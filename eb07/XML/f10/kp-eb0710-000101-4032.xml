                <p>IN treating of France, a subject in itself of great magnitude, but one which, in
                    a work like this, embracing the entire circle of human knowledge, can only be
                    delineated in outline, we shall endeavour to observe the same method which was
                    followed in treating of England, and to place before our readers condensed
                    abstracts of the History, Statistics, Government and Laws of that great country,
                    long remarkable for its high civilization, and now happily blessed with
                    political institutions in some measure adapted to the opinions and wants of its
                    people.</p>
                <p>I. HISTORY.</p>
                <p>About half a century before the commencement of our era, Gaul, then inhabited by
                    a race of Celtic origin and descent, was subdued by Caesar, and for the space of
                    nearly five centuries continued under the sway of the Romans. During the first
                    half of this period, which was in a great measure one of repose, the country
                    made considerable advances in improvement, and in fact received its full share
                    in that civilization with which Rome usually repaid the turbulent independence
                    destroyed by her conquests. Political union, internal tranquillity, and the
                    security resulting from the firm and impartial administration of an admirable
                    system of laws, were amongst the direct advantages which the people derived from
                    their subjugation; whilst, collaterally, agriculture was improved, commerce
                    extended, industry encouraged, wealth accumulated, and the general happiness
                    promoted. To the wild and pernicious liberty enjoyed by warlike savages had
                    succeeded the vigorous but wise government of an enlightened conqueror, whose
                    policy it was to efface the recollection of independence by positive benefits
                    conferred, and to secure to the people those substantial advantages without the
                    enjoyment of which liberty is no better than an empty name. Even the climate was
                    ameliorated in proportion as industry extended its dominion; and the soil,
                    rendered capable of producing and maturing the choicest fruits, amply repaid the
                    labour employed in its cultivation. The vine, the olive, and other useful
                    plants, were introduced by the Romans; and even Christianity itself was amongst
                    the boons which this people latterly conferred on the subject nations in return
                    for their political independence. But during the latter half of the period above
                    mentioned, when the ancient Roman valour and discipline had begun to decline,
                    and degeneracy of manners had sapped the foundations of Roman power, the
                    province of Gaul became exposed to the incursions, and was finally overwhelmed
                    by the settlement, of barbarian invaders.</p>
                <p>Of the natural boundaries of the Roman province of Gaul, the Rhine was by far the
                    most important, as forming the line of demarcation between the empire on the one
                    hand, and the multitudinous tribes of savage nations which swarmed beyond the
                    stream on the other. On one side were wealth and civilization; on the other,
                    want and barbarism. Principles the most irreconcilable, and inveterately
                    hostile, were only separated by the breadth of the river. But the genius of
                    barbarism, hanging on the outskirts of civilization, is essentially aggressive,
                    and continually seeking to destroy the monuments which the latter has reared. In
                    a word, the natural state between such neighbours is one of war. As long,
                    however, as the Roman legions preserved their ancient discipline and spirit, the
                    turbulence of the German tribes was repressed, and the barrier of the empire
                    maintained; one or two defeats, which imprudence or temerity had entailed, were
                    severely avenged; and the Roman generals, penetrating at different intervals
                    into the country of the barbarians, chastised their audacity, and taught them to
                    regard with salutary awe the power which they had dared to defy. But the
                    Germans, though little versed in policy, began in time to be sensible that their
                    frequent defeats were owing to their disunion; that whilst dispersed in
                    different tribes, without any solid or permanent bond of connection, they could
                    never hope to contend with success against the disciplined force of a great
                    empire, impelled by and obedient to one supreme directing mind. They now
                    perceived that their former leagues, hastily <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514045"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4045-0002"/>formed, were as easily dissolved; that something
                    more than a sort of wild, irregular co-operation was necessary; and that without
                    coherence and consistence, it would be vain to expect success in any offensive
                    enterprise. The consciousness of this defect produced in the third century those
                    extensive confederacies in which many tribes united permanently under one common
                    name, and frequently under one chief or sovereign, some assuming the appellation
                    of Alemanni, descriptive of the combination which had been formed, and others
                    taking that of Franks, indicative of the spirit or freedom in which they
                    rejoiced.</p>
                <p>The first mention made of the Franks by the historians of the empire is about the
                    middle of the third century. Of their origin various and discordant accounts
                    have been given; but the most probable supposition seems to be that, about the
                    time of the emperor Gordian, the people inhabiting the banks of the Lower Rhine
                    entered into a confederacy with those who dwelt on the Weser, and that the
                    tribes thus united assumed the name of Franks or Freemen. The chief seat of this
                    confederacy, therefore, appears to have been the marshy territory overflowed and
                    divided into islets by the Rhine, from the spot where the river begins to run in
                    a westerly direction, to its junction with the sea. Their first irruption took
                    place in the year 254, and the second in the reign of Valerian. On the latter
                    occasion they were but few in number, and were easily repulsed by Valerian, who
                    afterwards became emperor. Not discouraged by this check, however, they returned
                    in greater numbers about two years afterwards, and were again defeated by
                    Gallienus, whom Valerian had now chosen as his associate in the empire. But as
                    fresh swarms still continued to pour in from their native fastnesses, Gallienus,
                    being no longer in a condition to expel them by force of arms, adopted the
                    perilous expedient of negotiation, and, by means of advantageous offers, engaged
                    one of their chiefs to defend the frontier against his own countrymen as well as
                    against other invaders. Such an admission of weakness, however, could only have
                    the effect of provoking further aggression. In the year 260 the Franks, taking
                    advantage of the defeat and captivity of Valerian in Persia, broke into Gaul,
                    and afterwards into Italy, committing everywhere the most dreadful ravages; and
                    five years afterwards they invaded Spain, which they occupied, or rather
                    desolated, for the space of twelve years. But in the year 275 they were
                    completely overthrown and driven out of Gaul by the emperor Probus, who pursued
                    them into their own country, and there built several forts to keep them in awe.
                    Intimidated by this defeat, they remained quiet until 287, when, in conjunction
                    with Saxon pirates, they plundered the coasts of Gaul, and carried off from
                    thence an immense booty. To revenge this insult the emperor Maximian, the
                    following year, entered their country, which he laid waste with fire and sword,
                    at the same time compelling two of their chiefs to submit to his arms; whilst to
                    such of the common people as chose to remain in Gaul he allotted lands in the
                    neighbourhood of Treves and Cambray. The restless disposition of the Franks,
                    however, did not suffer them to remain long at peace; and about the year 293
                    they made themselves masters of Batavia and part of Flanders; but they were once
                    more entirely defeated, and compelled to surrender at discretion, by
                    Constantins, the father of Constantine the Great, <hi rend="superscript"> w</hi>
                    " <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> allotted them settlements in Gaul. In 306 their
                    countrymen in Germany renewed their depredations, though with little success;
                    for having been overtaken by Constantine, they were completely routed, and two
                    of their kings who fell into his hands were thrown to wild beasts during the
                    sports exhibited in honour of the victory. All these reverses, however, were
                    insufficient to prevent the incur-õľe <hi rend="superscript"> 8</hi> u this

                    cities in that province. But they were soon afterwards defeated by the emperor
                    Julian, who also drove the Alemanni within their ancient boundaries; and again
                    by Theodosius, father of the emperor of that name, who expelled the invaders,
                    and pursued them with great slaughter. They returned, however, in the year 388,
                    when they ravaged the province with greater fury than ever, cut off the Roman
                    army which was sent against them, and in some measure established themselves in
                    the country which they had so frequently overrun. In fact, the western empire
                    was now reduced to so low an ebb that the Franks, until their progress was
                    checked by Aetius, experienced more interruption from other barbarians roving in
                    quest of new settlements, than from the armies of Rome, which had so often
                    repulsed preceding invaders.</p>
                <p>The commencement of the fifth century was marked by an overwhelming irruption
                    into Gaul of the barbarian hosts, who, pouring in from different points, rolled
                    on like a sudden inundation, sweeping away every thing in their destructive
                    course. The church alone towered aloft above the general desolation; her
                    bulwarks were strong enough to resist the shock of that fierce torrent of
                    barbarism by which they were assailed; and had it not been for this
                    circumstance, all the records and traditions of the past must have perished
                    amidst the general ruin. But the progress of the invaders was nevertheless
                    destined to experience a vigorous check. When the contest with Aetius commenced,
                    the Franks were governed by Pharamond, the first of their kings or leaders of
                    whom any distinct account has been preserved. This chief or prince is supposed
                    to have reigned from the year 417 or 418 to 428, and is generally believed to
                    have been killed in the war with Aetius. He is understood to have compiled the
                    Salic laws, with the assistance of four sages named Ŵisegast, Losegast,
                    Widegast, and Solegast; but Valesius is of opinion that the Franks had no
                    written laws until the time of Clovis. Pharamond was succeeded by his son
                    Clodio, who is said to have received a terrible overthrow from Aetius near the
                    city of Lens. But notwithstanding this defeat he advanced to Cambray, of which
                    he made himself master, extended his conquests as far as the river Somme, and
                    destroyed the cities of Treves and Cologne, Tournay and Amiens. He died in the
                    year 448, and was succeeded by Merovaeus. It is uncertain whether the new king
                    was brother, or son, or in fact any relation at all, to Clodio; it seems
                    probable, indeed, that he was of a different family, as from him the first race
                    of French kings were styled Merovingian. He was honoured and respected by his
                    people, but did not greatly enlarge the boundaries of his kingdom. Merovaeus,
                    who died in 458, was succeeded by his son Childeric, who being no longer kept in
                    check by Aetius, made war upon the Romans, extended his conquests as far as the
                    river Loire, and took the city of Paris after a lengthened siege. Childeric was
                    succeeded by Clodovaeus, Clovis, or Louis; and as the Roman power in Italy had
                    now been totally destroyed, the latter set himself to make an entire conquest of
                    Gaul. Part of the province was still retained by a Roman named Syagrius, the son
                    of Aegidius, who, like his father, governed and was even said to have reigned at
                    Soissons, where the former had established himself on the downfall of the
                    western empire in 476. But Syagrius was defeated and taken prisoner by Clovis,
                    who afterwards caused him to be beheaded, and soon reduced his dominions under
                    subjection.</p>
                <p>The French monarchy was thus established in the year 487 by Clovis, who possessed
                    all the country situated between the Rhine and the Loire. The secret of the rise
                    of this conqueror, originally the chief or king of a small colony of Franks
                    established at Tournay, may be easily explained. Of all the nations which
                    overran Gaul, that which eventually subdued all the others, and gave its name
                    both to the country and the people, was the most disunited and the least
                    advanced in the arts of life. The Goths and the Burgundians were much more
                    civilized than the Franks; for, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514058"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4058-0003"/>whilst the former constituted each a separate
                    nation and race, which obeyed one monarch or family of monarchs, the latter
                    consisted of different tribes united in a species of temporary confederacy, the
                    ties of which became more and more relaxed in proportion as they advanced from
                    the lthine. Each town or territory had its petty independent sovereign; and,
                    anterior to the time of Clovis, they do not appear to have had any supreme chief
                    or a general capital. Whether this was or was not an advantage, we do not
                    pretend to determine. But it obviously leit them in a great measure free to
                    engage in any enterprise in which they chose to embark; and it also laid open
                    the chieftaincy to the ambition of the first leader distinguished for boldness
                    and preeminent talents; whilst, on the other hand, the vague comprehensiveness
                    of their name was calculated to congregate under their banner such roving bands
                    as might be in search of either plunder or establishments. The principle of
                    their confederacy was such that any tribe or race might easily be admitted
                    within its pale. Of this Clovis skilfully took advantage, and, by availing
                    himself of its elasticity (if we may be allowed the expression), became the
                    founder of the French monarchy.</p>
                <p>Clovis had been educated in paganism, and continued to profess it until the
                    thirtieth year of his age; but notwithstanding this circumstance, he allowed his
                    subjects full liberty of conscience. When he married Clotilda, daughter of the
                    Duke of Burgundy, this princess, who was a zealous Christian, used all her
                    influence to persuade him to embrace her religion. For some time, however, he
                    continued to waver between Christianity and paganism; but having gained a battle
                    against the Germans near Cologne, where, when in great danger, he had invoked
                    the God of Clotilda and the Christians, he afterwards lent a favourable ear to
                    the discourses of Remigius bishop of Rheims, and having declared himself a
                    convert, was baptized in the year 496. But his acknowledgment of the truths of
                    Christianity was not followed by any amendment of life; on the contrary, he
                    employed the remainder of his life in aggrandizing himself, and extending his
                    dominions, by means of treachery, fraud, and violence. In his attacks on
                    Armorica or Bretagne, however, he proved unsuccessful. The inhabitants of this
                    country, which comprehended the maritime part of ancient Gaul, had united for
                    their common defence, and, though abandoned by the Romans, made a vigorous
                    resistance against the barbarians, who assaulted them on all sides. Clovis,
                    finding them too powerful to be subdued by force, proposed an union with his
                    people, which they readily accepted, chiefly on account of his professing
                    Christianity. Thus the new religion of Clovis proved subservient to the purposes
                    of his ambition, and his power became gradually formidable. At this time the
                    Burgundians, under Gondebaud, the uncle of Clotilda, possessed all the country
                    from the forest of Vosges to the sea at Marseilles; and their chief, to secure
                    his own authority, had put to death two of his brothers, one of whom was the
                    father of the French queen. But the third brother, Godagesil, whom he had spared
                    and allowed to possess the principality of Geneva, conspired with Clovis to
                    expel Gondebaud from his dominions. A war accordingly commenced between the
                    French and Burgundian monarchs, and the latter being deserted in battle by the
                    faithless Godagesil, was obliged to fly to Avignon, leaving his antagonist
                    undisputed master of the cities of Lyons and Vienne. The conqueror next laid
                    siege to Avignon; but the place was defended with such vigour, that Clovis
                    thought proper to accept of a large sum of money and an annual tribute from
                    Gondebaud, who was likewise obliged to cede to Godagesil the city of Vienne, and
                    several other places taken during the war. Gondebaud, however, no sooner found
                    himself at liberty from his enemies, than he assembled a powerful army, with
                    which he advanced towards Vienne, where Godagesil then resided. The place was
                    garrisoned by five thousand Franks, and might have made considerable resistance;
                    but Gondebaud being admitted into the city through an aqueduct, massacred most
                    of the Franks, sent the rest as prisoners to the king of the Visigoths, and put
                    Godagesil to death. This was speedily followed by the submission of all the
                    other places which had owned the authority of Godagesil; and Gondebaud
                    considering himself in a condition to resist the power of Clovis, intimated his
                    determination to withhold the promised tribute; a defection which Clovis, though
                    exceedingly mortified, found himself obliged for the present to overlook.</p>
                <p>The next expedition undertaken by Clovis was directed against the Visigoths, who
                    possessed considerable territories on both sides of the Pyrenean mountains. Ĳis
                    motives for this enterprise were expressed in a speech which he delivered to his
                    nobility when assembled in the city of Paris, which he considered as the capital
                    of his dominions. “It is with concern,” said the monarch, “that I suffer the
                    Arians to possess the most fertile part of Gaul; let us, with the aid of God,
                    march against them, and, having conquered them, annex their kingdom to our
                    dominions.” The nobility approved of the scheme; and Clovis marched against a
                    prince for whom he had lately professed the greatest regard, vowing to erect a
                    church in honour of the holy apostles if he succeeded in his unrighteous
                    enterprise. Alaric the king of the Visigoths, though personally brave, was
                    destitute of military experience, and therefore hesitated not to engage with his
                    antagonist; but, unable to contend with the veteran troops of Clovis, his army
                    was utterly defeated on the banks of the Clain, near Poictiers, in the year 507,
                    and Alaric himself slain. After this victory the province of Aquitaine
                    submitted; Toulouse soon afterwards surrendered, and the royal treasures of the
                    Visigoths were transported to Paris. Angoulême was next reduced, and the city of
                    Arles invested. But here the victorious career of Clovis was stopped by
                    Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths, who had overturned the dominion of Odoacer in
                    Italy. He had married the sister of Clovis, but having also given his own
                    daughter in marriage to the king of the Visigoths, he had endeavoured, as far as
                    possible, to preserve a good understanding between the two sovereigns. This,
                    however, he found to be impossible; and, convinced that no bounds could be set
                    to the ambition of Clovis by peaceful means, he sent against him one of his
                    generals with a powerful army, by which the French monarch was defeated with the
                    loss of thirty thousand men. This discomfiture obliged Clovis to raise the siege
                    of Arles; but the Franks still retained the greater part of their conquests, and
                    the province of Aquitaine was indissolubly annexed to their empire. In 508
                    Clovis received the title of Roman consul, and was thus supposed to be invested
                    with a just title to all his conquests, in whatsoever manner they had been
                    acquired. He was solemnly invested with the new dignity in the church of St
                    Martin, in the city of Tours. Clovis now proceeded to confirm his power by the
                    murder of his kinsmen the princes of the Merovingian race. Amongst those who
                    perished in virtue of this bloody policy were Sigebert king of Cologne, with his
                    son Cloderic; Cararic, another prince whose do-ņiinions have not been accurately
                    pointed out by historians; Ranacaire, who governed the diocese of Cambray , and
                    Renomer, king of the territory of Maine. All these murders, however, were
                    supposed to be expiated by the zeal which he expressed in behalf of
                    Christianity, and his liberality towards the church. Clovis died in the year
                    511, after having reformed and published the Salic laws; a few lines of which,
                    excluding women from inheriting any part of the Salic lands, have been extended
                    so far as to deprive the females of the royal family of France of their right of
                    succession to the throne of that kingdom.</p>
                <p>Clovis has been compared to Constantine, and they had <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193514071" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4071-0004"/>certainly this in common,
                    that each embraced Christianity in circumstances nearly similar, and from
                    motives much more closely allied to self-interest than conviction. In both
                    cases, too, the change of religion, instead of tempering their passions, or
                    exercising a benign influence over their conduct, appears rather to have
                    exasperated their natural ferocity and blood-thirstiness. The domestic murders
                    committed by Constantine find their parallel in the assassinations perpetrated
                    by Clovis, who equalled the Roman emperor in cruelty, and perhaps surpassed him
                    in perfidy. In the abuse of the doctrines of confession and absolution each
                    found an opiate to lull the remonstrances of conscience; and as the church
                    encouraged errors calculated to augment its wealth and extend its power, the
                    natural obstacles to the commission of crime were thus removed, and eventual
                    impunity secured to the greatest offender, provided his means bore any
                    proportion to his criminality. The founder of the French monarchy, therefore, is
                    to be regarded rather as a daring and fortunate ruffian than as a great
                    conqueror or an able leader; one who reaped the fruits of the crimes he had
                    committed, and around whom success had thrown that false glare which so much
                    misleads the moral judgments of men.</p>
                <p>The dominions of Clovis were divided amongst his four sons. Thierri, or
                    Theodoric, the eldest, received the eastern part of the empire, and as he made
                    the city of Metz his capital, he is commonly styled the king of Metz; Clodomir,
                    the eldest son by Clotilda, obtained the kingdom of Orleans; whilst to
                    Childebert and Clotaire, both infants, were allotted the kingdoms of Paris and
                    Soissons, under the tutelage of their mother. During eight years the prudence of
                    Clotilda maintained tranquillity in all parts of the empire; but about the year
                    520 a numerous fleet of Danes arrived at the mouth of the Meuse, and their king
                    Cochi-hac having landed his forces, began to desolate the country with fire and
                    sword. Against the invaders Thierri sent his son Theodobert, who defeated the
                    Danish army, killed their king, and forced the remainder to retire with
                    precipitation. In 522 Hermanfroi, king of Thuringia, having put to death one of
                    his brothers named Berthaire, and seized on his dominions, applied to Thierri
                    for assistance against his other brother Balderic, whom he intended to dispose
                    of in the same manner. Thierri assented, and embarked in this creditable
                    enterprise, upon condition that he should have one half of Balderic’s dominions;
                    but after the unhappy prince had been overcome and killed in battle, Hermanfroi,
                    forgetting or despising the compact, seized upon all his dominions. Thierri had
                    no opportunity of revenging himself till the year 531, when, perceiving that the
                    power of the Ostrogoths, whom he greatly dreaded, had been considerably lessened
                    by the death of king Theodoric, he engaged his brother Clotaire to assist him.
                    They accordingly entered Thuringia with two powerfill armies, which formed a
                    junction as soon as they had passed the Rhine, and were soon afterwards
                    reinforced by a considerable body of troops under the command of Theodobert. The
                    army of Hermanfroi was advantageously posted; but being attacked by a superior
                    force, it was totally defeated, and Hermanfroi himself forced to fly from place
                    to place in disguise.. His capital was soon afterwards taken, and Hermanfroi
                    himself being invited to a conference by Thierri, was treacherously murdered;
                    after which his extensive dominions became feudatory to the murderer. In the
                    mean time Clotilda had excited her children to make war on the Burgundians, in
                    order to avenge the death of her father Chilperic, whom Gondebaud, king of
                    Burgundy, had caused to be murdered. Gondebaud, who was now dead, had left his
                    dominions to his sons Sigismund and Godemar. The former was speedily defeated,
                    and soon afterwards delivered up to Clodomir, who caused him to be thrown into a
                    pit, where he perished miserably. Clodomir now marched against Godemar, who, by
                    the death of his brother, had become sole master of Burgundy, and completely
                    defeated him also; but having pursued his victory too eagerly, he was surrounded
                    by his enemies and slain. After the reduction of Thuringia, however, Childebert
                    and Clotaire entered the kingdom of Burgundy at the head of a powerful army, and
                    in 534 completed the conquest of that country.</p>
                <p>In 560 Clotaire having murdered the sons of Clodomir, who had been killed in
                    Burgundy as already related, and Thierri and his children, as also Childebert,
                    being now dead, became sole heir to the dominions of Clovis. He had five sons,
                    the eldest of whom, named Chramnes, had some time previously rebelled against
                    his father in Auvergne. As long as Childebert lived he had supported the young
                    prince; but on his death Chramnes was obliged to implore the clemency of his
                    father, by whom he was pardoned. But he soon began to cabal afresh, and engaged
                    the Count of Bretagne to assist him in another rebellion. The Bretons, however,
                    were defeated, and Chramnes resolved to make his escape; but perceiving that his
                    wife and children were surrounded by his father’s troops, he made an effort to
                    rescue them. In this attempt, however, he failed, and being taken prisoner, he
                    was with his family thrust into a thatched cottage near the field of battle,
                    which the king commanded to be set on fire, and all that were in it perished in
                    the flames.</p>
                <p>Clotaire did not long survive this barbarous execution, but died in 562, and
                    after his death the French empire was divided amongst his four remaining sons,
                    Caribert, Gontran, Sigebert, and Chilperic. Caribert, the eldest, received the
                    kingdom of Paris; Gontran, the second, obtained Orleans; Sigebert got Metz, or
                    Austrasia; and Chilperic had Soissons; whilst Provence and Aquitaine were
                    possessed by all of them in common. The peace of the empire was first disturbed
                    in 563 by an invasion of the Abares, a barbarous nation, believed to have been
                    the remains of the Huns. They entered Thuringia, which belonged to the dominions
                    of Sigebert, but were totally defeated, and obliged to repass the Elbe. Sigebert
                    pursued them closely, but on hearing that his brother Chilperic had invaded his
                    dominions, and taken Rheims, with some other places in the neighbourhood, he
                    concluded a peace with the vanquished barbarians. Sigebert then marched with his
                    victorious army against Chilperic, made himself master of Soissons, and seized
                    his eldest son Theodobert. He then defeated Chilperic in battle, recovered the
                    places which he had seized, and conquered the greater part of his dominions;
                    but, on the mediation of the other two brothers, Sigebert abandoned all his
                    conquests, set Theodobert at liberty, and thus restored peace to the empire.</p>
                <p>Soon after this event Sigebert married Burnehaut, daughter to Athanagilde, king
                    of the Visigoths in Spain; and Caribert, king of Paris, having died, his
                    dominions were divided amongst his three brothers. In 567 Chilperic married
                    Galswintha, Brunehaut’s eldest sister, and before her arrival dismissed his
                    mistress, Fredegonde, a woman of great ability and firmness of mind, but
                    ambitious, and capable of committing the darkest crimes to gratify her ambition.
                    The queen, who had brought with her immense treasures from Spain, and who made
                    it her sole study to please the king, was for some time entirely acceptable to
                    him. But by degrees Chilperic suffered Fredegonde to re-appear at court, and was
                    even suspected of having renewed his intercourse with this profligate woman; a
                    circumstance which gave such offence to the queen, that she desired permission
                    to return to her own country, at the same time promising to leave behind her all
                    the wealth she had brought. Aware that this would render him extremely odious,
                    the king found means to dissipate his wife’s suspicions, and soon afterwards
                    caused her to be privately strangled, upon which he publicly married the harlot
                    Fredegonde. Such an atrocious action could <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514084"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4084-0005"/>not fail to excite the greatest indignation
                    against Chilperic. His dominions were immediately invaded by Sigebert and
                    Gontran, who conquered the greater part of them; but having effected this, they
                    suddenly made peace, on Chilperic consenting that Brunehaut should enjoy those
                    places “hich he had bestowed upon Galswintha, namely, Bordeaux, Limoges, Cahors,
                    Bigorre, and the town of Bearn. The French princes, however, did not long
                    continue at peace among themselves; and a war having ensued, Gontran and
                    Chilperic made common cause against Sigebert. But the latter prevailed, and,
                    having forced Gontran to conclude a separate peace, seemed determined to make
                    Chilperic pay dear for his perfidy, when he -was assassinated by a contrivance
                    of Fredegonde, who thus saved herself and Chilperic from the most imminent
                    danger. Immediately on his death Bmnehaut fell into the hands of Chilperic; but
                    Gondebaud, one of Sigebert’s best generals, having made his escape into
                    Austrasia with Childebert, the only son of Sigebert, an infant of about five
                    years of age, the latter was immediately proclaimed king. In a short time,
                    however, Merovaeus, eldest son to Chilperic, fell in love with Bitinehaut, and
                    married her without acquainting his father. On receiving information of this,
                    Chilperic went to Rouen, where Merovaeus and his consort were living; and having
                    seized them, sent Brunehaut and her two daughters to Metz, and carried Merovaeus
                    to Soissons. Soon afterwards one of his generals being defeated by Gontran, who
                    had espoused Brunehaut’s cause, Chilperic in a fit of rage caused Merovaeus to
                    be shaved and confined in a monastery <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>. From this
                    he found means to make his escape, and arrived in Austrasia, where Brunehaut
                    would gladly have protected him; but the jealousy of the nobles proved so strong
                    that he was forced to leave that country; and being betrayed into the hands of
                    his father’s forces, he was murdered at the instigation of Fredegonde.</p>
                <p>The French empire was at this time divided between Gontran king of Orleans,
                    called also king of Burgundy, Chilperic king of Soissons, and Childebert king of
                    Austrasia. But Chilperic found his affairs in a very disagreeable situation. In
                    579, having a dispute with Varoc count of Bretagne, who refused to do him
                    homage, he dispatched against his vassal a body of troops, who were defeated,
                    and he was in consequence forced to submit to a disadvantageous peace. Meanwhile
                    his brother and nephew, whom he had reason to dread, lived in the strictest
                    union; his subjects, oppressed with heavy taxes, were poor and discontented;
                    Clovis, his son by a former queen named Andovera, hated Fredegonde, and made no
                    secret of his aversion; and, to add to his embarrassment, the seasons were for a
                    long time so unfavourable that the country was threatened with famine and
                    pestilence. The king and queen were both attacked by an q&gt;idemic which then
                    raged; and though they recovered, their three sons Clodobert, Samson, and
                    Dagobert, all died. After this, the sight of Clovis became so hateful to
                    Fredegonde that she caused him to be murdered, as she likewise did his mother
                    Andovera, lest Chilperic’s affection for that lady should return after the
                    tragical death of her son. In 583 Chilperic himself was murdered by some unknown
                    assassins, when his dominions were on the point of being conquered by Gontran
                    and Childebert. After his death Fredegonde implored the protection of Gontran,
                    which he readily granted, and obliged Childebert to put an end to the war.
                    Contran died on the 28th of Marell 593, having lived upwards of Mxty years, and
                    reigned thirty-two; and Childebert succeeded to the kingdom without opposition,
                    but did not long enjoy it. His dominions were on his death divided between his
                    two sons Theodobert and Thierri; the former being declared king of Austrasia,
                    and the latter king of Burgundy. But as Theodobert was only in his eleventh, and
                    Thιem m his tenth year, Brunehaut governed both kingdoms with absolute sway.
                    Fredegonde, however, avail ing herself of the opportunity offered by the death
                    of Childebert, made herself mistress of Paris and some other places on the
                    Seine; upon which Brunehaut sent against her the best part of the forces in
                    Austrasia. The latter, however, were totally defeated; but Fredegonde died
                    before she had time to improve her victory, leaving her son Clotaire heir to her
                    dominions.</p>
                <p>For some time Brunehaut preserved her kingdom in peace; but her own ambition in
                    the end proved her ruin. Instead of instructing Theodobert in what was necessary
                    for a prince to know, she took care to keep him in ignorance, and even suffered
                    him to marry a young and handsome slave of his father’s. But the new queen being
                    possessed of ability and good nature, so gained the affection of her husband
                    that he consented to the banishment of Brunehaut. Upon this disgrace she in 599
                    fled to Thierri king of Burgundy, by whom she was kindly received; and, instead
                    of exciting jealousies or misunderstandings between the two brothers, she
                    engaged Thierri to attempt the recovery of Paris and the other places which had
                    been wrested from their family by Fredegonde. This measure was so acceptable to
                    Thcodobcrt, that he likewise raised a numerous army, and in conjunction with his
                    brother invaded Clotaire’s dominions. A battle ensued, in which the forces of
                    Clotaire were completely defeated, and he himself obliged to sue for peace,
                    which was not granted except on condition of his yielding up the best part of
                    his dominions. This treaty was concluded in the year 600; but three years
                    afterwards it was broken by Clotaire, who was again attacked by the two
                    brothers. The war was carried on with great vigour until the next spring, when
                    Thierri having forced Landri, Clotaire’s general, to accept battle, overthrew
                    him, and put to death the king’s infant son Merovaeus, whom he had sent with
                    Landri. After this victory, Thierri, intent on the destruction of his cousin,
                    marched directly to Paris. But Theodobert no sooner heard of the victory gained
                    by Thierri, than, becoming jealous of his success, he offered Clotaire such
                    conditions as speedily compelled Thierri also to listen to terms of
                    accommodation. This conduct of Theodobert greatly provoked his brother; and his
                    resentment was still more inflamed by Brunehaut, who never forgot the disgrace
                    of having been banished from his court. A war was therefore commenced in 605;
                    but being disapproved of by the nobility, Thierri found himself obliged to put
                    an end to it. The tranquillity which ensued, however, was again disturbed in
                    607, when Theodobert sent an embassy to demand part of Childebert’s dominions,
                    which by the will of that monarch had been added to those of Burgundy. But the
                    nobility of both kingdoms were exceedingly averse to war, and constrained their
                    kings to consent to a conference, attended by an equal number of troops. By a
                    scandalous breach of faith, however, Theodobert brought double the number agreed
                    on, and compelled his brother to submit to whatever terms he pleased to dictate.
                    This act of treachery instantly brought on a war. Thierri was bent on revenge,
                    and his nobility no longer opposed him. Having secured the neutrality of
                    Clotaire by a promise of restoring those parts of his dominions of which he had
                    formerly been despoiled, Thierri entered Theodobert’s territories, defeated him
                    in two battles, took him prisoner, and treated him with the greatest indignity.
                    Meanwhile Clotaire, thinking that the best method of making Thierri keep his
                    word was to seize upon those places which the latter had promised to restore to
                    him as the price of his neutrality, did so accordingly; upon which Thicrri sent
                    to him a messenger to require him to withdraw his forces, and in the event of a
                    refusal, to declare war. Clotaire was prepared for such a proceeding, and
                    immediately assembled his forces. But before Thierri could reach his enemies, he
                    was seized with a dysentery, of which he died, in the year 612.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514097" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4097-0006"/>
                <p>On the death of Thierri, Bnmehaut immediately caused his eldest son Sigisbert,
                    then in the tenth year of his age, to be proclaimed king. It is probable that
                    she intended to govern in his name with an absolute sway; but Clotaire did not
                    allow her time to discover her intentions. Knowing that the nobility both in
                    Burgundy and Metz were disaffected to Brunehaut, he declared war against her;
                    and the unfortunate queen having been betrayed by her generals, fell into the
                    hands of her enemies. Clotaire gave her up to the nobles, who generally hated
                    her, and treated their captive in the most barbarous manner; for, after having
                    led her about the camp, exposed to the insults of all who had the meanness to
                    insult her, she was tied by the leg and arm to the tail of an untamed horse,
                    which, setting off at full speed, quickly dashed out her brains. Thus, in the
                    year 613, Clotaire became sole monarch of France, and quietly enjoyed his
                    kingdom till his death, which happened in 628.</p>
                <p>This prince was succeeded by Dagobert, who proved a great and powerful sovereign,
                    and raised the kingdom of France to a high degree of splendour. Dagobert was
                    succeeded by his sons Sigebert and Clovis; the former of whom obtained the
                    kingdom of Austrasia, and the latter that of Burgundy. Both the kings were
                    minors at the time of their accession to the throne, which gave an opportunity
                    to the mayors of the palace, the highest officers under the crown, to usurp the
                    whole authority of the state. Sigebert died in 640, after a short reign of one
                    year, leaving behind him an infant son named Dagobert, whom he strongly
                    recommended to the care of Grimoalde, his mayor of the palace. The minister
                    caused Dagobert to be immediately proclaimed king, but did not long suffer him
                    to enjoy that honour. He had not the cruelty, however, to put him to death, but
                    sent him to a monastery in one of the western islands of Scotland; and then,
                    giving out that he was dead, advanced his own son Childebert to the throne.
                    Childebert was expelled by Clovis king of Burgundy, who placed on the throne
                    Childeric, the second son of Sigebert. Clovis died soon after the revolution,
                    and was succeeded in his dominions by his son Clotaire, who also died in a short
                    time without issue. He was succeeded by his brother Childeric, who, after a
                    brief reign, was murdered, with his queen, at that time big with child, and an
                    infant son named Dagobert, though another, named Daniel, had the good fortune to
                    escape.</p>
                <p>The affairs of the French were now in the most deplorable situation. The princes
                    of the Merovingian race had been for some time entirely deprived of their power
                    by their officers called mayors of the palace. In Austrasia the administration
                    had been totally engrossed by Pepin and his son Grimaulde, whilst Archambaud and
                    Ebroin followed the same course in Neustria and Burgundy. On the reunion of
                    Neustria and Burgundy with the rest of the French dominions, this minister ruled
                    with such despotic sway that the nobility of Austrasia, provoked to a revolt,
                    elected as their dukes two chiefs named Martin and Pepin. The forces of the
                    confederates, however, were defeated by Ebroin; and Martin having surrendered
                    upon a promise of safety, was treacherously put to death. Pepin lost no time in
                    recruiting his shattered forces; but before he had an opportunity of trying his
                    fortune a second time in battle, the assassination of Ebroin delivered him from
                    all apprehensions in that quarter. Pepin now carried every tiling before him;
                    overthrew the royal army under the command of the new minister Bertaire; and
                    having obtained possession of the capital, caused himself to be declared mayor
                    of the palace, in which station he continued to govern with absolute sway during
                    the remainder of his life. Pepin, who had obtained’ the surname of Heristal,
                    from his palace on the Meuse, died in the year 714, having enjoyed unlimited
                    power for twenty-six years; and appointed his grandson</p>
                <p>Theudobalde, then only six years of age, to succeed him in his post of mayor of
                    the palace. This happened during the reign of Dagobert already mentioned; but as
                    the latter had too much spirit to suffer himself to be deprived of his authority
                    by an infant, the adherents of the young mayor were defeated in battle; and this
                    discomfiture was soon followed by his death.</p>
                <p>But Charles, the illegitimate son of Pepin, was now raised to the dignity of duke
                    by the Austrasians; and by his great qualities he seemed in every respect worthy
                    of this honour. The murder of Dagobert freed him from a powerful opponent; and
                    the young king Chilperic, who after Dagobert’s death had been brought from a
                    cloister to the throne, was not qualified to cope with so experienced an
                    antagonist. On the 19th of March 717, Charles had the good fortune to surprise
                    the royal camp as he passed through the forest of Ardennes; and soon afterwards
                    a battle ensued, in which the king’s forces were entirely defeated. Upon this
                    Chilperic entered into an alliance with Eudes duke of Aquitaine, whose
                    friendship he purchased by the final cession of all the ∞untry which Eudes had
                    seized for himself. Charles, however, having placed on the throne another of the
                    royal family, named Clotaire, advanced against Chilperic and his associate, whom
                    he entirely defeated near Soissons. After this disaster Eudes, despairing of
                    success, delivered up Chilperic into the hands of his antagonist; having
                    stipulated for himself the same terms which had been formerly granted him by the
                    captive monarch. Charles being now advanced to the summit of power, treated
                    Chilperic with the greatest respect, and on the death of Clotaire caused him to
                    be proclaimed king of Austrasia; but by this proceeding his own power was in no
                    degree diminished, and henceforth the authority of the kings of France became
                    merely nominal; indeed so inactive and indolent were they accounted, that
                    historians have bestowed upon them the epithet of <hi rend="italic">rois
                    fainéant,</hi> indolent or lazy kings. Charles, however, had still one
                    competitor to contend with. This was Rainfroy, who had been appointed mayor of
                    the palace, and who made so vigorous a resistance, that Charles was obliged to
                    allow him to retain peaceable possession of the country of Anjou. But no sooner
                    had he thus set himself at liberty from domestic enemies, than he was threatened
                    with destruction by foreign invaders. The Suevians, Frisians, and Alemanni, were
                    successively encountered and defeated; Eudes also, who had perfidiously violated
                    the treaties by which he had bound himself, was twice repulsed; after which
                    Charles invaded Aquitaine, and obliged the treacherous duke to hearken to
                    reason. This however had scarcely been accomplished when he found himself
                    engaged with a more formidable enemy than any he had yet encountered. The
                    Saracens having overrun the greater part of Asia, now turned their victorious
                    arms westward, and threatened Europe with total subjugation. Spain had already
                    received their yoke; and having crossed the Pyrenees, they next invaded France,
                    appearing in vast numbers under the walls of Toulouse. Here they were
                    encountered and defeated by Eudes; but this proved only a partial check. The
                    barbarians having once more passed the Pyrenees, entered France with a powerful
                    army, which Eudes was no longer able to resist. He encountered them indeed with
                    his accustomed valour; but being obliged to yield to superior force, he
                    solicited the protection and assistance of Charles. Upon this occasion the
                    latter, on account of his valour and personal strength, acquired the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Martel,</hi> or the Hammer, in allusion to the violence of the
                    strokes which he bestowed on his enemies. Three hundred and seventy-five
                    thousand Infidels, amongst whom was their commander Abderrahman himself, are
                    said to have perished in a single battle fought near Poictiers. But
                    notwithstanding this slaughter, they soon made another irruption, though with no
                    better success, being again defeated by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490715&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=27" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0027-0007"
                    />Charles, who by so many victories established his power on the most solid
                    foundation. Having also defeated the Frisians, and with his own hand killed
                    their duke, he assumed the sovereignty of the dominions of Eudes. At length his
                    fame became so great that he was chosen by Gregory III. as his protector. The
                    latter also offered to shake off the yoke of the Greek emperor, and to invest
                    Charles with the dignity of Roman consul, sending him at the same time the keys
                    of the tomb of St Peter; but whilst this negotiation was going on successfully,
                    the pope, the emperor, and Charles Martel himself, all died.</p>
                <p>After the death of Martel, which happened in the year 741, his dominions were
                    divided among his three sons, <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> Carloman, Pepin,
                    and Grippon, according to dispositions which he had made in his ufetime.
                    Carloman, the eldest, received Austrasia; Pepin, the second, obtained Neustria
                    and Burgundy; but Grippon, the third, had only some lands assigned him in
                    France. This inequality displeased him so much that the tranquillity of the
                    empire was soon disturbed. With the assistance of his mother Sonnechilde he
                    seized upon the city of Lahon, where he sustained a siege; but in the end he was
                    obliged to submit; when Sonnechilde was put into a monastery, and Grippon
                    imprisoned in a castle at Ardennes. The two brothers, having thus freed
                    themselves from their domestic enemy, continued to govern the empire with
                    uninterrupted harmony, until its tranquillity was disturbed by the intrigues of
                    Sonnechilde. That enterprising and ambitious woman having negotiated a marriage
                    between Odilon duke of Bavaria, and Hiltrude the sister of the two princes,
                    instigated Odilon, who, alarmed at the growing power of the two princes, entered
                    into an alliance with Theodobald duke of the Alemanni, and Theodoric duke of the
                    Saxons. Having assembled a formidable army, he advanced directly against the
                    princes, and took post in an advantageous manner, with the Lech in front. But
                    Carloman and Pepin having passed the river at different fords in the night time,
                    attacked the camp of the allies, and entirely routed the Bavarians and Saxons,
                    and compelled the vanquished dukes to submit to the clemency of the victors.
                    During their absence on this expedition Hunalde duke of Aquitaine passed the
                    Loire, ravaged the open country, and burned the magnificent cathedral of
                    Chartres. But the invader was speedily obliged to retreat, and afterwards to
                    withdraw into a convent, after resigning his dominions to his son. This was soon
                    followed by the resignation of Carloman, who, notwithstanding his uninterrupted
                    success, suddenly took the resolution of retiring into a convent, and persisted
                    in his design, in spite of the entreaties of Pepin, who ostensibly did all he
                    could to dissuade him.</p>
                <p>By the resignation of Carloman, which happened in the year 746, Pepin became sole
                    master of France; and in this exalted station he acquitted himself in such a
                    manner as to render his name deservedly illustrious. One of his first acts was
                    to release from prison his brother Grippon. That treacherous prince, however,
                    had no sooner regained his liberty than he again excited the Saxons to take up
                    arms. But his enterprise proved unsuccessful. The Saxons were defeated, their
                    duke was taken prisoner, and his subjects “ere obliged to submit to the will of
                    the conqueror. Grippon then fled to Hiltrude, whom, in requital of a favourable
                    reception, he betrayed, and afterwards assumed the title of Duke of Bavaria; but
                    being driven by Pepin from the throne he had usurped, he was obliged to implore
                    his clemency, which was once more granted. Pepin having thus subdued all his
                    enemies within and without, resolved to assume the title of king, after having
                    so long exercised the regal power. His wishes in this respect were quite
                    agreeable to those of the nation in general; but the nobility were bound by an
                    oath of allegiance to Childeric the nominal monarch, and this oath could not be
                    dispensed with except by the authority of the pope. A dispensation was therefore
                    procured; the unfortunate Childeric, degraded from his dignity, was sent to a
                    monastery; Pepin assumed the title of King of France, and the line of Clovis was
                    finally set aside.</p>
                <p>This revolution took place in the year 751. The first claim on the attention of
                    the new monarch was a revolt of the Saxons; but they were soon reduced to
                    subjection, and obliged to pay an additional tribute. In the mean time Pepin
                    continued to advance his fortune. The submission of the Saxons was soon followed
                    by the reduction of Bretagne, and the recovery of Narbonne from the Infidels.
                    His next exploit was the protection of Pope Stephen III. against the king of the
                    Lombards, who had seized on the exarchate of Ravenna, and insisted on being
                    acknowledged king of Rome. The pope, unable to contend with so powerful a rival,
                    hastened to cross the Alps and implore the protection of Pepin, who received him
                    with all the respect due to his character, and attended him in person during a
                    dangerous sickness with which he was seized. On his recovery Stephen solemnly
                    placed the diadem on the head of his benefactor, bestowed the regal unction on
                    his sons Charles and Carloman, and conferred on the three princes the title of
                    patricians of Rome. In return for these honours, Pepin accompanied the pontiff
                    into Italy at the head of a powerful army, and obliged Astolphus to renounce all
                    pretensions to the sovereignty of Rome, as well as to restore the city and
                    exarchate of Ravenna, and to pay an annual tribute. Pepin returned to France in
                    triumph; but the peace of his dominions was soon disturbed by another revolt of
                    the Saxons. Their attempt, however, proved unsuccessful; and they were obliged
                    to submit and purchase their pardon by a renewal of their tribute, and an
                    additional supply of three hundred horse. But whilst the king was absent on this
                    expedition, Vaisar duke of Aquitaine ravaged Burgundy, carrying his devastations
                    as far as Chalons. Pepin returned, and entering the dominions of Vaisar,
                    committed similar devastations, and would have reduced the whole of Aquitaine,
                    had he not been interrupted by the hostile preparations of the Duke of Bavaria.
                    This, however, was ultimately effected, and the duchy of Aquitaine once more
                    annexed to the crown of France. But Pepin had scarcely time to indulge himself
                    with a view of his new conquest when he was seized with a slow fever, which in
                    768 put an end to his life, in the fifty-fourth year of his age and seventeenth
                    of his reign. Being of short stature, he had the surname of <hi rend="italic">Le
                    Bref;</hi> but his great actions justly entitled him to the character of a hero.
                    Under the succeeding reign, however, his own fame seemed to have been entirely
                    forgotten; and on his tomb was only inscribed, “Here lies the father of
                    Charlemagne.” Pepin was succeeded by his sons Charles and Carloman, to whom he
                    bequeathed his dominions, and who continued to reign jointly for some time; but
                    the active and enterprising spirit of Charles gave such umbrage to the weak and
                    jealous Carloman, that he regarded him with envy, and was on the point of coming
                    to an open rupture with him, when he himself was removed by death, and thus the
                    tranquillity of the empire was preserved.</p>
                <p>The death of Carloman, which happened in the year 771, left Charles sole master
                    of France; but the revolt of the Saxons involved him in a series of wars, from
                    which it required thirty-three years to extricate himself. The latter had long
                    been tributaries to the French, but frequently revolted; and now, when freed
                    from the terror of Pepin’s arms, they thought they had a right to shake off the
                    yoke altogether. Charles entered their country with a powerful army; and having
                    defeated them in a number of small engagements, advanced towards Eresburg, near
                    Paderborn, where was the image of their god Irminsul, represented as a man
                    completely armed, and standing on a column. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490715&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=28" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0028-0008"
                    />Saxons made an obstinate defence, but were at last obliged to submit; and
                    Charles employed his army three days in demolishing the monuments of idolatry in
                    this place. But the news which Charles now received from Italy induced him to
                    relax a little the severity with which he was otherwise disposed to treat the
                    Saxons. He had concluded a marriage with the daughter of Didier king of the
                    Lombards, but this had been dissolved by the pope; and as the Lombard monarchs
                    appear to have had a kind of natural antipathy to the popes, this feeling now
                    broke out with uncommon fury. Didier having seized on and terrified to death
                    Pope Stephen IV. used his utmost endeavours to reduce his successor Adrian I. to
                    a state of entire dependence. The pontiff applied to the French monarch, who was
                    inclined to grant the necessary assistance; but as the nobility were averse to
                    an Italian war, he was obliged to act with circumspection. Several embassies
                    were therefore sent to Didier, entreating him to restore to the pope those
                    places which he had taken from him, and even offering him a large siun of money
                    if he would do so. But these propositions being rejected, Charles obtained the
                    consent of his nobility to make war on the Lombards. Didier, however, disposed
                    his troops with such ability, that the officers of Charles were of opinion it
                    would be impossible to force a passage; but, either by the superior skill of
                    Charles, or from the effect of panic, this was accomplished; after which Didier,
                    with the Duke of Aquitaine, who had taken refuge at his court, shut themselves
                    up in Pavia, whilst Adalgise, the only son of the Lombard monarch, together with
                    the widow and children of Carloman, fled to Verona. The latter city was
                    immediately invested, and in a short time obliged to submit; but Adalgise had
                    the good fortune to escape to Constantinople. After paying a short visit to
                    Rome, Charles returned to the siege of Pavia. The place was vigorously defended,
                    but famine and pestilence ultimately obliged the inhabitants to implore the
                    clemency of the conqueror. Hunalde fell a sacrifice to his own obstinacy in
                    opposing the intention of the people; Didier was taken prisoner and carried into
                    France; his kingdom was totally dissolved, and Charles crowned king of Lombardy
                    at Milan in the year 774.</p>
                <p>Having received the oaths of allegiance from his new subjects, Charles set out
                    for Saxony, the inhabitants of which had again revolted, and re-possessed
                    themselves of Eresburg, their capital. The king however soon recovered this
                    important post; but a detachment of his army having been cut off, and new
                    troubles having arisen in Italy, he was obliged to accept the proposals of the
                    Saxons, though distrustful of their sincerity. Having strengthened the
                    fortifications of Eresburg, and left a sufficient garrison in the place, he set
                    out for Italy, where his presence restored tranquillity; but the Saxons having
                    in the meanwhile retaken Eresburg, and destroyed the fortifications, threatened
                    to annihilate the French power in that quarter. On his return Charles found them
                    employed in the siege of Sige-burg. But his sudden arrival struck them with such
                    terror that they instantly sued for peace, which the king once more granted;
                    but, to secure their obedience, he constructed a chain of forts along the river
                    Lippe, and repaired the fortifications of Eresburg. An assembly of the Saxon
                    chiefs was then held at Paderborn, and a promise extracted from them that the
                    nation should embrace the Christian religion.</p>
                <p>His next enterprise was an expedition to Spain, undertaken in 778 at the request
                    of Ibunala, the Moorish sovereign of Zaragoza, who had been driven from his
                    territory. Having reduced the cities of Pampeluna, Zaragoza, and Barcelona, and
                    also the kingdoms of Navarre and Aragon, Charles restored Ibunala; but, on his
                    return, he met with a severe check from the Gascons, who attacked and defeated
                    with great slaughter the rear-guard of his army, in a pass of the Pyrenean
                    mountains. This encounter, the result of which seems to imply some defect in the
                    prudence or military skill of Charles, has been much celebrated among romance
                    writers, on account of the death of Roland, which took place on this
                    occasion.</p>
                <p>The following year Charlemagne paid a visit to Italy with his two sons Carloman
                    and Louis, and having passed the winter at Pavia, entered Rome next spring
                    amidst the acclamations of the inhabitants. Here, in the thirty-ninth year of
                    his age, he divided his dominions between his two sons Carloman and Louis; the
                    former, who now took the name of Pepin, receiving Lombardy, and the latter
                    Aquitaine. Having then received the submission of the Duke of Bavaria, he set
                    out for Saxony, where the people had once more revolted, and where he now
                    inflicted a severe chastisement for the many treacheries of which they had been
                    guilty. This insurrection had been stirred up by a chief named Witikind, who
                    having twice before fled from the victorious arms of Charles, and taken refuge
                    at the court of Denmark, had returned in the king’s absence, and roused his
                    countrymen to arms, whilst the generals of Charles, divided among themselves,
                    and neglecting to take the proper measures for putting down the revolt, were
                    entirely defeated on the banks of the Weser, in the year 782. Charles arrived in
                    time to prevent the total destruction of his troops, and having penetrated into
                    the heart of the country, Witikind, unable to resist his antagonist, once more
                    fled into Denmark; but four thousand five hundred of his followers perished at
                    once by the hands of the executioner. A general insurrection ensued; and though
                    during three years the French monarch was constantly successful in the field, he
                    found it impossible to subdue the spirit of the people, and was at last obliged
                    to have recourse to negotiation. Witikind and several other chiefs were invited
                    to an interview, and Charles having represented to them in strong colours the
                    ruin which must ensue to their country from persisting in an obstinate and
                    fruitless opposition, they were induced not only to persuade their countrymen
                    finally to submit, but also to embrace the Christian religion.</p>
                <p>Having thus brought his affairs in Saxony to a satisfactory conclusion, Charles
                    turned his arms against Tassilon duke of Bavaria, who had secrectly supported
                    the Saxons in their revolts; and having entered that country with a powerful
                    army in the year 787, he advanced so rapidly, that seeing his destruction
                    inevitable, Tassilon privately entered his camp, and threw himself at his feet.
                    Charles looked with pity on his faithless kinsman; but no sooner did the latter
                    find himself at liberty, than he stirred up the Huns, the Greek emperor, and the
                    fugitive Adalgise, and also fomented the discontents of the factious nobles of
                    Aquitaine and Lombardy. His subjects, however, fearing lest these intrigues
                    should involve them in destruction, made a discovery of the whole; upon which
                    Tassilon was arrested by order of the French monarch, and being brought to a
                    trial, and found guilty, he was condemned to lose his head; a sentence which was
                    afterwards mitigated to perpetual confinement in a monastery. The duchy of
                    Bavaria was then annexed to the dominions of Charles.</p>
                <p>But the Huns and other enemies of the French monarch, disregarding the fate of
                    Tassilon, continued to prosecute their enterprises against him. Their attempts,
                    however, only served to enhance the fame of Charles, who defeated the Huns in
                    Bavaria, and the Greek emperor in Italy, at the same time obliging the latter to
                    renounce for ever the fortunes of Adalgise. As the Huns, not disheartened by
                    their defeat, continued to infest the French dominions, Charles entered their
                    country at the head of a formidable army; and having forced their intrenchments,
                    penetrated as far as Raab on the Danube; but he was compelled by an epidemic to
                    retire before he had completed the conquest of this people. On his return to his
                    own dominions, <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490715&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=29"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-0029-0009"/>he had the mortification to learn that his eldest
                    son Pepin had conspired against his life. The plot having been discovered by a
                    priest, Pepin was seized, and condemned to expiate his offences by spending the
                    remainder of his days in a monastery. But Charles was no sooner freed from this
                    danger than he was again called to arms by a revolt of the Saxons on the one
                    hand, and a formidable invasion of the Moors on the other, whilst the Huns at
                    the same time renewed their predatory attacks on his dominions. As to the Moors,
                    the king foresaw that they would be called off by their Christian enemies in
                    Spain; and this accordingly happened, the victories of Alonso the Chaste having
                    obliged them to quit France. Charles then marched in person to attack the Saxons
                    and Huns, the former of whom again consented to receive the Christian religion,
                    and were likewise obliged to deliver up a third part of their army to be
                    disposed of at the king’s pleasure; but the latter defended themselves with
                    incredible vigour, and the war was only terminated by the death of their king,
                    and an almost total destruction of the people.</p>
                <p>These exploits occurred between the years 793 and 798. Charles next invaded and
                    subdued the islands of Majorca and Minorca. But the satisfaction he received
                    from this new conquest was soon damped by the troubles which broke out in Italy.
                    After the death of Adrian, his nephew aspired to the papal dignity; but a priest
                    named Leo having been preferred, the disappointed candidate determined en
                    revenge, yet managed matters so well as to conceal for four years his design. At
                    last, on the day of a procession, a furious assault was made on the person of
                    Leo, and the unfortunate pontiff was left for dead on the ground. But having
                    with difficulty recovered, and made his escape to the Vatican, he was protected
                    by the Duke of Spoleto, general of the French forces, and his cause was warmly
                    espoused by Charles, who invited him to his camp at Paderborn in Westphalia. Leo
                    accepted the invitation, and not long afterwards returned, with a numerous
                    guard, to Rome, which the French monarch promised soon to visit, and there
                    redress all grievances. Having constructed forts at the mouths of most of the
                    navigable rivers, and further provided for the defence of his territories
                    against the descents of the Normans, by instituting a regular militia, and
                    appointing proper squadrons to cruise against the invaders, he set out for the
                    fourth and last time to Rome, where he was received with the highest possible
                    honours. Leo was now permitted to clear himselt by oath of the crimes laid to
                    his charge by his enemies, whilst his accusers were sent into exile.</p>
                <p>At length, on the festival of Christmas in the year 800, after Charles had made
                    his appearance in the cathedral of "St Peter, and assisted devoutly at mass, the
                    pope suddenly put a crown on his head; and the place instantly resounded with
                    acclamations of “Long life to Charles the August, crowned by the hand of God;
                    long life and victory to the great and pacific emperor of the Romans.” His body
                    was then consecrated and anointed with the royal unction; and after being
                    conducted to a throne, he was treated with all the respect usually paid to the
                    ancient Caesars; from this time also he was honoured with the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Charle-niagne,</hi> or Charles the Great. In private conversation,
                    however, he usually protested that he was ignorant of the pope’s intention, and
                    that, had he known it, he would have disappointed it by absenting himself; but
                    these protestations were not generally believed, and the care he took to have
                    his new title acknowledged by the eastern emperors evidently showed that the
                    conduct of his holiness on this occasion was neither unexpected nor
                    disagreeable. Being now raised to the supreme dignity in the west, Charlemagne
                    proposed to unite in his own person the whole power of the first Roman emperors,
                    by marrying Irene, the empress of the east. But in this he was disappointed by
                    the marriage of that princess to Niceþhorus, who, however, acknowledged the new
                    dignity of Augustus bestowed on his rival, and the boundaries of the two empires
                    were amicably settled. Charles was further gratified by the respect paid him by
                    the renowned Haroun Al-Raschid, caliph of the Saracens, who yielded to him the
                    sacred city of Jerusalem, together with the holy sepulchre. But in the mean time
                    his empire was threatened with the invasion of a formidable enemy, whom even the
                    power of Charles would have found it difficult to resist. We allude to the
                    Normans, who were at this rime under the command of Godfrey, a celebrated
                    warrior, and who by their adventurous spirit and skill in maritime affairs
                    threatened all the western coasts of Europe with desolation. From motives of
                    mutual convenience, a temporary peace was concluded, and Charles employed the
                    interval thus afforded to settle the final distribution of his dominions.
                    Aquitaine and Gascony, with the Spanish Marche, were assigned to his son Louis;
                    Pepin had Italy confirmed to him, to which was added the greater part of
                    Bavaria, with the country now possessed by the Grisons; whilst Charles, the
                    eldest, had Neustria, Austrasia, and Thuringia. This division, however, had
                    scarcely taken place when the princes were all obliged to defend their dominions
                    by force of arms. Louis and Pepin were attacked by the Saracens, and Charles by
                    the Sclavonians. All these enemies were indeed defeated; but whilst Charles
                    hoped to spend the remainder of his days in tranquillity, he was once more
                    called into the field by the hostile demeanour of the Norman chief. Charles sent
                    him a message of defiance, which was returned in the same style by Godfrey; but,
                    by artfully fomenting divisions amongst the northern tribes, Charles prevented
                    for a time the threatened danger. When these disturbances were quelled, however,
                    the Normans renewed their depredations, and Charles was obliged to confront them
                    in the field. But an engagement was prevented by the death of Godfrey, who was
                    assassinated by a private soldier; and the Norman army having retreated, the
                    dominions of the empire remained free from these invaders. Still the latter days
                    of Charles were embittered by domestic misfortunes. His favourite daughter
                    Rotrude died, as did also Pepin king of Italy; and these misfortunes were soon
                    followed by the death of his eldest son Charles. The emperor then resolved to
                    associate with himself in the government his only surviving son Louis; and this
                    was formally executed at Aix-la-Chapelle. But Charles survived the transaction
                    only a few months; and his death, which happened on the 27th of January 814, in
                    the seventy-first year of his age and forty-seventh of his reign, removed the
                    last remaining barrier against the confusion and anarchy which ensued.</p>
                <p>By the martial achievements of this hero the French monarchy was raised to the
                    highest pitch of splendour. He had added tire province of Aquitaine to the
                    territories of his ancestors; he had confined the inhabitants of Bretagne to the
                    shores of the ocean, and obliged them to submit to annual tribute; and he had
                    reduced under his dominion all that part of Spain which extends from the
                    Pyrenees to the Ebro, including the kingdoms of Roussillon, Navarre, Aragon, and
                    Catalonia. He possessed Italy from the Alps to the borders of Calabria; but the
                    duchy of Beneventum, including the greater part of the present kingdom of
                    Naples, escaped from his yoke after a transitory submission. Charles also added
                    to his territories the whole of Germany and Pannonia; so that the French
                    jurisdiction extended from the Ebro in Spain to the Vistula in Poland, and from
                    the duchy of Beneventum in Italy to the river Eyder, the boundary between
                    Germany and the dominions of Denmark. ìn acquiring these extensive dominions,
                    Charles had committed frequent and barbarous massacres, for which he had no
                    other excuse than the fierce and rebellious disposition of the people with whom
                    he had to deal. But in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490715&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=30" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0030-0010"
                    />establishing schools throughout the conquered provinces, he showed an
                    inclination to govern his subjects in peace, and to take means for promoting
                    their civilization; though many parts of his conduct still evinced no small
                    inclination to cruelty, particularly the fate of the sons of Carloman, of whom
                    no distinct account could ever be obtained. His advice to his son Louis was
                    indeed excellent: in exhorting the latter to consider his people as his
                    children, to be mild and gentle in his administration, but firm in the execution
                    of justice, to reward merit, to promote his nobles gradually, to choose
                    ministers deliberately, and not remove them capriciously or without sufficient
                    reason, he displayed a degree of sense and wisdom worthy of his fame. But these
                    prudent maxims were insufficient to enable Louis to govern dominions so
                    extensive, or to restrain people so turbulent as he had to deal withal.</p>
                <p>At the time of the decease of his father this prince was about thirty-six years
                    of age, and had married Ermengarde, daughter of the Count of Hesbai, of the
                    diocese of Liege, by whom he had three sons, Lothaire, Pepin, and Louis.
                    Lothaire, the elaest, was associated with himself in the empire, and the two
                    others were intrusted with the governments of Aquitaine and Bavaria. But these
                    princes proved unfaithful to their father, as well as enemies to one another.
                    The death of Ermengarde, and the marriage of the emperor with Judith, a princess
                    of Bavaria, artful but accomplished, proved the first source of calamity to the
                    empire. In the year 823 was born Charles, the emperor’s youngest son; and his
                    pretensions eventually became more fatal to the public tranquillity than the
                    ambition and disobedience of all the others. Various parts of the imperial
                    dominions were likewise attacked by foreign enemies. The inhabitants of Bretagne
                    and Navarre revolted, and the Moors invaded Catalonia; whilst the ambition of
                    Judith produced a war amongst the brothers themselves. Charles at first had been
                    appointed sovereign of that part of Germany which is bounded by the Danube, the
                    Maine, the Neckar, and the Rhine, together with the country of the Grisons and
                    Burgundy, comprehending Geneva and the Swiss Cantons; but this was opposed by
                    the three elder sons. Pepin and Louis advanced with the united forces of
                    Aquitaine and Bavaria, whilst the imperial forces deserted their standard and
                    joined the malcontents. The emperor was taken prisoner, and the empress retired
                    to a monastery. Lothaire, the eldest of the young princes, was the person who
                    retained the emperor in his possession; but, notwithstanding his breach of duty,
                    his heart was touched with remorse on account of the crimes he had committed.
                    Dreading the reproach of the world at large, and threatened with the censures of
                    the church, he threw himself at his fathers feet, begged pardon for his offence,
                    and consented to relinquish the power he had unjustly usurped. Being thus
                    re-established in his authority by the diet of the empire, which had met to
                    depose him, Louis recalled his empress from the monastery to which she had
                    retired; but this princess, implacable in her resentment, so persecuted Lothaire
                    that he was obliged to join his two brothers Pepin and Louis in a confederacy
                    against their father. The old emperor attempted to check this rebellious
                    disposition by revolting his grant of Aquitaine to Pepin, and bestowing it on
                    his youngest son Charles, then only nine years of age; but Pope Gregory IV.
                    conferred the imperial dignity itself on Lothaire, deposed the unhappy monarch,
                    and again sent the empress to a nunnery in the forest of Ardennes. As the
                    unnatural behaviour of his son, however, had once more excited the compassion of
                    his subjects, Dreux, the bishop of Mentz, used his interest with Louis of
                    Bavaria to arna in defence of his father and sovereign. In this enterprise the
                    Bavarian monarch was joined by the French and the Saxons; and the aged emperor
                    was again restored, the empress being released from her nunnery, and Charles
                    from his prison, in the year 833. But the ambition of Judith again kindled the
                    flame of discord. Taking advantage of the affection of her husband, she
                    persuaded him to invest her son Charles with the sovereignty of Neustria, as
                    well as the dominions formerly assigned him; a proceeding which was productive
                    of great discontent on the part of Lothaire and Pepin. But their power was now
                    too much broken to enable them to accomplish any thing by force of arms; and the
                    death of Pepin, which happened soon afterwards, produced a new division of the
                    empire. The claims of Pepin and Charles, the sons of the deceased prince, were
                    entirely disregarded, and his French dominions divided between the two brothers
                    Charles and Lothaire, the latter of whom was named guardian to his infant
                    nephew. This enraged Louis of Bavaria, whose interest was entirely neglected in
                    the partition, and induced him to revolt; but the unexpected appearance of the
                    Saxons obliged him to submit and ask pardon for his offence. Still, however, the
                    ambition of the empress kept matters in a continual ferment, and the empire was
                    again threatened with all the calamities of civil war; but this was prevented by
                    the death of the emperor, which took place in 841, after a most unfortunate
                    reign of twenty-seven years. Louis was eminent for his mild manners and peaceful
                    virtues, which procured him the title of <hi rend="italic">Le Débonnaire;</hi>
                    but such was the excessive turbulence and barbarity of the age in which he
                    lived, that his virtues, instead of procuring him respect and esteem, were
                    productive only of contempt and rebellion.</p>
                <p>The decease of the emperor was followed by a civil war among his sons. In 842,
                    the united forces of Lothaire and his nephew Pepin were defeated by those of
                    Charles and Louis in a bloody battle on the plains of Fontenoy, where a hundred
                    thousand Franks perished. This victory, however, did not decide the fortune of
                    the war. The conquerors having, from motives of interest or jealousy, retired
                    each into his own dominions, Lothaire found means to recruit his shattered
                    forces, and even pressed the other two princes so vigorously that they were glad
                    to consent to a new partition of the empire. By this Lothaire was allowed to
                    possess the whole of Italy, with the tract of country situated between the
                    rivers Rhone and Rhine, as well as that between the Meuse and Scheldt; Charles
                    obtained Aquitaine, with the country situated between the Loire and the Meuse;
                    whilst Louis received Bavaria, with the rest of Germany, and from this was
                    distinguished by the appellation of Louis the German. By this partition Germany
                    and France were disjoined in such a manner as never afterwards to be united
                    under one head. That part of France which was allowed to Lothaire was from him
                    called <hi rend="italic">Lotharingie,</hi> and afterwards, by the gradual
                    corruption of the word, Lorraine. The sovereignty, however, which that prince
                    had pursued at the expense of every filial duty, and purchased with so much
                    blood, afforded him so little satisfaction, that, disgusted with the cares and
                    anxieties of his situation, he sought relief in a monastery in the year 855. On
                    his retreat from the throne, he allotted to his eldest son Louis II. the
                    sovereignty of Italy; to his second son Lothaire the territory of Lorraine, with
                    the title of king; and to his youngest son Charles, surnamed the Bald, Provence,
                    Dauphine, and part of the kingdom of Burgundy; so that he may be considered as
                    properly the king of France. From the year 845 to 857 the provinces subjected to
                    his jurisdiction had been infested by the annual depredations of the Normans,
                    from whom Charles was at last glad to purchase peace at a greater expense than
                    might have carried on a successful war. The people of Bretagne had also
                    revolted; and though obliged, by the appearance of Charles at the head of a
                    powerful army, to return to their allegiance, they no sooner perceived him again
                    embarrassed by the incursions of the Normans, than they threw off the yoke, and
                    under the conduct of their dukt <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514110"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4110-0011"/>Louis subdued the neighbouring diocese of Rennes;
                    nfter which the latter assumed the title of king. By this bold usurper Charles
                    was totally defeated; and his subjects, perceiving the weakness of their
                    monarch, put themselves under the protection of Louis the German, whose ambition
                    prompted him to give a ready ear to the proposal. Taking the opportunity of
                    Charles’s absence in repelling an invasion of the Danes, he marched with a
                    formidable army into France, and was solemnly crowned by the Archbishop of Sens
                    in the year 857. But being too confident of success, and fancying himself
                    already established on the throne, he was persU⅛ded to dismiss his German
                    forces; upon which Charles marched against him with an army, and compelled Louis
                    to abandon his new kingdom. Notwithstanding this success, however, the kingdom
                    of Charles still continued in a very tottering condition. Harassed by the
                    Normans on one side, and by the king of Bretagne on another, he marched against
                    the latter in 860; but had the misfortune to sustain a total defeat, after an
                    engagement which lasted two days. The victory was chiefly owing to a noted
                    warrior named Robert le Fort, or the Strong, who commanded the Bretons; but
                    Charles found means to gain over the latter to his interest, and for some time
                    the abilities of Robert afforded support to his tottering throne. The
                    difficulties, however, returned on the death of that hero, who was killed in
                    repelling an invasion of the Danes. Some amends were indeed made for his loss by
                    the death of the king of Lorraine in 869, by which event the territories of
                    Charles were augmented by the cities of Lyons, Vienne, Tou!, Besançon, Verdun,
                    Cambray, Viviers, and Urez, together with the territories of Hainault, Zealand,
                    and Holland; whilst Cologne, Utrecht, Treves, Mentz, Strasburg, with the rest of
                    the territories of Lothaire, were assigned to Louis the German.</p>
                <p>All this time the Normans still continued their incursions; but Solomon king of
                    Bretagne having joined his forces to those of Charles, in order to repel the
                    common enemy, the Normans were besieged in Angiers, and obliged to purchase
                    leave to depart by relinquishing all the spoil they had taken. Thus freed from a
                    formidable enemy, Charles began to aspire to the imperial crown, which soon
                    became vacant by the death of Louis. This indeed belonged of right to Louis the
                    German; but Charles, having assembled a powerful army, marched into Italy; and
                    being favourably received at Rome, the imperial crown was placed on his head by
                    the pope, in the year 873. Enraged at his disappointment, Louis discharged his
                    fury on the defenceless country of Champagne; and though the approach of Charles
                    obliged him to retire, he continued his preparations with such vigour that
                    Charles would probably have found him a formidable adversary, had he not been
                    removed by death in 877. Informed of his brother’s decease, Charles invaded the
                    dominions of his son Louis, who possessed Franconia, Thuringia, and Lower
                    Lorraine, with some other territories. But the enterprise proved unsuccessful.
                    Charles, though at the head of superior numbers, was defeated with great
                    slaughter, and had scarcely time to reunite his scattered forces when he
                    received information that the Normans had invaded his territories, laid waste
                    part of the country, and taken possession of Rouen. These disasters affected him
                    so deeply that he fell dangerously ill, and he had scarcely recovered when he
                    was called into Italy to assist the pope against the Saracens. Charles passed
                    into Italy with a few followers; but when he arrived at Pavia, where the pontiff
                    had appointed to meet him, he was informed that Carloman, king of Bavaria, son
                    of Louis the German, was already in Italy with a powerful army, and laid claim
                    to the imperial title. Charles accordingly prepared to oppose him by force of
                    arms; but his generals conspired against him, and rhe soldiers declared their
                    resolution not to pass the Alps. This obliged him to retire to France at the
                    moment when Carloman, dreading his power, was preparing to return to Germany.
                    This was the last enterprise of Charles. His journey brought on a relapse of
                    illness, which was rendered fatal through the treachery of a Jewish physician
                    named Zedechius, who administered poison to him under the pretence of curing his
                    malady; and he expired in a miserable cottage upon Mount Cenis, in the
                    fifty-fourth year of his age, and thirty-eighth of his reign over the kingdom of
                    France.</p>
                <p>The ambition of Charles had been productive of much distress both to himself and
                    to his subjects. His son Louis, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> surnamed the
                    Stammerer, from a defect in his speech, was' of a different disposition; but his
                    feeble administration was ill calculated to retrieve the fortunes of his
                    country. He died on the 10th of April 879, whilst on a march to suppress some
                    insurrections in Burgundy, leaving his queen Adelaide pregnant; and some time
                    after his decease the latter was delivered of a son, named Charles. His death
                    was followed by an interregnum, during which a faction was formed for setting
                    aside the children of Louis the Stammerer, in favour of the German princes, sons
                    to Louis the brother of Charles the Bald. But this scheme proved abortive; and
                    the two sons of the late king, Louis and Carloman, were crowned kings of France.
                    But in 881 both princes died; Louis, as was suspected, of poison; and Carloman
                    of a wound he had received whilst hunting. This produced a second interregnum,
                    which ended in calling in Charles the Gross, emperor of Germany, whose reign was
                    even more unfortunate than that of any of his predecessors. The Normans, whom he
                    had allowed to settle in Friesland, having sailed up the Seine with a fleet, and
                    laid siege to Paris, Charles, unable to force them to abandon their undertaking,
                    prevailed on them to depart by a large sum of money. But as he could not advance
                    the money at once, he permitted them to remain during the winter in the
                    neighbourhood of Paris, which they in return plundered without mercy. After this
                    disgraceful transaction Charles returned to Germany in a declining state of
                    health; and having quarrelled with his empress, he was abandoned by all his
                    friends, deposed, and reduced to the greatest distress.</p>
                <p>On the deposition of Charles the Gross, Eudes count of&lt; Paris, chosen king by
                    the nobility during the minority of* Charles son of Adelaide, afterwards named
                    Charles the Simple, defeated the Normans, and repressed the power of the
                    nobility. On this account a party was formed in favour of Charles, who was sent
                    for from England; but Eudes having peaceably resigned the greater part of the
                    kingdom, consented to do homage for the remainder, and died soon after the
                    agreement, in 898. During the reign of Charles the Simple, the French government
                    declined. By the introduction of fiefs, those noblemen who had obtained the
                    possession of governments, and got these confirmed to themselves and their heirs
                    for ever, became in a manner independent sovereigns; and as the great lords had
                    others under them, and these in like manner others who again had their vassals,
                    instead of the easy and equal government which formerly prevailed, a vast number
                    of insupportable little tyrannies was erected. The Normans, too, ravaged the
                    country, and desolated some of the finest provinces of France. But Charles at
                    length ceded the duchy of Neustria to Rollo, the chief of these barbarians, who
                    having become a Christian, changed his own name to Robert, and that of his
                    principality to Normandy.</p>
                <p>During the remainder of the reign of Charles the Simple, and the entire reigns of
                    Louis IV. surnamed the Stranger, Lothaire, and Louis V. the power of the
                    Carlovingian race continually declined, till at last they were supplanted by
                    Hugh Capet, who had been created Duke of France by Lothairc. This revolution
                    happened in the year 987, and was brought about much in the same manner as the
                    former <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514123" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4123-0012"/>one had
                    been by Pepin. Capet proved an active and prudent monarch, and possessed other
                    qualities requisite for keeping his tumultuous subjects in awe. He died on the
                    24th of October 997, leaving his dominions in perfect quiet to his son
                    Robert.</p>
                <p>The new king inherited the eminent qualities of his father. In his reign the
                    kingdom was enlarged by the death of Henry duke of Burgundy, to whom he became
                    heir. This new accession of territory, however, was not obtained without a war
                    of several years continuance; and had it not been for the. assistance of the
                    Duke of Normandy, it is doubtful whether the king would have succeeded. As
                    Robert was of opinion that peace and tranquillity were preferable to wide and
                    extended dominions held by a precarious tenure, he refused the kingdom of Italy
                    and the imperial crown of Germany, both which were offered him, and died on the
                    20th of July 1030.</p>
                <p>Robert was succeeded by his eldest son Henry I. In the beginning of his reign he
                    met with great opposition from his mother, who had always hated him, and
                    preferred his younger brother Robert, in whose favour she now raised an
                    insurrection. With the assistance of Robert duke of Normandy, however, Henry
                    overcame all his enemies, and established himself firmly upon the throne. In
                    return for this service he supported William, Robert’s natural son, and
                    subsequently king of England, in the possession of the duchy of Normandy.
                    Afterwards, however, having become jealous of the power of the future conqueror,
                    he not only supported secretly the pretenders to the duchy of Normandy, but
                    actually invaded that country. This enterprise, however, proved unsuccessful,
                    and Henry was obliged to make peace; but no sincere reconciliation ever
                    followed; for the king retained a deep sense of the disgrace he had met with,
                    and the duke never forgave him for invading his dominions. The treaty was
                    therefore speedily broken; and Henry once more invaded Normandy with two armies,
                    one commanded by himself, and the other by his brother. The first was harassed
                    by continual skirmishes, and the last totally defeated; after which Henry was
                    obliged to agree to such terms as the duke thought proper to dictate. But the
                    rancour which had been generated between them never ceased, and was in reality
                    the cause of that implacable aversion which for a long series of years produced
                    perpetual quarrels between the kings of France and those of the Norman race in
                    England.</p>
                <p>Henry died in 1059, not without suspicion of being poisoned, and was succeeded by
                    his eldest son Philip, at that time in the eighth year of his age. Baldwin earl
                    of Flanders was appointed his guardian, and died in the year 1066, about the
                    time that William of Normandy became king of England. After the death of his
                    tutor, Philip began to show an insincere, haughty, and oppressive disposition.
                    He engaged in a war with William the Conqueror, and supported his son Robert in
                    a rebellion against him. (See article <hi rend="smallcaps">England.)</hi> But
                    after the death of William, he assisted Robert’s brothers against him, by which
                    means the latter was forced to consent to a partition of his dominions. In 1092,
                    Philip, being wearied of his queen Bertha, procured a divorce under pretence of
                    consanguinity, and afterwards demanded in marriage Emma, daughter of Roger,
                    count of Calabria. The treaty of marriage was concluded; and the princess was
                    sent over, with jewels and a considerable sum in ready money. But the king,
                    instead of espousing her, retained her fortune; dismissed the princess herself;
                    carried off the countess of Anjou, esteemed the handsomest woman in France, from
                    her husband, and, not satisfied with the illegal possession of her person,
                    procured a divorce from her husband, whilst he prevailed upon some Norman
                    bishops to solemnize a marriage with her. But these transactions were so
                    scandalous, that the pope, having caused them to be revised in a council held at
                    Autun in the year 1094, pronounced sentence of excommunication against Philip in
                    case he did not part with the countess. On his professing repentance, however,
                    the censure was taken off; but as the king paid no regard to his promises, he
                    was in 1095 excommunicated a second time. He again professed repentance, and was
                    again absolved; but as he still lived with the Countess of Anjou as formerly, he
                    was soon afterwards excommunicated a third time. This unworthy conduct exposed
                    him to the contempt of the people. But too many of the nobility followed his
                    example, at the same time that they despised his authority. In the year 1100
                    Philip prevailed on the court of Rome to have this affair reviewed in an
                    assembly at Poictiers; where, notwithstanding his utmost efforts, sentence of
                    excommunication was a fourth time pronounced against him. Yet, in spite of all
                    these sentences, as Bertha was now dead, and the Count of Anjou offered, for a
                    large sum of money, to give whatever assistance might be requisite for procuring
                    a dispensation, Philip at last prevailed, and the countess was proclaimed queen
                    of France. But though his domestic concerns were now in some measure arranged,
                    his negligence in public matters had thrown the affairs of the nation into the
                    greatest disorder. He therefore associated with him in the government his eldest
                    son Louis, a prince the reverse of his father, and who by his activity and
                    resolution kept constantly in the field with a considerable body of forces,
                    reduced the rebellious nobility to subjection, and saved the state from being
                    utterly subverted. For these services the queen looked upon the prince with so
                    jealous an eye, that he found it necessary to retire for a time into England;
                    but he had not been long at the English court before Henry I. received a letter
                    from Philip, urging him, for certain important reasons, to throw his son into
                    close confinement, or even to dispatch him. The king of England, however,
                    instead of complying with this infamous request, showed the letter to Louis, and
                    sent him home with all imaginable marks of respect. Immediately on his return he
                    demanded justice; but the queen caused poison to be administered to him, which
                    operated so violently that his life was for a time despaired of. A stranger,
                    however, undertook the cure, and succeeded. On his recovery, the prince was on
                    the point of avenging his quarrel by force of arms; but his father having caused
                    the queen to make the most humble submissions to him, his resentment was
                    appeased, and a reconciliation took place.</p>
                <p>Philip died in the year 1108, and was succeeded by his son Louis, surnamed the
                    Gross. The first years of his reign were disturbed by insurrections of his
                    lords, which proved the more troublesome as they were secretly fomented by Henry
                    I. of England, that by weakening the power of France his duchy of Normandy might
                    be the more secure. This quickly brought on a war, in which Henry was defeated,
                    and his son William obliged to do homage for Normandy. As the kings of England
                    and France, however, were rivals, the latter espoused the cause of William the
                    son of Robert duke of Normandy, whom Henry had unjustly deprived of that duchy;
                    and this brought on a new war, in which Louis, having sustained a defeat, was
                    obliged to make peace upon such terms as his antagonist thought proper to
                    prescribe. The pacification, however, was but of short duration. Louis renewed
                    his intrigues in favour of William, and endeavoured to form a confederacy
                    against Henry; but the latter found means not only to dissipate this
                    confederacy, but to prevail upon Henry V. emperor of Germany to invade France
                    with the whole strength of the empire on one side, whilst he prepared to attack
                    it on the other. But Louis having collected an army of two hundred thousand men,
                    both thought proper to desist from the attempt. Upon this the king of France
                    desired to march into Normandy to put William in possession of that duchy; but
                    his great vassals refused to assist in such an <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193514136" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4136-0013"/>enterprise, alleging that
                    they had assembled to defend the territories of France from the invasion of a
                    foreign prince, and not to enlarge his power by destroying the balance produced
                    by the king of England possessing Normandy, which they reckoned necessary for
                    their own safety. This was followed by a peace, which was concluded on pretty
                    equal terms, and maintained during the life of Louis, who died in 1137, leaving
                    the kingdom to his son Louis VII.</p>
                <p>The young king was not endowed with any of those qualities which constitute a
                    great monarch. From the superstition of the age in which he lived, he undertook
                    an expedition into the Holy Land, whence he returned without glory. In this
                    expedition he took his queen Eleanor along with him: but was so much offended
                    with her gallantries during her stay in Palestine, as well as her behaviour
                    afterwards, that he divorced her, and returned the duchy of Guienne. which he
                    had received as her portion. Six weeks after this she married Henry duke of
                    Normandy, count of Anjou and Maine, and heir apparent to the crown of England.
                    This marriage proved a very great mortification to Louis, and, on account of the
                    folly of his conduct, procured him an unenviable cognomen. His reign was wholly
                    undistinguished. He died on the 18th of September 1180, leaving the kingdom to
                    his son Philip.</p>
                <p>This prince, surnamed The Gift of God, The Magnanimous, and The Conqueror, during
                    his life-time, and styled Augustus after his death, is reckoned by some
                    historians one of the greatest princes who ever sat on the throne of France. It
                    does not appear, however, that these titles were at all deserved. In the
                    beginning of his reign he was opposed by a strong faction excited by his mother,
                    which he suppressed with a vigour and spirit that did him honour; but his having
                    taken part with the children of Henry II. of England, in their unnatural
                    contests with their father, and his treacherous combination with John to seize
                    his brother’s kingdom when he was detained in prison by the emperor of Germany,
                    are indelible stains in his character. In military skill and personal valour he
                    was inferior to Richard I. of England; nor can his recovering the provinces held
                    by the English in France from such a mean and dastardly prince as John entitle
                    him with any justice to the surname of Conqueror. In politics he was evidently
                    the dupe of the pope, who made use of him to intimidate John into a submission,
                    by promising him the kingdom of England, which he never meant that he should
                    enjoy. For an account of these transactions, see the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">England.</hi></p>
                <p>Philip died in 1223, and was succeeded by his son Louis VIII. who, again, was, in
                    1226, succeeded by Louis IX. afterwards styled St Louis. This prince was
                    certainly possessed of many good qualities, but deeply tinctured with the
                    superstition of the times, which induced him to engage in two crusades. In the
                    first of these, against the Saracens of Egypt, he was taken prisoner, and
                    treated with great cruelty; but ultimately obtained his deliverance, on
                    condition of paying a million of pieces of gold, and surrendering the city of
                    Damietta. No sooner had he regained his liberty than he entered Syria with a
                    view of doing something worthy of his character. But from this expedition he was
                    obliged to return sooner than he intended, by the news of the decease of his
                    mother, Queen Blanch, whom he bad appointed regent in his absence, and who had
                    managed the national affairs with great prudence. Upon his return, however, the
                    king found many and great disorders in the kingdom, which he set himself to
                    reform with the utmost diligence. The reputation of this monarch for candour and
                    justice was so great that the barons of England, as well as King Henry III.
                    consented to make him umpire of the differences which subsisted between them.
                    But though he decided this matter justly, his decision was not productive of any
                    good. At last the king, having settled every thing relating to his kingdom, set
                    out on another crusade for Afřiċa, where he died of the plague, on the 25th of
                    August 1270.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the misfortunes of Louis, his successor Philip, βurnamed the
                    Hardy, continued the war against the Infìdeis with great vigour. Being
                    reinforced by his uncle Charles king of Sicily, he brought the contest to a more
                    fortunate conclusion than his predecessor; the Saracens were defeated in two
                    engagements; and the king of Tunis was obliged to sue for peace, offering at the
                    same time to double the tribute which he formerly paid to the crown of Sicily,
                    to reimburse the expenses of the war, and to permit the Christian religion to be
                    freely propagated throughout his dominions. Having accomplished this, the two
                    princes set sail for Europe; but the distemper which had infected the army in
                    Africa not being eradicated, it broke forth on their arrival in Sicily, and for
                    some time raged with great violence. On his return to France, Philip took
                    possession of the counties of Provence and Toulouse; married his second son,
                    though then very young, to the only daughter of the king of Navarre; and himself
                    espoused Mary the daughter of the Duke of Brabant, reckoned one of the most
                    bean-tiful princesses of the age. He steadily enforced the regulations of his
                    predecessor, who had prohibited the barons from making private wars upon one
                    another; secured the friendship of Edward I. of England, by ceding to him the
                    county of Agenois; and entered into a war with Spain in support of the
                    pretensions of his nephews, the Infants de la Cerda, to the throne of Castille.
                    The events of this war were of no great importance; and the king’s attention was
                    quickly called away from them by the death of his eldest son Louis at the age of
                    twelve years. This event happened in the year 1275, not without a suspicion of
                    poison, which is common enough when princes are cut off by sudden deaths, and
                    the king and queen were themselves loudly condemned. Meanwhile the Sicilians,
                    over whom Charles of Anjou had established his authority, instigated by John of
                    Procida, a noble exile, came to a determination of freeing themselves from the
                    French yoke by a general massacre. This resolution was accordingly carried into
                    execution, and the French, to the number of eight thousand, were murdered in one
                    night; after which Pedro of Aragon sailed to the island, where he was received
                    by the inhabitants as their king and deliverer. Charles was sensibly affected by
                    this misfortune; and having laid siege to Messina, sailed directly to
                    Marseilles, where he obtained a powerful reinforcement. But during his absence,
                    his son, to whom he had entrusted the conduct of the siege, having rashly
                    ventured an engagement with the Spanish fleet, was entirely defeated and taken
                    prisoner. This so much affected the father that he died of grief, and Sicily
                    became inseparably attached to the house of Aragon. The misfortunes of Charles
                    were followed by others which equally affected Philip himself. Pope Martin IV.
                    in the warmth of his zeal for the cause of the Duke of Anjou, had excommunicated
                    Pedro of Aragon, and bestowed his kingdom on Charles of Valois, a younger son of
                    the king of France. In attempting to defend himself against the execution of
                    this unjust sentence, Pedro was mortally wounded; but, soon afterwards, the
                    French fleet being defeated by that of Aragon, the king was so much affected by
                    the misfortune that he fell sick, and expired at Perpignan, in 1285, in the
                    forty-first year of his age and sixteenth of his reign.</p>
                <p>By the death of Philip the Hardy, the French crown devolved on his second son
                    Philip the Fair, who had espoused the princess of Navarre, and who at the time
                    of his accession was in his seventeenth year. By the marriage with this princess
                    he had obtained the counties of Champagne and Brie; yet even with this increase
                    of territory he found himself unable to support the war in which his predecessor
                    had engaged, for which reason he abandoned the interest of the Infants de la
                    Cerda, and settled the differences with Castille. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193514149" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4149-0014"/>treaty was concluded through
                    the mediation of Edward I. of England, by whose intercession Charles the Lame,
                    son of the Duke of Anjou, was released from captivity, Edward himself paying
                    part of his ransom. Charles consented to renounce his claim on Sicily; and
                    Philip himself promised that his kinsman Philip of Valois should renounce all
                    pretensions to the crown of Aragon. The tranquillity resulting from this treaty
                    was, however, soon interrupted by differences with Edward, Pope Boniface VIII.
                    and Guy de Dampier, count of Flanders. The difference with England arose by
                    accident. A Norman and an English vessel having met off the coast of Bayonne,
                    and having both occasion to water, the crews met and quarrelled at the same
                    spring, and in the squabble a Norman was killed with his own weapon by an
                    Englishman, whom it was alleged he had assaulted with it. But however this may
                    have been, a complaint was made by the Normans to Philip, who, without giving
                    himself much trouble to inquire into the merits of the cause, instantly allowed
                    them to redress their supposed injuries. The consequence was, that a kind of
                    piratical war commenced between the two nations; the Irish and Dutch seamen
                    taking part with the English, and those of Flanders and Genoa with the French.
                    Thus the force on both sides was gradually augmented, until at last the affair
                    became so serious that in one engagement fifteen thousand French are said to
                    have perished. Alarmed at such a carnage, Philip summoned the king of England as
                    his vassal to attend; and, on his refusal, declared his estates in France
                    forfeited. After a great deal of negotiation, however, Philip declared that he
                    would be satisfied with the nominal cession of the province of Guienne; and
                    Edward complied with his demands; but no sooner had the French monarch obtained
                    possession of that country than he persisted in the forfeiture of the English
                    possessions in France; and this treacherous proceeding instantly produced a war
                    between the two nations. Edward, that he might the better defend himself against
                    so formidable an adversary, concluded a treaty with the emperor Adolphus, and
                    the courts of Bretagne, Holland, Bar, Juliers, Gueldres, and Flanders; whilst
                    Philip strengthened himself by an alliance with John Baliol of Scotland, and
                    thus laid the foundation of that intimate union which subsisted between France
                    and Scotland for about two centuries. During this war the French made a descent
                    upon the coast of England, and destroyed the town of Dover; whilst Edward, in
                    revenge, landed in Gascony with a powerful army. But no great exploits were
                    performed with this armament; and the belligerents, finding themselves equally
                    matched, consented to a suspension of arms for two years, during which time a
                    peace was finally concluded through the mediation of Boniface VIII. Guienne was
                    restored; Edward espoused Margaret the sister of Philip; and his daughter
                    Isabelle was given in marriage to the prince of Wales. Philip and Edward treated
                    the allies whom they had engaged in their cause with equal perfidy. Baliol was
                    abandoned by Philip to the resentment of Edward; and Guy, earl of Flanders, was
                    left equally exposed to the vengeance of Philip.</p>
                <p>The reconciliation between the French and English monarchs was soon followed by a
                    difference with Pope Boniface, whom they had appointed mediator between them.
                    Sensible of his assuming disposition, they had inserted in the reference made to
                    him a provision, to the effect that he was chosen as a private individual, and
                    not as the successor of St Peter. The pontiff, however, soon showed that he was
                    not to be treated as a private person; and a contest with Phi lip quickly
                    ensued. Boniface began with forbidding the clergy, under pain of
                    excommunication, to grant the king any subsidies, without first obtaining the
                    consent of the Holy See; and Philip revenged himself by prohibiting
                    ecclesiastics from sending money out of the kingdom without his leave, and by
                    protecting the Colonnas, the implacable enemies of Boniface. Irritated at this
                    decided proceeding, his holiness sent an abusive letter to Philip, and then
                    summoned the clergy of France to attend a council at Rome. Philip retaliated, by
                    seizing the temporalities of those who obeyed the summons, and recalling his
                    brother Charles of Valois, who was styled the pope’s general. Sensible of the
                    danger which attended this contest, however, Philip dispatched two emissaries
                    under the pretence of conciliating differences, but in reality to levy a body of
                    troops sufficient to execute his hostile purposes against the holy father; and
                    with these he suddenly invested the pope in his native city of Anegnia; so that,
                    whilst the bull was preparing to excommunicate Philip, and release his subjects
                    from their obedience, the pope himself was obliged to surrender to the troops of
                    the prince whom he intended to anathematize. But although Boniface had been
                    delivered up to the troops of Philip through the treachery of the people of
                    Anegnia, he was no sooner taken prisoner, and reduced to distress, than they
                    rescued him from his guards, and conveyed him to Rome, where he soon afterwards
                    died of chagrin and disappointment. Benedict, his successor, revoked the
                    excommunication prepared by Boniface, and attempted to conciliate the good-will
                    of Philip; but, before this could be effected, he was himself cut off by death,
                    not without strong suspicions of poison. After the decease of Benedict, Philip
                    offered to procure the papal chair for Bertrand, archbishop of Bordeaux,
                    provided the latter would condemn the memory of Boniface, restore the honours
                    and estates of the Colonnas, which had been forfeited, allow him the tenths of
                    the clergy of France fe” five years, and 'rant other concessions which at that
                    time it was not thought proper to divulge. Bertrand complied with the terms
                    proposed by the king, and ascended the papal throne by the name of Clement V.;
                    but narrowly escaped being killed on his return from the cathedral of Lyons, by
                    the falling of a wall, by which accident the Duke of Bretagne was killed, and
                    the king and Count of Valois were considerably bruised. The new pope fixed his
                    residence at Avignon, where he punctually complied with all the conditions of
                    the treaty, except that of condemning the memory of Boniface, which, instead of
                    attainting, he vindicated with much solemnity. The condition which Philip had at
                    first concealed was discovered by the death of the emperor Albert of Austria,
                    after which he sought the assistance of Clement to place his brother Charles of
                    Valois on the imperial throne. But his holiness, apprehensive of the danger
                    which might arise from being surrounded with the powerful relations of Philip,
                    urged the diet to proceed instantly to an election, and recommended to them
                    Henry of Luxemburg as a proper person to fill the imperial throne. This scheme
                    succeeded, and the election was concluded before Philip could arrive at Avignon;
                    but, as some consolation for his disappointment, the latter took possession of
                    the city of Lyons, which had hitherto been independent, but which was now
                    induced to submit to the authority of Philip.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, Guy earl of Flanders having been abandoned by his ally Edward
                    king of England, was obliged∣ to throw himself on the clemency of the French
                    monarch, who had sent his brother, Charles of Valois, with a powerful army to
                    invade his dominions. From the latter indeed he had obtained a promise, that if
                    he could not, within a year, settle the differences subsisting between him and
                    Philip, he should be at liberty to retire and pursue whatever measures he
                    pleased. But Philip, to gratify the resentment of his queen against the captive
                    prince, detained him, with two of his sons, in close confinement; whilst he
                    himself, having entered Flanders in triumph, was everywhere received as
                    sovereign of the country, and at his departure appointed John de Chatillon, a
                    relative of the queen, as governor of the newly-acquired territory. This person,
                    however, being of a haughty and tyrannical disposition, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193514162" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4162-0015"/>treated the people so harshly
                    that an insurrection speedily broke out. The commotion, nevertheless, was not
                    general, and would have been effectually auelled by the diligence of the
                    magistrates, had not Chatilíon entered Bruges, and publicly displayed two
                    hogsheads of ropes, which he threatened to employ in the execution of the
                    inhabitants. Upon this the people flew to arms, and massacred fifteen hundred
                    French, whilst Chatillon himself escaped their fury only by swimming across the
                    town ditch. The insurgents daily gathered strength, and having assembled an army
                    of sixty thousand men, laid siege to Courtray. Here they were rashly attacked in
                    their trenches by the Count d’Artois, who met the reward of his temerity in
                    being cut off, with twenty thousand of his troops. Determined on revenge,
                    Philip, by debasing the coin of the kingdom, raised another army, and was thus
                    enabled to enter Flanders with a force which would probably have subdued the
                    whole country, had not Edward artfully communicated to the queen of France, as a
                    secret, a feigned correspondence between the French nobility and the court of
                    Rome; by which false intelligence the king was induced to abandon the enterprise
                    without performing any thing worthy of the preparations he had made. The war was
                    continued some time longer, but the attempts of Philip were constantly defeated
                    by the steady valour of the Flemings; and the only recompense Philip obtained
                    for all his trouble and expense was the city of Courtray.</p>
                <p>The other remarkable transactions of this reign were the expulsion and
                    confiscation of the estates of the Templars, who at that time enjoyed immense
                    possessions in France. These confiscations took place without any form of trial,
                    and upwards of fifty of the knights were put to death in a cruel manner. The
                    grand master, with three of his principal officers, were burned by a slow fire
                    in the presence of the king and his attendants. The whole body of these
                    unfortunate knights had been accused of the most gross and abominable
                    sensualities. The particulars were revealed, or pretended to be so, by two
                    criminals, who received their pardon for the discoveries they made; and these
                    discoveries were confirmed by the confession of the Templars themselves. But
                    this confession was afterwards retracted, as being extorted from them by the
                    fear of absolute destruction; and those who suffered asserted their purity to
                    the last; so that, on the whole, it was believed that Philip consulted his
                    avarice more than his justice by this cruel execution.</p>
                <p>The latter part of his life was embittered by domestic misfortunes. His three
                    daughters-in-law were accused of infidelity to their husbands, and, after a
                    severe examination, two of them were condemned to perpetual imprisonment, whilst
                    their paramours were flayed alive, and afterwards hung upon a gibbet, together
                    with an usher of the chamber, who had been their confidant. The uneasiness of
                    mind which Philip suffered on this account is supposed to have impaired his
                    health, and he died of a consumption in the year 1314, being the forty-seventh
                    of his age and thirtieth of his reign.</p>
                <p>On the accession of Louis surnamed the Boisterous, he found his treasury so much
                    exhausted that he was obliged to delay for some time the ceremony of his
                    coronation, and that of his queen Clemence, daughter of the king of Hungary.
                    Having found die kingdom otherwise in a distracted state, he applied himself
                    diligently to appease the discontents of his subjects, and conciliate their
                    affection by every means in his power; and in this he was assisted by his uncle
                    Charles of Valois, on whom he at length entirely devolved the government of the
                    kingdom. This regent, however, behaved with a degree of cruelty which is
                    supposed to have proved fatal to the king himself; for having put to death a
                    nobleman who had enjoyed the confidence of the former king, this act was so much
                    resented by his friends that they were thought to have administered poison to
                    the king, who expired suddenly after drinking a glass of cold water, in the
                    twenty-sixth year of his age and second of his reign. Immediately after his
                    death, Charles prepared to dispute the sovereignty with the brothers of the
                    deceased sovereign. Philip count of Poitou, the eldest brother, was at that time
                    at Rome assisting in the election of a new pope; but on his arrival in France,
                    the throne was assigned to him by the unanimous voice of the people. His
                    prospects, however, were for a short time clouded by the queen dowager Clemence
                    being delivered of a son, who has been enrolled amongst the kings of France
                    under the name of John I.</p>
                <p>The death of this infant in three weeks secured the throne to Philip. The conduct
                    of this monarch, who, on account of his stature, was surnamed the Long, proved
                    superior to that of his predecessor, who had unsuccessfully attempted to subdue
                    the Flemings, and had even suffered himself to be duped by their count. By his
                    vigorous policy Philip compelled their sovereign to consent to a peace upon
                    honourable terms. He also summoned Edward II. of England to do homage for his
                    possessions in France; but that monarch finding himself involved in difficulties
                    which rendered the visit inconvenient, sent excuses to Philip, which the latter
                    was pleased to sustain. As the French monarch had formerly taken the cross
                    during the life-time of his father, he now proposed to perform his vow; but he
                    was dissuaded by the pope himself; and, at the instance of the pontiff, he sent
                    an army into Italy to put an end to the contending factions of the Guelphs and
                    Ghibelines, who had long filled the country with violence and bloodshed. The
                    event proved unfortunate; and the disgrace was rendered the more mortifying by a
                    contagious distemper, which swept off many thousands of the French. The
                    remaining part of the reign of Philip was spent in attempting to regulate the
                    internal concerns of his kingdom. A design having been formed by his
                    predecessors of establishing a certain standard for the coin, and also of
                    weights and measures, throughout France, this was adopted by Philip, who, in
                    order the more effectually to carry it into execution, purchased from the Counts
                    of Valois, Clermont, and Bourbon, the right of coinage within their respective
                    dominions. But notwithstanding all his endeavours the scheme misgave, and having
                    failed to conciliate the affection of his subjects, he died of a fever and
                    dysentery in the year 1322, being then in the twenty-eighth year of his age and
                    sixth of his reign.</p>
                <p>By the death of Philip the crown of France devolved on his brother Charles IV.,
                    who had obtained the surname of the Fair. After settling some disputes with the
                    Duke of Burgundy, he obtained the dissolution of his marriage with Blanch, who
                    still continued in prison, and espoused Mary the daughter of Henry emperor of
                    Germany. This marriage was contracted with a view to the imperial crown, which
                    had been so long separated from that of France; and in 1325 an opportunity for
                    Charles to gratify his ambition presented itself. At that time the imperial
                    dignity was disputed between Louis of Bavaria and Frederic of Austria, the
                    latter of whom had been taken prisoner in a battle with Louis. But Pope John,
                    who entertained an implacable hatred towards Louis, fulminated sentence of
                    excommunication against him; and the king of France was induced to embark in the
                    same cause, by a promise of the spoils of Bavaria; whilst Frederic consented to
                    relinquish his pretensions. Louis, however, by instantly releasing his prisoner,
                    and dismissing him in an honourable manner, secured his friendship, and disarmed
                    his most formidable antagonist. But the pope was not to be disappointed. A
                    considerable sum of money induced Leopold, w ho had been intrusted with the
                    execution of the excommunication, to persevere in hostilities; and it was
                    determined that a new council of electors should be held in order to transfer
                    the imperial <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514175" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4175-0016"
                    />crown to Charles. In pursuit of this scheme, the ting of France set out with a
                    splendid army for the frontiers of Ger- <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> many; but
                    he soon found it impossible to attain the object of his ambition. Leopold alone
                    remained his friend, from motives of interest; the others showed the greatest
                    indifference, and even his brother in-law, the king of Bohemia, absented himself
                    from the diet; whilst in a short time the death of the queen put an end to all
                    connection with that crown. On the decease of Mary, Charles espoused Joanna,
                    daughter of the Count d’Evreux, and, to avert the calamity of an infant
                    succession, he entered into an alliance with Robert, king of Scotland, by which
                    it was provided, that should either of the sovereigns die without an heir
                    apparent, the states of the kingdom should fill the vacant throne, and the
                    survivor of the two kings should with his whole force support the legality of
                    such nomination against any other competitor. But even this proved insufficient
                    to avert the danger which now threatened the kingdom.</p>
                <p>Charles died in the year 1328, leaving his queen pregnant; and as the succession
                    depended on the fruit of the queen’s pregnancy, a regent was in the mean time
                    necessary. Two candidates accordingly appeared for this important office, urging
                    at the same time their right to the crown as well as to the regency. These were,
                    Philip of Valois, cousin-german of the deceased king; and Edward III., king of
                    England, who aspired to the throne in right of his mother, and as nephew of
                    Charles the Fair. The pretensions of the latter, however, were easily set aside,
                    and Philip was confirmed in the regency; from which, on the queen being
                    delivered of a daughter, he soon stepped on the throne, and acquired the surname
                    of Fortunate. But though the pretensions of Edward, both to the regency and the
                    crown, were rejected by the people, it was still impossible for Philip to think
                    of the claims of such a formidable rival without uneasiness. He therefore
                    summoned the English monarch to do homage for his possessions in France; and,
                    upon the latter not answering his summons, forfeited them, and seized his
                    revenues. This at last induced Edward to cross the sea and pay homage, which
                    Philip consented to receive in any form, upon condition of a proper explanation
                    being afterwards given; but as this was studiously delayed after the return of
                    the king of England, the province of Guienne was again seized by the French
                    monarch. Unwilling to lose his continental dominions, or involve himself in a
                    war for the sake of a mere ceremony, Edward sent over a formal deed, by which he
                    acknowledged that he owed liege homage to France. The flame was thus smothered
                    for the present, and would perhaps have been entirely extinguished, had it not
                    been for the intrigues of Robert of Artois, brother-in-law to the king of France
                    himself, who had been expelled his country, and had taken refuge in England. For
                    some time, indeed, neither party made any open declaration of hostility; but as
                    both monarchs possessed great sagacity, they soon penetrated each other’s
                    designs. Philip, under pretence of taking the cross, began to make great
                    preparations, strengthening himself at the same time by alliances on every side;
                    whilst Edward, determined to renew his claim to the crown of France, projected
                    the conquest of Scotland. Ί his, however, he failed to accomplish; and in the
                    mean time Philip, in order to favour die Scotch, with whom he was in alliance,
                    suffered his subjects to make irruptions into Guienne.</p>
                <p>But at length, in 1337, the war broke out in earnest. Philip having detached a
                    squadron of his fleet against the Infidels, employed the rest, consisting
                    chiefly of Genoese vessels, against the English. In this contest the Flemings,
                    whose aid was of importance, were courted by both parties. Louis count of
                    Flanders declared for Philip, but his subjects were more inclined to Edward.
                    James ArteviUe, a brewer, the most able and artful man in the country, governed
                    them at that time as if he had been their prince; and as the advantages arising
                    from the English commerce determined him in favour of Edward, that prince, at
                    his request, embarked with a numerous army for Sluys, where he arrived in 1338.
                    Upon his landing it was resolved that the German princes in alliance with him
                    should act against France. But for this a pretext was wanting. The vassals of
                    the empire could not act by Edward’s orders, nor even as his allies, without
                    directions from the emperor, and he was in league with France. This difficulty,
                    however, was soon overcome. The French had made themselves masters of Cambray,
                    and the emperor resolved that it should be retaken. With this view he created
                    Edward vicar-general of the empire; an empty title, but one which seemed to give
                    him a right to command the services of the princes of Germany. The Flemings, who
                    were vassals of France, likewise pretended scruples at invading the territories
                    of their liege lord; but, to allay these, Edward, by the advice of Arte-ville,
                    assumed the title of king of France, and in virtue of this claim challenged
                    their assistance to dethrone Philip of Valois, the usurper of his kingdom. Such
                    a step, which could scarcely fail to beget endless jealousies and animosities,
                    Edward did not take without hesitation; and from this time may be dated the
                    commencement of that animosity which the English have until very recently borne
                    towards the French. Edward’s first attempt was upon the city of Cambray, to
                    which he laid siege; but in a short time he was prevailed upon by Robert of
                    Artois to raise the siege and march into Picardy, which he entered with an army
                    of about fifty thousand men, composed chiefly of foreigners. Philip came in
                    sight with an army of nearly a hundred thousand men, composed chiefly of native
                    subjects; and it was daily expected that a battle would ensue. But the English
                    monarch was averse to engage against a force so greatly superior; and Philip
                    thought it sufficient to elude the attacks of his enemy, without running any
                    unnecessary hazard. The two armies faced each other for several days, and mutual
                    defiances were exchanged; but Edward at last retired into Flanders, and
                    dispersed his army. Such was the fruitless and almost ridiculous conclusion of
                    Edward’s first expedition, which had plunged him into the greatest difficulties.
                    He had contracted nearly L.300,000 of debt; he had anticipated all his revenue;
                    he had pledged every thing of value which belonged either to himself or his
                    queen; and he was obliged in some measure even to pawn himself to his creditors,
                    by desiring their permission to go over to England in order to procure supplies,
                    and by promising on his word of honour to return in person if he did not remit
                    their money. On his arrival in England, however, he obtained a large supply,
                    sufficient to enable him to make all the necessary preparations for a new
                    invasion; and so certain were the English that France would now be conquered,
                    that the parliament, before Edward’s departure, protested that they owed him no
                    obedience as king of France, and that the two kingdoms must remain for every
                    distinct and independent.</p>
                <p>The king of England set out on his second expedition with a fleet of two hundred
                    and forty vessels. Philip had prepared a fleet of four hundred vessels, manned
                    with forty thousand men; which he stationed off Sluys, in order to intercept
                    Edward on his passage. The two fleets met on the 13th of June 1340; but the
                    English, either by the superior abilities of Edward, or the greater dexterity of
                    his seamen, gained the wind of the enemy, and with this advantage began the
                    action. The battle was fierce and bloody. The English archers, whose force and
                    address were now much celebrated, galled the French on their approach; and when
                    the ships grappled together, the example of the king and his nobility so
                    animated the seamen and soldiers, that they maintained everywhere a superiority
                    over the enemy. Meanwhile the Flemings observing the battle, hurried <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193514188" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4188-0017"/> out or their
                    ports, and brought a reinforcement to the English, which contributed to decide
                    the fate of the action. Two hundred and thirty ships were taken, and thirty
                    thousand Frenchmen, including two of their admirals, were killed; whilst the
                    loss of the English was inconsiderable compared to the greatness and importance
                    of the victory. After this brilliant victory Edward landed his forces and laid
                    siege to Tournay. Philip marched to its relief with a numerous army, but acted
                    with so much caution that Edward found himself in a manner blocked up in his
                    camp. At length the Countess Dowager of Hainault, sister of Philip, and
                    mother-in-law of Edw^ard, interposed with so much spirit and address, that she
                    engaged all parties to agree to a truce for a year, and might perhaps have
                    brought about a peace if she had survived.</p>
                <p>In 1341, however, Edward’s ambition was once more excited by the invitation of
                    the Count de Montfort, who had possessed himself of the province of Bretagne,
                    and applied to Edward to second his claims. An offer of this kind entirely
                    coincided with Edward’s views. He was happy in the promised assistance of
                    Montfort, which thus opened to him an entrance into the heart of France. But
                    this flattering prospect was for a time damped by the imprisonment of Montfort,
                    who, on the discovery of his intentions, was besieged in the city of Nantes, and
                    taken prisoner. But Jane of Flanders, his wife, courageously undertook to
                    support the falling fortunes of her family. Having assembled the inhabitants of
                    Rennes, where she then resided, she appeared before them carrying her infant son
                    in her arms, and having deplored her misfortunes, attempted to inspire the
                    citizens with an affection for her cause. The inhabitants of Nantes instantly
                    espoused her interests, and all the other fortresses of Bretagne embraced the
                    same resolution. The king of England being apprised of her exertions, was
                    entreated to send succour with all possible expedition to the town of Hennebone,
                    in which place she had resolved to sustain the attack of the enemy. Charles de
                    Blois, Philip’s general, anxious to make himself master of so important a
                    fortress as Hennebone, and still more to take the countess prisoner, sat down
                    before the place with a large army, and conducted the siege with indefatigable
                    industry. But the defence was not less vigorous than the attack, and several
                    sallies were made by the garrison, in which the countess herself led the
                    assailants. But at length the besiegers made several breaches in the walls, and
                    a general assault was hourly expected. A capitulation was therefore proposed,
                    and a conference already commenced, when the countess, who had ascended a high
                    tower, and was looking with great impatience towards the sea, descried some
                    ships in the distance, and, immediately exclaiming that reinforcements had
                    arrived, forbade any further ne-ciation. Nor was she disappointed. The fleet
                    which she</p>
                <p>I descried carried a body of English gentlemen, with six thousand archers, whom
                    Edward had prepared for the relief of Hennebone, but who had been long detained
                    by contrary winds. This seasonable relief entered the harbour under the conduct
                    of Sir Walter Manny, one of the most gallant commanders of his time, and served
                    to keep up the spirits of the Bretons until the expiration of the truce, when
                    Edward would be at liberty to renew the war in regular form.</p>
                <p>The succours under Sir Walter Manny were speedily followed by a more considerable
                    reinforcement commanded by Robert of Artois, who soon after his arrival made
                    himself master of Vannes; but the French speedily recovered that city, and
                    Robert was compelled to relinquish his prize after receiving a mortal wound.
                    Edward, eager to revenge the death of his ally, soon landed at Morbihan, near
                    Vannes, at the head of an army of twelve thousand men; and with this small force
                    he undertook at once the siege of Vannes, Nantes, and Rennes; but having divided
                    his troops, he failed in every enterprise, and gave John duke of Normandy, the
                    king of France’s eldest son, an opportunity of besieging him in his camp. In
                    this situation his provisions began to fail; and, notwithstanding all his
                    valour, Edward would have been obliged to surrender, had he not, by a train of
                    artful negotiations, induced Philip to relinquish the advantage he had obtained,
                    and consent to a truce of three years, which was brought about by the mediation
                    of the court of Rome.</p>
                <p>Philip now endeavoured to secure himself against the power of his rival by
                    alliances, and by purchasing the city of Montpellier from the king of Majorca.
                    But in the mean time the English, under the command of the Earl of Derby,
                    invaded Guienne, and, having twice defeated the French army, commanded by the
                    Count de Lisle, made themselves masters of a great number of towns. Philip, by
                    reason of the exhausted state of his treasury, was for some time incapable of
                    making any opposition; and, to recruit his finances, he was obliged to impose a
                    duty on salt, which gave great offence to his subjects. But when these
                    discontents were allayed, he soon raised an army of a hundred thousand men,
                    whose courage was excited by the presence of the Dukes of Normandy and Burgundy.
                    The English general was therefore compelled to act on the defensive, and one
                    fortress after another surrendered to the French, until at length the total
                    extinction of the power of England upon the Continent appeared inevitable. In
                    this situation Edward resolved to bring relief in person to his distressed
                    subjects and allies; and accordingly embarked in 1346, at Southampton, on board
                    a fleet of near a thousand sail. Besides the chief nobility of England, he
                    carried along with him his eldest son the prince of Wales, afterwards surnamed
                    the <hi rend="italic">Black Prince,</hi> from the colour of his armour, a youth
                    of about fifteen years old, and already remarkable for understanding and valour
                    far above his age. His army, which consisted of four thousand men at arms, ten
                    thousand archers, ten thousand Welsh infantry, and six thousand Irish, were all
                    landed in safety at La Hogue, a port in Normandy. The intelligence of Edward’s
                    landing, and the devastation caused by his troops, who dispersed themselves over
                    the whole country, soon spread consternation in the French court. The rich city
                    of Caen was taken and plundered by the English; the villages and towns as far as
                    Paris shared the same fate; and the French had no other resource but to break
                    down the bridges, in order to check the advance of the invader. In the mean time
                    Philip was not idle in making preparations to oppose the enemy. Having stationed
                    one of his generals, Godemar de Faye, with an army on the opposite side of the
                    river Somme, which Edward had to cross, whilst he himself, at the head of a
                    hundred and twenty thousand fighting men, advanced to give the English battle,
                    he so hemmed in Edward that the latter found himself exposed to the danger of
                    being enclosed and starved in an enemy’s country. In this dilemma he offered a
                    large reward to any one who should bring him information of a passage across the
                    river Somme; and a peasant of the country, named Gobin Agace, having discovered
                    a ford, Edward had just time to get his whole army across the river, when Philip
                    appeared in his rear. A battle ensued, in which the French were overthrown with
                    great slaughter, and which, under the name of Crescy, the place where it was
                    fought, is equally memorable in the annals of England and France. Edward next
                    laid siege to Calais, which was then defended by John de Vienne, an experienced
                    commander, and supplied with every thing necessary for defence; but it was
                    nevertheless taken, after a twelvemonth’s siege, the defenders having been
                    reduced to the last extremity by fatigue and famine.</p>
                <p>From the beginning of this unfortunate war, Philip had invariably showed himself
                    desirous of peace, and the victory of Crescy rendered him still more so. Edward
                    also, notwithstanding<pb break="no" facs="nls:193514201"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4201-0018"/> his successes, found himself unable any longer to
                    support the expenses of the war. The mediation of ’ the court of Rome was
                    therefore readily accepted, and a truce for three years concluded. At the same
                    time, Philip met with some recompense for the losses he had sustained, by the
                    acquisition of Dauphiné, which afterwards gave the title of Dauphin to the
                    eldest son of the king of France. The subsequent events of his reign are
                    unimportant, and he expired in the year 1350, at the age of fifty-seven.</p>
                <p>• On the death of Philip, his eldest son John took possession of the kingdom; but
                    scarcely was he seated on the throne when he disgusted his nobility by a most
                    unseasonable act of severity. Robert de Brienne, count of Eu and Guisnes, had
                    been taken prisoner by the king of England at Caen, and, under pretence of
                    negotiating his ransom, had passed several times between France and England; but
                    being accused of maintaining a treasonable correspondence with Edward, he was
                    suddenly arrested, condemned, and beheaded, without any form of trial. At his
                    death he is said to have confessed his treasonable practices, but this has not
                    been authenticated by any historian of credit. Having been constable of France,
                    the sword, the badge of his office, was delivered to Charles de la Carda; but
                    the fate of the latter was not less unfortunate than that of his predecessor,
                    inasmuch as he was soon afterwards assassinated by Charles king of Navarre,
                    surnamed The Wicked. This prince, celebrated for his personal qualifications,
                    but detested for his crimes, was the son-in-law of John. He had demanded the
                    duchy of Angoulême of the king; but as the latter had thought proper to bestow
                    it upon Carda, he sought to revenge himself by assassinating his rival. John did
                    not fail to show a proper resentment; but such was the weakness of his
                    government, that the king of Navarre set him at defiance, and would not even
                    condescend to go through the ceremony of asking pardon until John had sent him
                    his second son as an hostage for his personal security. To these offences the
                    king of Navarre added another still more atrocious, namely, that of aiming at
                    the crown of France, to which, as grandson by the female side to Louis the
                    Boisterous, he pretended a title in right of his mother. But his more immediate
                    demand was that the countries of Champagne and Brie should be given up to him.
                    To obviate all difficulties on this head, however, John bestowed the duchy of
                    Normandy on his eldest son Charles, and commanded him to seize the estates of
                    the king of Navarre; upon which the latter soon made his appearance at Faris,
                    and John found himself obliged to appease his opposition at the expense of a
                    hundred thousand crowns.</p>
                <p>During all this time the truce with England had been but ill observed on both
                    sides; the French had possessed themselves of the port of St Jean d’Angeli, and
                    the English had surprised the town of Guisnes. The rival houses of Montfort and
                    Blois also indulged their animosities, whilst Edward continued to threaten war.
                    The king of Navarre also persevered in his intrigues, and even the dauphin was
                    drawn into a confederacy against his father; but John, being informed of their
                    machinations, found means to defeat them. The dauphin was reclaimed by pointing
                    out to him the impropriety of his conduct, and the disadvantage which must
                    unavoidably ensue to himself from the connections which he had formed. The king
                    of Navarre, with his principal adherents, were invited to an entertainment,
                    where they were unexpectedly arrested; the former being sent prisoner to Chateau
                    Gaillard, and several of the most obnoxious of the latter put to death. But the
                    rest of the conspirators, instead of being dismayed by this check, immediately
                    broke out in open rebellion; and finding themselves unable to gain their point
                    without further assistance, they immediately invited Edward to come over from
                    England.</p>
                <p>That warlike and enterprising monarch had never lost sight of the object which he
                    had originally contemplated; and on the expiration of the truce had sent his
                    son, the prince of Wales, surnamed the Black Prince, with a squadron towards the
                    coast of France. With this force the prince entered the mouth of the Garonne,
                    burned the towns and villages of Languedoc, and then retired with his plunder
                    into the country of Guienne, whilst Edward himself, who had likewise passed over
                    to the Continent, wasted the country as far as St Omer; but the French king,
                    notwithstanding all these provocations, determined to avoid a battle, and
                    accordingly prohibited his general, the constable of Bourbon, from coming to an
                    engagement, though his army was much superior to that of the prince of Wales.
                    With the flower of his troops, however, he pursued Edward from St Omer to
                    Hesdin, where he defied him to a pitched battle; but the latter, without minding
                    his bravadoes, continued his march towards Calais, whence he embarked for
                    England. After his departure, John called an assembly of the states at Paris,
                    where he explained the distressed situation of his finances, and showed so fully
                    the necessity of their assisting him in the defence of the kingdom, that they
                    consented to maintain an army of thirty thousand men during the war. To supply
                    the other exigencies of government, they revived the duty upon salt, and added a
                    variety of other imposts; but at the same time appointed a committee of their
                    own number to take care that the money should be strictly appropriated to the
                    public service. But the satisfaction which John received from these grants, and
                    from the suppression of some disturbances which happened about this time, was
                    soon overcast by the news that the prince of Wales had marched with an army of
                    twelve thousand men from Bordeaux, and, after ravaging the Agenois, Quercy, and
                    the Limousin, had entered the province of Berry. The young warrior had
                    penetrated into the heart of France with this trifling body of forces, in hopes
                    of joining the Duke of Lancaster in Guienne. But he soon found that his scheme
                    was impracticable. The country before him was teo well guarded to permit him to
                    advance further; and all the bridges behind were broken down, which effectually
                    barred a retreat. In this embarrassing situation his perplexity was increased by
                    being informed that the king of France was actually marching at the head of
                    sixty thousand men to intercept him. He at first thought of retreating; but soon
                    finding it impossible to retrograde, he determined calmly to wait the approach
                    of the enemy, and, notwithstanding the disparity of forces, to commit all to the
                    hazard of a battle.</p>
                <p>At a place called Maupertuis, near Poitiers, both armies arrived in sight of each
                    other. The French king might easily have starved the English into terms; but
                    such was the impatient valour of the French nobility, and such their confidence
                    of success, that it might have been equally fatal to attempt repressing their
                    ardour to engage. In the mean time, whilst both armies were drawn up in'order of
                    battle, and expecting the signal to advance, they were stopped by the appearance
                    of the Cardinal of Perigord, who attempted to act as mediator between them. But
                    as John, who made himself sure of victory, would listen to no terms which did
                    not include the restitution of Calais, the Black Prince refused to listen to
                    such a proposition, and the combat was deferred till the next morning, for which
                    both sides waited in anxious suspense. During this interval the young prince
                    strengthened his position with new intrenchments, and placed three hundred men
                    in ambush, with as many archers, who were commanded to attack the enemy in flank
                    during the heat of the engagement. Having taken these precautions to ensure
                    success, he drew up his army in three divisions; the van commanded by the Earl
                    of Warwick, the rear by the Earls of Salisbury and Suffolk, and the main body by
                    himself. The king of France also arranged his forces in three divisions; the
                    first commanded by the Duke of Orleans, and the second by the dauphin, attended
                    by <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514214" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4214-0019"/>his younger
                    brothers, whilst he himself directed the main body, seconded by his youngest
                    son, then about fourteen years of age. As the English could be attacked only by
                    marching along a narrow defile, the French suffered greatly from the English
                    archers, who were posted on each side behind the hedges. Nor were they in a
                    better situation upon emerging from this pass, being met by the Black Prince
                    himself at the head of a chosen body of troops, who made a furious onset upon
                    their troops, already in great disorder. A dreadful overthrow ensued. Those who
                    were as yet in the defile recoiled upon their own forces; whilst the English
                    troops who had been placed in an ambush took the opportunity, by a flank attack,
                    to increase the confusion and confirm the victory. The dauphin and the Duke of
                    Orleans were amongst the first who fled. The king of France himself made great
                    efforts to retrieve by valour what rashness had forfeited; but his courage was
                    unable to check that panic which had now become general throughout his army; and
                    his cavalry soon flying, he found himself exposed to the whole fury of the
                    enemy. At length, overpowered with fatigue, and despairing of success, he
                    thought of yielding himself a prisoner, and frequently cried out that he was
                    ready to deliver himself to his cousin the prince of Wales. But the honour of
                    taking him was reserved for a more ignoble hand; he was seized by Dennis de
                    Morbec, a knight of Arras, who had been obliged to fly from his country for
                    murder.</p>
                <p>This defeat, which happened in the year 1356, almost entirely ruined the French
                    affairs; and the miseries which ensued were greatly augmented by internal
                    commotions. The dauphin, who had now assumed the government, was altogether
                    unfit to govern a turbulent and seditious people at a crisis like this. An
                    assembly of the states, which he called, took the opportunity to limit the power
                    of the prince, to impeach the former ministers, and to demand the liberty of the
                    king of Navarre; and the treasurer of the crown was basely murdered by one
                    Marcel, a partisan of that worthless prince, who had filled the city of Paris
                    with confusion by his intrigues. The public disorders were also augmented by the
                    escape of the king of Navarre; and, though the dauphin was even assured that
                    this royal ruffian had administered poison to him, he was nevertheless obliged
                    to pay him some appearance of regard. A scheme was even formed by the chiefs of
                    the sedition to change the government, to vest all the power in the commons, and
                    to leave the king no more than an empty title; but though this was favourably
                    received by the city of Paris, the other cities of the kingdom refused to concur
                    in the project. The dauphin was likewise recognised as regent by the
                    states-general, and the inhabitants of Picardy and Champagne took up arms in his
                    cause. In this disastrous state of affairs, the miseries of the people were
                    heightened by a new and unexpected evil. The peasants, who had all along been
                    oppressed by the nobles, were now treated in such a manner that, having risen in
                    great numbers to revenge themselves, the castles of the nobility were razed to
                    the ground, their wives and daughters ravished, and themselves put to the most
                    cruel torments. At last they were obliged to arm in their own defence. The Duke
                    of Orleans cut off ten thousand of the insurgents in the neighbourhood of Paris;
                    twelve thousand were massacred by the king of Navarre; and nine thousand who had
                    laid siege to the town of Meaux, where the dauphiness and three other ladies of
                    ,the first rank resided, were routed and pursued with dreadful slaughter by an
                    officer in the service of Edward. Amidst these confusions, Marcel, the seditious
                    leader already mentioned, perished in a tumult of his own raising; and the most
                    virtuous and prudent people of the nation supported the pretensions of the
                    dauphin. But his most dangerous enemy was the king of Navarre, who had enticed
                    to his standard numbers of those Norman and English adventurers who had followed
                    Edward into France, and remained there to seek their fortunes, having associated
                    themselves under the name of the <hi rend="italic">Companions.</hi> By this
                    formidable competitor the dauphin was reduced almost to the last extremity, when
                    his hopes were revived by an unexpected proposal of peace upon equitable and
                    moderate terms. Historians in general have ascribed this to the natural levity
                    of the king of Navarre; but some have been of opinion that he acted from
                    prudential motives, and that he justly supposed it would be more easy to deal
                    with the dauphin, who was his own kinsman, and humbled by so many misfortunes,
                    than with a haughty and imperious conqueror like Edward.</p>
                <p>On the expiration of the truce in the year 1359, Edward, having again set sail
                    for France, anchored before Calais with a fleet of eleven hundred sail, assumed
                    the title of King of France, and augmented his army to a hundred thousand men.
                    The dauphin, finding himself unable to oppose so great a force, was obliged to
                    act upon the defensive; and having chosen the city of Paris as his station, he
                    allowed the English to ravage the open country. Thus they were suffered to
                    penetrate through Picardy into Champagne; but the city of Rheims, where Edward
                    designed to have been crowned king of France, baffled his utmost efforts. From
                    Champagne, therefore, which had already been laid waste, the English monarch
                    marched into Burgundy, pillaging Tonnere, Gaillon, and Avalon. Burgundy was
                    saved by the payment of a hundred thousand merks, and an equal sum was paid for
                    Nivernois. At last, after a long and destructive march, Edward arrived at the
                    gates of Paris; but the prudence of the dauphin and the citizens had rendered it
                    impregnable to the attacks of famine as well as the assaults of an army. The war
                    proceeded, however, till the year 1360, when the king of England showed himself
                    inclined for peace. Notwithstanding all the victories he had gained, the French
                    nation evinced not the least favour to his claim of succession; the king of
                    Navarre was a dangerous rival; and the caution of the dauphin, in avoiding an
                    engagement, deprived him of the advantages he expected from his valour and
                    military skill. Conferences for a peace were accordingly opened at Bre-tigny in
                    the Chartraine, and it was at last concluded, on the conditions that King John
                    should pay for his ransom, at different periods, three millions of crowns of
                    gold, or about a million and a half of our money; and that Edward should for
                    ever renounce all claim to the kingdom of France, and remain possessed of the
                    territories of Poitou, Xaintonge, l ’ Agenois, Perigord, the Limousin, Quercy,
                    Rouvergne, l’Angoumois, and other districts in that quarter, together with
                    Calais, Guisnes, Montreuil, and the county of Ponthieu. Some other stipulations
                    were also made in favour of the allies of England, as a security for the
                    execution of these conditions. But, upon John’s return to his dominions, he
                    found himself unable to ratify the terms of peace which had just been concluded.
                    At the head of an exhausted state, his soldiers were without discipline, and his
                    peasants without subordination. The latter had in fact risen in great numbers,
                    and one of their chiefs had assumed the title of The Friend of God and the
                    Terror of Man, A citizen of Sens, named John Gouge, also got himself
                    acknowledged king, by means of his robberies, and soon caused almost as many
                    calamities by his depredations as the real king had brought on by his
                    misfortunes. Such was the state of France on the return of its captive monarch;
                    yet so incredible was his absurdity, that he had scarcely been replaced on the
                    throne when he prepared for a crusade into the Holy Land. But this folly was
                    prevented by the exhausted state of the country, and the misery of the people,
                    who, in fact, were even unable to pa; the king’s ransom. In these circumstances,
                    however, th« conduct of John was truly noble. “Though good faith <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193514227" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4227-0020"/>should be banished from the
                    rest of the earth,” said he, ' “yet she ought still to retain her habitation in
                    the breasts of kings.” He accordingly returned once more to' England, and
                    yielded himself a prisoner, since he could not be honourably free. It has indeed
                    been said by some, that his passion for the Countess of Salisbury was the real
                    cause of his journey; but there seems to be no foundation for a report so
                    injurious to his honour. During his captivity he resided in the Savoy, and
                    afterwards closed a long and unfortunate reign by his death, which happened in
                    the year 1364.</p>
                <p>Charles, surnamed the Prudent, succeeded his father upon the throne of France;
                    and by a finely-conducted policy, even though he suffered some defeats, restored
                    his country once more to tranquillity and power. He dispersed a horde of
                    banditti, who having associated themselves under the name of Companions, had
                    long been a terror to the peaceable inhabitants. He had them even enrolled into
                    a body, and led them into the kingdom of Castille against Peter, surnamed the
                    Cruel, whom his subjects had dethroned, and who, by means of an alliance with
                    the English, endeavoured to get himself reinstated in power. The consequence
                    was, that the English and French again came to an engagement; the army of the
                    former being commanded by the Black Prince, and that of the latter by Henry of
                    Transtamarre, and Bertrand du Guesclin, one of the most consummate generals and
                    accomplished men of the age in which he lived. The usual good fortune of the
                    English prince however prevailed, and the French lost above twenty thousand men,
                    whilst only four knights and forty private men were slain on the side of the
                    English. Nevertheless these victories were attended with but little effect. The
                    English, by frequent levies, had become quite exhausted, and were unable to
                    continue an army in the field. Charles, on the other hand, cautiously avoided
                    coming to a decisive engagement, but contented himself with allowing his enemies
                    to waste their strength in attempts to plunder a fortified country; and when
                    they retired, he then sallied forth, possessing himself of such places as they
                    were not strong enough to defend. He first fell upon Ponthieu; the citizens of
                    Abbeville opened their gates to receive him; those of St Valois, Rue, and
                    Crotoy, imitated the example; and the whole country was in a little time reduced
                    to submission. The southern provinces were in the same manner invaded by his
                    generals with equal success; whilst the Black Prince, destitute of supplies from
                    England, and wasted by a cruel disorder, was obliged to return to his native
                    country, leaving affairs in the south of France in a desperate condition. In
                    this exigency the resentment of the king of England was excited to the utmost
                    pitch, and he resolved to take signal vengeance on his enemies of the Continent.
                    But the fortunate occasion had now passed, and all his succeeding designs were
                    unsuccessful. The Earl of Pembroke and his whole army were intercepted at sea,
                    and taken prisoners, by Henry king of Castille. Sir Robert Knolles, at the head
                    of thirty thousand men, was defeated by Bertrand du Guesclin; and the Duke of
                    Lancaster, at the head of twenty-five thousand men, had the mortification of
                    seeing his troops diminished without even coming to a battle. At length, when
                    the affairs of the English were totally ruined by the death of the Black Prince
                    and of King Edward, the armies of Charles attacked the English on all sides.
                    One, under the command of the Duke of Burgundy, entered Artois; another, under
                    the command of the Duke of Berry, penetrated into Auvergne; that which acted in
                    Guienne was commanded by the Duke of Anjou; the forces in Bretagne were under
                    the constable Guesclin; and the king put himself at the head of a powerful body
                    of troops, that he might be able to repair any accident to which the chance of
                    war might give rise. The constable having found it difficult to oppose Sir
                    Thomae Felton and the seneschal of Bordeaux, was joined by the Duke of Burgundy,
                    and soon afterwards attacked and defeated both, making them prisoners of war. At
                    the close of the campaign of 1377, Bayonne and Bordeaux, with the surrounding
                    districts, and the fortress of Calais with its dependencies, were all that
                    England had now left on the Continent. But Charles having thus once more
                    established the house of Valois on the throne of France, did not long live to
                    enjoy his good fortune. He died in the year 1379, at the age of forty-four, in
                    consequence of the poison formerly administered to him by the king of Navarre,
                    and the immediate operation of which had been suspended by the skill of a
                    physician sent by the emperor Charles IV.</p>
                <p>Charles V. was succeeded by his son Charles VI. sur-∣ named the Well-beloved,
                    who, at the time of his accession to the throne, was only twelve years of age.
                    The Duke of Anjou, eldest brother to the late king, had been appointed guardian
                    during the minority of the prince; but being totally unfit for the office, and
                    distinguished only for his ambition and rapacity, he resigned his charge to the
                    Dukes of Burgundy and Bourbon, the former being uncle to the king by his
                    father’s side, the latter by his mother’s. None of these tutors, however, proved
                    faithful to the trust reposed in them. At this time Joan, infamous for her
                    profligacy, reigned in Naples, where she had appointed one Charles Durazzo, her
                    relation, to succeed her on the throne; but the inhuman wretch murdered his
                    benefactress, who with her last breath revoked her grant of the kingdom to him,
                    and bestowed it upon the Duke of Anjou. The influence of the latter at the
                    French court enabled him to waste the treasures of the kingdom in support of his
                    pretensions; but he proved ultimately unsuccessful, his forces having been
                    defeated, and his designs frustrated, by the superior skill of his adversary.
                    Meanwhile the citizens of Paris, oppressed with taxes, broke out into tumults,
                    and were with difficulty quelled; and the mal-administration of the duke soon
                    involved the nation in hostilities with the Flemings, whose country he invaded
                    at the head of an army of eighty thousand men, accompanied by the young king and
                    by the principal nobility of France. The first operations of the war were
                    favourable to the Flemings; but they were at length totally defeated on the
                    banks of the river Lis, where their leader, with twenty-five thousand men,
                    perished in the field. This victory was followed by the submission of the whole
                    country; but the satisfaction which this event afforded the king was disturbed
                    by new seditions and revolts in Paris and other great towns. His return,
                    however, at the head of a victorious army soon reduced them to their duty, and
                    several of the revolted cities were severely punished; at the same time that the
                    death of the Duke of Anjou having freed him from the immediate dependence on his
                    tutors, enabled him to assume the reins of government, in the year 1384.</p>
                <p>The genius which Charles displayed in his early years raised the hopes of the
                    nation; but these were soon overcast, and greater misfortunes than any which had
                    yet occurred were in reserve. His administration was for some time prudent and
                    vigorous. He conciliated the affections of his people by restoring their
                    privileges, punishing their oppressors, and relieving them from the taxes which
                    had been imposed in his minority. He compelled the Flemings to submit to the
                    authority of his uncle the Duke of Burgundy, and detached fifteen thousand
                    archers and fifteen hundred men-at-arms to assist the Scotch in their incursions
                    into England. Lastly, in 1385 he fitted out a mighty armament against England. A
                    vast fleet assembled in the harbour of Sluys, and a numerous army was collected
                    in the neighbourhood. According to some writers, the armament consisted of
                    twelve hundred ships, twenty thousand foot variously armed, twenty thousand
                    cavalry, and twenty <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514240"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4240-0021"/>thousand cross-bow men. There was besides a vast
                    wooden edifice or floating town, which had been contrived for the • protection
                    of the soldiers when landed. But all these preparations came to nothing through
                    the obstinacy of the Duke of Berry, who, having been originally opposed to the
                    expedition, conducted his part of the armament so slowly that he did not arrive
                    at Sluys till the middle of September, when the season was too far advanced, and
                    an invasion impracticable. In addition to this, a storm which happened soon
                    afterwards drove the greater part of the fleet on shore, and beat down the
                    wooden edifice, and completely shipwrecked the whole project.</p>
                <p>But the destruction of the French fleet was only a prelude to calamities of a
                    more extraordinary description. The Sieur de Craon, a profligate nobleman,
                    having been intrusted by the court of France with a considerable sum destined
                    for the support of the Duke of Anjou during his Italian expedition, had
                    dissipated this money at Venice; but, by the credit of the Duke of Orleans, the
                    king’s brother, he had obtained his pardon, and even returned to court, where he
                    sought to gratify his private resentment by the assassination of the constable
                    Oliver Clisson, whom he suspected of having promoted his disgrace. The latter
                    was attacked on his return from the Hôtel de St Pol, by a band of twenty
                    ruffians, against whom he defended himself with wonderful intrepidity, but at
                    last fell, after receiving more than fifty wounds. Happily, however, the veteran
                    recovered from his wounds; and the assassin, in order to screen himself from
                    vengeance, fled for protection to the Duke of Bretagne. The king demanded the
                    surrender of Craon; and the duke having professed that he knew nothing of him,
                    he marched with all his forces into Bretagne. But when the army had arrived at
                    Mons, the king was seized with a slow fever, during which he became delirious,
                    and killed several persons with his own hand. When the excitement subsided he
                    fell down and lay as if he had been dead; upon which he was taken up, bound in a
                    waggon, and carried back to Mons, where he lay two days in a lethargy, from
                    which he recovered a little, and expressed great sorrow on account of the blood
                    he had shed in his delirium. But it was soon discovered that he no longer
                    possessed that strength of judgment and understanding for which he had formerly
                    been remarkable; and hence a regency became indispensably necessary. The
                    competition for this office brought to light the characters of the queen and the
                    Duke of Orleans, which had not hitherto been displayed to public view. The
                    former was a beautiful and accomplished princess, but vindictive, suspicious,
                    and intriguing, insensible to natural affection, but easily accessible to
                    flattery, and ready to yield to every impulse of lawless passion. The latter was
                    equally remarkable for personal accomplishments, and had married Valentina,
                    daughter of the Duke of Milan; but his engagements with that princess did not
                    prevent him from engaging in a number of licentious amours, and amongst the
                    rest, as was supposed, with his sister-in-law Isabelle. During the king’s
                    illness he openly aspired to the regency; but his pretensions were overruled by
                    the stetes, and the administration of affairs for the present conferred on the
                    Duke of Burgundy. In a few months indeed the health and understanding of the
                    king seemed to be sufficiently restored; but in the year 1393 it was again
                    disturbed by a sudden alarm, which occasioned a relapse, and he continued
                    delirious at intervals as long as he lived. During his lucid intervals Charles
                    frequently assumed the government into his own hands; and as the war with
                    England still continued, though in a languid manner, the French monarch in one
                    of those intervals of reason had an interview with Richard of England, in order
                    to put an end to hostilities. But their respective claims were so difficult of
                    adjustment, that, as an intermediate arrangement, Aey concluded a truce for
                    twenty-five years; during which time it was hoped that a lasting peace might be
                    established. Richard gave up Cherbourg to Charles, and Brest to the Duke of
                    Bretagne; and a marriage was also concluded between the king of England and
                    Isabelle the daughter of Charles, but, by reason of the tender age of the
                    princess, this marriage was never consummated. During this reign France was
                    still further weakened by the succours sent to the Hungarians against the Turks.
                    On this expedition upwards of one thousand of the bravest and most experienced
                    knights were sent under the conduct of John count of Nevers, eldest son of the
                    Duke of Burgundy; the Count of Eu, constable of France; John de Vienne, admiral
                    of France; and the Count of Marche, a prince of the blood royal; together with
                    De Courcy, one of the most experienced captains in Christendom. But the prudent
                    counsels of this veteran were not obeyed by the youthful warriors by whom he was
                    accompanied, and who, having attacked the enemy rashly, whilst heated with wine,
                    were all either killed or taken prisoners. Notwithstanding this disaster,
                    however, assistance was in the year 1400 sent to Wances-laus, emperor of
                    Germany; and the Duke of Orleans, who commanded the army on this occasion,
                    acquitted himself so well that he acquired the duchy of Luxembourg for himself,
                    and left his ally satisfied.</p>
                <p>But whilst the friendship of France was thus courted by foreign powers, the
                    kingdom itself was in the most miserable situation. The king’s distemper daily
                    gained ground; and the discordant interests of the contending parties kept the
                    whole nation in a ferment. The most violent animosity broke out between the
                    Dukes of Orleans and Burgundy. The former, by means of his interest with the
                    queen, and the ascendency which his duchess possessed over the king, had for
                    some time got the advantage of his rival, and was made lieutenant-general and
                    governor of the kingdom; but presuming on his power to levy new imposts on the
                    people, and oppress the churchmen, whom in that age he ought to have
                    conciliated, he was deprived of his authority, and obliged to yield to the Duke
                    of Burgundy. For some time, however, these powerful rivals were kept within some
                    bounds by the mediation of the Duke of Bourbon, the only grandee who appears to
                    have maintained a pure and unspotted character; but by his death in 1404, the
                    unhappy nation was left totally exposed to their relentless fury. In 1405 the
                    queen and the Duke of Orleans again seized on the administration, which,
                    however, they were soon deprived ofby the unanimous voice of the people. During
                    this period Charles and his children were neglected and abandoned to distress;
                    but they were relieved by the Duke of Burgundy on his obtaining the regency,
                    whilst Isabelle and the Duke of Orleans were obliged to retire from Milan. But a
                    sudden return of the king’s reason now deprived both parties of power, and the
                    administration was vested in the queen and a council composed of princes of the
                    blood. The rival dukes being thus prevented from interfering in public affairs,
                    exercised themselves in committing hostilities against the English, with whom
                    the truce had lately been concluded. They were encouraged to commit this
                    infraction of the treaty by the unsettled situation of affairs under Henry IV.;
                    but their attempts having proved unsuccessful, the truce was renewed after
                    obtaining the restoration of the princess, who, as has already been mentioned,
                    had been betrothed to Richard II. The failure of their enterprises produced a
                    new scene of discord between the dukes, and led to mutual recriminations. By the
                    interposition of the Duke of Berry they were apparently reconciled; but the Duke
                    of Burgundy pretended friendship only in order to take a more signal vengeance,
                    to which he was now inflamed by jealousy as well as by political animosity. The
                    Duke of Orleans was accordingly attacked one evening by eighteen ruffians hired
                    for the purpose, who set upon him whilst attended by only two pages. A Norman
                    gentleman <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514253" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4253-0022"/>who
                    had been deprived of an employment headed the assassins, and in person attacked
                    the duke; at the first blow he cut off his grace’s hand, at the second he struck
                    him from his mule, and at the third put an end to his life. Ί he Duke of
                    Burgundy escaped to Flanders; and the whole nation was rent into two factions,
                    called the Burgundians and Armagnacs, the latter being the title of the party of
                    the Duke of Orleans, from Armagnac, the father-in-law of that prince. A state of
                    dreadful confusion and anarchy ensued. The Duke of Burgundy soon returned into
                    France, and extorted a pardon from the unhappy king, who was now no longer able
                    to resist him; and some notion may be formed of the state of the kingdom from
                    the circumstance that two thousand people perished in one tumult in the capital.
                    The king himself was alternately the prisoner of both parties, and transferred
                    the power from the one to the other as he happened to fall into their hands.</p>
                <p>Henry V. of England judged this a favourable opportunity to recover from France
                    those possessions that had been formerly surrendered by treaty. But, in order to
                    give his Intended expedition the appearance of justice, he sent ambassadors to
                    Paris, offering perpetual peace and alliance, on condition of being put in
                    possession of all those provinces which had been ravished from the English
                    during former reigns, and of espousing Catharine, daughter of the French king,
                    with a suitable dowry. Though the French court was at this time extremely averse
                    to war, yet these demands were too extravagant to be complied with; and Henry
                    probably made them in hopes of meeting a refusal. He therefore assembled a fleet
                    and army at Southampton, and having drawn all the military men of the kingdom to
                    his standard, he put to sea, and landed at Harfleur at the head of an army of
                    six thousand men-at-arms, and twenty-four thousand foot, mostly archers. His
                    first operations were directed against Harfleur, which being hard pressed,
                    promised to surrender by a certain day, unless relieved before that time. When
                    the day arrived, and the garrison, unmindful of their engagement, resolved to
                    defend the place, Henry ordered an assault, took the town by storm, and put the
                    garrison to the sword. The victor then advanced further into the country, which
                    had been already rendered desolate by factions, and which he now laid totally
                    waste. But although the enemy made a feeble resistance, the climate seemed to
                    fight against the English; and a contagious dysentery carried off three fourths
                    of Henry’s army. In this situation he had recourse to an expedient common enough
                    in that age, in order to inspire his troops with confidence in their general. He
                    challenged to single combat the dauphin, who commanded the French army, offering
                    to stake his pretensions on the event. But this challenge, as might have been
                    expected, was refused; and the French, notwithstanding their internal
                    dissensions, at last seemed to unite at the appearance of a common danger. A
                    numerous army of fourteen thousand men-at-arms and forty thousand foot had by
                    this time assembled under the command of Count Albert, and been placed so as to
                    intercept Henry’s weakened forces on their return. The English monarch, when it
                    was too late, began to repent of his rash inroad into a country where disease
                    and a powerful army everywhere threatened destruction, and he therefore
                    determined to retire on Calais. In this retreat, which was at once painful and
                    dangerous, Henry took every precaution to inspire his troops with patience and
                    perseverance, and showed them in his own person the brightest example of
                    fortitude and resignatum. He was continually harassed on his march by flying
                    parties of the enemy; and when he attempted to cross the nver Somme, he observed
                    troops on the other side ready to oppose his passage. He was, however, fortunate
                    enough to seize by surprise, near St Quintin, a passage which had not been
                    sufficiently guarded, and thus carried ov&lt; <hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                    it</hi> his army in safety. But the enemy being sti∏ resolved to intercept his
                    retreat, after he had passed the river Tertrois, at Blangi, he was surprised to
                    observe from the heights the whole French army drawn up in the plains of
                    Agincourt, and so posted that it was impossible for him to proceed on his march
                    without coming to an engagement. A battle accordingly took place, in which the
                    English gained a victory, the most remarkable perhaps of any recorded in history
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Agincourt),</hi> and which deserves to be classed with
                    the triumphs achieved at Crescy and Poitiers. This victory, gained on the 25th
                    of October 1415, was however attended with no immediate effects. Henry still
                    continued to retreat after the battle of Agincourt, and carried his prisoners
                    first to Calais and thence to England.</p>
                <p>In 1417, the king of England once more landed an army of twenty-five thousand men
                    in Normandy, and prepared to strike a decisive blow for the crown of France, to
                    which the English monarchs had long made pretensions. That wretched country was
                    now reduced to a most deplorable condition. The whole kingdom appeared one vast
                    theatre of murder, injustice, and devastation. The Duke of Orleans had been
                    assassinated by the Duke of Burgundy; and the Duke of Burgundy, in his turn,
                    fell by the treachery of the dauphin. At the same time the son of the duke,
                    desirous of revenging his father’s death, entered into secret negotiations with
                    the English; and a league was immediately concluded at Arras, between Henry and
                    the young Duke of Burgundy, in which the king promised to revenge the murder of
                    the late duke, and the son appeared to insist on no further stipulations. Henry
                    therefore proceeded in his conquests without much opposition from any quarter.
                    Several towns and provinces submitted on his approach; the city of Rouen was
                    besieged and taken; and he soon became master of Pontoise and Gisors. He even
                    threatened Paris, and obliged the court to remove to Troyes, where the Dμke of
                    Burgundy, who had taken upon him the protection of the French king, met Henry in
                    order to ratify the treaty by which the crown of France was to be transferred to
                    a stranger. The imbecility into which Charles had fallen made him passive in
                    regard to this treaty, and Henry dictated the terms throughout the whole
                    negotiation. The principal articles of the treaty were, that Henry should
                    espouse the Princess Catharine; that King Charles should enjoy the title and
                    dignity of king for life, but that Henry should be declared heir to the crown,
                    and intrusted with the present administration of the government; that France and
                    England should be for ever united under one king, but should still retain their
                    respective laws and privileges; and that Henry should unite his arms with those
                    of King Charles and the Duke of Burgundy, to depress and subdue the dauphin and
                    his partisans. Not long after this treaty had been concluded, Henry married the
                    Princess Catharine; upon which he carried his father-in-law to Paris, and took
                    formal possession of the capital. He next obtained from the estates of the
                    kingdom a ratification of the late compact, and then turned his arms with
                    success against the adherents of the dauphin, who now wandered about a stranger
                    in his own country, and to the success obtained by his enemies opposed only
                    fruitless expostulations.</p>
                <p>But Henry’s supplies were not provided in such abundance as to enable him to
                    carry on the war without returning in person to prevail with his parliament to
                    grant fresh aid; and on his arrival in England, although he found his subjects
                    highly pleased with the splendour of his conquests, they seemed somewhat
                    doubtful as to the advantage to be derived from them. A treaty, which in its
                    consequences was likely to transfer the seat of empire from England, was not
                    much relished by the parliament, which, therefore, on various pretences, refused
                    his majesty a supply equal to his exigencies. But he was bent on pursuing his
                    schemes of ambition; and, having joined the supplies granted at home to the
                    contributions levied on the conquered provinces, he <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193514266" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4266-0023"/>was able once more to
                    assemble an army of twenty-eight thousand men, with which he landed safely at
                    Calais.</p>
                <p>In the mean while, the dauphin omitted no opportunity of repairing his ruined
                    fortunes. Taking advantage of Henry’s absence from France, he prevailed upon the
                    regent of Scotland to send him a body of eight thousand men; and with t!ιese,
                    and some few forces of his own, he attacked the Duke of Clarence, who commanded
                    the English troops in the king’s absence, and gained a complete victory. This
                    was the first action which turned the tide of success against the English. But
                    it was of short duration; for Henry having soon afterwards appeared with a
                    considerable army, the dauphin fled at his approach; and many of the places
                    which held out for the latter in the neighbourhood of Paris surrendered to the
                    conqueror. Henry, everywhere victorious, now fixed his residence at Paris; and
                    whilst Charles had only a small court, he was attended with one of great
                    magnificence. In the mean while the dauphin, driven beyond the Loire, and almost
                    totally dispossessed of the northern provinces, was pursued into the south by
                    the united arms of the English and Burgundians, and threatened with total
                    destruction. In this exigency, he found it necessary to protract the war, and to
                    evade all hazardous actions with a rival who had long been accustomed to
                    victory. His prudence was everywhere remarkable; and, after a train of
                    persecutions from fortune, he found her at length willing to declare in his
                    favour by the death of the king of England. Charles VI. died a short time
                    afterwards; and Charles VII. succeeded his father on a nominal throne.</p>
                <p>Nothing could be more deplorable than the situation of France when this monarch
                    assumed his title to the crown. The English were masters of almost all France;
                    and Henry VI. though yet an infant, was solemnly invested with regal power by
                    legates from Paris. The Duke of Bedford was at the head of a numerous army in
                    the heart of the kingdom, ready to oppose every insurrection; whilst the Duke of
                    Burgundy, who had entered into a firm confederacy with the English commander,
                    still remained stedľast, and seconded his claims. Yet notwithstanding these
                    unfavourable appearances, Charles found means to break the leagues formed
                    against him, and to bring back his subjects to their natural interest and duty.
                    His first attempts, however, were totally' destitute of success. Wherever he
                    endeavoured to face the enemy he was overthrown, and he could scarcely rely even
                    on the friends next his person. His authority was insulted by his own servants;
                    advantage after advantage was gained over him; and a battle fought near
                    Verneuil, in which he was totally defeated by the Duke of Bedford, seemed to
                    render his affairs altogether desperate. But, from the impossibility of the
                    English keeping the field without new supplies, Bedford was obliged to retire
                    into England; and in the absence of this commander his vigilant enemy began to
                    recover from his late consternation. Dunois, one of his generals, at the head of
                    a thousand men, compelled the Earl of Warwick to raise the siege of Montargis;
                    and this advantage, slight as it was, served to convince the French that the
                    English were not invincible.</p>
                <p>But they had soon still greater reason to triumph in their change of fortune, and
                    a new revolution was produced, by means apparently the most unlikely to bring
                    about such a result. In the village of Domremi, near Vaucou-lt∙urs, on the
                    borders of Lorraine, there lived a country girl, about twenty-seven years of
                    age, called Joan d’Arc. This girl had been a servant in a cabaret or small inn,
                    and in t&gt;ιat humble station had submitted to those hardy employments which
                    fit the body for the fatigues of war. She was of an irreproachable life, and had
                    hitherto exhibited nor.e of those enterprising qualities which she soon
                    afterwards displayed. She contentedly fulfilled the duties of her station, and
                    was remarkable only for her modesty and love of religion. But the miseries of
                    her country seemed to have occupied the thoughts of this lowly maiden; and her
                    mind, inflamed by the subject, and brooding with melancholy stedfastness
                    thereon, began to feel impulses, which she was willing to mistake for
                    inspirations of heaven. Convinced of the reality of her own visions, she had
                    recourse to one Baudricort, governor of Vaucouleurs, whom she informed of her
                    destination by heaven to free her native country from its fierce invaders.
                    Baudricort treated her at first with neglect; but her importunities at length
                    prevailed, and, willing to make trial of her pretensions, he gave her some
                    attendants, who conducted her to the court, which at that time resided at
                    Chinon. The French courtiers were probably sensible of the weakness of her
                    pretensions, but they were willing to make use of every artifice to support
                    their declining fortunes. It was therefore given out that Joan was actually
                    inspired; that she had been able to discover the king amongst the number of his
                    courtiers, although he had laid aside all the distinctions of his authority;
                    that she had told him some secrets, which were only known to himself; and that
                    she had demanded, and minutely described, a sword in the church of St Catharine
                    de Herbois, which she had never seen. The minds of the vulgar being thus
                    prepared, she appeared armed <hi rend="italic">cap-à-pied,</hi> and was shown in
                    that martial dress to the people. She was then brought before the doctors of the
                    university, who, tinctured with the credulity of the times, or willing to second
                    the imposture, declared that she had actually received her commission from
                    above. When the preparations for her mission had been completely blazoned, the
                    next object was to send her against the enemy. The English were at this time
                    besieging the city of Orleans, the last resource of Charles, and every’ thing
                    promised them a speedy conquest. Joan undertook to raise the siege; and, in
                    order to render herself still more remarkable, girded herself with the
                    miraculous sword, of which she had before had such extraordinary notices. Thus
                    equipped, she ordered all the soldiers to confess themselves before they set
                    out, displayed in her hand a consecrated banner, and assured the troops of
                    certain success. Such confidence on her side soon raised the spirits of the
                    French army; and even the English, who pretended to despise her efforts, felt
                    themselves secretly influenced with the terrors of her mission. A supply of
                    provisions was to be conveyed into the town; Joan, at the head of some French
                    troops, covered the embarkation, and entered Orleans at the head of the convoy
                    which she had safely protected. Whilst she was leading her troops along, silence
                    and astonishment reigned amongst the English; and they regarded with religious
                    awe that temerity, which they thought nothing but supernatural assistance could
                    inspire. But they were soon roused from their state of amazement by a sally from
                    the town; Joan led on the besieged, bearing the sacred standard in her hand,
                    encouraging them with her words and actions, bringing them to the trenches, and
                    overpowering the besiegers in their own redoubts. In the attack of one of the
                    forts, she was wounded in the neck with an arrow; but instantly pulling out the
                    weapon with her own hands, and getting the wound promptly dressed, she hastened
                    back to head the troops, and to plant her victorious banner on the hostile
                    ramparts. As these successes continued, the English found it impossible to
                    resist troops who were animated by such superior energy; and Suffolk, who
                    conducted the attack, thinking that it might prove extremely dangerous to remain
                    any longer in the presence of snch an enemy, raised the siege, and retreated
                    with all imaginable precaution. From being attacked, the French now became in
                    turn the aggressors. Charles formed a body of six thousand men, and sent them to
                    besiege Jergeau, whither the English, commanded by the Earl of Suffolk, had
                    retired. The city was taken; Suffolk yielded himself a prisoner; and Joan
                    marched into <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514279" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4279-0024"
                    />the place in triumph at the head of the army. A battle was soon after fought
                    near Patay, where the English were ’ again worsted, and Generals Scales and
                    Talbot were taken prisoners.</p>
                <p>The raising of the siege of Orleans formed one part of the promise which the maid
                    had made to the king of France, the crowning him at Rheims was the other; and as
                    she now declared that it was time to complete that ceremony, Charles, in
                    pursuance of her advice, set out for Rheims at the head of twelve thousand men.
                    The towns through which he passed opened their gates to receive him; and Rheims
                    sent him a deputation, with its keys, upon his approach. The ceremony of his
                    coronation was there performed with the utmost solemnity; and the Maid of
                    Orleans, as she was now called, seeing the completion of her mission, desired
                    leave to retire, alleging that she had now accomplished the end of her calling.
                    But her services had been so great that the king could not think of parting with
                    her; he pressed her earnestly to remain, and she at length complied with his
                    request. A train of success followed the performance of this solemnity; Laon,
                    Soissons, Château-Thierri, Provins, and many other fortresses in that
                    neighbourhood, submitted to him on the first summons.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the English, discomfited and dispirited, fled in every
                    direction, not knowing whether to ascribe their misfortunes to the power of
                    sorcery or to a celestial influence, but equally terrified at both. They now
                    found themselves deprived of the conquests they had gained, in the same manner
                    as the French had formerly submitted to their power. Their own divisions, both
                    abroad and at home, unfitted them entirely for carrying on the war; and the Duke
                    of Bedford, notwithstanding all his prudence, saw himself divested of his
                    strongholds in the country, without being able to arrest the enemy’s progress.
                    In order, therefore, to revive the declining state of his affairs, he resolved
                    to have Henry crowned king at Paris, knowing that die natives would be allured
                    to obedience by the splendour of the ceremony. In 1430 Henry was accordingly
                    crowned, all the vassals who still continued under the English power swearing
                    fealty and homage. But it was now too late to give a turn to the affairs of the
                    English by the ceremonies of a coronation; the generality of the kingdom had
                    declared against them, and the remainder only waited a convenient opportunity to
                    follow the example. An accident which soon afterwards occurred, though it
                    promised to advance the English cause in France, served in the end to render it
                    odious, and conduced to the total evacuation of that country. The Duke of
                    Burgundy, at the head of a powerful army, had laid siege to Compeigne; and the
                    Maid of Orleans had thrown herself into the place, contrary to the wishes of the
                    governor, who desired not the company of one whose authority would be greater
                    than his own. The garrison, however, were rejoiced at her appearance, and
                    believed themselves invincible under her protection. But their joy was of short
                    duration; for Joan having the day after her arrival headed a sally, and twice
                    driven the enemy from their intrenchments, was at last obliged to retire,
                    placing herself in the rear, to cover the retreat of her forces. But in the end,
                    attempting to follow the troops into the city, she found the gates shut, and the
                    bridge raised, by order of the governor, who is said to have long wished for an
                    opportunity of delivering her up to the enemy. Nothing could exceed the joy of
                    the besiegers, in having taken a person who had been so long a terror to their
                    arms. The service of <hi rend="italic">Te</hi><hi rend="italic">Deum</hi> was
                    publicly celebrated on the occasion; and it was hoped that the capture of this
                    extraordinary person would restore to the English their former victories and
                    successes. The Duke of Bedford was no sooner informed of her being taken, than
                    he purchased the heroine of the Count Vendome, who had made her his prisoner,
                    and ordered her to be committed to close confinement.</p>
                <p>The credulity of both nations was at this time so great, that any tiling which
                    coincided with their passions was not too absurd to gain belief. As Joan had a
                    little before, when successful, been regarded as a saint, she was now, on her
                    captivity, considered as a sorceress, forsaken by the demon who had given her a
                    temporary and fallacious assistance. It was accordingly resolved in council to
                    send her to Rouen to be tried for witchcraft; and the Bishop of Beauvais, a man
                    wholly devoted to the English interest, having presented a petition against her,
                    the university of Paris was mean enough to join in the request. Several
                    prelates, amongst whom the Cardinal of Winchester was the only Englishman, were
                    appointed her judges, and held their court at Rouen, where Henry then resided;
                    whilst the maid, clothed in her military apparel, but loaded with irons, was
                    produced before the tribunal. Her behaviour on this occasion in no way disgraced
                    her former gallantry; she betrayed neither weakness nor womanish submission, but
                    appealed to God and the pope for the truth of her former revelations.
                    Nevertheless she was found guilty of heresy and witchcraft, and sentenced to be
                    burned alive, the common punishment for such offences. But previously to the
                    execution of this sentence, they resolved to make her abjure her former errors;
                    and at length, by terror and rigorous treatment, so far prevailed, that her
                    spirits were entirely broken by the hardships she was forced to endure. Her
                    former visionary dreams began to vanish, and a gloomy distrust took place of her
                    late inspirations; she publicly declared herself willing to recant, and promised
                    never more to give way to the vain delusions which had hitherto misled her, and
                    imposed upon the people. This was what her oppressors desired; and, willing to
                    show some appearance of mercy, they changed her sentence into that of perpetual
                    imprisonment, and to be fed for life on bread and water. But the rage of her
                    enemies was not yet satiated. Suspecting that the female dress, which she had
                    consented to wear, was disagreeable to her, they purposely placed in her
                    apartment a suit of men’s apparel, and watched the effect of this temptation.
                    The despicable artifice succeeded. Joan, struck with the sight of a dress in
                    which she had gained so much glory, immediately threw off her penitent robes,
                    and put on the forbidden garment. Her enemies caught her equipped in this
                    fashion; and her imprudence was considered as a relapse into her former
                    transgressions. No recantation would now suffice, no pardon could now be
                    granted. She was condemned to be burned alive in the market-place of Rouen; and
                    this disgraceful sentence was executed with most rigorous severity.</p>
                <p>One of the first misfortunes which befel the English after this sacrifice was the
                    defection of the Duke of Burgundy, who had for some time seen the error of his
                    conduct, and wished to break an unnatural connection, which only served to
                    involve his country in ruin. A treaty was therefore concluded between him and
                    Charles, in which the former agreed to assist him in driving the English out of
                    France. This proved a mortal blow to the cause of the latter; and such were its
                    effects upon the populace of London when informed of it, that they killed
                    several of the Duke of Burgundy’s subjects who happened at the time to be living
                    amongst them. It might perhaps also have hastened the Duke of Bedford’s death,
                    who died at Rouen a few days after the treaty had been concluded; and the Earl
                    of Cambridge was appointed his successor to the regency of France. From this
                    period the English affairs were irretrievably ruined. The city of Paris returned
                    once more to a sense of its duty, and Lord Willoughby, who commanded it, was
                    contented to stipulate for the safe retreat of his troops to Normandy. Thus
                    ground was continually, though slowly, gained by the French; and notwithstanding
                    that their fields <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514292"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4292-0025"/>were laid waste, and their towns depopulated, they
                    yet found protection in the weakness and divisions of the English. • At length
                    both parties began to grow weary of a war, which, though carried on feebly, was
                    still a burden greater than either could support-But the terms of peace insisted
                    upon by both were so exorbitant that little hopes of an accommodation could
                    reasonably be entertained. In 1443, therefore, a truce for twenty-two months was
                    concluded, which left every thing between the parties on the footing upon which
                    it actually stood. And no sooner had this been agreed upon, than Charles applied
                    himself with great industry and judgment to repair the numberless evils to
                    which, from the continuance of wars both foreign and domestic, his kingdom had
                    so long been exposed. He established discipline amongst his troops, and justice
                    amongst his governors; he revived agriculture, and repressed faction. Having
                    prepared once more for taking the field, he seized the first favourable
                    opportunity to break the truce. Normandy was at the same time invaded by four
                    powerful armies; one commanded by Charles himself, a second by the Duke of
                    Bretagne, a third by the Count of Alençon, and a fourth by the Count Dunois.
                    Every place opened its gates almost as soon as the French appeared before them.
                    Rouen was the only city which threatened to hold out; but the inhabitants
                    clamoured so loudly for a surrender, that the Duke of Somerset, who commanded
                    the garri-on, was obliged to capitulate. The battle, or rather skirmish, of
                    Fourmingi, was the last stand which the English made in defence of their French
                    dominions; but here they were put to the rout, and above a thousand slain.
                    Normandy and Guienne, which had so long acknowledged subjection to England, were
                    lost in the space of a year; and the English saw themselves entirely
                    dispossessed of a country which for above three centuries they had considered as
                    annexed to their native dominions. Of all their conquests Calais alone remained
                    to them; but this was a small compensation for the blood and treasure which had
                    been lavished in France.</p>
                <p>In the year 1450, accordingly, the power of the English in France was entirely
                    destroyed; and Charles obtained the surname of Victorious, on account of the
                    vigour which he had shown in expelling the invaders of his country. But his
                    satisfaction was greatly diminished by domestic misfortunes. The dauphin,
                    forgetting the allegiance and filial duty which he owed to his father, had
                    already impeded his conquests by his seditious intrigues. He had used every
                    effort to thwart the designs of the king’s ministers, and it was even supposed
                    that he had destroyed by poison Agnes Soreille, his father’s favourite mistress.
                    He had also married Charlotte, daughter of the Duke of Savoy, which Charles had
                    resented by a declaration of war against the duke; but he had been persuaded to
                    recall this denunciation, in order to prosecute the war against Guienne. At
                    length, weary of the disobedience of his son, he commanded him to be arrested;
                    but Louis, informed of his design, withdrew to Franche Comté, and afterwards to
                    Brabant, where the Duke of Burgundy, then sovereign of the country, ordered him
                    to be supplied with every necessary, and treated with all imaginable respect.
                    The duke, however, refused to see him until he had obtained the approbation of
                    his father; upon which Louis employed himself in sowing dissension between his
                    benefactor and the Count of Ċharolois, his son, at the very time that he himself
                    was receiving a pension of twelve thousand crowns annually from the father. He
                    thus destroyed the domestic peace of his benefactor, whilst his unnatural
                    conduct created continual suspicions in the mind of his father. Being repeatedly
                    informed that his own domestics, along with his undutiſul son, were in a
                    conspiracy against his life, the miserable monarch lived in continual fear of
                    being poisoned, and, having none in whom he could repose confidence, obstinately
                    refused for some days to receive any sustenance; and when at last prevailed upon
                    by the importunities of his attendants to take some food, his stomach had become
                    incapable of receiving it, and he died of inanition, in the year 1461. His body,
                    neglected by his unnatural son, was interred at the expense of Tannegui de
                    Chastel, who had ever been his faithful companion.</p>
                <p>On the death of Charles, his son Louis succeeded to the throne to which he had so
                    long aspired. He was reckoned one of the greatest politicians that ever existed,
                    though his character was not upon that account the more amiable; on the
                    contrary, there are few princes whose character appears in a more detestable
                    light. So destitute was he of natural affection, that he did not even attempt to
                    conceal his joy at his father’s death. He pretended much friendship for the
                    Count of Ċharolois, son to the Duke of Burgundy, on account of the protection
                    which he had received at his father’s court, and even conferred upon him a
                    pension of twelve thousand crowns annually. But all this show of affection soon
                    degenerated into a mortal aversion upon both sides. Some differences which took
                    place between the courts of France and Castille produced an interview between
                    the two monarchs, Louis, and Henry surnamed the Impotent. They met at Mauleon,
                    on the confines of Navarre; but their negotiations came to nothing, and they
                    parted with a feeling of mutual contempt; Henry despising the mean and sordid
                    appearance of Louis, and the latter in his turn deriding the gaudy magnificence
                    of Henry. In his negotiations with the Duke of Burgundy, Louis proved more
                    successful, having persuaded him to restore some towns situated on the river
                    Somme which had been ceded by Charles VII., and by the possession of which the
                    duke was in effect master of Picardy. This cession was opposed by the Count of
                    Ċharolois; but Louis, by corrupting John de Croy, the duke’s minister, succeeded
                    in his object, and for the sum of four hundred thousand crowns the cities were
                    delivered to him. In this transaction, by which he effectually ensured the
                    hatred of Ċharolois, the duplicity of Louis was eminently displayed; for though
                    he had agreed to retain in those towns the officers appointed by the duke, he
                    had no sooner obtained possession than he displaced all of them, and appointed
                    others in their stead.</p>
                <p>The duchy of Bretagne was at this time governed by Francis, a weak but generous
                    prince, whose defect of capacity was supplied by the abilities of his ministers.
                    This prince Louis had insulted in the grossest manner; and as Francis found
                    himself unable alone to oppose such a powerful adversary, he formed a close
                    alliance with the Duke of Burgundy and the Count of Ċharolois, who had also been
                    grievously offended by Louis. The confederacy was joined by several of the
                    principal French nobility, who had been oppressed by the king; and though the
                    secret was confided to upwards of five hundred persons, not one of them ever
                    divulged it. Finding matters becoming very critical, Louis marched with an army
                    towards the capital, which the Count of Ċharolois had already threatened; and a
                    battle ensued, in which both princes exerted themselves to the utmost, though
                    their valour was but ill seconded by the bravery of their troops. About fifteen
                    hundred men perished on each side, but the Count of Ċharolois remained master of
                    the field. Louis, however, after this engagement entered the capital, where he
                    endeavoured, by every kind concession, to conciliate the affection of his
                    subjects; and in this he succeeded so well, that though the army of the
                    insurgents was soon augmented to a hundred thousand men, they were unable to
                    make themselves masters of the city. At last a treaty was concluded between
                    Louis and the Count of Ċharolois, by which the latter obtained the towns which
                    had been formerly ceded, with the districts of Boulogne, Guisne, Peronne,
                    Mondidior, and Roye, as a perpetual inheritance<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193514305" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4305-0026"/> for himself; and by granting
                    favours to the other confederates, the league was completely broken. But as soon
                    as Louis found himself freed from danger, he protested against the whole treaty,
                    as contrary to the interest of his crown; and therefore waited the first
                    favourable opportunity to crush one by one those who by their united efforts had
                    been ready to destroy him. The Duke of Bourbon, one of the most able of the
                    confederates, was gained over, by bestowing upon him in marriage, Jane, a
                    natural daughter of the king, with the dowry of Usson in Auvergne, together with
                    Moras, Beaurepaire, and Cormil-lon in Dauphine; and, by the discontents between
                    the Dukes of Bretagne and Normandy, he was enabled tp secure the neutrality of
                    the former, and to recover from the latter some territories which had been
                    unwillingly ceded to him.</p>
                <p>In 1467, Philip duke of Burgundy, surnamed from his amiable qualities the Good,
                    died, and left his dominions to his son Charles, count of Charolois. That fiery
                    and impetuous prince, jealous of the growing power of France, and an implacable
                    enemy of Louis, had entered into a secret treaty with Francis; but Louis had
                    driven the Bretons from the posts which they had occupied in Normandy before the
                    Duke of Burgundy could pass the Somme. The king, however, alarmed at the power
                    of the confederates, concluded a peace with Bretagne; and, confiding in his
                    talents for negotiation, determined to risk a personal conference with the Duke
                    of Burgundy. This memorable interview took place in the year 1468; and Peronne,
                    a fortified town of Picardy, belonging to the Duke of Burgundy, was appointed as
                    the place of rendezvous. Thither the politic Louis repaired with a slender
                    train, being attended only by Cardinal Balue, the Duke of Bourbon, and the Count
                    de St Pol, constable of France; apparently without reflecting that he was
                    entering a hostile city, where he might be confined for any length of time, or
                    treated at the pleasure of the duke, who was his mortal enemy. Nor had he been
                    long in the place when he began to perceive the extent of his error; and, by the
                    daily concourse of Burgundian lords and other persons of rank, his avowed
                    enemies, he became alarmed for his personal safety. His fears even suggested to
                    him more serious apprehensions; and he requested apartments in the castle, where
                    it was in the power of his rival in a moment to make him a close prisoner. This
                    event accordingly took place, through the machinations of Louis himself. From
                    the first his policy had been to keep the Duke of Burgundy constantly employed
                    in domestic wars; and with this view he had, immediately before his interview
                    with Charles, excited the inhabitants of Liège, who were subject to the Duke of
                    Burgundy, to revolt against their sovereign. It is probable, indeed, that he did
                    not anticipate that the effects of this treachery would so soon begin to
                    manifest themselves. But at the very time when Louis was in the castle of
                    Peronne, the people of Liège revolted, seized the bishop and governor, and
                    having massacred many of the adherents of Charles, retired with their prisoners
                    to the capital. Charles was soon informed of this massacre, with the additional
                    circumstance that the emissaries of Louis were seen animating the insurgents to
                    their work of destruction. Transported with rage, he commanded the gates of the
                    castle to be shut and strictly guarded, and denounced the severest vengeance on
                    the perfidious monarch who had so often deceived him. Louis, however, though
                    justly alarmed for the consequences of this premature explosion, did not neglect
                    to take the proper methods for securing himself. He distributed large sums of
                    money amongst those officers to whom he imagined the duke was most inclined to
                    pay any regard, and by splendid promises and presents endeavoured to allay the
                    resentment of his other enemies. The resentment of Charles, as short-lived as it
                    was violent, quickly subsided, and he entered into a treaty with the king, upon
                    much the same terms as those which had been agreed to before. He insisted,
                    however, that Louis should be present at the punishment he inflicted upon the
                    inhabitants of Liège for the massacre they had committed; and this being acceded
                    to, these princes in conjunction formed the siege of the city, which,
                    notwithstanding the obstinate defence of the people, was at length taken by
                    storm, and delivered over to a general massacre.</p>
                <p>But, as might have been foreseen, the new alliance was soon dissolved. A
                    confederacy against Louis, whom neither promises nor treaties could bind, was
                    formed between his own brother the Duke of Normandy and the Duke of Burgundy;
                    but before their measures were ripe for execution, Louis had already commenced
                    hostilities. The Duke of Burgundy, as a peer of France, was summoned to
                    parliament, and on his refusal the Constable St Pol made himself master of St
                    Quintin. Several other cities were also reduced; and Baldwin, the natural
                    brother of Charles, having, at the instigation of Louis, deserted his cause, the
                    duke, notwithstanding his haughty spirit, was at last obliged to solicit a
                    peace. This, however, was not of long duration. Charles, encouraged by the
                    success of Edward IV. of England, his brother-in-law, began once more to league
                    against Louis, with the Dukes of Bretagne and Guienne, the king’s brother, and
                    formerly Duke of Normandy, but who had exchanged that duchy for the territory of
                    Guienne. But whilst the affairs of the confederates seemed likely to prosper,
                    their prospects were suddenly overcast by the death of the Duke of Guienne, who
                    was universally supposed to have been poisoned by order of Louis. The abbot of
                    St Jean d’ Angeli was fixed upon as the immediate perpetrator of the deed; but
                    upon the day appointed for his trial he was found strangled in his cell; and as
                    the dead tell no tales, Louis escaped the ignominy which the trial would
                    probably have fixed on him, and was enabled to seize upon the territory of
                    Guienne, which he annexed to the dominions of France.</p>
                <p>By this unexampled vi)lany Charles was so much exasperated that he vowed the most
                    dreadful vengeance against the people of France, and threatened to sacrifice to
                    the memory of the Duke of Guienne every one who fell into his hands. The
                    citizens of Nesle were massacred without distinction of sex or age; but Beauvis
                    resisted his attacks, after which Charles wreaked his fury on other places.
                    Having entered the country of Caux, he reduced the cities of Eu and St Valery,
                    burned Longueville, and wasted the whole country as far as Rouen. Louis, on the
                    other hand, steady and constant in his designs, determined to dissolve the
                    league between the Duke of Bretagne and Edward IV. of England, encamped with his
                    army on the frontiers of Bretagne; whilst the duke, not meeting with the
                    assistance promised by Edward, was obliged to consent to a truce for a year. In
                    a little time, however, he began again to conspire with the king of England
                    against Louis, and a powerful invasion was determined upon. Edward was to cross
                    the sea with an army of ten thousand men, whilst Charles assembled all his
                    forces to join in the attack. The former was also to set up a claim to the crown
                    of France, and at all events to obtain the provinces of Normandy and Guienne;
                    whilst the duke was to have Champagne, with some adjacent districts, and to free
                    his dominions from homage; and neither party was to make peace without the
                    consent of the other. It was supposed that the Duke of Bretagne would naturally
                    accede to the confederacy; and the Count de St Pol, constable of France, had
                    engaged to deliver up the town of St Quintin and others which he occupied on the
                    river Somme. Louis, however, had still the good fortune to avoid the storm.
                    Charles, instead of advancing to the assistance of Edward, who had entered
                    France at the head <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514318"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4318-0027"/>of fifteen thousand archers and fifteen hundred
                    men-at-arms, laid siege to the city of Nuiz on the Rhine; whilst <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> the Constable St Pol, instead of delivering up the
                    towns as he had promised, deceived his allies, and enabled Louis to dissolve a
                    confederacy, which, had it been vigorously maintained, might have involved him
                    in the greatest difficulties. To procure the departure of Edward, however, he
                    was obliged to consent to a tribute of seventy-five thousand crowns, as well as
                    to settle on the king himself fifty thousand crowns for life, and also to
                    betrothe the dauphin to the eldest daughter of the king of England. The Dulce of
                    Burgundy exclaimed loudly against this treaty; but Edward presiβting in his
                    resolution, it was executed, at a place called Pecquigny, near Amiens, though in
                    such a manner as showed the little confidence which the two sovereigns reposed
                    in each other. A power was reserved by Edward for the Duke of Burgundy to accede
                    to the treaty; but the latter haughtily replied, that he was able to support
                    himself without the assistance of England, and that he would make no peace with
                    Louis until three months after the return of Edward to his own country. To this
                    resolution he adhered; but no sooner had the term expired than he concluded a
                    truce with Louis for nine years. The Constable St Pol having rendered himself
                    obnoxious to all parties by his complicated treachery, fled to Mons in Hainault;
                    but the Duke of Burgundy had already consented to deliver him up, upon condition
                    of receiving his estates and moveables as the price of his treachery.</p>
                <p>Thus had Louis, without any other remarkable qualification than the mere arts of
                    dissimulation and falsehood, got rid of all his enemies excepting the Duke of
                    Burgundy, whose growing power rendered him a constant object of jealousy and
                    terror. The imprudence and temerity of the latter, however, soon proved his
                    ruin. Having rashly engaged in a war with the Swiss, he was defeated in the
                    first encounter, with the loss of his military chest and baggage, and of his
                    plate and jewels, supposed to be the richest in Europe. His disappointment on
                    this occasion was so great that he was seized with a severe sickness; but he had
                    hardly recovered when he resumed his insane scheme of conquering the Swiss.
                    Another battle ensued, in which, after an obstinate struggle, Charles was
                    defeated with the loss of eighteen thousand men; a disaster which was followed
                    by the defection of most of his allies. The Duke of Lorraine recovered the city
                    of Nancy, and the greater part of his dominions, which Charles had seized;
                    whilst the latter, overwhelmed with shame and disappointment, spent his time in
                    solitude and inactivity. But from this state he was at length roused by the
                    misfortunes which fell upon him in rapid succession. He now invested the city of
                    Nancy, acting in this, as in every other instance, against the advice of his
                    best officers. The Duke of Lorraine advanced with a strong body of Germans to
                    the relief of the city, whilst Charles had scarcely four thousand men to oppose
                    him. His troops were therefore defeated, and he himself, notwithstanding the
                    most heroic efforts of valour, was hurried away in the crowd. The Count de
                    Campobasso, an Italian nobleman, in whom he put great confidence, but who was in
                    reality a traitor, had deserted with about eighty men at the commencement of the
                    action; but he left twelve or fifteen fellows about the duke ♯ person, with
                    strict orders to assassinate him in the tumult; and this order they punctually
                    obeyed. The body of Charles was found two days after the battle, pierced with
                    three wounds. This occurred in the year 1477.</p>
                <p>The news of Charles’s death was received with the most unfeigned joy by Louis,
                    whose sole object it now was to unite the territories of the Duke of Burgundy to
                    those of his own. This might be done in two ways; either by a match between the
                    dauphin and Mary, the heiress of Burgundy, or by marrying this lady to the Duke
                    of Angoulême, a prince of the blood royal of France. The king, however, to whom
                    duplicity and falsehood seem to have been absolutely necessary, chose a third
                    method, which was more agreeable to his character. The match with the dauphin,
                    for various reasons, might be considered as impracticable. The disparity of age
                    was great, the dauphin being only eight years old, and the princess twenty; the
                    Flemings were besides averse to submit to a prince whose powerful resources
                    would enable him to oppress their liberties. But, notwithstanding these
                    difficulties, Louis chose to insist upon the match, at the same time that he
                    endeavoured to make himself master of her dominions by force of arms. He
                    addressed circular letters to the principal cities of Burgundy, representing
                    that the duchy had been given by King John to the heirs male of his son Philip,
                    and that now, when these were extinct by the death of Charles, the territory
                    reverted of course to the crown; and, to render this argument more effectual, he
                    corrupted the governors of some towns, and seduced the inhabitants of others,
                    whilst he himself at the head of an army prepared to enforce obedience from
                    those who could not be worked upon by other methods. And by these means the
                    province of Burgundy was entirely reduced. But Flanders could not be brought
                    under subjection either by fraud or force. In this, as on almost all other
                    occasions, Louis displayed the most detestable falsehood, and the meanest
                    treachery. In order to render Mary odious to her subjects, he negotiated with
                    her ministers, and having prevailed on them to disclose the most important state
                    secrets, he communicated their letters to the states of Flanders. This double
                    treachery, however, did not answer his purpose. The two ministers he had
                    betrayed were indeed put to death in the presence of their sovereign; but Mary
                    was induced to bestow her hand upon the emperor Maximilian, and Louis had the
                    mortification to find that all his arts had contributed only to aggrandise a
                    rival power, whom he had already sufficient cause to dread. To repair this
                    oversight, he entered into an alliance with Edward IV. of England, whom he had
                    inspired with a jealousy of his brother Clarence; and thus a peace was concluded
                    between the two monarchs, intended to continue during the life of each, and a
                    year thereafter. Meanwhile the marriage of Mary with Maximilian secured the
                    independence of Flanders; whilst the return of the prince of Orange to the party
                    of that princess once more extended the war to the cities of Burgundy, and the
                    French were on the point of being expelled from that country. But Maximilian
                    unexpectedly made proposals of peace, and a truce was concluded, but without any
                    term fixed for its duration, or without stipulations in favour of the
                    Burgundians; so that the whole country was soon afterwards reduced by Louis.</p>
                <p>The king being now freed from the apprehensions of foreign enemies, turned his
                    vindictive disposition against his own subjects, and, under pretence of former
                    rebellions, exercised the most insupportable tyranny. The principal victim of
                    his sanguinary disposition was James d’Armagnac, duke of Nemours, one of the
                    first noblemen in the kingdom, who had formerly been a zealous confederate in
                    the league with Edward and Charles. This unfortunate nobleman, knowing that
                    vengeance was determined on, fled to the fortress of Carlat, in the mountains of
                    Auvergne, where he was besieged by the Seigneur de Beaujeu, who had married Anne
                    the daughter of Louis. The place, however, being almost impregnable, his enemies
                    were obliged to make the most solemn promises of safety in order to induce him
                    to surrender, and he was at last persuaded to trust himself in the hands of the
                    faithless tyrant. But no sooner had the latter got the unfortunate nobleman in
                    his power than he shut him up in an iron cage <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193514331" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4331-0028"/>in the Bastille, and
                    reprimanded the judges for having released him from this close confinement
                    during his exami- ' nation. He was condemned to be beheaded; but the king’s
                    cruelty extended beyond the sentence, for he ordered the two sons of the duke,
                    though yet in childhood, to be placed directly under the scaffold, that they
                    might be covered with the blood of their father. Four thousand persons are
                    supposed to have perished upon this occasion without any form or trial; and were
                    it not for the concurring testimony of the historians of that age, the inhuman
                    barbarities of this monster would scarcely be credited. By these means he broke
                    the spirit of the French nobility, and gradually extended the power of the
                    crown, until at last it was limited only by the pleasure of the sovereign.</p>
                <p>In 1479, the emperor Maximilian, who had lightlyaban-doned the duchy of Burgundy
                    when he might have reduced it, now renewed his claims when it was no longer in
                    his power to enforce them. After a variety of actions of little note, and the
                    destruction of cities on both sides, a battle was fought at Guinegate, where the
                    Flemings were routed; but as the French pursued with too great ardour, the
                    infantry of the enemy rallied, and the battle was renewed with great slaughter
                    on both sides. A more decisive advantage was afterwards gained by the capture of
                    eighty Flemish vessels, which induced that commercial people to think of
                    peace.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, Louis, after a life spent in continual deceit, hypocrisy, and
                    cruelty, received warning of his approaching end by a fit of apoplexy, with
                    which he was seized in. the year 1480. He lay speechless and motionless for two
                    days; after which he in some degree recovered, but never completely regained his
                    health and strength. His illness, however, neither prevented him pursuing the
                    schemes of his ambition, nor using the same methods as formerly to attain them.
                    He seized, without any pretence, the estates of the Duke of Bourbon, the only
                    nobleman in the kingdom whose power gave him any cause of suspicion; and,
                    notwithstanding his assiduity for the interest of the dauphin, kept him a kind
                    of prisoner in the castle of Amboise. He banished his own consort, the mother of
                    the dauphin, to Savoy, and endeavoured to inspire the prince with aversion for
                    her. By the death of Charles, titular king of Naples, and the last of the second
                    house of Anjou, he became master of the county of Provence; but his satisfaction
                    on this occasion was marred by a second stroke of apoplexy. Still, however, he
                    revived, and again began to pursue his ambitious intrigues. The death of Mary of
                    Burgundy, who perished by a fall from her horse, inspired him with new views;
                    and he betrothed his son to the infant daughter of the emperor, by which means
                    he deeply offended Edward IV. whose eldest daughter had previously been
                    contracted to the dauphin, and a war would in consequence have ensued, had it
                    not been for the death of the king of England. This event was ere long followed
                    by that of Louis himself, who had m vain exhausted the skill <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi> f his physician, and wearied the clergy with prayers
                    and processions to avert the impending stroke. He expired in the year 1483,
                    after a reign of twenty-three years, during which he was detested by his
                    subjects, whom he had continually oppressed, and equally dreaded and hated by
                    his neighbours, whom he had constantly deceived. But, in spite of all this, he
                    obtained from his holiness the title of Most Christian King, which his
                    successors retained until the year 1830, when a sudden revolution placed a new
                    and more popular dynasty on the throne. Notwithstanding the dark character of
                    this prince, it must be allowed that he laid the foundations of the future
                    greatness of the French monarchy. By his arts he deprived the common people of
                    their liberty, depressed the power of the nobility, established a standing army,
                    and even induced the states to render many taxes perpetual which formerly were
                    only temporary. From this time the people became accustomed to submit entirely
                    to the voice of their sovereign as their only legislator; and being always
                    obedient in matters of the greatest consequence, they cheerfully contributed
                    whatever sums were required to fulfil the king’s pleasure.</p>
                <p>Charles VIII. who succeeded his father Louis XI. in 1483, was only fourteen years
                    of age at the time of his father’s death. But though he might, even at that age,
                    have ascended the throne without any material violation of the laws of France,
                    yet it was judged necessary to appoint a regent, on account of the king’s
                    delicacy of constitution and want of education. Three competitors appeared as
                    candidates for this important trust: John duke of Bourbon, a prince of the
                    blood, and who had, till the age of sixty, maintained the most unblemished
                    character; Louis duke of Orleans, presumptive heir to the crown, but who from
                    his youth seemed incapable of undertaking so important an office; and Anne, the
                    eldest daughter of Louis, to whom he had in the last moments of his life
                    committed the charge of the kingdom. The claim of this lady was supported by the
                    assembly of the states-general at Tours; and though she had only entered the
                    twenty-second year of her age, the office, it appears, could not have been more
                    properly bestowed. Being married to Peter of Bourbon, seigneur of Beaujeu, she
                    was styled the Lady of Beaujeu; but she seems to have acted independently of her
                    husband, who was a man but of moderate capacity.</p>
                <p>Her first step was to ingratiate herself with the people by some popular acts,
                    and particularly by punishing the instruments of her father’s cruelties. One of
                    these, Oliver le Dian, who, from the humble station of barber, had raised
                    himself to the confidence and favour of the king, and had distinguished himself
                    by the invention of new modes of torture, was publicly hanged. Another, named
                    Jean Doyac, who by continual acts of violence and rapacity had oppressed the
                    people, after being whipped in all the public places and squares of Paris, was
                    condemned to have one of his ears cut off, and his tongue pierced through with a
                    hot iron; upon which he was conveyed to his native city of Montferrand, where he
                    was again whipped, and had his other ear cut off. Jacques Coitier, the physician
                    of Louis, who had availed himself of the terror of death, with which the king
                    was strongly influenced, to extort large sums of money from him, was ordered to
                    account for the immense wealth he had acquired; but he prudently averted the
                    danger by paying a fine of fifty thousand crowns. Thus the Lady of Beaujeu
                    secured the affection of the people at large, and was equally successful in
                    gaining those who had at first been averse to her government. The Duke of
                    Bourbon was made constable, an office which he had long desired; the Duke of
                    Orleans having behaved in such a manner as to exclude all hopes of favour.
                    Incensed at the determination against him of a trifling dispute at tennis by the
                    Lady of Beaujeu, he furiously had exclaimed, that whoever had decided in that
                    manner was a liar if a man, or a strumpet if a woman. After this insolent
                    declaration he fled to the castle of Beaujency, where, however, he was soon
                    forced to surrender. He then applied to Henry VII. who had newly ascended the
                    throne of England; but that prince, naturally cautious and deliberate, paid
                    little attention to his application. On this he next made application to the
                    court of Bretagne, where he was received with great marks of esteem, and began
                    to entertain hopes of marrying the daughter of the duke; but he was looked upon
                    with a jealous eye by the nobility, who entered into secret negotiations with
                    Anne, and even solicited her to invade the country, stipulating that only a
                    certain number of troops should enter the province, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193514344" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4344-0029"/>that no fortified place
                    should remain in the hands of the French; conditions which were indeed agreed to
                    by the regent, though she determined to keep them no longer than it suited her
                    purpose so to do. Bretagne was therefore invaded by four armies, each superior
                    to the stipulated number, who quickly made themselves masters of the most
                    important places in the country; whilst the troops of the duke retired in
                    disgust, leaving the invaders to pursue their conquests as they pleased.
                    Finding, however, that the entire subjection of their country was determined
                    upon, the nobility at last began to exert themselves in its defence, and,
                    inflamed by the enthusiasm of liberty, they raised an army of sixty thousand
                    men, by which the French were compelled to abandon the siege of Nantes. But this
                    proved only a transient gleam of success. Anne persevered in her design of
                    completing the conquest of the country, and the state of Europe was at that time
                    favourable to the design. Of all the European nations, England alone was then
                    capable of affording effectual assistance; but the slow caution of Henry
                    prevented him from giving the aid which in this case he ought to have afforded.
                    The Bretons were thus left to defend themselves as they best could; and having
                    ventured a .battle, they were entirely defeated, most of their leaders being
                    taken prisoners, whilst a small body of English who assisted them were entirely
                    cut to pieces. The duke soon afterwards died by a fall from his horse, leaving
                    his dominions to his daughter Anne, at that time only thirteen years of age. A
                    marriage was now negotiated between this princess and Maximilian king of the
                    Romans, who had previously been married to Mary of Burgundy; but, by reason of
                    the poverty of that prince, it was never completed. The Lady of Beaujeu then
                    determined to conclude a marriage between the young king of France and the
                    duchess, though the former had already been married to Margaret of Austria, the
                    daughter of Maximilian. But this marriage was not consummated, by reason of the
                    tender age of the princess, who had been sent to Paris for her education, and
                    for several years treated as queen of France; and in 1491 Margaret was returned,
                    like rejected goods, to her father. Anne of Bretagne, however, long refused to
                    violate the engagement into which she had entered; but at last, finding herself
                    pressed on all sides, and incapable of resisting the numerous forces of France,
                    she reluctantly consented to the match. Maximilian, whose proverty had prevented
                    him from giving any assistance to his bride, or even from coming to see her,
                    enraged at the double disgrace which he had suffered, began, when too late, to
                    bethink himself of revenge. France was now threatened with an invasion by the
                    united forces of Austria, Spain, and England. But this formidable confederacy
                    was soon dissipated. Henry, whose natural avarice had induced him to withhold
                    the necessary assistance, was bought off with the immediate payment of 745,000
                    crowns, and the promise of 25,000 annually ever afterwards; Ferdinand king of
                    Spain had the counties of Roussillon and Cerdagne restored to him; whilst
                    Maximilian was gratified by the cession of that part of Artois which had been
                    acquired by Louis XI.</p>
                <p>The young king of France agreed to these terms the more readily, that he was
                    impatient to undertake an expedition into Italy, in order to conquer the kingdom
                    of Naples, to which he laid claim. Most of his counsellors were opposed to this
                    expedition; but the king was inflexible, even though Ferdinand king of Naples
                    offered to do homage for his kingdom, and to pay him a tribute of fifty thousand
                    crowns a year. He appointed the Duke of Bourbon regent in his absence, and then
                    set out for Italy, with few troops, and but little money. On the march he fell
                    ill of the small-pox, but in a short time recovered, and having entered Italy
                    with a force of twelve thousand foot and six thousand horse, the greater part of
                    which consisted of regular troops, he obtained the most surprising success,
                    traversing the whole country in six ’ weeks, and rendering himself master of the
                    kingdom of Naples in less than a fortnight. To vulgar observers, his
                    extraordinary good fortune seemed miraculous; and he was reckoned an instrument
                    raised up by God to destroy the execrable tyrants by which Italy was at that
                    time afflicted; and had Charles availed himself of this prepossession in his
                    favour, and acted up to the character generally ascribed to him, he might have
                    raised his name as high as that of any hero of antiquity. But his conduct was of
                    a very different description. Instead of following up his successes, he amused
                    himself with feasts and shows, leaving his power in the hands of favourites, who
                    abandoned it to such as chose to purchase titles, places, or authority, at the
                    rates imposed; and the whole force he proposed to leave in his newly conquered
                    dominions amounted to no more than four thousand men. But whilst Charles was
                    thus idly losing precious time, a league was forming against him at Venice, to
                    which the pope, the emperor Maximilian, the archduke Philip, LudovicoSforza, and
                    the Venetians, were all parties. The confederates assembled an army of forty
                    thousand men, commanded by Francis marquis of Mantua, and waited for the king in
                    the valley of Fornova, in the duchy of Parma, into which he had descended with
                    nine thousand men. On the 6th of July 1495 he attacked the allies, and,
                    notwithstanding their great superiority of numbers, defeated them, with but
                    little loss on his part. By this victory he got safe to France; but his Italian
                    dominions were lost almost as soon as he departed. Some schemes were proposed
                    for recovering these conquests, but they were never put in execution; and the
                    king died of an apoplexy in 1498.</p>
                <p>By the death of Charles VIII. the crown of France ] passed from the direct line
                    of the house of Valois, and Louis duke of Orleans succeeded to the throne. At
                    the time of his accession he was in his thirty-sixth year, and had long been
                    taught prudence in the school of adversity. During the administration of the
                    Lady of Beaujeu he had been constantly in disgrace, and, after his connections
                    with the Duke of Bretagne, had spent a considerable time in prison; and though
                    afterwards set at liberty by Charles, he had never possessed any share of that
                    monarch’s confidence or favour. Towards the close of the preceding reign he fell
                    under the displeasure of the queen; and afterwards continued at his castle of
                    Blois till he was called thence to take possession of the throne. He had been
                    married in early life, against his will, to Jane, the youngest daughter of Louis
                    XI. a princess of an amiable disposition, but deformed in person, and supposed
                    to be incapable of bearing children. He afterwards entertained thoughts of
                    having his marriage dissolved, and was supposed to possess the affections of the
                    Duchess of Bretagne before she became queen of France. After the death of her
                    husband, that princess retired to Bretagne, where she pretended to assume
                    independent sovereignty; but Louis having got his marriage with Jane dissolved
                    by Pope Alexander VI. made proposals to the queen dowager, which were accepted
                    without hesitation, though it was stipulated that, if she had two sons, the
                    younger should inherit the duchy of Bretagne.</p>
                <p>As Louis, while Duke of Orleans, had some pretensions to the crown of Naples, he
                    now set about realizing them by conquest, and found circumstances favourable to
                    his design. The pope, Alexander VI. was devoted to his interests, in the hope of
                    getting his son Caesar Borgia provided for. Louis had conciliated the friendship
                    of the Venetians by promising them a part of the Milanese; he had also concluded
                    a truce with the archduke Philip, and renewed his alliances with the crowns of
                    England, Scotland, and Den·</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514357" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4357-0030"/>
                <p>mark. He then entered Italy with an army of twenty thousand men; and, being
                    assisted by the Venetians, con- • quered one part of the duchy, whilst they
                    conquered the other, the archduke himself being obliged to fly with his family
                    to Inspruck. He then attacked Ferdinand of Spain with three armies
                    simultaneously; but as none of these performed any thing remarkable, he was
                    obliged to evacuate the kingdom of Naples in 1504. But in 1506 the people of
                    Genoa revolted, drove out the nobility, chose eight tribunes, and declared Paul
                    Nuova, a silk dyer, their duke; after which they expelled the French governor,
                    and reduced a great part of the Riviera. This induced Louis to return into
                    Italy, where, in 1507, he obliged the Genoese to surrender at discretion, and in
                    1508 entered into a league with the other princes who at that time desired to
                    reduce the overgrown power of the Venetians. But Pope Julius II. who had been
                    the first contriver of this league, soon repented of his contrivance, and
                    declared that if the Venetians would restore the cities of Faenza and Rimini,
                    which had been unjustly taken from him, he would be contented. This was refused,
                    and in 1509 the forces of the republic received an entire defeat from Louis, in
                    consequence of which they agreed to restore not only the two cities demanded by
                    Pope Julius, but whatever else the allies required. The pope, instead of
                    executing his treaties with his allies, made war on the king of France. Upon
                    this Louis convoked an assembly of his clergy, at which it was determined that
                    in some cases it was lawful to make war upon the pope. The king therefore
                    declared war against his holiness, and committed the command of his army to the
                    Marshal de Trivulce, who soon obliged the pope to retire to Ravenna. In 1511,
                    Gaston de Foix, duke of Nemours, gained a great victory at Ravenna, but was
                    himself killed in the engagement. After his death the army was disbanded for
                    want of pay; and the French affairs in Italy, and indeed everywhere else, fell
                    into great confusion. The duchy of Milan was recovered and lost again in a few
                    weeks. Henry VIII. of England invaded France, and took Terruenne and Tournay;
                    whilst the Swiss invaded Burgundy with an army of twenty-five thousand men. In
                    this desperate situation of affairs the queen died, and Louis put an end to the
                    opposition of his most dangerous enemies by negotiating marriages. To Ferdinand
                    of Spain he offered his second daughter for either of his grandsons, Charles or
                    Ferdinand, and promised to renounce, in favour of that marriage, his claims on
                    Milan and Genoa. This proposal was accepted; and Louis himself married the
                    princess Mary, sister of Henry VIII. of England. But he did not long survive
                    this marriage; and having died on the 2d of January 1514, he was succeeded by
                    Francis I. count of Angouleme and duke of Bretagne and Valois.</p>
                <p>The new king had no sooner been seated on the throne than he resolved to
                    undertake an expedition into Italy. In this he was at first successful, having
                    defeated the Swiss at Marignon, and reduced the duchy of Milan. In 1518 the
                    emperor Maximilian having died, Francis showed himself ambitious of becoming his
                    successor, and thereby restoring to France a splendid title which had been so
                    long lost. But Maximilian, before his death, had exerted himself so much in
                    favour of Charles V. of Spain, that Francis found it impossible to succeed; and
                    from that time an irreconcilable hatred took place between these two monarchs.
                    In 1521 this bad feeling produced a war, which, however, might perhaps have been
                    terminated, if Francis could have been prevailed upon to restore the town of
                    Fontarabia, which had been taken by his admiral Bonivet. But this being refused,
                    hostilities were renewed with greater vigour than ever; nor were they concluded
                    till France had been brought to the very brink of destruction. The war was
                    continued with various success until the year 1524, when Francis having invaded
                    Italy, and laid siege to Pavia, was utterly defeated before that city, and taken
                    prisoner, on the 24th of February. This disaster threw the whole kingdom into
                    the utmost confusion. The Flemish troops made continual inroads; many thousand
                    boors assembled in Alsace, in order to invade the country from that quarter;
                    Henry VΠI.had assembled an army, and also threatened France on the side of the
                    Channel; and a party was formed in the kingdom to dispossess the duchess of the
                    regency, and confer it upon the Duke de Vendome. This prince, however, who after
                    the constable was the head of the house of Bourbon, proceeded to Lyons, where he
                    assured the regent that he had no view but for her service and that of his
                    country; and he then formed a council of the ablest men of the kingdom, of which
                    the queen appointed him president. Henry VIII. acting under the influence of
                    Cardinal Wolsey, resolved not to oppress the oppressed, and therefore assured
                    the regent that she had nothing to fear from him; at the same time that he
                    advised her not to consent to any treaty by which France was to be dismembered.
                    To the emperor, however, he is said to have held different language, telling him
                    that the time had now arrived when this puissant monarchy lay at their mercy,
                    and that therefore an opportunity so favourable should not be lost; that, for
                    his part, he would be content with Normandy, Guienne, and Gascony; that he
                    trusted the empire would make no scruple of owning him as king of France; and
                    that he expected the emperor would make a right use of his victory, by entering
                    Guienne in person, in which case he was ready to bear half the expenses of the
                    war. Alarmed at these proposed conditions, and not caring to have Henry as a
                    neighbour, the emperor agreed to a truce with the regent for six months. In
                    Picardy the Flemings were repulsed; whilst the Count de Guise and the Duke of
                    Lorraine, with a handful of troops, defeated and cut to pieces the German
                    peasants.</p>
                <p>In the mean time Francis was detained a captive in Italy; but being wearied of
                    his confinement in that country, and the princes of Italy having begun to cabal
                    for his deliverance, he was carried to Madrid, where, on the 14th of January
                    1525, he signed a treaty, the principal articles of which were, that he should
                    resign to the emperor the duchy of Burgundy in full sovereignty; desist from the
                    homage which the emperor owed him for Artois and Flanders; renounce all claim to
                    Naples, Milan, Asti, Tournay, Lisle, and Hesdin, and certain other places;
                    persuade Henry d’Albert to resign the kingdom of Navarre to the emperor, or at
                    least to give him no assistance; restore within forty days the Duke of Bourbon
                    and all his party to their estates; pay the king of England five hundred
                    thousand crowns which the emperor owed him; and, when the emperor went to Italy
                    to receive the imperiaí crown, to lend him twelve galleys, four large ships, and
                    a land force, or instead of it two hundred thousand crowns. All these articles
                    the king of France promised on the faith and honour of a prince to execute, or,
                    in case of non-per-ſormance, to return as a prisoner into Spain. But,
                    notwithstanding these professions, Francis had already protested, before certain
                    notaries and witnesses in whom he could confide, that the treaty he was about to
                    sign was compulsory, and therefore null and void. On the 21st of February the
                    emperor released him from his prison, in which he had been closely confined ever
                    since his arrival in Spain; and, after receiving from his own lips the strongest
                    assurances that he would literally fulfil the terms of the treaty, sent him
                    under a strong guard to the frontiers, where he was exchanged for his two eldest
                    sons, who were to remain as hostages for his fidelity.</p>
                <p>But when the king returned to his dominions, his first care was to get himself
                    absolved by the pope from the oaths which he had taken; and when this had been
                    accomplished, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514370" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4370-0031"
                    />he entered into a league with the pontiff, the Venetians, the Duke of Milan,
                    and the king of England, for preserving the peace of Italy. In the month of June
                    he received publicly remonstrances from the states of Burgundy, in which they
                    told him without ceremony, that by the treaty of Madrid he had done what he had
                    no right to do, in breach of the laws and his coronation oath; and that if he
                    persisted in his resolution of placing them under a foreign yoke, they must
                    appeal to the general states of the kingdom. The viceroy of Naples and the
                    Spanish ministers were present at these remonstrances, and, perceiving the end
                    at which the king aimed, expostulated with him in pretty warm terms. The
                    viceroy, in fact, told him that be had now nothing left but to keep his royal
                    word in returning to the castle of Madrid, as his predecessor John had done in a
                    similar case. To this Francis replied, that John acted rightly, because he
                    returned to a king who had treated him like a king; but that at Madrid he had
                    received such usage as would have been unbecoming to a gentleman, and he had
                    often declared to the emperor’s ministers that the terms they extorted from him
                    were unjust and impracticable. However, he was still willing to do all that was
                    fit and reasonable, and to ransom his sons at the rate of two millions of gold
                    in lieu of the duchy of Burgundy.</p>
                <p>Hitherto the treaty for tranquillizing Italy had been kept secret, in hopes that
                    some mitigation of the treaty of Madrid would have been obtained; but now it was
                    judged expedient to publish it, though the viceroy of Naples and the Spanish
                    lords still remained at the French court. The emperor was to be admitted as a
                    party to this treaty, provided he accepted the king’s offer of two millions for
                    the release of his children, and left the Duke of Milan and other Italian
                    princes in quiet possession of their dominions. But it is the common misfortune
                    of all leagues, that the powers which enter into them keep only their own
                    particular interests in view, and thus defeat the general intention of the
                    confederacy. In the present instance, the king’s great aim was to obtain his
                    children upon the terms he had proposed; and he was desirous of knowing what
                    hopes there were of accomplishing that object, before he acted against the
                    monarch who had them in his power. Thus the Duke of Milan and the pope were both
                    sacrificed. The former was obliged to surrender to the Duke of Bourbon, and the
                    latter was surprised by the Colonnas; disasters which would have been prevented
                    if the French succours had entered Italy in time. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Italy.</hi></p>
                <p>According to an agreement which had been entered into between Francis and Henry,
                    their ambassadors entered Spain, attended each of them by a herald, to summon
                    the emperor to accept the terms which had been offered him, or in case of
                    refusal to declare war. But as the emperor’s answer was foreseen in the court of
                    France, the king had previously called together an assembly of the Notables, to
                    whom he proposed the question, whether he was bound to perform the treaty of
                    Madrid? or whether, if he did not perform it, he was obliged in honour to return
                    to Spain? To both these questions the assembly answered in the negative,
                    declaring that Burgundy was united to the crown of France, and could not be
                    separated by the king’s own authority; that his person also was the property of
                    the public, of which therefore he could not dispose; but as to the two millions,
                    which they looked upon as a just equivalent, they undertook to raise it for his
                    service. When the ambassadors delivered,their propositions, Charles treated the
                    English herald with respect, and the French herald with contempt; a circumstance
                    which induced Francis to challenge the emperor. But all differences were at
                    length adjusted, and a treaty concluded at Cambray on the 5th of August 1528. By
                    this treaty, instead of actual possession, the emperor contented himself with
                    reserving his right to the duchy of Burgundy, and the payment of the two
                    millions of crowns already mentioned. Of these, he was to receive one million
                    two hundred thousand in ready money; the lands in Flanders belonging to the
                    house of Bourbon, valued at four hundred thousand, were to be delivered up; and
                    the remaining four hundred thousand were to be paid by France in discharge of
                    the emperor’s debt to England. Francis was likewise to pay the penalty of five
                    hundred thousand crowns which the emperor had incurred by not marrying his niece
                    the Princess Mary of England, and further to release a rich jewel which many
                    years before had been pawned by the house of Burgundy for fifty thousand crowns.
                    The town and castle of Hesdin were also surrendered, together with the
                    sovereignty of Flanders and Artois, and all the king’s pretensions in Italy. As
                    for the allies of France, they were, as usually happens, abandoned to the
                    emperor’s mercy, without the least stipulation in their favour; but Francis
                    consoled himself for this disgraceful dereliction by protesting against the
                    validity of the treaty before he ratified it, as did also his attorney-general
                    before he registered it in parliament, though in both instances with the
                    greatest secrecy imaginable. The remainder of this reign was not distinguished
                    by any events of consequence. The war was renewed by Charles, who invaded
                    France, though without success; nor was peace fully established until the death
                    of the French king, which happened on the 3d of March 1547.</p>
                <p>Francis was succeeded by his son Henry II. who ascended the throne at the age of
                    twenty-nine. In the beginning of his reign an insurrection broke out in Guienne,
                    owing to the oppressive conduct of the officers who levied the salt-tax, and was
                    not put down without considerable difficulty. In 1548 the king began to enforce
                    the edicts issued against the Protestants with the utmost severity; and,
                    thinking even the clergy too mild in the prosecution of heresy, he for that
                    purpose erected a chamber composed of members of the parliament of Paris. At the
                    queen’s coronation, which happened this year, he caused a number of Protestants
                    to be burned, and was himself present at the horrid spectacle, which, however,
                    shocked him so much that he never forgot it. In 1549 a peace was concluded with
                    England, and Henry purchased from the latter Boulogne, for the sum of four
                    hundred thousand crowns, one half to be paid on the day of restitution, and the
                    other half a few months afterwards. Scotland was included in the treaty, and the
                    English restored some places which they had taken in that country. This was the
                    most advantageous peace which France had hitherto concluded with England; the
                    vast arrears due to that crown being in effect remitted, and the pension, which
                    looked so like tribute, being tacitly extinguished. The Earl of Warwick himself,
                    who had concluded the peace, was in fact so sensible of the disgrace suffered by
                    this nation on this occasion, that he pretended to be sick, in order to avoid
                    setting his hand to so scandalous a compact. This year, also, an edict was made
                    to restrain the extravagant remittances which the clergy had been in use to make
                    to Rome, and for correcting other abuses committed by the papal notaries. With
                    this edict Pope Julius III. was highly displeased; and the following year, 1550,
                    war was declared by the king of France against the pope and the emperor, on the
                    ground that Henry protected Octavio Farnese, duke of Parma, whom the pope was
                    desirous of depriving of his dominions. In this war the king was threatened with
                    the censures of the church; but as the emperor soon found himself in such danger
                    from these new enemies, that he could not support the pope as he intended, the
                    latter was obliged to sue for peace. Henry continued the war against the emperor
                    with success; and having reduced the cities of Toul, Verdun, and Metz, entered
                    the country of Alsace, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514383"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4383-0032"/>reduced all the fortresses between Hagenau and
                    Wissenburg. He failed, however, in his attempt on Strasburg; <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> and was soon afterwards obliged by the German princes
                    and the Swiss to desist from all further conquests on that side. This war
                    continued with little interruption, and but small success upon the part of the
                    French, till the year 1557, when a peace was concluded; and soon afterwards the
                    king was killed at a tournament by the Count de Montgomery, one of the strongest
                    knights in France, who had done all he could to avoid this encounter.</p>
                <p>The reign of his successor Francis II. was remarkable only for the persecution of
                    the Protestants, which became so grievous that they were obliged to take up arms
                    in their own defence. This occasioned several civil wars, the first of which
                    commenced in the reign of Charles IX. who succeeded to the throne in 1560. This
                    contest continued until the year 1562, when a peace was concluded, by which the
                    Protestants were to have a complete amnesty, and enjoy entire liberty of
                    conscience. But in 1565 the war broke out afresh, and was continued with little
                    interruption until 1569, when peace was again concluded, upon terms advantageous
                    to the Protestants.</p>
                <p>After this, Charles, who had now taken the government into his hands, caressed
                    and flattered the Protestants in an extraordinary manner. Their destruction had
                    been resolved on, but as they were too powerful to be openly attacked, it was
                    judged necessary to lull them into security by means of systematic
                    dissimulation, and to fall upon them when off their guard. With this view the
                    king invited to court Admiral de Coligni, the head of the Huguenot party, and so
                    effectually cajoled him, that the gallant veteran was lulled into a fatal
                    security, notwithstanding the warnings given by his friends that the king’s fair
                    speeches were by no means to be trusted. And he had soon reason to repent his
                    confidence. On the 22d of August 1571, as he was returning from court to his
                    lodgings, he received a shot from a window, which carried away the second finger
                    of his right hand, and wounded him grievously in the left arm. This he himself
                    ascribed to the malice of the Duke of Guise, the head of the Catholic party.
                    After dinner, the king went to pay him a visit, and amongst other things
                    observed, “you have received the wound, but it is I who suffer ;” at the same
                    time desiring that he would order his friends to establish themselves around his
                    residence, and promising to prohibit the Catholics from entering that'quarter
                    after dark. This satisfied the admiral of the king’s sincerity, and prevented
                    him from complying with the wishes of his friends, who desired to carry him
                    away, and were strong enough to have forced a passage out of Paris if they had
                    attempted it.</p>
                <p>In the evening of the same day, the queen-mother, Catharine de’ Medicis, held a
                    cabinet council to fix the execution of the massacre of the Protestants, which
                    had long been meditated. The persons of whom this council was composed, were
                    Henry duke of Anjou, the king’s brother; Gonzagua duke of Nevers; Henry of
                    Angoulême, grand prior of France, the bastard brother of the king; Marshal de
                    Tavannes; and Albert de Gondi, count de Uetz: and the direction of the whole was
                    intrusted to the Duke of Guise, to whom the administration had during the former
                    reign been entirely confided. The guards were appointed to be in arms, and the
                    city officers were ordered to predispose the militia to execute the king’s
                    orders, of which the signal was to be the ringing of a bell near the Louvre. It
                    is said, indeed, that when the fatal hour, which was that of midnight,
                    approached, the king grew undetermined, and expressed great horror at the idea
                    of shedding so much blood, especially considering that the people about to be
                    destroyed were his subjects, who had come to the capital at his command, and in
                    dependence on his word, and particularly the admiral, whom he bad so lately
                    detained by his caresses. The queen-mother, however, reproached him with
                    cowardice, and representing to him the danger which he incurred from the
                    Protestants, at last induced him to consent. According to others, the king
                    himself urged on the massacre, and, when it was proposed to him only to take off
                    a few of the leaders, exclaimed, “If any are to die, let there not be one left
                    to reproach me with breach of faith.”</p>
                <p>As soon as the signal had been given, a body of Swiss troops, headed by the Duke
                    of Guise and the Chevalier d’Angoulême, accompanied by many persons of quality,
                    attacked the admiral s house; and having forced open the doors, the foremost of
                    the assassins rushed into the apartment. One of them asked if he was Coligni; to
                    which he answered that he was, adding, “Young man, respect these gray hairs.”
                    The assassin replied by running him through the body with a sword. The Duke of
                    Guise and the chevalier growing impatient below stairs, loudly demanded if the
                    business was done; and being answered in the affirmative, commanded the body to
                    be thrown out at the window. As soon as it fell on the ground, the chevalier,
                    or, as some say, the Duke of Guise, wiped the blood from the face, and kicked it
                    with his foot. The body was then abandoned to the fury of the populace, who,
                    after a series of indignities, dragged it to the common gallows, to which they
                    chained it by the foot, whilst the head, being cut off, was carried to the
                    queen-mother, who, it is said, caused it to be embalmed and transmitted to Rome.
                    The king himself went to see the body hanging upon the gibbet, where a fire
                    being kindled under it, part was burned, and the rest scorched. In the Louvre,
                    the gentlemen belonging to the king of Navarre and the prince of Condé were
                    murdered under the king s own eye. Two of them, wounded and pursued by the
                    assassins, fled into the bedchamber of the queen of Navarre, and jumped upon her
                    bed, beseeching her to save their lives; and as she proceeded to solicit this
                    favour of the queen-mother, two more, under the same circumstances, rushed into
                    the room, and threw themselves at her feet. The queen-mother repaired to the
                    window to enjoy these dreadful scenes; and the king, seeing the Protestants who
                    lodged on the other side of the river flying for their lives, called for his
                    long gun, and fired upon them. In the space of three or four days many thousands
                    were destroyed in the city of Paris alone. Peter Ramus, professor of philosophy
                    and mathematics, after being robbed of all he had, was cruelly mutilated in the
                    abdomen, and thrown from a window. During the first two days, the king denied
                    that the massacre was done by his orders, and threw the whole blame upon the
                    house of Guise; but on the 28th of August he went to the parliament, avowed the
                    incomparable atrocity, was complimented on it, and directed a process against
                    the admiral, by which he was stigmatized as a traitor. Two innocent gentlemen
                    suffered as his accomplices in a pretended plot against the life of the king, in
                    order, as was alleged, to place the crown on the head of the prince of Condé.
                    They were executed by torch light; and the king and the queen-mother, together
                    with the king of Navarre and the prince of Condé, who were forced to be present,
                    were spectators of the horrid deed. Nor was the massacre confined to the city of
                    Paris alone. On the eve of St Bartholomew, orders had been sent to the governors
                    of provinces, either to fall upon the Protestants themselves, or to let loose
                    the people on them; and though an edict was published before the end of the
                    week, assuring them of the king’s protection, and protesting that he by no means
                    designed to exterminate them on account of their religion, yet private orders
                    were issued of a directly contrary nature, in consequence of which the Matins of
                    Paris were repeated in Meaux, Orleans, Troyes, Angers, Toulouse, Rouen, and
                    Lyons; so that in the space of about two months thirty thousand Protestants were
                    butchered<pb break="no" facs="nls:193514396" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4396-0033"/> in

                    has in vain attempted to extenuate the guilt and dispute the leading facts of
                    this atrocious massacre. All his learn, ing and ingenuity have been foiled in
                    the attempt; and the result of his controversy with Mr Allen has only been to
                    confirm and settle general belief on the subject. The “vindication” of the able
                    writer last mentioned is a masterpiece of historical research and strong
                    reasoning.</p></note> The next year Rochelle, the only fortress which the
                    Protestants occupied in France, was besieged and taken, but not until
                    twenty-four thousand of the besiegers had fallen before its walls. After this a
                    pacification ensued, on terms nominally favourable to the Protestants; but as a
                    body they had been destroyed; St Bartholomew had completely broken their power;
                    and those who survived the massacre had no alternative but to accept whatever
                    terms were offered them.</p>
                <p>This year the Duke of Anjou was elected king of Poland, and soon afterwards set
                    out to take possession of his new kingdom. Charles accompanied him to the
                    frontiers; but during the journey he was seized with a slow fever, which from
                    the commencement portended death. Ĳe lingered for some time under the most
                    terrible agonies both of mind and body; and at last expired on the 30th of May
                    1572. It is said that ever after the massacre of St Bartholomew, this prince had
                    a fierceness in his looks, and adeadly paleness in his cheeks; he slept little,
                    but never soundly, and waked frequently in agonies, which the soft music
                    employed to lull him into repose often failed to allay. The sting of remorse was
                    deeply infixed in his soul, and in a little time its poison drank up his
                    spirit.</p>
                <p>During the first years of the reign of Henry III. who succeeded his brother
                    Charles IX. die war with the Protestants was carried on with indifferent success
                    upon the part of the Catholics. In 1575 a peace was concluded, which by way of
                    eminence was called the Edict of Pacification. The treaty consisted of no fewer
                    than sixty-three articles, the substance of which was, that liberty of
                    conscience, and the public exercise of religion, were granted to the reformed,
                    without any restriction except that they were not to preach within two leagues
                    of Paris, nor in any other part where the court might be. The judgments against
                    the admiral, and others who had either fallen in the war or been executed, were
                    also reversed; and eight cautionary towns were given up to the Protestants.</p>
                <p>This edict induced the Guises to form an association in defence (as was
                    pretended) of the Catholic religion, which afterwards became known by the name
                    of the Catholic League. This confederacy, though the king was mentioned with
                    respect, struck at the very root of his authority; for, as the Protestants had
                    their leaders, so the Catholics were in future to be entirely dependent on the
                    chief of the league, and to execute whatever he commanded, for the good of the
                    cause, without exception of persons. In order to neutralize the bad effects of
                    this association, the king, by the advice of his council, declared himself the
                    head of the league; and in this character he recommenced the war against the
                    Protestants, which was not extinguished as long as he lived. In the mean time
                    the faction of the Duke of Guise resolved to support Charles cardinal of
                    Bourbon, a weak old man, as presumptive heir of the crown; and having entered
                    into a league with Spain, they in 1584 took up arms against the king; and though
                    peace was concluded the same year, yet in 1587 they again proceeded to such
                    extremities that the king was forced to fly from Paris. Another reconciliation
                    was soon afterwards effected; but it is generally believed that the king from
                    this time resolved on the destruction of the Duke of Guise. Accordingly, finding
                    that this nobleman still behaved with his usual haughtiness, the king caused him
                    to be stabbed by his guards on the 23d of December 1587. But Henry himself did
                    not long survive this deed, being stabbed by one Jacques Clement, a Jacobin
                    monk, on the first of August 1588. His wound was not at first thought mortal;
                    but his frequent swooning quickly discovered his danger, and he died the
                    following morning, in the thirty-ninth year of his age and sixteenth of his
                    reign.</p>
                <p>Before the king’s death he had nominated Henry Bourbon, king of Navarre, as his
                    successor on the throne of France; but as the latter was a Protestant, or at
                    least one who greatly favoured their cause, he was at first owned by very few
                    except those of the Protestant party. He met with the most violent opposition
                    from the members of the Catholic League, and was often reduced to such
                    extremities that he went to people’s houses under colour of visits, when in
                    reality he had not a dinner in his own. By his activity and perseverance,
                    however, he was at last acknowledged by the whole kingdom, a consummation to
                    which his abjuration of the Protestant religion not a little contributed. As the
                    king of Spain had laid claim to the crown of France, Henry no sooner found
                    himself in a fair way of being firmly seated on the throne, than he formally
                    declared war against that kingdom; and having proved successful, he, in 1597,
                    entered upon the quiet possession of his kingdom.</p>
                <p>The king’s first care was to put an end to the religious disputes which had so
                    long distracted the kingdom. For this purpose he passed the famous edict, dated
                    at Nantes, 13th April 1598, which re-established in a solid and effectual manner
                    all the favours which had been granted to the reformed, and added some which had
                    pot been thought of before, particularly that of allowing them a free admission
                    to all employments of trust, profit, and honour, establishing chambers in which
                    the members of the two religions were equal, and the permitting their children
                    to be educated without restraint in any of the universities. Soon afterwards he
                    concluded peace with Spain upon advantageous terms; an event which afforded him
                    an opportunity of restoring order and justice throughout his dominions,
                    repairing the ravages occasioned by the civil war, and abolishing all those
                    innovations which had been made, either to the prejudice of the prerogatives of
                    the crown or the welfare of the people. His schemes of reformation, indeed, he
                    intended to have carried much beyond the boundaries of France. If we may believe
                    the Duke of Sully, he had in view no less a design than the new-modelling of all
                    Europe. He imagined that the European powers might be formed into a kind of
                    Christian republic, by rendering them as nearly as possible of equal strength;
                    and that this republic might be maintained in perpetual peace, by bringing all
                    their differences to be decided before a senate of wise, disinterested, and able
                    judges. The number of these powers was to be fifteen, the Papacy, the empire of
                    Germany, France, Spain, Hungary, Great Britain, Bohemia, Lombardy, Poland,
                    Sweden, Denmark, the republic of Venice, the States General, the Swiss Cantons,
                    and the Italian commonwealth, comprehending the states of Florence, Genoa,
                    Lucca, Modena, Parma, Mantua, and Monaco. In order to render the states equal,
                    the empire was to be given to the Duke of Bavaria; the kingdom of Naples to the
                    pope; that of Sicily to the Venetians; Milan to the Duke of Savoy, who, by this
                    acquisition, was to become king of Lombardy; the Austrian Low Countries were to
                    be added to the Dutch republic; and Franche Comté, Alsace, and the country of
                    Trent, were to be given to the Swiss. With the view, it is now thought, of
                    executing this grand project, but under pretence of reducing the exorbitant
                    power of the house of Austria, Henry made immense preparations both by sea and
                    land; but <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514409" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4409-0034"/>if
                    he really entertained such a design, he was prevented by death from attempting
                    its execution. He was stabbed in his coach by Ravaillac, on the 12th of May
                    1608.</p>
                <p>On the death of Henry IV. the queen-mother assumed the regency. Ravaillac was
                    executed, after suffering the most exquisite tortures. It is said that he made a
                    confession, which was so written by the person who took it, that not a word of
                    it could be read, and thus his instigators and accomplices were never
                    discovered. The regency, during the minority of Louis XIII. was only remarkable
                    for the cabals and intrigues of the courtiers. In 1617 the king assumed the
                    government, banished the queenmother to Blois, caused Marshal d’Ancre, her
                    favourite, to be put to death, and chose as his minister the celebrated Cardinal
                    Richelieu. In 1620 a new war broke out between the Catholics and Protestants,
                    which was carried on with the greatest fury on both sides. Of this we have an
                    instance in what took place at Negreplisse, a town in Quercy. This place was
                    besieged by the king’s troops, and it was resolved to make an example of the
                    inhabitants, who had absolutely refused to surrender upon any terms. They
                    defended themselves with desperate valour; and when at last the city was taken
                    by storm, they were all massacred, without distinction of rank, sex, or age. But
                    both parties soon became weary of so destructive a war; and a peace was
                    concluded in 1621, by which the edict of Nantes was confirmed. This treaty,
                    however, was not of long duration. A new war broke out, which lasted till the
                    year 1628, when the edict of Nantes was again confirmed; but the Protestants
                    were deprived of their cautionary towns, and consequently of the power of
                    defending themselves in time to come. This put an end to the civil wars on
                    account of religion, in which a million of men lost their lives, 150,000,000
                    livres were expended, and nine cities, four hundred villages, two thousand
                    churches, two thousand monasteries, and ten thousand houses, were burned or
                    otherwise destroyed. The next year the king was attacked with a slow fever,
                    extreme depression of spirits, and swelling in the stomach and abdomen. But the
                    year following he recovered, to the great disappointment of his mother, who had
                    hopes of regaining her power. Meanwhile Richelieu, by a masterly system of
                    policy, supported the Protestants of Germany and Gustavus Adolphus against the
                    house of Austria; and, after suppressing all the rebellions and conspiracies
                    which had been formed against him in France, died some months before Louis XIII.
                    in 1643.</p>
                <p>Louis XIV. surnamed the Great, succeeded to the throne of France when he was only
                    five years of age. During his minority, the kingdom, under the administration of
                    his mother, Anne of Austria, was thrown into confusion by the factions of the
                    great, and the divisions between the court and parliament. The prince of Condé
                    blazed like an erratic star; sometimes a patriot, sometimes a courtier,
                    sometimes a rebel. He was opposed by Turenne, who from being a Protestant had
                    become Catholic. The kingdom of France was involved both in civil and domestic
                    wars; but the queen-mother having made choice of Cardinal Mazarin as her first
                    minister, the latter found means to turn the arms even of Cromwell against the
                    Spaniards, and so effectually divided the domestic enemies of the court, that
                    when Louis assumed the reins of government he found himself the most absolute
                    monarch who had ever sat upon the throne of France. On the death of Mazarin he
                    had the good fortune to put the administration of affairs into the hands of
                    Colbert, a minister who formed new systems for improving the commerce and
                    manufactures of France, which he carried to a surprising height of prosperity.
                    The king himself, ignorant and vain, was blind to every patriotic duty,
                    promoting the interests of his subjects only that they might the better answer
                    the purposes of his greatness; and, actuated by an overweening ambition,
                    embroiled himself with all his neighbours, and wantonly rendered Germany a scene
                    of devastation. By his impolitic and unjust revocation of the edict of Nantes in
                    the year 1685, with the dragonade which followed it, he obliged the Protestants
                    to take shelter in England, Holland, and different parts of Germany, where they
                    established the silk manufacture, to the great prejudice of their own country.
                    He was so blinded by flattery, that he arrogated to himself the heathen honours
                    paid to the emperors of Rome; he made and violated treaties for his convenience;
                    and in the end raised up against himself a confederacy of almost all the princes
                    of Europe, at the head of which was King William III. of England. He was so well
                    served, however, that for some years he made head against this alliance; and
                    France seemed to have attained the highest pitch of military glory. But having
                    provoked the English by his repeated perfidy, their arms under the Duke of
                    Marlborough, and those of the Austrians under Prince Eugene, rendered the latter
                    part of his life as miserable as the beginning of it had been splendid. From
                    1702 to 1711 his reign was one continued series of defeats and disasters; and he
                    had the mortification of seeing those places reduced, which in the former part
                    of his reign were acquired at an enormous expense of blood and treasure. But
                    when Marlborough and Eugene were preparing to invade France at the head of their
                    victorious troops, and to march directly to the capital, Louis, now tottering on
                    the verge of destruction, was saved from ruin by the English Tory ministry
                    deserting the cause, withdrawing from their allies, and concluding the
                    inglorious peace of Utrecht in 1713. (See article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Britain.)</hi> The last years of Louis were also embittered by domestic
                    misfortunes, which, added to those of a public nature which had befallen him,
                    impressed him with a deep melancholy. He had been for some time afflicted with a
                    fistula, which, though successfully cut, ever afterwards affected his health.
                    The year before the peace was concluded, his only son, the Duke of Burgundy,
                    died; a blow which was the more severely felt because it admitted of no
                    alleviation. The king himself survived till the month of September 1715, when he
                    expired, leaving the kingdom to his grandson Louis, then a minor. The reign of
                    Louis XIV. is considered as the Augustan age of French literature.</p>
                <p>By the last will of Louis XIV. the regency during the minority of the young king
                    devolved upon a council, at the head of which was the Duke of Orleans. That
                    nobleman, however, disgusted with an arrangement which gave him only a casting
                    vote, appealed to the parliament of Paris, who set aside the will of the late
                    king, and declared him sole regent. His first acts were extremely popular, and
                    gave a favourable impression of his government and character. He restored to the
                    parliament the right which had been taken from them of remonstrating against the
                    edicts of the crown, and compelled those who had enriched themselves during the
                    former reign to restore their ill-gotten wealth. He also took every method to
                    efface the calamities occasioned by the unsuccessful wars in which his
                    predecessor had engaged; promoted commerce and agriculture; and, by a close
                    alliance with Great Britain and the United Provinces, seemed anxious to lay the
                    foundation of lasting tranquillity. But this happy prospect was soon overcast by
                    the intrigues of Alberoni the Spanish minister, who had formed a design of
                    recovering Sardinia from the emperor, and Sicily from the Duke of Savoy, and
                    also of establishing the Pretender on the throne of Britain. To accomplish these
                    objects he negotiated with the Ottoman Porte, Peter the Great of Russia, and
                    Charles XII. of Sweden; the Turks were to resume the war against the emperor,
                    and the two latter <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514422"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4422-0035"/>powers to invade Great Britain. But, as long as
                    the Duke of Orleans retained the administration of France, he found it
                    impossible to bring his schemes into play. To remove this obstacle, therefore,
                    he fomented divisions in the kingdom. An insurrection having taken place in
                    Bretagne, Alberoni sent small parties into the country in disguise to support
                    the insurgents, and even laid plots to seize the regent himself. But the
                    intrigues of the Spanish minister misgave in every direction. His partisans in
                    France were put to death; the king of Sweden was killed at Frederickshall in
                    Norway; the Czar, intent on improving his own institutions, could not be
                    persuaded to make war upon Britain; and the Turks refused to engage in a war
                    with a power from which they had recently suffered so deeply. The cardinal,
                    however, persevered in his intrigues, which soon produced a war between Spain on
                    the one hand, and France and Britain on the other. But the Spaniards, unable to
                    resist the union of two such formidable powers, were soon reduced to the
                    necessity of suing for peace; and the terms were dictated by the regent of
                    France, one of which was the dismission of Alberoni.</p>
                <p>The spirit of conquest having now in a great measure subsided, that of commerce
                    came in its stead, and France became the scene of as remarkable a project as
                    ever was known in any country. John Law, a Scotchman, who had found it
                    convenient to leave his own country, formed the plan of a company which by its
                    notes was to pay off the debt of the nation, and reimburse itself by the
                    profits. Law had wandered throughout various parts of Europe, and had
                    successively endeavoured to engage the attention of various courts. The same
                    proposal had been made to Victor Amadeus, king of Sicily; but the latter
                    dismissed Law with the reply, that he was not rich enough to ruin himself. In
                    France, however, it was looked upon in a more favourable light; and as the
                    nation was at this time involved in a debt of two hundred millions, the regent
                    and the people in general were ready to embark in almost any new scheme which
                    might be proposed. The bank thus established proceeded at first with some degree
                    of caution; but having gradually extended its credit to more than eighty times
                    its real stock, it soon became unable to answer the demands made upon it, and
                    the company was dissolved the very same year in which it had been instituted.
                    The confusion into which the kingdom was thrown by this fatal scheme required
                    the utmost exertions of the regent to put a stop to it; and scarcely had this
                    been accomplished when the king, in the year 1723, took the government into his
                    own hands. The duke then became minister, but did not long enjoy this office.
                    His irregularities had broken his constitution, and brought on a number of
                    maladies, under which he in a short time sunk, and was succeeded in the
                    administration by the Duke of Bourbon. The king, as we have already remarked,
                    had been married when young to the infanta of Spain, though by reason of his
                    tender years the marriage had never been completed. This princess, however, had
                    been brought to Paris, and for some time treated as queen of France; but as
                    Louis grew up, it was easy to perceive that he had contracted an inveterate
                    hatred against the intended partner of his bed. The minister, therefore, at last
                    consented that the princess should be sent back; an affront so much resented by
                    the queen her mother, that it had almost produced a war between the two nations.
                    The dissolution of the marriage of Louis was the last act of Conde’s
                    administration, and the negotiating a new match was the first act of his
                    successor Cardinal Fleury. The princess pitched upon was the daughter of
                    Stanislaus Leczinski, king of Poland, who had been deposed by Charles XII. of
                    Sweden. This princess was destitute of persona) charms, but of an amiable
                    disposition; and though it is probable that she never possessed the affections
                    of her husband, her excellent qualities could not but extort his esteem; whilst
                    the birth of a prince soon after their marriage removed all the fears of the
                    people, if they had any, concerning the succession.</p>
                <p>Cardinal Fleury continued the pacific policy pursued by his predecessors, though
                    it was somewhat interrupted by the war which took place in the year 1733. But
                    notwithstanding the connection between the sovereign of Poland and the French
                    nation, Fleury was so parsimonious of his assistance, that only fifteen hundred
                    soldiers were sent to relieve Dantzick, where Stanislaus was at that time
                    besieged by the Russians. This pitiful reinforcement was soon overpowered by the
                    Russians; and Stanislaus was at last obliged to renounce all thoughts of the
                    crown of Poland, though he was permitted to retain the title of king. Fleury so
                    steadily pursued his pacific plans, that the disputes between Spain and England
                    in 1737 but little affected the peace of France; and it should be remembered to
                    his praise, that instead of fomenting quarrels between the neighbouring
                    potentates, he laboured incessantly to maintain peace and concord. He reconciled
                    the Genoese and Corsicans, who wer e at war; and his mediation was accepted by
                    the Ottoman Porte, which, through his intercession, concluded a treaty with the
                    emperor. But all his endeavours to preserve the general peace proved at last
                    ineffectual. The death of the emperor Charles VI. in 1740, the last prince of
                    the house of Austria, set all Europe in a flame. His eldest daughter, Maria
                    Theresa, claimed the Austrian succession, comprehending the kingdoms of Hungary
                    and Bohemia, the duchy of Silesia, Austrian Suabia, Upper and Lower Austria,
                    Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, the four forest towns, Burgau, Brisgau, the Low
                    Countries, Friuli, Tyrol, the duchy of Milan, and the duchies of Parma and
                    Placentia. Amongst the many competitors who pretended a right to share, or
                    wholly to inherit, these extensive dominions, the king of France was one. But as
                    he cared not to awaken the jealousy of the European princes by preferring
                    directly his own pretensions, he chose rather to support those of Frederick HL,
                    who laid claim to the duchy of Silesia. This brought on the war of 1740 (see
                    articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Britain</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Prussia),</hi> which was terminated in 1748 by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.
                    But Louis, who had secretly meditated a severe vengeance against Britain, only
                    consented to give his aid, that he might have time to repair his fleet, and put
                    himself somewhat more upon an equality with so formidable a power. Meanwhile the
                    internal tranquillity of the kingdom was disturbed by violent disputes between
                    the clergy and parliaments of France. In the reign of Louis XIV. there had been
                    vehement contests between the Jansenists and Jesuits, concerning free will, and
                    other obscure points of theology; and the opinions of the Jansenists had been
                    declared heretical by the celebrated bull <hi rend="italic">Unigenitus,</hi> the
                    reception of which was enforced by the king, in opposition to the parliaments,
                    the Archbishop of Paris, and the great body of the people. The archbishop, with
                    fifteen other prelates, protested against it as an infringement of the rights of
                    the Gallican church and the laws of the realm, and also as an infringement of
                    the rights of the people themselves. The Duke of Orleans favoured the bull by
                    inducing the bishops to submit to it, but at the same time he stopped a
                    persecution which had been commenced against its opponents. Matters continued in
                    this state until the conclusion of the peace. But a short time afterwards the
                    jealousy of the clergy was awakened by an attempt of the minister to inquire
                    into the wealth of individuals of their order. To prevent this they revived the
                    contest about the bull <hi rend="italic">Unigenitus,</hi> and it was resolved
                    that confessional notes should be obtained of dying persons; that these notes
                    should be signed by priests who maintained the authority<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193514435" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4435-0036"/> of the ball; and that,
                    without such notes, no person could obtain the viaticum, or extreme unction. On
                    this occasion the new Archbishop of Paris and the parliament of that city having
                    taken opposite sides, the latter imprisoned such of the clergy as refused to
                    administer the sacraments. Other parliaments followed the example of that of
                    Paris; and a contest was instantly kindled up between the civil and
                    ecclesiastical departments of the state. But the king having interfered in the
                    dispute, forbade the parliaments to take cognizance of ecclesiastical
                    proceedings, and commanded them to suspend all prosecutions relative to the
                    refusal of the sacraments. Instead of acquiescing, however, the parliaments
                    presented new remonstrances, refused to attend to any other business, and
                    resolved that they could not obey this injunction without violating their duty
                    as well as their oath. They cited the Bishop of Orleans before their tribunal,
                    and ordered all writings in which its jurisdiction was disputed to be burned by
                    the executioner. With the assistance of the military they enforced the
                    administration of the sacraments to the sick, and ceased to distribute that
                    justice to the subject for which they had been originally instituted. Enraged at
                    their obstinacy, the king arrested and imprisoned four of the members who had
                    been most obstinate, and banished the remainder to Bourges, Poitiers, and
                    Auvergne; whilst, to prevent any impediment to the administration of justice in
                    their absence, he issued letters patent, by which a royal chamber for the
                    prosecution of civil and criminal suits was instituted. But the counsellors
                    refused to plead before these new courts; and the king, finding that the whole
                    nation was about to fall into a state of anarchy, thought proper to recall the
                    parliament. The banished members entered Paris amidst the acclamations of the
                    inhabitants; and the archbishop, who still continued to encourage the priests in
                    refusing the sacraments, was banished to his seat at Conflans, as were also the
                    Bishops of Orleans and Troyes; and for the present tranquillity was restored to
                    the kingdom.</p>
                <p>But the tranquillity thus established was not of long duration. In the year 1756,
                    the parliaments again fell under the displeasure of the king, by their imprudent
                    persecution of those who adhered to the bull <hi rend="italic">Unigenitus,</hi>
                    and even proceeded so far in this opposition as to refuse to register certain
                    taxes absolutely necessary for carrying on the war. Louis was so provoked at
                    this, that he suppressed the fourth and fifth chambers of inquests, the members
                    of which had distinguished themselves by their opposition to his will. He
                    commanded the bull <hi rend="italic">Unigenitus</hi> to be respected, and
                    prohibited the secular judges from ordering the administration of the
                    sacraments. On this, fifteen counsellors of the great chamber resigned their
                    offices, and a hundred and twenty-four members of the different parliaments
                    followed their example; and the most grievous discontent pervaded the kingdom.
                    Meanwhile an attempt was made by a fanatic, named Damien, to assassinate the
                    king; and he was actually wounded, though slightly, in the midst of his guards.
                    The assassin was put to the most exquisite tortures, under which he persisted in
                    declaring that he had no intention to kill the king, but that his design was
                    only to wound him, that God might touch his heart, and incline him to restore
                    peace to his dominions. But these expressions, which undoubtedly indicated
                    insanity, had no effect on his judges, who consigned him to one of the most
                    horrid deaths which the ingenuity of man ever invented. This attempt, however,
                    seems to have produced some effect upon the king; for he soon afterwards
                    banished the Archbishop of Paris, who had been recalled,and once more
                    accommodated matters with his parliament.</p>
                <p>The unfortunate issue of the war of 1755 had brought the nation to the brink of
                    ruin, when Louis implored the assistance of Spain; and upon this occasion was
                    signed the celebrated Family Compact, by which, with the single exception of the
                    American trade, the subjects of France and Spain were naturalized in both
                    kingdoms, and the enemy of the one sovereign was to be invariably looked upon as
                    the enemy of the other. At this time, however, the assistance of Spain availed
                    but little, for both powers were reduced to the lowest ebb, and the arms of
                    Britain were triumphant in every quarter of the globe. See the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Britain.</hi></p>
                <p>The peace which was concluded at Paris in the year 1763, though it freed the
                    nation from a most destructive and bloody war, did not restore internal
                    tranquillity. The parliament, eager to pursue the victory which they had
                    formerly gained over their religious enemies, now directed their efforts against
                    the Jesuits, who had obtained and enforced the bull <hi rend="italic"
                    >Unigenitus.</hi> But that once powerful order was now on the brink of
                    destruction. A detestation of its principles, and even of its members, had for
                    some time prevailed; and a conspiracy, formed, or said to have been formed, by
                    this order against the king of Portugal, and from which he narrowly escaped,
                    roused the indignation of Europe, which was still further inflamed by some
                    fraudulent practices of which they had been guilty in France. La Valette, the
                    chief of their missionaries in Martinico had, ever since the peace at
                    Aix-la-Chapelle, carried on an extensive commerce, insomuch that when the war
                    with Great Britain commenced in 1755, he even aspired to monopolize the whole
                    West India trade. Leonay and Gouffre, merchants at Marseilles, in expectation of
                    receiving from him merchandise to the value of two millions, had accepted bills
                    drawn by the Jesuits to the amount of a million and a half. But unhappily, owing
                    to the vast number of captures made by the British, the returns were not made;
                    in consequence of which the missionaries were obliged to apply to the society of
                    Jesuits at large. But the latter, either ignorant of their true interest, or too
                    tardy in giving assistance, suffered the merchants to stop payment, and thus not
                    only to bring ruin upon themselves, but to involve a great many others in the
                    same calamity. Their creditors demanded indemnification from the society at
                    large, and, upon the refusal of the latter to satisfy them, brought the cause
                    before the parliament of Paris. And that body, again, being eager to avenge
                    itself on such powerful adversaries, carried on the most violent persecutions
                    against them, in the course of which the volume containing the constitution and
                    government of the order itself was appealed to, and produced in court. It then
                    appeared that the order of Jesuits formed a distinct body in the state,
                    submitting implicitly to their chief, who alone was absolute over their lives
                    and fortunes; and it was likewise discovered that, after a former expulsion,
                    they had been admitted into the kingdom upon conditions which they had never
                    fulfilled, and to which their chief had obstinately refused to subscribe; and
                    consequently, that their actual existence in the nation was merely the effect of
                    sufferance. The result was, that the writings of the Jesuits were found to
                    contain doctrines subversive of all civil government, and injurious to the
                    security of the sacred persons of sovereigns; the attempt of Damien against the
                    king was attributed to this body; and every thing seemed to prognosticate their
                    speedy dissolution. At this critical moment, however, the king interfered, and
                    by his royal mandate suspended all proceedings against them for a year. A plan
                    of accommodation was then drawn up, and submitted to the pope and the general of
                    the order; but the latter, by his ill-timed haughtiness, entirely destroyed all
                    hope of reconciliation. The king withdrew his protection, and the parliament
                    redoubled its efforts against them. The bulls, briefs, constitutions, and other
                    regulations of the society, were declared to be encroachments on the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193514448" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4448-0037"/> public authority,
                    and abuses of government; the society itself was finally dissolved, and its
                    members were declared • incapable of holding any clerical or municipal offices;
                    their colleges were seized, their effects confiscated, and the order itself in
                    fact annihilated.</p>
                <p>The parliament, having gained this victory, next made an attempt to set bounds to
                    the power of the king himself. They now refused to enregister an edict which
                    Louis had issued for the continuation of some taxes which should have ended with
                    the war, and likewise to conform to another by which the king was enabled to
                    redeem his debts at an inadequate rate. The court attempted to get the edicts
                    enregistered by force, but the parliaments everywhere showed a disposition to
                    resist to the uttermost. In 1766, the parliament of Bretagne having refused the
                    crown a gift of seven hundred thousand livres, were in consequence singled out
                    for royal vengeance; but whilst matters were on the point of coming to
                    extremities, the king thought proper to drop the process altogether, and to
                    publish a general amnesty. The parliaments, however, now affected to despise the
                    royal clemency; a circumstance which exasperated the king so much that he
                    ordered the counsellors of the parliament of Bretagne who had refused to resume
                    the functions of which he deprived them, to be included in the list of those who
                    were to be drafted for militia, which was accordingly done. The parliament of
                    Paris remonstrated so freely against this proceeding that they also fell under
                    the royal censure; but Louis in the most explicit manner declared that he would
                    suffer no earthly power to interfere with his will.</p>
                <p>The interval of domestic tranquillity which now ensued was employed by the king
                    in humbling the pride of the pope. The French monarch reclaimed the territories
                    of Avignon and Venaissin; and whilst the pontiff denounced his unavailing
                    censures, the Marquis de Rochecouart, with a single regiment of soldiers, drove
                    out the troops of his holiness, and took possession of these territories. But a
                    much more formidable opposition was made by the natives of the small island of
                    Corsica, the sovereignty of which had been transferred to France by the Genoese,
                    its former masters, on condition of Louis reinstating them in possession of the
                    island of Caprala, which the Corsicans had lately reduced. These islanders
                    defended themselves with desperate intrepidity; and it was only after two
                    campaigns, in which several thousands of the bravest troops of France were
                    killed, that they could be brought under subjection.</p>
                <p>The satisfaction which this unimportant conquest afforded to Louis was clouded by
                    the distress of the nation. The East India Company bad totally failed, and most
                    of tile principal commercial houses in the kingdom were involved in the same
                    calamity. The minister, the Due de Choiseul, by one desperate stroke, reduced
                    the interest of the funds one half, and at the same time took away the benefit
                    of survivorship in the tontines, by which means the national credit was greatly
                    affected; the altercation between the king and his parliaments also revived, and
                    the dissensions became worse than ever. The Due de Choiseul attempted in vain to
                    conciliate these differences; but his efforts tended only to bring misfortunes
                    upon himself, and in 1771 he was banished by the king, who suspected him of
                    favouring the popular party. This was won afterwards followed by the banishment
                    of the parliament of Paris, and by that of a number of others; new parliaments
                    being chosen in the room of those which had been expelled. But the people were
                    by no means disposed to pay the same regard to these new parliaments as they had
                    done to the old ones, though every appearance of opposition was at last silenced
                    by the absolute authority of the king. In the midst of this plenitude of power,
                    however, his majesty’s health daily declined, and the end of his days was
                    evidently at no great distance. As he had all along indulged himself to excess
                    in sensual pleasures, so now these proved the immediate means of his
                    destruction. His favourite mistress, Madame de Pompadour, who for a considerable
                    time governed him with an absolute sway, had been long dead, and the king had
                    become equally enslaved by the charms of Madame du Barry. But even her beauty at
                    length proved insufficient to excite desire; and a succession of mistresses
                    became necessary to rouse the languid appetites of the king. One of these, who
                    happened to be infected with the small-Įiox, communicated the disease to the
                    king, who in a short time died of it, notwithstanding all the assistance which
                    could be afforded him by the physicians.</p>
                <p>The new king, Louis XVI., grandson to the former, ascended the throne in the year
                    1774, in the twentieth year of his age; and, to secure himself against the
                    disease which had proved fatal to his predecessor, submitted to inoculation,
                    together with several other members of the royal family. Their quick and easy
                    recovery contributed much to extend the practice throughout the kingdom, and to
                    remove the prejudices which had been entertained against it.</p>
                <p>The king had no sooner regained his health than he applied himself diligently to
                    extinguish the differences which had arisen between his predecessor and the
                    people. He removed from their employments those persons who had given just cause
                    of complaint by their arbitrary and oppressive conduct; and he conciliated the
                    affection of his subjects by discharging the new and recalling the old
                    parliaments. But though the prudence of Louis had suggested to him these
                    compliances, he still endeavoured to preserve entire the royal authority. He
                    explained his intentions in a speech delivered in the great chamber of
                    parliament. The step which he had taken to ensure the tranquillity and happiness
                    of his subjects ought not, he observed, to invalidate his own authority; and he
                    hoped, from the zeal and attachment of the assembly, an example of submission to
                    the rest of his subjects. Their repeated resistance to the commands of his
                    grandfather had compelled that monarch to maintain his prerogative by their
                    banishment; but they were now recalled in the expectation that they would
                    quietly exercise their functions, and display their gratitude by their
                    obedience. He declared that it was his desire to bury in oblivion all past
                    grievances; that he should ever behold with extreme disapprobation whatever
                    might tend to create divisions and disturb the general tranquillity; and that
                    the chancellor would read an ordonnance to the assembly, from which they might
                    be assured he would not suffer the smallest deviation to be made. This
                    ordonnance was conceived in the most explicit terms, and immediately registered.
                    It limited within narrow bounds the pretensions of the parliament of Paris. The
                    members were forbidden to look upon themselves as one body with the other
                    parliaments of the kingdom, or to take any step or assume any title which might
                    tend towards or imply such an union. They were enjoined never to relinquish the
                    administration of public justice, excepting in cases of absolute necessity, for
                    which the first president was to be responsible to the king; and it was
                    provided, that in the event of disobedience, the grand council might replace the
                    parliament without any new edict for the purpose. They were still, however,
                    permitted to exercise the right of remonstrating before the registering of
                    edicts or letters-patent which they might conceive injurious to the welfare of
                    the people, provided they preserved in their representations the respect due to
                    the throne. But these remonstrances were not to be repeated, and if they proved
                    ineffectual, the parliament were to enregister the edict objected to within a
                    month at furthest from the day of its publication. They were forbidden to issue
                    any arrets which might tend to excite trouble, or in any manner retard the
                    execution of the king’s ordonnances; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514461"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4461-0038"/>and they were assured that, as long as they
                    adhered to the bounds prescribed, they might depend upon the coun- tenance and
                    protection of the sovereign. In short, the terms on which Louis consented to
                    re-establish the parliaments were such that they were reduced to mere ciphers,
                    and the will of the king still continued to be the only law in the kingdom. The
                    Archbishop of Paris, who had likewise presumed to raise some commotions
                    regarding the bull <hi rend="italic">Unigenitus,</hi> was obliged to submit, and
                    severely threatened if he should afterwards interfere in such a matter.</p>
                <p>The final conquest of the Corsicans, who had once more attempted to regain their
                    former liberty, was the first event of importance which took place after the
                    restoration of tranquillity. But, from various causes, the kingdom was still
                    filled with disorder. A scarcity of corn having taken place at the time when
                    some regulations had been made by Μ. Turgot, the new minister of finance, the
                    populace rose in great numbers, and committed such outrages that a military
                    force became necessary to quell them; and it was not until upwards of five
                    hundred of these starving creatures were destroyed that they could be reduced.
                    The king, however, by his prudent and vigorous conduct on this occasion, put a
                    stop to all riots, and displayed his clemency as well as prudence in the methode
                    which he adopted for the restoration of the public tranquillity. He also seized
                    the first moments of peace to fulfil those promises of economy which on his
                    accession he had given to the people. Particular attention was likewise paid to
                    the state of the marine. TheappointmentofM.de Sartine in 1776 to the naval
                    department did honour to the penetration of the sovereign. That minister,
                    fruitful in resources, and unwearied in application, was incessantly engaged in
                    augmenting the naval strength of his country; and the various preparations which
                    filled the ports and docks created no small uneasiness on the other side of the
                    Channel. The next appointment made by the king was equally fortunate, and in one
                    respect singular and unprecedented. Μ. Turgot, though possessed of integrity and
                    industry, had not been able to command the public confidence. On his retreat, Μ.
                    Clugny, intendant-general of Bordeaux, had been elevated to the vacant office;
                    but the latter having soon afterwards died, Μ. Taboureau des Reaux was appointed
                    his successor; and the king associated with him in the management of the
                    finances Μ. Neckar, who was a Swiss and a Protestant. In the preceding reign
                    that gentleman had been chosen to adjust some differences between the East India
                    Company and the crown, and had discharged his trust in a manner which gained him
                    the approbation of both parties. Possessed of distinguished abilities, his
                    appointment would have excited no surprise, had it not been contrary to the
                    constant policy of France, which had carefully excluded the aliens from
                    exercising any control in matters of revenue.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> f</hi> Although the French monarch was of a pacific
                    disposition, and not destitute of generosity of sentiment, yet his own and the
                    public exultation had been openly and constantly proportioned to the success of
                    the Americans in their contest with Britain. The princes of the blood and the
                    chief nobility were eager to embark in support of the cause of freedom; and the
                    prudence of the king and his most confidential ministers alone restrained their
                    ardour. The fatal events of the former war were still impressed on the mind of
                    Louis; and he could not readily consent to expose his rising marine in a contest
                    with a nation which had so frequently asserted the dominion of the seas, and had
                    so lately broken the united strength of the house of Bourbon. At the same time
                    he was sensible that the opportunity of humbling England should not be entirely
                    neglected, and that some advantage should be taken of the present commotions in
                    America. Two agents from the United States, Silas Deane and Dr Benjamin
                    Franklin, had successively arrived at Paris; and though all audience was denied
                    them in a public capacity, still they were privately encouraged to hope that
                    France only waited for a favourable opportunity to assist in conquering the
                    independence of America. In the mean while, the American cruisers were
                    hospitably received in the French ports; artillery and all kinds of warlike
                    stores were freely sold or liberally granted to the colonists; and, with the
                    connivance of government, French officers and engineers entered their
                    service.</p>
                <p>Some changes were about this time introduced into the different departments of
                    state. The conduct of Μ. Neckar in the finances had given general satisfaction;
                    and Μ. Taboureau des Reaux, his colleague, had resigned his situation, but still
                    retained the dignity of counsellor of state. To afford full scope to the genius
                    of Μ. Neckar, Louis determined that he should no longer be clogged with an
                    associate, and, with the title of director-general of the finances, submitted to
                    him the entire management of the revenue of France. In the ensuing year the
                    Count de St Germains, secretary at war, died; and the Prince de Montbarey, who
                    had already filled an inferior situation in that department, was now appointed
                    to succeed him. In the mean time negotiations with foreign courts were not
                    neglected. Louis concluded a new treaty of alliance with Switzerland; and, on
                    the death of the elector of Bavaria, vigilantly observed the motions of the
                    different princes of Germany. When closely questioned by the English ambassador,
                    Lord Stormont, respecting the warlike preparations which were diligently
                    continued throughout the kingdom, he replied, that at a time when the seas were
                    covered with English fleets and American cruisers, and when such armies were
                    sent to the New World as had never before appeared there, it became prudent for
                    him also to arm for the security of his colonies and the protection of the
                    commerce of France. The king was not ignorant that the remonstrances of Great
                    Britain, and the importunities of the agents of the United States, would soon
                    compel him to adopt some decisive line of conduct; and this was accelerated by
                    an event most disastrous to Britain, namely, the failure of General Burgoyne’s
                    expedition, and the capture of his army. The news of that calamity was received
                    at Paris with unbounded exultation. Μ. Sartine, the minister of marine, was
                    eager to measure the naval strength of France with that of Great Britain; the
                    queen, who had long seconded the applications of the American agents, now
                    espoused their cause with fresh ardour; and the pacific inclinations of Louis
                    being overborne by the suggestions of his ministers and the influence of his
                    queen, it was at length determined openly to acknowledge the independence of the
                    United States. Accordingly Dr Franklin and Silas Deane, who had hitherto acted
                    as private agents, were now acknowledged as public ambassadors from those states
                    to the court of Versailles; and a treaty of amity and commerce was signed
                    between the insurgent colonists and France in the month of February 1778. The
                    Duke of Noailles, ambassador to the court of London, was in the month of March
                    instructed to acquaint that court with the above treaty, and at the same time to
                    declare that the contracting parties had not stipulated any exclusive advantages
                    in favour of France, and that the United States had reserved the liberty of
                    treating with every nation whatsoever upon the footing of equality and
                    reciprocity. But this declaration was treated with contempt by the British; and
                    the recall of Lord ‘Stormont became the signal for the commencement of
                    hostilities.</p>
                <p>In the year 1780 new changes took place in the French: ministry. Μ. Bertin had
                    resigned the office of secretary ∣ of state; and the Prince de Montbarey had
                    retired from the office of secretary at war, in which he was succeeded by the
                    Marquis de Segur. But the most important re-moral<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193514474" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4474-0039"/> was that of Μ. Sartine, who
                    had for several years presided over the marine department, and whose ability and
                    unwearied application had raised the naval power of France to a height which
                    astonished Europe. His colleagues in the cabinet, however, had loudly arraigned
                    a profusion which would have diverted into one channel the whole resources of
                    the kingdom; and his retreat opened a road to the ambition of the Marquis de
                    Castries, who was appointed in his stead. This year the king abolished the
                    inhuman custom of putting the question by torture; a custom which had been so
                    established by long practice that it seemed an inseparable part of the
                    constitution of courts of justice in France. At the same time, in order to
                    defray the charges of war, he diminished his own expenditure; and sacrificing
                    splendour to popularity, dismissed at once above four hundred officers belonging
                    to his court.</p>
                <p>But unhappily the popular discontents were next year excited by the dismission of
                    Μ. Neckar. He had conceived the arduous but popular project of supporting a war
                    by means of loans without taxes; and the rigid economy which he had introduced
                    into all the departments of the royal household, together with the various
                    resources which were thus rendered available, had supported him amidst the
                    difficulties that attended this system. But his austerity of temper had not
                    rendered him equally acceptable to the sovereign and his subjects; and the
                    repeated reforms which he had recommended were represented as inconsistent with
                    the dignity of the crown. He was therefore, in 1781, dismissed from his office
                    of comptroller-general; and Μ. Joli de Fleury, counsellor of state, was
                    appointed to that important department. But the defeat of the Count de Grasse,
                    which happened the following year, produced general grief and consternation. The
                    victory of Rodney was indeed the most severe blow which the navy of France had
                    ever yet sustained, and its effects were felt in every part of the kingdom.
                    Immense preparations were, however, made for the operations of 1783; and, in
                    conjunction with the courts of Madrid and the Hague, Louis determined this year
                    to make the most powerful efforts to bring the war to a conclusion. But in the
                    midst of these preparations the voice of peace was again heard; and Louis was
                    induced to listen to the proffered mediation of the emperor of Germany and of
                    the empress of Russia. The Count de Vergennes, who still held the portfolio of
                    foreign affairs, was appointed to treat with Mr Fĭtzherbert, the British
                    minister at Brussels, who had lately proceeded to Paris to conduct this
                    important negotiation. The way was already smoothed by provisional articles,
                    which had been signed at the close of the preceding year between Great Britain
                    and the states of America, and which were now to constitute the basis of a
                    treaty of peace between Great Britain and France. Preliminaries were accordingly
                    agreed upon and signed at Versailles; and these were soon afterwards succeeded
                    by a definitive treaty, so that France, throughout her extensive dominions,
                    beheld peace once more established. Though the war had been attended by the most
                    brilliant success, and the independence of America seemed to strike deep at the
                    sources of British power, yet France herself had not by any means been free from
                    difficulties. The retreat of Neckar bad diminished the public confidence, and
                    the failure of the celebrated <hi rend="italic">caisse</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >d’</hi><hi rend="italic">escompte</hi> completed the consternation of the
                    people.</p>
                <p>The bank of this name had been established in the year 1776. The plan of it was
                    formed by a company of private adventurers, and its capital was fixed at
                    L.500,000 sterling. The professed design of the company was to discount bills at
                    short dates, at the rate of four per cent, per annum; but as this interest was
                    not an equivalent for the capital sunk by the proprietors, they were intrusted
                    with the additional power of issuing notes to the amount of their capital,
                    which, as these were made convertible into specie, might often be voluntarily
                    taken instead of cash. The reputation acquired by the bank soon caused its stock
                    to rise above par; and its credit still continued unimpaired, when, to the
                    astonishment of the nation, it suddenly stopped payment on the 2d of October
                    1783. The cause assigned was an uncommon scarcity of specie. But the public
                    suspected that the failure arose from a loan secretly made to government; and
                    what confirmed the suspicion was, that government about the same time stopped
                    payment of the bills drawn upon them by their army in America. But, whatever was
                    the cause of this catastrophe, the king was prevailed on to extend his
                    protection to the company. By four successive edicts the banks in Paris were
                    ordered to receive the notes of the <hi rend="italic">caisse d’escompte</hi> as
                    currency; and a lottery with a capital of one million sterling, redeemable in
                    eight years, was established, the tickets of which were made purchasable in
                    notes of the <hi rend="italic">caisse d’escompte.</hi> By these expedients the
                    public confidence in the bank was in some measure revived, while its business
                    increased, and its stock rose to above double the original subscription; the
                    bills from America were at the same time put in a train of payment, and public
                    credit was in a great degree restored throughout the kingdom. Some compensation
                    also for the expenses which had been incurred during the war was derived from a
                    treaty concluded with the United States of America. The latter engaged to
                    reimburse France in the sum of eighteen millions of livres, which had been
                    advanced in the hour of their need; and Louis, for the convenience of the
                    States, consented to receive the money, in the space of twelve years, by twelve
                    equal annual payments.</p>
                <p>The general peace was soon afterwards followed by a' particular treaty between
                    France and Holland, which was I effected by the Count de Vergennes. It included
                    all the ’ principles which can serve to cement nations in the closest <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> union, and by which, in peace or in war, they may
                    mutually participate in good or evil, and in all cases administer to each other
                    the most perfect aid, counsel, and succour. If their united good offices for the
                    preservation of peace should prove ineffectual, it also fixed the assistance
                    which they were to afford each other by sea and land. France was to furnish
                    Holland with ten thousand effective infantry and two thousand cavalry, and with
                    twelve ships of the line and six frigates. Their high mightinesses, on the other
                    hand, in case of a naval war, or of France being attacked by sea, were to
                    contribute to her defence six ships of the line and three frigates; and in the
                    event of an attack on the territory of France, the States General were to have
                    the option of furnishing their land contingent either in money or troops, at the
                    rate of five thousand infantry and one thousand cavalry. And further, if the
                    stipulated succours should prove insufficient for the defence of the party
                    attacked, or for procuring a proper peace, they engaged to assist each other
                    with all their forces if necessary; but it was nevertheless provided, that the
                    contingent of troops to be furnished by the States General should not exceed
                    twenty thousand infantry and four thousand cavalry. Finally, it was agreed that
                    neither of the contracting parties should disarm, or make or receive proposals
                    of peace or even truce, without the consent of the other, nor directly or
                    indirectly contract any future alliance or engagement whatsoever, contrary to
                    the present treaty; and if any treaties or negotiations which might prove
                    detrimental to their joint interest were proposed, they pledged their faith to
                    give notice to each other of such proposals as soon as made. Thus <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Holland was converted into the firm ally of that
                    power against the encroaching spirit of which she had formerly armed the most
                    powerful kingdoms of Europe; whilst France having asserted the independence of
                    America <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514487" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4487-0040"
                    />against Great Britain, and converted an ancient and formidable foe into an
                    useful friend, seemed to have attained '•an influence over the nations of Europe
                    which she had never before been possessed of.</p>
                <p>But, however exalted her present situation might appear, the seeds of future
                    commotion had already been extensively sown. The applause which had attended the
                    parliament of Paris in their protracted struggle· with the late king might be
                    considered as the first dawn of freedom; the language of that assembly had
                    boldly indicated to their countrymen their natural rights, and taught them to
                    look with a less enraptured eye upon the splendour which encompassed the throne.
                    The war in America had contributed to enlarge the political ideas of the French;
                    they had on that occasion stood forth as the champions of liberty, in opposition
                    to regal power; and the officers who had served in the struggle for
                    independence, accustomed to think and speak without restraint, and familiarized
                    with republican institutions, on their return imparted to the provinces of
                    France a portion of the'spirit which had been kindled in the wilds of America.
                    From that moment the French, instead of silently acquiescing in the edicts of
                    their sovereign, canvassed each action with bold inquisition; whilst the
                    attachment of the army, which has ever been considered as the sole foundation of
                    despotism, gave way to the noble enthusiasm of liberty.</p>
                <p>We have already noticed the public dissatisfaction which had attended the
                    dismission of Neckar. His successor, Μ. de Fleury, had retired from the
                    management of the finances in 1783, and.the still more short-lived
                    administration of M, d’Ormesson had expired in the same year which gave it
                    birth. Upon the retreat of the latter, Μ. de Calonne, who had successively
                    filled with acknowledged reputation the office of intendant of Mentz, and
                    afterwards of the provinces of Flanders and Artois, was nominated to the office
                    of comptroller-general. This person, who was flexible and insinuating, eloquent
                    in conversation and polished in his manners, fertile in resources and liberal in
                    the disposal of the public money, soon rendered himself acceptable to the
                    sovereign. But he did not enter upon his new and arduous station favoured by the
                    breath of popularity; he was, in fact, reported to be more able than consistent,
                    and not to have tempered the ardour of his spirit by the severity of deep
                    research; and the people, amidst repeated loans, regretted that severe
                    simplicity which had characterized the administration of Neckar. It was,
                    however, by the bold and judicious measures of Calonne that credit was restored
                    to the <hi rend="italic">caisse d’escompte,</hi> which had stopped payment a few
                    weeks before his accession. His next measure, in 1784, the establishment of the
                    <hi rend="italic">caisse d’amortissement,</hi> or sinking fund, was entitled to
                    a still higher degree of applause. The plan of that fund was simple and
                    moderate. It was, that government should pay annually into the hands of a board
                    set apart for that purpose, the entire interest of the national debt, whether in
                    stock or annuities, together with an additional sum of L.120,000. The annuities
                    which would thus be extinguished every year were estimated at L.50,000, and in
                    that proportion the sum set apart for the redemption of the national debt would
                    annually increase. The operation of this new fund was limited to the term of
                    twenty-five years; and during that period the annual receipt of the <hi
                    rend="italic">caisse</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >amortissement</hi> was declared unalterable, and incapable of being diverted to
                    any other object.</p>
                <p>The principal measure of the following year was the establishment of a new East
                    India Company, a measure which did not fail to excite violent complaints. The
                    time, however, was now approaching, when the necessities of the state compelled
                    the king to adopt measures still more unpopular, and destined to undergo a
                    severer scrutiny. Although peace had for three years been re-established
                    throughout Europe, yet the finances of France seemed scarcely affected by this
                    interval of tranquillity, and it was found requisite to close every year with a
                    loan. The public expenditure of 1785, indeed, seemed to sanction this measure;
                    for it had been thought proper to fortify Cherbourg upon a <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> grand scale.; the claim of the emperor to the
                    navigation of the Scheldt had obliged the French to increase their land forces;
                    and the Marquis de Castries, fond of war, and profuse in his designs, had not
                    suffered the navy which Μ. Sartine had surrendered into his hands to decline
                    during the interval of peace. The treaty of commerce concluded with Great
                    Britain in the year 1786 was also a new source of discontent. Though regarded by
                    the English manufacturers as far from advantageous, it excited in France still
                    louder murmurs, and was represented as likely to extinguish those infant
                    establishments, which were yet unable to compete with the manufactures of
                    England, that had attained to maturity. The market which it held out for the
                    wines and oils of France was passed over in silence, whilst the distress of the
                    artisan was painted in the most striking colours. But when the edict for
                    registering the loan of the preceding year, amounting to three millions three
                    hundred and thirty thousand pounds, was presented to the parliament of Paris,
                    the murmurs of the people, through the remonstrances of that assembly, assumed a
                    more legal and formidable aspect. The king, however, signified to the select
                    deputation commissioned to convey to him their remonstrances, that he expected
                    to be obeyed without further delay. The ceremony of the registration accordingly
                    took place on the following day; but it was accompanied with a resolution,
                    importing, that public economy was the only genuine source of abundant revenue,
                    the only means of providing for the necessities of the state, and of restoring
                    that credit which borrowing had reduced to the brink of ruin. The king was no
                    sooner informed of this step than he commanded the attendance of the grand
                    deputation of parliament, when he erazed from their records the resolution which
                    had been adopted; and observed, that though it was his pleasure that the
                    parliament should communicate, by its respectful representations, whatever might
                    concern the good of the public, yet he never would permit them so far to abuse
                    his clemency as to erect themselves into the censors of his government. At the
                    same time, in order the more strongly to mark his displeasure at their
                    expostulations, he superseded one of their officers, who had appeared most
                    active in forwarding the obnoxious resolution.</p>
                <p>Μ. de Calonne, however, though gratified by the approbation of his sovereign,
                    could not but feel himself deeply mortified by the opposition of the parliament.
                    His attempts to conciliate that assembly had proved ineffectual; and he
                    experienced their inflexible aversion at the critical juncture when their
                    acquiescence might have proved of the most essential service. An anxious inquiry
                    into the state of the public finances had convinced him that the expenditure far
                    exceeded the revenue. In this situation, to impose new taxes was impracticable,
                    to continue the method of borrowing was ruinous, to have recourse to economical
                    reforms would be found wholly inadequate; and he hesitated not to declare, that
                    it would be impossible to place the finances upon a solid basis, except by the
                    reformation of whatever was vicious in the constitution of the state. But, to
                    give weight to this reform, Μ. de Calonne was sensible that something more was
                    necessary than even the royal authority; he perceived that the parliament was
                    neither a fit instrument for introducing a new order into public affairs, nor
                    would submit to be a passive machine for sanctioning the plans of a minister,
                    even if those plans were the emanations of perfect wisdom. Though originally a∙
                    body of lawyers, indebted for their appointment to the king, there was not an
                    attribute of a legislative assembly which they did not seem desirous to engross
                    to themselves; and they had been supported in their pretensions by the
                    approbation of the people, who were sensible that there was no other body in the
                    nation which could plead their cause against <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514500"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4500-0041"/>either royal or ministerial oppression. To
                    suppress, therefore, the only power of control that remained, and to render the
                    government more arbitrary, was deemed too perilous a measure; yet to leave the
                    parliament in the full possession of an influence which the minister was
                    convinced would be exerted against him, was at once to render his whole system
                    abortive. In this dilemma, the only expedient which suggested itself was to have
                    recourse to some other assembly, more dignified and solemn in its character, and
                    which should in a greater degree consist of members selected from the various
                    orders of the state and the different provinces of the kingdom. This promised to
                    be a popular measure; it implied a deference to the people at large, and might
                    be expected to prove highly acceptable.</p>
                <p>But the true and legitimate assembly of the nation, the • States General, had not
                    met since the year 1614, nor could the minister flatter himself with the hope of
                    obtaining the royal assent to a meeting which a despotic sovereign could not but
                    regard with secret jealousy. Another assembly had occasionally been substituted
                    in the room of the States General. This was distinguished by the title of the
                    Notables, and consisted of a number of persons from all parts of the kingdom,
                    chiefly selected from the higher orders of the state, and nominated by the king
                    himself. This assembly, which had been convened by Henry IV. and also by Louis
                    XIII. was now once more summoned by the authority of Louis XVI. The writs for
                    calling them together were dated the 29th of December 1786, and addressed to
                    seven princes of the blood, nine dukes and peers of France, eight
                    field-marshals, twenty-two nobles, eight counsellors of state, four masters of
                    requests, eleven archbishops and bishops, thirty-seven of the heads of the law,
                    twelve deputies of the <hi rend="italic">paysd</hi><hi rend="italic">états,</hi>
                    the civil lieutenant, and twenty-five magistrates of the different towns of the
                    kingdom. The number of members was thus a hundred and forty-four; and the 29th
                    of January 1787 was the period appointed for their meeting.</p>
                <p>Upon the arrival of the Notables at Paris, however, the minister found himself as
                    yet unprepared to submit his system for their consideration, and therefore
                    postponed the opening of the assembly until the 7th of February. A second delay
                    until the 14th of the same month was occasioned by the indisposition of Μ. de
                    Calonne, and that of the Count de Vergennes, president of the council of finance
                    and first secretary of state; and a third procrastination necessarily resulted
                    from the death of the count on the day previous to that which had been fixed for
                    the opening of the assembly. Μ. de Vergennes was succeeded in the department of
                    foreign affairs by the Count de Montmorin, a nobleman of unblemished character;
                    but his loss at this critical juncture was severely felt by Μ. de Calonne, as he
                    alone, of all the ministers, had entered with warmth and sincerity into the
                    plans of the comptroller-general. The Chevalier de Miromesnil, keeper of the
                    seals, was avowedly the rival and enemy of Calonne; the Marshal de Castries,
                    secretary for the department of marine, was personally attached to Μ. Neckar;
                    and the Baron de Breteuil, secretary for the household, was the creature of the
                    queen, and deeply engaged in what was called the Austrian system.</p>
                <p>It was under these difficulties that Μ. de Calonne, on the 22d of February, first
                    met the Assembly of the Notables, and unfolded his long-expected plan. He began
                    by stating, that the public expenditure had for centuries past exceeded the
                    revenue, and that a very considerable deficiency had of course existed; that the
                    Mississippi scheme of 1720 had not, as might have been expected, restored the
                    balance; that under the economical administration of Cardinal Fleury the deficit
                    still existed; that the progress of this derangement under the last reign had
                    been extreme, the deficiency amounting to three millions sterling at the
                    appointment of the Abbe Terray, who, however, reduced it to one million six
                    hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds; that it decreased a little under the
                    short administrations which followed, but rose again, in consequence of the war,
                    under the administration of Μ. Neckar; and that upon his own accession to office
                    it amounted to three millions three hundred and thirty thousand pounds. In order
                    to remedy this growing evil, Μ. Calonne recommended a territorial impost, of the
                    nature of the English land-tax, from which no rank or order of men was to be
                    exempted; and an inquiry into the possessions of the clergy, who hitherto had
                    been exempted from bearing their proportion of the public burdens. It was also
                    proposed that the various branches of internal taxation should undergo a strict
                    examination; and a considerable resource was anticipated in mortgaging the
                    demesne lands of the crown.</p>
                <p>The necessity for these reforms, however, was combated with a degree of boldness
                    and force of reasoning which could not fail to make a deep impression on the
                    assembly; and, instead of meeting with a ready acquiescence, the
                    comptroller-general found that he had launched into the boundless ocean of
                    political controversy. Μ. Neckar, previously to his retirement, had published
                    his <hi rend="italic">compte rendu au roi,</hi> in which France was represented
                    as possessing a clear surplus of above four hundred thousand pounds sterling.
                    This performance had been read with avidity, and probably contributed to deprive
                    the author of the royal favour; but the credit of the work was ably vindicated
                    by Μ. de Brienne, archbishop of Toulouse. Μ. de Calonne met with a still more
                    formidable adversary in the Count de Mirabeau. This extraordinary man, restless
                    in disposition, licentious in morals, but bold, penetrating, and enterprising,
                    had occasionally visited every court in Europe. He had been admitted at one time
                    to the confidence of the minister, and had been directed, though not in an
                    ostensible character, to observe at Berlin the disposition of the successor of
                    the great Frederick; but whilst employed in this capacity he was frequently
                    exposed to neglect and disappointment, and his letters were often left
                    unanswered. Disgust succeeded to admiration; and he who had entered the Prussian
                    court the intimate friend, returned to Paris the declared enemy, of Μ. de
                    Calonne. Accordingly, whilst the archbishop arraigned the understanding,
                    Mirabeau impeached the integrity, of the comptroller-general.</p>
                <p>The eloquence of Μ. de Calonne, however, might have successfully vindicated his
                    system and reputation against the calculations of Brienne and the invectives of
                    Mirabeau; but he could not support himself against the influence of the three
                    great bodies of the nation. The ancient nobility and the clergy had ever been
                    free from all public assessments; and had the evil gone no further, it might
                    still perhaps have been borne with patience; but, through the shameful custom of
                    selling patents of nobility, such crowds of new noblesse started up, that every
                    province in the kingdom was filled with them. The first object with those who
                    had rapidly acquired fortunes, was to purchase a patent, which, besides
                    gratifying their vanity, afforded an exemption to them and their posterity from
                    contributing to the exigencies of the state. The magistracies likewise
                    throughout the kingdom enjoyed their share of these exemptions; so that the
                    whole weight of taxation fell upon those classes who were least able to bear it.
                    Hence the minister’s design of equalizing the public burdens, and diminishing
                    the load borne by the lower and most useful classes of the people, by rendering
                    the taxes genera), though undoubtedly great and patriotic, at once united
                    against him the nobility, the clergy, and the magistracy. And the result was
                    such as might have been expected. The intrigues of these three bodies raised
                    against him so loud a clamour, that finding it impossible to stem the torrent<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193514513" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4513-0042"/>, hė not only
                    resigned his office on the 12th of April, but soon afterwards withdrew to
                    England from the storm of persecution which now impended over him.</p>
                <p>In the midst of these domestic transactions, the attention of Louis was called to
                    the state of affairs in Holland. The prince of Orange having been, stripped of
                    all authority by the aristocratic party, had retired from the Hague, and now
                    maintained the shadow of a court at Nimeguen. But his brother-inrlaw, the new
                    king of Prussia, exerted himself to promote the interests of the stadtholder,
                    and offered, in concert with France, to undertake the arduous task of composing
                    the differences which distracted the republic. The proposal was received with
                    much apparent cordiality by the court of Versailles. At the same time it was
                    scarcely to be expected that France would become the instrument of restoring the
                    prince of Orange to that share of power which he had previously enjoyed, and
                    thus abandon a favourite object of∙policy, namely, establishing a supreme and
                    permanent control in the councils of Holland. In fact, the conditions framed as
                    the basis of reconciliation by the Louvestein ſaċtion, were such as plainly
                    indicated their design of reducing within very narrow limits the influence and
                    authority of the stadtholder. On his renouncing the right of filling up
                    occasional vacancies in the town senates, he was to be restored to the nominal
                    office of captain-general; but he was to be restrained from marching troops into
                    any province, or out of it, without leave from the respective provinces
                    concerned; and he was also to subscribe a resolution passed some time previously
                    by the senate of Amsterdam, that the command should at all times be revocable at
                    the pleasure of the states. Had the prince acquiesced in these preliminaries,
                    France would have completely attained the object of her lengthened negotiations,
                    and by means of the Louvestein faction acquired the ascendency which she had
                    repeatedly sought to obtain in the councils of Holland. But, under the
                    difficulties which surrounded him, the prince of Orange was admirably supported
                    and assisted by the genius, spirit, and abilities of his consort, who firmly
                    rejected every measure tending to abridge the rights attached to the office of
                    stadtholder; and Μ. de Rayneval, the French negotiator, having in vain
                    endeavoured to overcome her resolution, broke off the correspondence between the
                    Hague and Nimeguen, and returned to Paris about the middle of January 1787.</p>
                <p>But the republican party were totally disappointed in the hopes which they had
                    formed of assistance from France. The court of Versailles had indeed long
                    trusted to the natural strength of this party, and had been assiduous during the
                    summer in endeavouring to second them by every species of succour which could be
                    privately afforded. Crowds of French officers arrived daily in Holland, and
                    either received commissions in the service of the states, or acted as volunteers
                    in their troops; several hundreds of tried and experienced soldiers were
                    selected from different regiments, furnished with money for their journey, and
                    dispatched in small parties to join the troops, and assist in disciplining the
                    burghers and volunteers; and a considerable corps of engineers were also
                    directed to proceed in disguise towards Amsterdam, in order to assist in'
                    strengthening the works of that city. But these aids, which might have proved
                    effectual had the contest been confined to the states of Holland and the
                    stadtholder, were rendered unavailing by the rapid invasion of the Prussians;
                    the court of Berlin had taken its measures with so much celerity, and the
                    situation of the republicans had already become so desperate, that it was
                    doubtful whether their affaire could be restored by any assistance which France
                    was capable of immediately affording. Nevertheless, on Great Britain fitting out
                    a strong squadron of men of war at Portsmouth, to give confidence to the
                    operations of the king of Prussia, the court of Versailles sent orders to equip
                    sixteen sail of the line at Brest, and recalled a small squadron which had been
                    commissioned to cruise on the coast of Portugal. But in these preparations Louis
                    seemed rather to regard his own dignity, than to be actuated by any purpose of
                    effectually relieving his allies. All opposition in Holland might already be
                    considered as extinguished. The states assembled at the Hague had officially
                    notified to the court of Versailles, that the disputes between them and the
                    stadtholder were now happily terminated; and as the circumstances which gave
                    occasion to their application to that court no longer existed, they intimated
                    that the succours which they had formerly requested would not now be necessary.
                    Under these circumstances, as the chief concern of France was to extricate
                    herself with honour from her present difficulty, she readily listened to a
                    memorial from the British minister at Paris, in which it was proposed that, in
                    order to preserve a good understanding between the two crowns, all warlike
                    preparations should be discontinued, and that the navies of both kingdoms should
                    again be reduced to the footing of a peace establishment; a proposition which
                    was gladly acceded to by the court of Versailles, and the harmony which had been
                    transiently interrupted was thus restored.</p>
                <p>But though the French king could not but sensibly feel the mortification of thus
                    relinquishing the ascendency which he had obtained in the councils of Holland,
                    the internal situation of his kingdom furnished matter for more serious
                    reflection. The dismission of Μ. de Calonne had left France without a minister,
                    and almost without a system of government; and though the king bore the
                    opposition of the Notables with temper, yet the disappointment he had
                    experienced sunk deep in his mind. Without obtaining any relief for his most
                    urgent necessities, he perceived when too late that he had opened a way for the
                    restoration of the ancient constitution of France, which had been undermined by
                    the craft of Louis XI. and nearly extinguished by the daring councils of
                    Richelieu under Louis XIII. The Notables had indeed conducted themselves with
                    respect and moderation, but at the same time they had not been deficient in
                    firmness. The appointment of the Archbishop of Toulouse, the avowed adversary of
                    Μ. de Calonne, to the office of comptroller-general, probably contributed to
                    preserve the appearance of good humour in that assembly; but notwithstanding
                    this, the proposed territorial impost or general land-tax, an object so ardently
                    desired by the court, was rejected. Deprived of all hope of rendering the
                    convention subservient to the relief of his embarrassments, and also dreading
                    the spirit which it had on several occasions evinced, Louis determined to
                    dissolve the assembly, which he did accordingly, in a moderate and conciliatory
                    speech addressed to the members on their dismission.</p>
                <p>Being thus disappointed of the advantage which he had hoped to derive from the
                    acquiescence of the Notables, the king was now obliged to revert to the usual
                    mode ol raising money by royal edicts; and amongst the measures proposed for
                    this purpose were the doubling of the poll-tax, the re-establishment of the
                    third-twentieth, and a stamp duty. But, as might have been expected, this
                    summary method was strongly disapproved by the parliament of Paris; and that
                    assembly refused, in the most positive terms, to register the edict. In the last
                    resort, therefore, Louis was obliged to have recourse to his absolute authority;
                    and, by holding what is called a bed of justice, he compelled the parliament to
                    register the impost. Bui the latter, though defeated, were not subdued; and or
                    the day after the king had held his bed of justice the, entered a formal protest
                    against the edict, declaring thaï it had been registered against their
                    approbation and consent, by the express command of the king; that it neither <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193514526" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4526-0043"/> should nor ought
                    to have any force; and that the first person who presumed to carry it into
                    execution would be adjudged a traitor, and condemned to the galleys. This
                    spirited declaration left the king no alternative, but either to proceed to
                    extremities in support of his authority, or to relinquish for ever afterwards
                    the power of raising money upon any occasion without the consent of the
                    parliament. But though naturally of a mild disposition, and averse to violent
                    measures, Louis determined not to surrender, without a struggle, that authority
                    which had so long been exercised by his predecessors. Ever since the
                    commencement of the discontents, considerable bodies of troops had been
                    gradually marched into the capital; and, about a week after the parliament
                    entered their protest, an officer of the guards, with a party of soldiers,
                    proceeded at daybreak to the house of each member, to signify to him the king’s
                    command, that he should immediately get into his carriage, and withdraw to
                    Troyes, a city of Champagne, about seventy miles from Paris, without writing or
                    speaking to any person out of his own house previously to his departure. These
                    orders were all served at the same instant; and before the citizens of Paris
                    became acquainted with the transaction, their magistrates were already on the
                    road to their place of banishment. Previously to their relegation, however, they
                    had presented a remonstrance on the recent measures of government, and the
                    alarming state of public affairs. In stating their opinions on taxes, they
                    declared that neither the parliaments nor any other authority, excepting that of
                    the three estates of the kingdom collectively, could warrant the imposition of
                    any permanent tax on the people; and they strongly urged the renewal of those
                    national assemblies which had rendered the reign of Charlemagne at once so
                    illustrious and beneficent.</p>
                <p>This demand for the convocation of the national council or States General was the
                    more honourable to the parliament, as the latter assemblies had uniformly sunk
                    under the influence of the former, and returned to their original condition of
                    mere courts of registration and law. The confidence and attachment of the people
                    therefore rose in proportion to this disinterestedness; their murmurs were
                    openly expressed in the streets of the capital, and the general dissatisfaction
                    was augmented in consequence of the stop put to public business by' the exile of
                    the parliament. Meanwhile the cabinet appeared weak, disunited, and fluctuating;
                    and continual changes took place in every department of the state. Averse to
                    rigorous counsels, Louis wished to allay the growing discontent by every
                    concession consistent with his dignity; but the queen, it was believed, strongly
                    dissuaded him from taking any step which might tend to diminish the royal
                    authority. The influence of this princess in the cabinet was undoubtedly great;
                    but the popularity which she had once enjoyed was no more, and some imputations
                    of private levity, which had been scattered through the capital, were far from
                    rendering her acceptable to the majority of the people. The Count d’Artois, the
                    king’s brother, who had expressed himself in the most unguarded terms against
                    the conduct of the parliament, also stood exposed to all the consequences of
                    popular hatred. Nor was it in the capital alone that the flame of liberty burst
                    forth; it blazed with equal strength in the provincial parliaments. Amongst
                    various instances of this, the parliament of Grenoble passed a decree against
                    <hi rend="italic">lettre»</hi><hi rend="italic">de cachet,</hi> declaring the
                    execution of these odious instruments of arbitrary power, within their
                    jurisdiction, by any person, and under any authority whatsoever, to be a capital
                    crime.</p>
                <p>The king had endeavoured to soothe the Parisiansby new regulations of economy,
                    and by continual retrenchments in his household; but these proofs of a desire to
                    lessen the public burdens, though they would at one time have been received with
                    the loudest acclamations, were now disregarded, and the absence of the
                    parliament was considered as an evil for which nothing could atone. In order
                    therefore to regain the affections of his subjects, his majesty consented to
                    restore that assembly, and at the same time to abandon the stamp duty and the
                    territorial impost, which had been the chief subjects of dispute. But these
                    measures were insufficient to establish harmony between the court and the
                    parliament. The necessities of the state still remained unprovided for; nor
                    could the deficiency of the revenue be supplied, except by extraordinary
                    resources or a long course of rigid frugality. About the middle of November
                    1787, in a full meeting of the parliament, attended by all the princes of the
                    blood and the peers of France, the king entered the assembly, and proposed for
                    their approbation two edicts; one for a new loan of four hundred and fifty
                    millions of francs, or about nineteen millions sterling, and the other for the
                    re-establishment of the Protestants in all their ancient civil rights, a measure
                    which had long been warmly recommended by the parliament, and which was now
                    brought forward to procure a better reception for the loan. On this occasion the
                    king delivered a speech of unusual length, filled with professions of regard for
                    the people, but at the same time dwelling strongly upon the obedience he
                    expected to his edicts. An animated debate ensued, and was continued for nine
                    hours, when the king, wearied by opposition, and chagrined at some freedoms used
                    in the course of the discussion, suddenly rose and commanded the edict to be
                    registered without further delay. But this order was most unexpectedly opposed
                    by the Duke of Orleans, first prince of the blood, who protested against the
                    whole proceedings of the day, as an infringement on the rights of parliament,
                    and therefore null and void. The king, though he could not conceal his
                    astonishment and displeasure at this decisive step, contented himself with
                    repeating his commands, and immediately afterwards left the assembly. On his
                    departure, the parliament confirmed the protest of the Duke of Orleans, and
                    declared, that as their deliberations had been interrupted, they considered the
                    whole business of that day as of no effect.</p>
                <p>But as it could not be supposed that Louis would suffer so bold an attack on his
                    power to pass with impunity, a letter was next day delivered to the Duke of
                    Orleans, commanding him to retire to Villars-Cotterel, one of his seats, about
                    fifteen leagues from Paris, and to receive no company there except his own
                    family; and at the same time the Abbé Sabbatière and Μ. Fréteau, both members of
                    the parliament, who had distinguished themselves in the debate, were seized
                    under the authority of <hi rend="italic">lettres</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    cachet,</hi> and conveyed, the former to the castle of Mont St Michel in
                    Normandy, and the latter to a prison in Picardy. This act of despotism
                    immediately roused the indignation of the parliament, which on the following day
                    waited on the king, and expressed their astonishment and concern that a prince
                    of the blood-royal should have been exiled, and two of their members imprisoned,
                    for having declared in his presence what their duty and consciences dictated,
                    and at a time when his majesty had announced that he came to take the sense of
                    the assembly by a plurality of voices. The answer of the king was reserved,
                    forbidding, and unsatisfactory. But this did not prevent the parliament from
                    attending to the exigencies of the state; and, convinced of the emergency, they
                    consented to register the loan for four hundred and fifty millions of livres,
                    which had been the principal cause of this unfortunate difference. This
                    concession contributed to soften the mind of the king; and the sentence of the
                    two magistrates was in consequence changed from imprisonment to exile; Μ.
                    Fréteau being sent to one of his country seats, and the Abbé Sabbatière to a
                    convent of Benedictines.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514539" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4539-0044"/>
                <p>The parliament, however, was not so far propitiated by this measure as to give up
                    the points against which they had originally remonstrated. In a petition,
                    conceived with great freedom, andcouched in the most animated language, they
                    boldly reprobated the late acts of arbitrary violence, and demanded the entire
                    liberation of the persons against whom these had been exercised. At the court of
                    Versailles there, was nothing but uncertainty and fluctuation; now vigour and
                    now weakness; violence one day and attempts at conciliation the next; a king
                    without energy or decision of character, and counsellors destitute alike of
                    wisdom, prudence, and moderation. In the beginning of the year 1788, Louis
                    recalled the Duke of Orleans, who soon afterwards obtained permission to retire
                    to England; whilst the Abbé Sabbatière and Μ. Fréteau were about the same time
                    allowed to return to the capital.</p>
                <p>But the parliament had not confined their demands to the liberation of these
                    gentlemen; they had also echoed the remonstrances of the parliament of Grenoble,
                    and had loudly inveighed against the execution of <hi rend="italic"
                    >lettres</hi><hi rend="italic">de cachet.</hi> These repeated remonstrances,
                    mingled as they were with personal reflections, seconded the suggestions of the
                    queen; and Louis was once more instigated to adopt measures of severity. MM.
                    d’Espremenil and Monsambert, whose bold and pointed harangues had given the
                    greatest offence, were doomed to experience the immediate resentment of the
                    court. A body of armed troops having surrounded the hôtel in which the
                    parliament were convened, Colonel Degout entered the assembly and secured the
                    persons of the obnoxious members, who were instantly conducted to different
                    prisons. This new instance of arbitrary violence drew forth a remonstrance from
                    parliament, which in boldness far exceeded all the former representations made
                    by that body. They declared they were now more firmly convinced than ever, that
                    the entire subversion of the constitution was aimed at; but they added, that the
                    French nation would never sanction the despotic measures which the king had been
                    advised to adopt; that the fundamental laws of the kingdom must not be trampled
                    on; and that the royal authority could only be esteemed as long as it was
                    tempered with justice.</p>
                <p>Language so pointed and decisive, asserting the con- trolling power of the laws
                    above the regal authority, could not fail to alarm the king; and, with a view to
                    diminish the influence of the parliament, it was determined again to convene the
                    Notables. Accordingly, about the beginning of May, Louis appeared in that
                    assembly, and after complaining of the excesses in which the parliament of Paris
                    had indulged, and which had drawn down his reluctant indignation on a few of the
                    members, he declared his resolution, instead of annihilating them as a body, to
                    recall them to their duty and obedience by a salutary reform. Μ. de la Moignon,
                    as keeper of the seals, then explained his majesty’s intention to establish a
                    plenary court, or supreme assembly, composed of princes of the blood, peers of
                    the realm, great officers of the crown, the clergy, marshals of France,
                    governors of provinces, knights of different orders, a deputation of one member
                    from every parliament, and two members from the chambers of council, which
                    should be summoned as often as any public emergency should, in the royal
                    opinion, render it necessary to do so.</p>
                <p>But if the Assembly of the Notables listened in silent deference to the project
                    of their sovereign, the parliament of Paris received it with undisguised
                    aversion. That body protested in the strongest manner against the establishment
                    of any other tribunal, and declared their unalterable resolution not to assist
                    at any deliberations in the supreme assembly which his majesty proposed to
                    institute. A more unexpected mortification occurred to the king in the
                    opposition of several peers of the realm, who expressed their regret at
                    beholding the fundamental principles of the constitution violated; and, though
                    lavish in professions of attachment to the person of the sovereign, concluded
                    with apologizing for not entering on the functions assigned them in the plenary
                    court, which, in their opinion, was inconsistent with the true interests of his
                    majesty, no less than with those of the nation at large. Nor was this opposition
                    confined to the parliament. The flame quickly spread throughout the more distant
                    provinces. At Rennes in Bretagne, and at Grenoble in Dauphine, the populace
                    broke out into acts of the most daring outrage. In the latter city several
                    hundred of the inhabitants perished in a conflict with the military; but they
                    nevertheless maintained their ground against the regulars, and the commanding
                    officer, on the entreaty of the first president, withdrew his troops from a
                    contest into which he had entered with reluctance. The different parliaments of
                    the kingdom at the same time expressed their feelings in the most animated
                    language, strongly urging the necessity of calling together the States General,
                    the lawful council of the kingdom, as the only means of restoring public trau·
                    quillity and promoting needful reforms.</p>
                <p>It now became evident to the king, that a compliance with the public wishes for
                    the convocation of the States General was absolutely necessary,, to avoid the
                    calamities of a civil war, which a refusal would render inevitable. In such
                    event he must have expected to encounter the majority of the people, animated by
                    the exhortations and example of their magistrates; the peers of the realm had
                    also expressed the strongest disapprobation of his measures; nor could he even
                    depend on the support of the princes of the blood. But what afforded the most
                    serious ground of alarm, was the spirit recently displayed by the military, who,
                    during the disturbances in the provinces, had with difficulty been brought to
                    act against their countrymen; whilst many of their officers, who had been
                    engaged" in assisting to establish the independence of America, publicly
                    declared their abhorrence of despotism. It was not, however, until after many a
                    painful struggle that Louis could bring himself to restore an assembly, the
                    influence of which would naturally overshadow that of the crown, whilst its
                    jurisdiction would confine within narrow limits the uncontrolled power which he
                    had inherited from his predecessors. In the two preceding reigns the States
                    General had been wholly discontinued; and though the queen-regent, during the
                    troubles attending the minority of Louis XIV. had frequently expressed her
                    intention of calling them together, she was constantly dissuaded by the
                    representations of Mazarin. It is probable, however, that Louis XVI. still
                    flattered himself with the hope of alluring the members of that assembly to the
                    side of the court, and, having employed them to establish some degree of
                    regularity in the finances, and to curb the spirit of the parliament, of again
                    dismissing them to obscurity.</p>
                <p>But be this as it may, an arrêt was issued in August, fixing the meeting of the
                    States General for the first day of May in the ensuing year; and, during the
                    interval, every step was taken to secure the favourable opinion of the public.
                    New arrangements took place in the administration; Neckar, who had long enjoyed
                    the confidence of the people, was again called to the management of the
                    finances; the torture, which by a former edict had been in part restricted, was
                    now entirely abolished; every person accused was allowed the assistance of
                    counsel, and permitted to avail himself of any point of law necessary to his
                    defence; and it was decreed, that in future sentence of death should not be
                    passed on any person, unless the. accused had been pronounced guilty by a
                    majority of at least three judges.</p>
                <p>As the time appointed for the convention of the States General approached, the
                    means of assembling them formed<pb break="no" facs="nls:193514552"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4552-0045"/> a matter of very grave deliberation in the
                    cabinet. The last meeting, in 1614, had been convened by application to the
                    bailiwicks. But this mode was liable to strong objections, as the bailiwicks had
                    been increased in number and jurisdiction, several provinces having since that
                    period been united to France; and as the numbers and quality of the members were
                    no less an object of serious attention, it was not till the close of the year
                    that the proposal of Neckar, which fixed the number of deputies at a thousand
                    and upwards, and ordained that the representatives of the third estate or
                    commons should equal in number those of the nobility and clergy united, was
                    adopted. Meanwhile the eyes of all Europe were turned towards the States
                    General; but the moment of their meeting was far from being auspicious. The
                    minds of the French had long been agitated by various rumours; the unanimity
                    which had been expected from the different orders of the states was destroyed by
                    the jarring pretensions of each; and their mutual jealousies were attributed by
                    the suspicions of the people to the intrigues of the court, which, it was
                    supposed, already repented of the hasty assent which had been extorted from it.
                    A scarcity which pervaded the kingdom increased the general discontent; and the
                    people, pressed by hunger, and inflamed by resentment, were ripe for revolt. The
                    sovereign also, impatient of the obstacles which he continually encountered,
                    could not conceal his chagrin; whilst the influence of the queen in the cabinet
                    manifested itself by the immediate removal of Neckar. The dismission of this
                    minister, who had so long been the favourite of the public, was the signal of
                    open insurrection. The Parisians assembled in great numbers; the guards refused
                    to stain their arms with the blood of their fellow-citizens; the Count d’Artois
                    and the most obnoxious of the nobility thought themselves happy in eluding by
                    flight the fury of the insurgents; and in a moment a revolution was
                    accomplished, which, in all its circumstances, is the most remarkable of any
                    recorded in history.</p>
                <p>The moral history of man is always more important than the mere recital of such
                    physical occurrences as diversify his existence. It is not the fall of a mighty
                    monarch and the overthrow of his dynasty, it is not the convulsion of empires,
                    and the rivers of human blood which have been shed, that render the French
                    Revolution peculiarly interesting. Such events, however deplorable, are far from
                    being without example in the history of mankind. In the populous regions of the
                    East, where superstition and slavery have always prevailed, these are regarded
                    as forming part of the ordinary course of human affairs, because an intrepid and
                    skilful usurper always finds it easy to intimidate millions of ignorant and
                    credulous men. But in Europe the case is very different indeed. No adventurer
                    can advance far without encountering thousands as artful and as daring as
                    himself. Events are not the result either of blind hazard or of individual
                    skill. Conspiracies or plots produce but little effect. Like other arts, that of
                    government has been much improved; and an established constitution can only be
                    shaken by a strong convulsion produced by national passions and national
                    efforts. The wonderful spectacle which we are now to contemplate, is that of an
                    enlightened and polished people becoming in an instant fierce and sanguinary; a
                    long established government, fortified by the recollections of ages, and forming
                    as it were part of the national character, overturned almost without a struggle;
                    a whole nation apparently uniting to destroy every institution which time had
                    hallowed or education had taught them to revere; a superstitious people treating
                    the religion of their forefathers with contempt; a long-enslaved race, whose
                    very chains had become dear to them, occupied in the discussion of refined and
                    even visionary schemes of freedom; in short, twenty-five millions of men
                    suddenly treading under foot every sentiment and every prejudice which they
                    themselves had once regarded as sacred and venerable.</p>
                <p>Like the other nations of Europe, France was anciently governed by a rude and
                    fierce aristocracy, the different members of which were feebly united by the
                    authority of a succession of kings destitute of power or influence. The nobles,
                    within their own territories, enjoyed privileges almost royal. They made peace
                    and war; they coined money; they were judges in the last resort; their vassals
                    were their slaves, whom they bought and sold along with the lands; and the
                    inhabitants of cities, although freemen, were poor, depressed, and dependent on
                    the protection of some baron in their neighbourhood. But, by the progress of the
                    arts, the cities at length rose into importance, and their inhabitants, along
                    with such freemen of low rank as resided in the country, were considered as
                    entitled to a representation in the States General of the kingdom, under the
                    appellation of <hi rend="italic">tiers</hi><hi rend="italic">état,</hi> or third
                    estate. When in process of time, however, the power of the crown had crushed
                    that of the barons, and the sovereign became despotic, the meetings of the
                    States General were discontinued. But absolute authority on the part of the
                    crown was not acquired, as it was in England under the house of Tudor, by
                    abolishing the pernicious privileges of the nobles, and elevating the commons:
                    it was obtained by skilful encroachments, by daring exertions of prerogative,
                    and by the employment of a regular military force. In France, therefore, the
                    monarch was absolute, whilst the nobles retained their feudal privileges, and
                    the ecclesiastical hierarchy also enjoyed its peculiar rights and
                    immunities.</p>
                <p>But the kingdom of France, previously to the Revolution, had never been reduced
                    to one homogeneous mass. It consisted of a variety of separate provinces
                    acquired by different means; some by marriage, others by legacy, and others
                    again by conquest. Each province retained its ancient Jaws and privileges,
                    whether political or civil, as expressed in the capitularies or conditions by
                    which it was originally acquired. In one part of his dominions the French
                    monarch was a count, in another he was a duke, in a third he was a king; whilst
                    the only bond which united his vast empire was the strong military force by
                    which it was overawed. Each province had its barriers; and the intercourse
                    between one province and another was often more restricted by local usages than
                    the intercourse of either with a foreign country. Some of the provinces, as
                    Bretagne and Dauphiné, even retained the right of assembling periodically their
                    provincial states; but these constituted no barrier against the power of the
                    court.</p>
                <p>The clergy formed the first estate of the kingdom in point of precedence. In
                    number they amounted to about a hundred and thirty thousand. The higher orders
                    enjoyed immense revenues; but the <hi rend="italic">curés</hi> or great body of
                    the working clergy seldom possessed more than about L.28 sterling a year, whilst
                    their <hi rend="italic">vicaires</hi> had only about half that sum. A few of the
                    dignified clergy were men of great piety, who resided constantly in their
                    dioceses, and attended to the duties of their office; but by far the greater
                    number passed their lives at Paris and Versailles, immersed in all the intrigues
                    and dissipation of a corrupt court and a profligate capital. They were almost
                    exclusively selected from amongst the younger branches of the families of the
                    high nobility; and it had even come to be accounted a species of dishonour for
                    any persons of low rank to be admitted into the episcopal order. The lower
                    clergy, on the contrary, were for the most part persons of mean birth, who had
                    little chance of preferment, but who, by living constantly among the people,
                    naturally participated in their feelings and opinions. As a body, the clergy
                    possessed, independently of the tithes, a revenue arising from their property in
                    land, which amounted to four or <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514565"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4565-0046"/>five millions sterling annually, and they were at
                    the same time exempt from taxation. The crown had latterly attempted to break
                    down this privilege; but, to avoid the danger, the clergy had presented to the
                    court, as a free gift, a sum of money somewhat short of a million sterling every
                    five years.</p>
                <p>The nobility was nominally the second order of the state, but it was in reality
                    the first. The nobles amounted to no less than two hundred thousand in number.
                    The title and rank descended to all the children of the family, but the property
                    went to the eldest alone; and hence vast multitudes of penniless nobles were
                    entirely dependent upon the bounty of the court. They regarded the useful and
                    commercial arts as dishonourable, and even the liberal professions of the law
                    and physic they considered as in a great measure beneath their dignity,
                    disdaining to intermarry with the families of their professors. The feudal
                    system in its purity was favourable to the production of respectable qualities
                    in the minds of those who belonged to the order of the nobles; but the
                    introduction of commerce had rendered its decline equally unfavourable to that
                    class of persons. Instead of the ancient patriarchal attachment between the
                    feudal chieftain and his vassals, the nobility had become greedy landlords in
                    the provinces, that they might appear in splendour at court and in the capital,
                    where, plunged in intrigue and sensuality, their characters became frivolous and
                    contemptible. Such of the French nobility, however, as remained in the
                    provinces, regarded with indignation this degradation of their order, and still
                    retained a proud sense of honour and of courage, which has always rendered them
                    respectable. The order of the nobles was exempted from the payment of taxes,
                    although the property of some of them was immense. The estates of the prince of
                    Conde, for example, were worth L.200,000 a year, and those of the Duke of
                    Orleans nearly twice as much. The crown had indeed imposed some trifling taxes
                    upon the nobility, but these they contrived, in a great measure, to elude.</p>
                <p>Next to the nobles, and as a privileged order possessing a secondary kind of
                    nobility of their own, may be mentioned the parliaments. These consisted of
                    large bodies of men, in different provinces, and served as courts of law for the
                    administration of justice. In consequence of the corruption of the officers of
                    state, the members purchased their places, which they held for life; but the son
                    was usually preferred when he offered to purchase his father’s place. Practising
                    lawyers had but little chance of ever becoming judges. In courts thus
                    constituted, consisting of a motley mixture of old and young, learned and
                    ignorant, justice was of course indifferently administered. The judges allowed
                    their votes in depending causes to be openly solicited by the parties or their
                    friends. No wise man ever entered into a litigation against a member of one of
                    these parliaments, and no lawyer would undertake to plead his cause; such a suit
                    never came to a successful issue, and usually came to no issue at all. But after
                    the States General had fallen into disuse, the parliaments acquired a certain
                    degree of political consequence, and formed the only check upon the absolute
                    power of the crown. The laws, or royal edicts, before being put in force, were
                    always sent to be registered in the books of the parliaments. Taking advantage
                    of this practice, in favourable times and circumstances, the latter often
                    delayed or refused to enregister the royal edicts, and presented remonstrances
                    against them. And this was done under cover of a legal fiction. For they
                    pretended that the obnoxious edict, being injurious to the public welfare, could
                    not be the will of the king, but must either be a forgery or an imposition by
                    the ministers. Objections of this kind were, however, got rid of, either by a
                    positive order from the king, or by his coming in person and ordering the edict
                    to be registered. The parliaments, nevertheless, often carried their opposition
                    a great length, indeed even to the ruin of themselves and their families as
                    individuals. This rendered them extremely popular with the nation, and enabled
                    them to embarrass a weak administration. But, after all, the opposition of the
                    parliaments proved so feeble, that it was not thought worth while to abolish
                    them entirely till towards the end of the reign of Louis XV.; and they were
                    restored as a popular measure at the beginning of that of Louis XVI.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">tiers</hi><hi rend="italic">état,</hi> or commons, formed
                    the lowest order of the state in France, and they were depressed and miserable
                    in the extreme. To form a conception of their situation, it is necessary to
                    observe that the whole pecuniary burdens of the state were laid on them. They
                    alone were liable to taxation. An expensive and ambitious court; an army of two
                    hundred thousand men in time of peace, and twice that number in war; a
                    considerable marine establishment; public roads and works; all were supported
                    exclusively by taxes levied from the lowest of the people. The revenues also
                    were collected in a wasteful and oppressive manner. They were farmed out at a
                    certain estimated sum, over and above which the farmers-general not only
                    acquired immense fortunes for themselves, but were also enabled to advance
                    enormous presents to those favourites or mistresses of the king or the minister
                    by means of whom they procured their contracts. In raising all this money from
                    the people, they were guilty of the most cruel oppression; as they had it in
                    their power to obtain whatever revenue laws they pleased, and to execute these
                    in the severest manner, their exactions were measured by their own cupidity
                    alone. For this purpose they kept in pay an army of clerks, subalterns, scouts,
                    and spies, amounting, it is said, to about eighty thousand. This class of
                    persons were equally detested by the king, whom they deceived and kept in
                    poverty; by the people, whom they oppressed; and by the ancient nobility, whom
                    they eclipsed by the splendour of their establishments and the prodigality of
                    their expenditure. But the court of France could never contrive to dispense with
                    these financial middle-men. The peasants were also liable to be called out by
                    the intendants of the provinces, in what were called <hi rend="italic"
                    >corvées,</hi> to work upon the high roads for a certain number of days in the
                    year. This was a source of severe oppression, as the intendant had the choice of
                    the time and place of their employment, and was not bound to accept of any
                    commutation in money. They were moreover subject to the nobles in a great
                    variety of ways. The latter retained all their ancient manorial or patrimonial
                    jurisdictions. The common people being anciently slaves, had obtained their
                    freedom upon different conditions. In many places they and their posterity
                    remained bound to pay a perpetual tribute to their feudal lords; and such
                    tributes formed a considerable part of' the revenue of many of the provincial
                    nobles. By a recent regulation, no man could be appointed an officer of the army
                    until he had produced proof’s of nobility for four generations. The parliaments,
                    although originally of the <hi rend="italic">tiers</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >état,</hi> attempted also to introduce a rule that none but the nobility should
                    be admitted into their order. It will not be accounted surprising, therefore,
                    that the common people of France were extremely ignorant and superstitious. They
                    were, however, passionately devoted to their monarch, and all that concerned
                    him. In 1754, when Louis XV. was taken ill at Metz, the whole nation was thrown
                    into a kind of despair. The courier who brought the news of his recovery to
                    Paris was almost suffocated by the embraces of the populace, who even extended
                    their loyal endearments to the horse which had carried him.</p>
                <p>The French monarch was, in every sense of the word, despotic. His power was
                    supported by the army, and by <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514578"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4578-0047"/>a watchful police with an infinite Kost of spies
                    and other servants in its pay· In France no man was safe. The secrets of private
                    families were searched into. Nothing, in feet, escaped the jealous inquisition
                    of tKe police. Men were seised by <hi rend="italic">lettres</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de cachet</hi> when they least expected it, and their families had
                    no means of discovering their fate. The sentence of a court of law against a
                    nobleman was usually reversed by the minister. No book could be published
                    without the license of a censor-general, appointed by the court, and the
                    minister was accountable to none but the king. No account was given of the
                    expenditure of the public money. Enormous gratifications and pensions were often
                    bestowed as the reward of the most infamous services. The supreme power of the
                    state was commonly lodged with a favourite mistress, who was sometimes a woman
                    taken from the stews. This was not indeed the case under Louis XVI., but it was
                    nevertheless one of the misfortunes of his life that he was far from being
                    absolute in his own family. Still, however, with all its manifold faults, the
                    French court was the most splendid and polished in Europe. It was more the
                    resort of men of talents and literature of every kind, and there they met with
                    more ample protection, than anywhere else. The court was often jealous of their
                    productions; but they met with the most distinguished attention from men of
                    fortune and rank; insomuch that for a century previous to this the French had
                    given the law to Europe in all questions of taste, literature, and polite
                    accomplishment. The gaiety and elegance which prevailed at court diffused itself
                    throughout the nation, and, amidst much internal misery, gave it an external
                    appearance of happiness, or at least of levity and vanity.</p>
                <p>But, such as it was, this government had stood for ages, and might have continued
                    much longer, had not a concurrence of causes contributed to its overthrow. The
                    inferior orders of the clergy, excluded from all chance of preferment, regarded
                    their superiors with jealousy and envy, and were ready to join the laity of
                    their own rank in any popular commotion. The inferior provincial nobility beheld
                    with contempt and indignation the vices and the power of the courtiers, and the
                    higher nobility desired to diminish the power of the crown. The practising
                    lawyers, being almost entirely excluded from the chance of becoming judges,
                    wished eagerly for a change of system, not doubting that their talents and
                    professional skill would render them necessary amidst any alterations which
                    might occur; and accordingly they were the first instruments in producing the
                    Revolution, and amongst its most active supporters. The monied interest eagerly
                    longed for the downfall of the ancient nobility. With respect to the great mass
                    of the common people, they were too ignorant, too superstitiously attached to
                    old establishments, and too much depressed, to have any distinct conception of
                    the nature of political liberty, or any hope of obtaining it; but their minds
                    were nevertheless in some measure prepared tor change, by the contagious
                    influence, as it were, of the passions which were fermenting around them.</p>
                <p>For forty years the principles of liberty had been disseminated with eagerness in
                    France by men of great talents, as Rousseau, Voltaire, Helvetius, and Raynal, to
                    whom the celebrated Montesquieu had led the way. Besides these, there was in
                    France a vast multitude of what were called men of letters, or persons who gave
                    this account of the manner in which they spent their time; and all these were
                    deeply engaged on the side of some kind of political reform. The men of letters
                    in Faris alone are said to have amounted to twenty thousand. One of the last
                    acta of the administration of the Archbishop of Toulouse was to publish a
                    resolution of the king in council, dated 5th July 1780, inviting all his
                    subjects to give him their advice with regard to the state of affairs. This was
                    considered as the concession of an unlimited liberty of the press; and it is
                    scarcely possible to form an idea of the infinite variety of political
                    publications which from that period diffused amongst the people a
                    dissatisfaction with the order of things under which they had hitherto lived.
                    The established religion of France had for some time past been gradually
                    undermined. It had been solemnly assaulted by philosophers in various elaborate
                    performances; and the men of wit, amongst whom Voltaire took the lead, had
                    attacked it with the dangerous weapon of ridicule, which in France is so much
                    more effective than argument. The Roman Catholic religion is much exposed in
                    this respect, in consequence of the multitude of false miracles and legendary
                    tales with which its history abounds. But, without discriminating between the
                    principles on which it rests, and the superstitious follies by which these had
                    been defaced, the French nation learned to laugh at the whole, and rejected
                    instead of reforming the religion of their fathers. Thus the first order in the
                    state had already begun to be regarded as useless, and the minds of men were
                    prepared for important changes.</p>
                <p>Upon the whole, then, it appears that a great variety of causes contributed, some
                    more and others less directly, to bring about that grand social and political
                    movement which, in the early part of its career, dashed in pieces the oldest
                    monarchy in Europe, and gave to the regenerative principle an impulse which has
                    been felt even in distant nations, and the ultimate effects of which no one can
                    as yet compute. In the first place, the destruction of the power of the great
                    vassals of the crown, and the consolidation of the monarchy into one great
                    kingdom, during the reigns of Louis XI, Francis I., and Henry IV., was essential
                    to the Revolution; for, had the central power been weaker, and the privileges of
                    the great feudatories remained unimpaired, France, like Germany, would most
                    probably have been split into a number of independent principalities, all unity
                    of feeling or national energy would have been lost in the division of interests,
                    and a revolution would no more have happened in France than in Silesia or
                    Saxony. Secondly, the military spirit of the French, and the native valour which
                    a long series of national triumphs had sustained, inspired them with the moral
                    courage to commence, and the fortitude to maintain, a conflict, under which a
                    people differently circumstanced would have speedily sunk. Thirdly, the spirit
                    of free investigation which distinguished the eighteenth century, and which,
                    from expatiating in the regions of taste and philosophy, passed, by an easy
                    transition, into those of politics and religion, no doubt contributed powerfully
                    to produce that change of opinion which sooner or later brings about important
                    alterations in the institutions of a country. This freedom of inquiry and
                    discussion, which assumed its greatest latitude in the writings of Voltaire,
                    Rousseau, Rayna), and the Encyclopaedists, existed by sufferance, it is true,
                    and was confined to abstract questions alone; yet the fact of its having been
                    tolerated is a proof that the minds of men were prepared to rc-consider all
                    received opinions, and that the religious and political speculations which are
                    commonly supposed to have created the revolutionary spirit, were in reality the
                    symptoms of a change already operated, but which they contributed incalculably
                    to extend and confirm. Fourthly, the church in France experienced the fate of
                    all attempts in an advancing age to fetter the human mind by the shackles of an
                    antiquated creed, or the tyranny of an overgrown and corrupt hierarchy; the
                    resistance to its authority became general, the good and the bad parts of its
                    doctrine were indiscriminately rejected, and blind belief gave place to the most
                    uncompromising scepticism. Infidelity became a test of mental independence; and
                    the progress of philosophical speculation, as evinced in the writings of Raynal,
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514591" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4591-0048"/>Voltaire,
                    Diderot, and Rousseau, served more an&lt; more to confirm the tendency to which
                    we have alluded Fifthly, the exclusive immunities enjoyed by the nobility the
                    grievances which the French nation suffered in conse quence, and the insolence
                    of privileged tyranny, which iι even more keenly resented than the tyranny
                    itself, wen mainly instrumental in bringing about the Revolution “Numerous and
                    serious as the grievances of the French nation were,” says Rivarol, “it was not
                    these that occasioned the Revolution. Neither the taxes, nor the <hi
                    rend="italic">lettret de cäcħet,</hi> nor the other abuses of authority, nor the
                    vexations of the prefects, nor the ruinous delays of justice, irritated the
                    nation: it was the <hi rend="italic">prestige</hi> of nobility which excited all
                    the ferment, a fact which proves that it was the shopkeepers, the men of
                    letters, the monied interest, in a word, all those who were jealous of the
                    nobility, who roused against them the lower classes in the towns, and the
                    peasantry in the country. In truth, it was an extraordinary circumstance that
                    the nation should say to a child possessed of parchment, ’ You shall one day be
                    either a prelate, or a marshal, or an ambassador, as you choose,' whilst it has
                    nothing to offer to its other children.” And to all these may be added, as
                    concurring and co-operating causes, first, the unprecedented inequality of
                    taxation; secondly, the state of the labouring poor, who had been reduced to the
                    most abject misery; thirdly, the non-residence of the landed proprietors,
                    drawing after it, as is almost invariably the case, a discontented tenantry and
                    a neglected country; fourthly, the local burdens and feudal services due by the
                    tenantry to their feudal superiors, which were to the last degree vexatious and
                    oppressive; fifthly, the royal prerogative, which, by a series of successful
                    usurpations, had reached a height inconsistent with any thing like real freedom;
                    sixthly, the corruption which had long tainted the manners of the court, and
                    poisoned all the sources of influence; seventhly, the American war, which,
                    whilst the minds of the people were in a ferment, lighted a spark that speedily
                    set fire to the train; eighthly, the state of the army, both in pointof feeling
                    and discipline; and, lastly, the spirit of innovation, which may justly be
                    considered as “the joint effect and full result” of all the causes we have
                    enumerated. But so many causes of disaffection did not come all at once into
                    action; many of them had long been in operation. During the whole reign of Louis
                    XV. the discontents of the people were gradually increasing, and it was already
                    foreseen that the reign of his successor would be one of anxiety and trouble. “I
                    have had great difficulty,” said Louis XV. “in extricating myself from the
                    quarrels with the parliaments during my whole reign; let my grandson take care
                    of them, for it is more than probable they will endanger his crown.”
                    Subsequently to the peace of 1763, a growing discontent prevailed in the nation;
                    headed, in the first instance, by a portion of the nobility, who were either
                    impelled by the force of public opinion, or ambitious of f&gt;opular applause,
                    and augmented latterly by the number-ess faults of the government, the
                    corruption of the court, and the misery of the country.</p>
                <p>The immense population of the city of Paris rendered it an important engine in
                    the hands of the fomenters and conductors of the Revolution. An overgrown
                    capital has always proved dangerous to a government which is or attempts to be
                    despotic; as appears from the history of ancient Babylon and Rome, as well as
                    that of modern Constantinople, London under Charles I., and Paris in the times
                    of the League and the Fronde. The general scarcity of grain which occurred about
                    this period also assisted not a little in producing many of the convulsions
                    attending the Revolution. On Sunday the 13th of July 1788, about nine in the
                    morning, without any eclipse, darkness suddenly overspread several parts of
                    France; a phenomenon</p>
                <p>1 which formed the prelude to a tempest unexampled in the . temperate region of
                    Europe. Wind, rain, hail, and thun- , der, seemed to contend in impetuosity; but
                    the hail proved</p>
                <p>- the greatest instrument of destruction. Instead of the 9 rich prospects of an
                    early autumn, the face of nature in</p>
                <p>* the space of an hour presented the dreary aspect of uni- . versai winter. The
                    soil was converted into a morass, and i the standing corn beaten into the
                    quagmire; the vines</p>
                <p>- were broken to pieces, and the fruit trees demolished; <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >í</hi> whilst unmelted hail lay in heaps like rocks of solid ice.</p>
                <p>• Even the most robust forest trees were unable to with-</p>
                <p>, stand the fury of the tempest. The hail was composed of i large, solid, angular
                    pieces of ice, some of them weighing i from eight to ten ounces. The country
                    people, beaten <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> down in the fields on their way to
                    church, amidst this concussion of the elements, concluded that the last day
                    had</p>
                <p>I arrived; and, scarcely attempting to extricate themselves, lay despairing and
                    half suffocated amidst the water and</p>
                <p>I the mud, expecting the immediate dissolution of all things. But the storm was
                    irregular in its devastations. Whilst several rich districts were laid entirely
                    waste, some intermediate portions of country remained comparatively little
                    injured. One district of sixty square leagues had not a single ear of corn or
                    fruit of any kind left. Of the sixty-six parishes in the district of Pontoise,
                    forty-three were entirely desolated; and of the remaining twenty-three some lost
                    two thirds and others half their harvest. The Isle of France, being the district
                    in which Paris is situated, and the Orleannois, appear to have suffered most
                    severely. The damage done there, upon a moderate computation, amounted to eighty
                    millions of livres, or between three and four millions sterling. Such a calamity
                    must at any period have been severely felt; but occurring on the eve of a great
                    political revolution, and amidst a general scarcity throughout Europe, it was
                    peculiarly unfortunate, and occasioned more embarrassment to the government than
                    perhaps any other event whatever. Numbers of families found it necessary to
                    contract their mode of living for a time, and to dismiss their servants, who
                    were thus left destitute of bread. Added to the public discontent and political
                    dissensions, this calamity produced such an effect upon the people in general,
                    that the nation seemed to have changed its character; and instead of that levity
                    by which it had ever been distinguished, a deep gloom seemed now to settle down
                    on every countenance.</p>
                <p>The spring of the year 1789 was a period of much political anxiety in France. The
                    superior orders wished to reduce the power of the crown, but were jealous of
                    their own privileges, and determined to retain them; whilst the popular
                    philosophers and others were endeavouring to render them odious, and to rouse
                    the people to a love of freedom. Still, however, the great body of the common
                    people remained careless spectators of the struggle, and unconscious of the
                    approaching convulsion. Such was their indifference, indeed, that few of them
                    took the trouble even to attend and vote at the elections of the deputies to the
                    States General. In many places where a thousand voters were expected, scarcely
                    fifty came forward; but such of them as did appear showed that a seed had been
                    sown which might one day produce important fruits. In the instructions which
                    they gave to their deputies, the British constitution formed in general the
                    model upon which they wished their government to be reconstructed. They demanded
                    equal taxation, the abolition of <hi rend="italic">lettres</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de cachet</hi> or arbitrary imprisonment, the responsibility of ministers, and
                    the extinction of the feudal privileges of the nobles; but they wished that the
                    whole three orders of the state should sit and vote in one house, well knowing
                    that their nobility were not prepared to act the moderate part of the British
                    House of Lords. The nobles, on the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514604"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4604-0049"/>other hand, though willing to renounce some of
                    their pecuniary immunities, and to sacrifice the power of the crown, were most
                    decidedly resolved neither to surrender their feudal prerogatives, nor to give
                    up the right of sitting in three separate assemblies; by means of which each of
                    the orders could easily resist the encroachments of the two others. Μ. Neckar
                    has been severely censured for not deciding this last and important question
                    previously to the meeting of the States General; but it must be observed, that
                    the very purpose of calling that assembly together was to overturn, through its
                    medium, and without any direct interposition on the part of the ministers, the
                    unjust privileges of the higher orders. Had the king positively decided in
                    favour of three chambers, the nobles and the clergy would have retained all
                    those ancient privileges established in their favour, of which it was his wish
                    to deprive them, and the crown and its prerogatives would have been the only
                    objects of sacrifice. It was therefore thought safer to leave the <hi
                    rend="italic">tiers</hi><hi rend="italic">état</hi> to fight its own battle; nor
                    was it yet imagined that the commons of France, depressed, and poor, and
                    dispersed over a multitude of provinces, could ever unite in enterprises
                    dangerous to the power of the sovereign.</p>
                <p>f The States had been summoned to meet at Versailles • on the 27th of April, and
                    most of the deputies arrived at that time; but as the elections for the city of
                    Paris were not concluded, the king deferred the commencement of their sessions
                    until the 4th of May. During this period the members, left in idleness, began to
                    find out and form acquaintance with one another. In particular, a few from
                    Bretagne formed themselves into a club, into which they gradually admitted such
                    other deputies as were found to be zealous in the popular cause, and also many
                    persons who were not deputies. This society, which took the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Comité</hi><hi rend="italic">Breton,</hi> was originally
                    established at Versailles, and was destined, under the appellation of the
                    Jacobin Club, to give laws to France, and to diffuse terror and alarm throughout
                    Europe. On the other hand, the aristocratic party established conferences at the
                    house of Madame de Polignac, for the purpose, as was alleged, of uniting the
                    nobles and the clergy. An event occurred at this time which all parties ascribed
                    to some malicious motive. In the populous suburb of St Antoine, where a person
                    named Réveillon carried on a great paper manufactory, a false report was spread
                    that this individual intended tp lower the wages of his workmen, and that he had
                    declared that bread was too good for them, and that they might subsist well
                    enough on patato-flour. A commotion was raised, Réveillon was burned in effigy,
                    and his house thereafter burned and pillaged by the mob, who were not dispersed
                    till the military had been called in, and many lives lost. The popular party
                    asserted that this commotion had been artfully excited by the party of the queen
                    and the Count d’Artois, to afford a pretence for bringing great bodies of the
                    military to the neighbourhood, in order to overawe the States General, or induce
                    the king to resolve on assembling that body at Versailles in preference to
                    Paris, where they and the popular minister Neckar wished the assemblage to take'
                    place.</p>
                <p>On the 4th of May the States General assembled at Versailles, and commenced
                    business by going to church in solemn procession, preceded by the clergy, and
                    followed by the king, according to ancient custom, to perform an act of
                    devotion. The nobles were arrayed in splendid robes, and, like the higher
                    clergy, glittered in gold and jewels. The commons appeared in black, the dress
                    belonging to the law. The assembly was thereafter opened by a short speech from
                    the throne, in which the king congratulated himself on thus meeting his people
                    assembled; alluded to the national debt, and the taxes, which were severely felt
                    because unequally levied; and noticed the general discontent and spirit of
                    innovation which prevailed, but declared his confidence in the wisdom of the
                    assembly for remedying every evil. Μ. Barretin, the keeper of the seals, next
                    addressed the assembly in a congratulatory speech, and was followed by Neckar.
                    The latter spoke for three hours; but though much applauded on account of the
                    clear financial details which his speech contained, he encountered a certain
                    degree of censure from all parties, on account of the cautious ambiguity which
                    he observed regarding the future proceedings of the States General.</p>
                <p>The following day the three orders assembled separately. The deputies of the <hi
                    rend="italic">tiers</hi><hi rend="italic">état</hi> amounted to six hundred in
                    number, and those of the nobles and clergy to three hundred each. During the
                    earlier sittings much time was spent in unimportant debates about trifling
                    points of form; and the first important question which came under discussion was
                    the verification of their powers, or production of the commissions of the
                    members, and the investigation of their authenticity. The commons laid hold of
                    this as a pretext for opening the grand controversy, whether the States General
                    should sit in one or in three separate chambers; and they sent a deputation
                    inviting the nobles and the clergy to meet along with them in the commonhall,
                    for the purpose of verifying their powers in one common assembly. In the chamber
                    of the clergy a hundred and fourteen members voted for the performance of this
                    ceremony in the general assembly, and a hundred and thirty-three against it; but
                    in the order of the nobles the resolution for the verification in their own
                    assembly was carried by a majority of a hundred and eighty-eight to forty-seven.
                    The commons, however, paid no regard to this. Conducted by bold and skilful
                    leaders, who discerned the importance of the point in contest, they resolved not
                    to abandon it. Hence the latter, though fully cognisant of the exigencies of the
                    state, and aware that, owing to the deficiency in the revenue, a short delay
                    might lead to the absolute dissolution of the government, suffered five weeks to
                    pass away in total inactivity. During this period proposals were made on the
                    part of the ministry for a pacification between the three orders, and
                    conferences were opened by commissioners from each; but no art could induce the
                    commons to abandon their original purpose, or prevail with them to enter upon
                    the business of the state.</p>
                <p>The nation having expected much from the assembling of the States General,
                    received the intelligence of their in-&lt; action with no small degree of
                    concern. But as the <hi rend="italic">tiers '</hi><hi rend="italic">état</hi>
                    was naturally popular, public censure could not readily fall upon that favourite
                    order. Besides, from the period of their assembling, the commons had made every
                    effort to augment their own popularity. They admitted all persons promiscuously
                    into the galleries, and even into the body of their hall; no restraint was
                    attempted to be laid upon the most vehement marks of popular applause or
                    censure; lists of the names of the voters were publicly taken and sent to Paris
                    upon every remarkable occasion; and thus the members suddenly found that,
                    according to their political sentiments, they became objects of general
                    execration or applause. The new and bold notions of liberty which were daily
                    advanced by the leaders of the <hi rend="italic">tiers</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >état</hi> were received with acclamation by their hearers; the capital became
                    interested in the issue of every debate; and the political fervour thus
                    generated thrilled along every nerve and sinew of society. The commons accused
                    the nobles of obstinately impeding the business of the state, by refusing to
                    verify their powers in one common assembly; and the accusation was greedily
                    swallowed by the multitude. The nobles accordingly became every day more
                    unpopular. Their persons were insulted; and new publications daily appeared, in
                    which their order was reviled, and represented as an useless or pernicious
                    incumbrance, not to be tolerated in a free state. Whoever adhered to them was
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514617" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4617-0050"/>branded with
                    the odious appellation of aristocrat. The clergy, from the influence of the
                    parish curés or parsons, seemed ready to desert their cause; and they were even
                    opposed by a minority of their own body, which derived lustre from having at its
                    head the Duke of Orleans. Still, however, the majority of the nobles remained
                    firm; well aware, that if they once consented to sit in the same assembly, and
                    to vote promiscuously, with the more numerous body of the commons, their whole
                    order, with all its exclusive privileges, must speedily be overthrown.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the leaders of the commons saw that a change was taking place in the
                    minds of men; and regarding the period as at length arrived when they might
                    emerge from their inactivity, and seize the whole legislative authority, they
                    declared that the representatives of the nobles and the clergy were only the
                    deputies of particular incorporations, who might sit and vote along with them,
                    but who had no title in a collective capacity to act as the legislators of
                    France. For conducting business with more facility, twenty committees were
                    named. On the suggestion of the Abbé Sieyes, a final message was sent to the
                    privileged orders, requiring their attendance as individuals, and intimating
                    that the commons, as the deputies of ninety-six out of every hundred of their
                    countrymen, were about to assume the exclusive power of legislation. None of the
                    nobles obeyed the summons; but three curés, named Cesve, Ballard, and Jallot,
                    presented their commissions, and were received with loud acclamations; and the
                    following day these were followed by five more, amongst whom were Grégoire,
                    Dillon, and Bodineau. After some debate concerning the appellation which they
                    ought to assume, the commons, with such of the clergy as had joined them,
                    solemnly voted themselves the sovereign legislators of their country, under the
                    name of the National Assembly. When the result of the vote was declared, the
                    hall resounded with shouts, from an immense concourse of spectators, of <hi
                    rend="italic">Vive le Roi et vive l’Assemblée Nationale.</hi> Μ. Bailly was
                    chosen president for four days only, MM. Camus and Pison de Galand were
                    appointed secretaries, and the assembly proceeded to business.</p>
                <p>The first acts of the National Assembly were decisively expressive of its own
                    sovereignty. All taxes imposed without the consent of the representatives of the
                    people were declared to be null and void; but a temporary sanction was given to
                    the existing taxes, though illegal, till the dissolution of the assembly, and no
                    longer; and it was added, that as soon as the assembly should be able to fix, in
                    concert with his majesty, the principles of national regeneration, it would take
                    into consideration the national debt, and place the creditors of the state under
                    the safeguard of the national honour.</p>
                <p>The popular cause now gained ground so fast, that on the 19th of June a majority
                    of the clergy voted for the verification of their pow ers in common with the
                    National Assembly, and resolved to unite with them on the following day. Affairs
                    had thus come to a crisis, and the nobles perceived that they must instantly
                    make a decisive stand, or yield up their cause as utterly lost. So great indeed
                    was their alarm, that Μ. d’Espremenil proposed, at one of the sittings of their
                    order, to address the king, entreating him to dissolve the States General.
                    Hitherto that prince had gone along with Neckar in favouring the popular cause
                    in opposition to the aristocracy. But every art was now used to alarm his mind
                    regarding the late assumptions of power on the part of the commons; and these
                    arts were at length successful. Repeated councils were held; and as Neckar was
                    absent attending a dying sister, the king was prevailed upon to enter into the
                    views of the aristocratical leaders. But the first measure which they adopted
                    was so ill conducted as to afford little prospect of final success to their
                    cause. On the 20th of June, when the president and mem bers were about to enter
                    as usual into their own hall, they found it unexpectedly surrounded by a
                    detachment of the guards, who refused them admission, whilst the herald at the
                    same time proclaimed a royal session. Alarmed at this unforeseen event, the
                    meaning of which they knew not, but apprehending that an immediate dissolution
                    of the assembly was intended, they instantly retired to a neighbouring
                    tennis-court, where, in the heat of their enthusiasm, they took a solemn oath
                    never to separate until the constitution they had promised the country should be
                    completed. On the 22d a new proclamation intimated that the royal session was
                    deferred till the following day. It was now alleged that the assembly had been
                    excluded from their hall merely because the workmen were occupied in preparing
                    it for the intended solemnity. But this information was not calculated to excite
                    favourable expectations of the measures about to be adopted at a royal session,
                    ushered in by such circumstances of disrespect to the representatives of the
                    people. The assembly, after wandering about in quest of a place of meeting, at
                    length entered the church of St Louis, and were immediately joined by the
                    majority of the clergy, with their president the Archbishop of Vienne at their
                    head. Two nobles of Dauphine, the Marquis de Blaçon and the Count d <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Agoult, at the same time presented their commissions.
                    Encouraged by these events, and by the applause of the multitude, the assembly
                    now waited with firmness the measures about to be adopted.</p>
                <p>The royal session was held in the most splendid form, ] but altogether in the
                    style of the ancient despotism. Sol-c diers surrounded the hall. The two
                    superior orders were seated, whilst the representatives of the people, who had
                    been left standing a full hour in the rain, were in no humour, when at last
                    admitted, to receive with much complacency the commands of their sovereign. The
                    king read a discourse, in which he declared null and void the resolutions of the
                    17th, but at the same time presented the programme of a constitution for France.
                    This scheme contained many good and patriotic principles, but preserved the
                    distinction of orders, and the exercise of <hi rend="italic">lettres</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de cachet;</hi> it said nothing about any active share in the
                    legislative power to be possessed by the States General, and was silent
                    respecting the responsibility of ministers and the liberty of the press. The
                    king concluded by commanding the deputies immediately to retire, and to assemble
                    again on the following day; after which he then withdrew, and was followed by
                    all the nobles and a part of the clergy. The commons remained on their seats in
                    gloomy silence; but this was at length interrupted by the grand master of the
                    ceremonies, who reminded the president of the intentions of the king. The words
                    were scarcely uttered wlu?n Mirabeau, starting from his seat, exclaimed, “The
                    commons of France have determined to debate. We have heard the intentions which
                    have been suggested to the king; and you, who cannot be his agent with the
                    States General, you, who have here neither seat nor voice, nor a right to speak,
                    are not the person to remind us of his speech. Go tell your master, that we are
                    here by the power of the people, and that nothing shall expel us but the
                    bayenet.” The applause of the assembly seconded the enthusissm of the orator,
                    and the master of the ceremonies withdrew in silence. Μ. Camus then rose, and
                    having in a vehement speech stigmatized the royal session by the obnoxieus
                    appellation of a bed of justice, he concluded by moving that the assembly should
                    declare their unqualified adherence to their former decrees. This motion was
                    followed by another, declaring the persons of the deputies inviolable; and both
                    were unanimously decreed. The assembly accordingly continued their sittings in
                    the usual form. On the following day the majority of the clergy attended as
                    members; and on the 2ŏth the Duke of Orleans, along with forty-nine of the
                    deputies belonging to the order ofnobility, also joined <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193514630" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4630-0051"/>them. The remaining nobles,
                    as well as the small minority of the clergy, now found themselves awkwardly
                    situated; but whether on this account, or because their leaders had by this time
                    formed a plan for carrying their point by the aid of a military force, the king,
                    by a pressing letter, invited both orders to join the commons; and this request
                    was immediately complied with, though many of the nobility highly disapproved of
                    the measure.</p>
                <p>The situation of France had now become truly alarming. When the king retired from
                    the assembly after the royal session, he was followed by more than six thousand
                    citizens, with loud clamours and every mark of disapprobation. At Versailles all
                    was speedily in an uproar. Neckar had repeatedly solicited his dismission, the
                    report of which increased the popular clamour. The court was in consternation.
                    The king nnw discovered that his minister was more popular than himself. At six
                    o’clock in the evening the queen sent for Μ. Neckar; and when he returned from
                    the palace, he assured the crowd who waited for him that he would not abandon
                    them, upon which they retired satisfied. At the same time the news of the royal
                    session had thrown the city of Paris into violent agitation. The peace of that
                    capital was at this time endangered by a variety of causes. A dreadful famine
                    raged throughout the land, and, as is usual in such cases, was most severely
                    felt in the capital. This prepared the minds of men for receiving unfavourable
                    impressions as to the political state of the country; and, besides, every effort
                    was made to disorganize the government, and produce a dislike of the ancient
                    order of things. The press poured forth innumerable publications, filled with
                    new and seducing, though generally impracticable, theories of liberty; and these
                    were not only distributed gratis amongst the people of Paris, but dispersed in
                    the same manner throughout the provinces. Philip duke of Orleans, presumptive
                    heir to the crown after the children and brothers of the king, is with good
                    reason believed to have supplied out of his more than princely revenues the
                    expense of these publications. In the gardens of the Palais Royal, which
                    belonged to him, an immense multitude was daily assembled, listening from
                    morning till night to orators who descanted upon the most exciting topics of
                    popular politics, and many of whom were suspected to be in his pay. It was even
                    believed, we wish we could say without reason, that his money found its way into
                    the pockets of some of the most distinguished leaders in the National
                    Assembly.</p>
                <p>But the government was, if possible, still more endangered by the methods which
                    were now employed to seduce the military from their duty. Every officer of the
                    French army belonged to the order of nobility; and hence it might have been
                    imagined that but little danger was to be apprehended from a body so commanded.
                    But this very circumstance became the means of disorganizing that great engine
                    of despotism. As the soldiers could not avoid imbibing the new opinions, their
                    officers became the first objects of the⅛ jealousy, especially in consequence of
                    the impolitic edict of Louis XVI. which required every officer to produce proofs
                    of four degrees of nobility, and thus insulted, by avowedly excluding, the
                    plebeians from promotion. With a view to what might eventually occur, the
                    instructions to the deputies of the <hi rend="italic">tiers</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">état</hi> had recommended an increase of the pay of the soldiers;
                    and now every art was employed to gain them to the popular cause. They were
                    conducted to the Palais Royal, and there caressed and flattered by the populace,
                    whilst they listened to the popular harangues. Nor were the arts of corruption
                    unsuccessful. On the 23d of June the military refused to fire on the mob in a
                    tumult; and when some of their number were on the 30th reported to be in
                    confinement for this offence, a crowd instantly collected and rescued them, the
                    dragoons who were brought to suppress the tumult grounding their arms. A
                    deputation of the citizens solicited the assembly to obtain the pardon of the
                    prisoners; and the assembly applied to the king, who ' pardoned them
                    accordingly.</p>
                <p>All these events, together with the tumultuous state of the capital, which was
                    daily increasing, rendered it necessary for the king to call out the military
                    force, in order, if possible, to restore the public peace. That his intentions
                    were to re-establish order, the actual state of affairs will not permit us to
                    doubt; but the aristocracy, with the Count d’Artois at their head, were engaged
                    in bringing forward other measures, which ultimately contributed to ruin the
                    king and the monarchy. Crowds of soldiers were collected, from all parts of the
                    kingdom, around Paris and Versailles; and it was observed, that these consisted
                    principally of foreign troops. Camps were traced out, and Marshal Broglio, an
                    officer of exaggerated reputation, was placed at the head of the army. The king
                    was supposed to have entirely yielded to new counsels, and every thing betokened
                    a desperate effort to restore the energy of the ancient government. This was
                    indeed the most interesting and important period of the French revolution; it
                    formed as it were the pivot on which the whole movement turned; yet the specific
                    designs of the leading actors have never been clearly understood, though their
                    general tendency has always been perfectly intelligible. It was rumoured at the
                    time, that Paris was to be subdued by a bombardment, and that the assembly was
                    to be dissolved, and its leaders put to death. But although such reports were
                    entitled to small credit, the crisis of French liberty was at hand, and the
                    existence of the National Assembly as an independent body, at least upon any
                    other footing than that proposed by the king on the 23d of June, was also
                    involved. An able and eloquent address.to the king against the assemblage of
                    foreign troops in their neighbourhood was in the mean time brought forward by
                    Mirabeau, and voted by the assembly. The king replied that the state of the
                    capital was the cause of assembling the troops, and offered to transfer the
                    States General to Noyons or Soissons. “We will remove neither to Noyons nor to
                    Soissons,” exclaimed Mirabeau; “we will not place ourselves between two hostile
                    armies, that which is besieging Paris, and that which may fall upon us through
                    Flanders or Alsace: we have not asked permission to run away from the troops; we
                    have desired that the troops should be removed from the capital.”</p>
                <p>Thirty-five thousand men were now stationed in the neighbourhood of Paris and of
                    Versailles. The posts which commanded the city were occupied, and camps were
                    marked out for a greater force. The Count d’Artois and his party regarded their
                    plans as ripe for execution; and Neckar received an order from the king,
                    ordaining him to quit the kingdom in twenty-four hours. That popular minister
                    dined with his family after receiving the commands of his sovereign, and the
                    same evening set out for Brussels. In his dismission the democratic party
                    perceived that a resolution had been adopted to accomplish their ruin. The
                    assembly therefore again addressed the throne, and requested anew the removal of
                    the troops, offering to become responsible for the public peace, and to proceed
                    in a body to Paris to encounter personally every danger which might occur. But
                    they were coolly told that the king was the best judge of the mode of employing
                    the troops, and that the presence of the assembly was necessary at Versailles.
                    On receiving this reply, it was instantly decreed, on the motion of the Marquis
                    de Lafayette, that the late ministry had carried with them the confidence of the
                    assembly; that the troops ought to be removed; that the ministry should be held
                    responsible to the people for their conduct; that the assembly persisted in all
                    its former decrees; and that as it had taken the public debt under the
                    protection of the nation, no power in France was entitled to pronounce the
                    degrading word bankruptcy.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514643" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4643-0052"/>
                <p>The city of Paris was thrown into great consternation by the news of Neckars
                    retreat. His bust and that of the Duke of Orleans were dressed in mourning, and
                    carried through the streets. But the royal Allemand, a German regiment, having
                    broken in pieces the busts, dispersed the populace; and the Prince de Lambesc,
                    grand-ecuyer of France, was ordered to advance with his regiment of cavalry, and
                    take post at the Tuilleries. Being a man of a violent temper, and enraged at the
                    appearances of disapprobation which were visible around him, the latter
                    furiously cut down with his sword an old man who was walking peaceably in the
                    gardens. The consequences of this inhuman act were such as might have been
                    expected. A shout of execration instantly arose; the cry to arms was heard; the
                    military was assaulted on all sides; the French guards joined their countrymen,
                    and compelled the Germans, overpowered by numbers, and unsupported by the rest
                    of the army, to retire. All order was now at an end, and as night approached
                    universal terror diffused itself throughout the city. Bands of robbers were
                    collecting; and from them, or from the foreign soldiery, a general pillage was
                    expected. The night passed away in consternation and tumult; and it was found in
                    the morning that the hospital of St Lazare had already been plundered. The alarm
                    bells were rung, and the citizens having assembled at the Hôtel de Ville,
                    adopted a proposal which was there made for enrolling themselves as a militia,
                    under the appellation of the National Guard. This day and the succeeding night
                    were spent in tolerable quietness, without any attempt being made on the part of
                    the army. But on the morning of the 14th of July it was discovered that the
                    troops encamped in the Champs Elisées had moved off, and an immediate assault
                    was therefore expected. The national guard now amounted to a hundred and fifty
                    thousand men; but they were in general destitute of arms. They assumed a green
                    cockade; but on recollecting that this was the livery of the Count d’Artois,
                    they adopted one of red, blue, and white; and this was the origin of the tricoor
                    cockade. Μ. de la Salle was named commander in chief; officers were chosen; and
                    detachments were sent round in quest of arms. In the Hôtel des Invalides were
                    found upwards of thirty thousand stand of arms, together with twenty pieces of
                    cannon. Avariety of weapons were also procured from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >garde-meuble de la couronne,</hi> and from the shops of armourers, cutlers, and
                    others.</p>
                <p>The too famous fortress of the Bastille was an object of natural hatred to the
                    Parisians. Within its walls, courage, genius, and innocence, had long wept
                    unseen, and its doleful echoes had often responded to the stifled cries of
                    despair. At eleven o’clock in the morning, Μ. de la Rosière, at the head of a
                    numerous deputation, waited upon Μ. Delaunay, the governor, who promised, along
                    with the officers of his garrison, that they would not fire upon the city unless
                    they were attacked. But a report was soon spread throughout Paris that Μ.
                    Delaunay had a short time thereafter admitted into the fortress a multitude of
                    persons, and then treacherously massacred them. The origin of this rumour has
                    never been discovered. The fact itself has been denied; but it was attested at
                    the time by the Duke of Dorset, then British ambassador at the court of France.
                    The effect of it was the adoption of a resolution to assault the Bastille; in
                    consequence of which an immense and furious multitude rushed into its outer, and
                    soon forced their way into its inner, courts, where they received and returned a
                    severe fire for the space of an hour. The French guards, who were now embodied
                    into the national guard, conducted the attack with equal skill and coolness.
                    They dragged three waggons loaded with straw to the foot of the walls, and there
                    set them on fire, by which means the garrison were prevented from taking aim,
                    whilst the smoke proved no hindrance to the assailants. The besieging multitude
                    pressed the attack with incredible obstinacy for the space of four hours; the
                    garrison was thrown in confusion; the officers served the cannon in person, and
                    fired muskets in the ranks; whilst the governor in despair thrice attempted to
                    blow up the fortress. A capitulation was at length sought, but refused to the
                    garrison, and an unconditional surrender demanded. This at length took place,
                    and the governor, with Μ. de Losme Salbrai, his major, became victims of the
                    popular fury, in spite of every effort which could be made for their protection;
                    but the French guards succeeded in saving the lives of the garrison. Only seven
                    prisoners were found in the Bastille. A guard was placed in it, and the keys
                    were sent to the celebrated Μ. Brissot, who a few years before had inhabited one
                    of its dungeons. The remaining part of this eventful day was spent at Paris in a
                    mixture of wild triumph and excessive alarm. In the pocket of the governor of
                    the Bastille there had been found a letter written by Μ. de Flesselles, the <hi
                    rend="italic">prévôt des marchands,</hi> or chief city magistrate, who had
                    pretended to be a most zealous patriot, encouraging him to resistance by the
                    promise of speedy support. This piece of treachery was punished by instant
                    death; and the bloody head of Flesselles was carried through the city on a pole,
                    along with that of Μ. Delaunay. On the approach of night a body of troops
                    advanced towards the city by the Barrière d’Enfer; but the national guard
                    hurried thither, preceded by a train of artillery, and the troops withdrew upon
                    the first fire. Barricades were everywhere formed, the alarm-bells were rung,
                    and a general illumination continued throughout the night.</p>
                <p>In the mean time it was obvious that the new ministry were entering upon a
                    difficult scene of action, where one false step might lead to ruin, and where
                    their own plans of conduct required to be maturely digested. Marshal Broglio was
                    appointed minister of war; the Baron de Breteuil, president of finance; Μ. de la
                    Galezière, comptroller-general; Μ. de Laporte, intendant of the war department;
                    and Μ. Foulon, intendant of the navy: but they were only destined to act as
                    official men under the Count d’Artois, and the other leaders of the aristocracy.
                    To the latter there scarcely remained even a choice of difficulties; in fact no
                    resource was left but that of overawing by military force the National Assembly
                    and the capital, and risking the desperate measure of a national bankruptcy, to
                    avoid which the court had convoked the States General. But no trace exists of
                    any attempt to employ this last and desperate resource. The evening after the
                    departure of Μ. Neckar was spent by the court of Versailles in festivity, as if
                    a victory had been gained; and the courtiers of both sexes went round among the
                    soldiery, striving to secure their fidelity by caresses, and every species of
                    flattering attention. The ministry, however, not only failed to support the
                    Prince de Lambesc in the post which he had been sent to occupy, but suffered the
                    whole of the 13th to pass in indecision, whilst the capital was in a state of
                    rebellion, an army formally mustering within its walls, and the names of the
                    principal nobiKty publicly exposed in lists of proscription. They accordingly
                    received with confusion and dismay the news of the capture of the Bastille; and
                    these feelings were increased by information received from Marshal Broglio that
                    the troops refused to act against the Parisians or the National Assembly. In
                    this perplexity they adopted the miserable device of concealing from the king
                    the real state of public affairs; and that unfortunate prince was thus perhaps
                    the only person who remained ignorant of the convulsions in which his country
                    was involved. At length, about midnight, the Duke of Liancourt forced his way
                    into the king’s apartment, and informed him of the revolt of the capital and the
                    army, and of the surrender of the fortress of the Bastille. The Count d’Artois,
                    who was present, still attempted to retain the monarch under the fata) delusion
                    which it had been the object of this communication to destroy<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193514656" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4656-0053"/>; but the Duke of Liancourt,
                    turning round, exclaimed, “As for you, Sir, your life can only be saved by
                    instant flight; I have seen with horror your name in the bloody list of the
                    proscribed.” The count, with the members of his short-lived administration and
                    their adherents, accordingly fled to the frontiers; and thus commenced an
                    emigration which, depriving the throne of its natural supporters, left the field
                    open to the declared enemies of the monarchy. This ministry had, no doubt, many
                    difficulties to contend with; but an accurate examination of their conduct
                    excites a suspicion which, whilst it exculpates them from much that has been
                    laid to their charge, does little honour either to their talents or their
                    character, namely, that they had come into office without having formed any
                    regular plan of conduct, and that, acting without decision, they became the
                    sport of events which they wanted skill and vigour to direct or control.</p>
                <p>But in spite of all that had occurred, the monarch was still personally beloved.
                    Early the following morning the king went to the assembly, though with none of
                    the usual solemnities. He regretted the commotions of the capital, disavowed any
                    knowledge of an intention against the persons of the deputies, and intimated
                    that he had commanded the removal of the troops. A deep silence prevailed for
                    some moments, but this was succeeded by vehement and universal shouts of
                    applause. When the king rose to depart, the whole assembly instantly crowded
                    around him, and attended him to his palace. The queen appeared at a balcony with
                    the dauphin in her arms; and the music played the pathetic air <hi rend="italic"
                    >Où peut</hi><hi rend="italic">on itre</hi><hi rend="italic">mieux qu’au sein de
                    sa famille.</hi> The enthusiasm of loyalty communicated itself to the
                    surrounding multitudes, and nothing was heard but acclamations of joy. On the
                    following day the king declared his resolution to visit in person the city of
                    Paris; and accordingly he set out, attended by some members of the assembly, and
                    by the militia of Versailles. He was met by Lafayette at the head of a body of
                    the national guard, of which he had been chosen commander in chief; and Μ.
                    Bailly, in whose person the ancient office of mayor of Paris had been revived,
                    received the king at the gates, and delivered to him the keys. During all this
                    time no shout was heard from the innumerable crowd of spectators but that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Vive la Nation.</hi> The king advanced to the Hôtel de Ville,
                    where the tricoor cockade was presented to him, which he put on, and with this
                    badge on his breast presented himself at the window. At the sight of the
                    patriotic emblem an universal shout of <hi rend="italic">Vive le Roi</hi> burst
                    forth from every quarter, and Louis returned to Versailles amidst loud
                    demonstrations of apparent loyalty and attachment. But much confusion still
                    prevailed in the capital, notwithstanding there was more appearance of order
                    than might have been expected at such a crisis. This arose from a casual
                    concurrence of circumstances. In order to conduct the elections with facility,
                    Paris had been divided into sixty districts, each of which had a separate place
                    of meeting. The people did not elect the members of the States General, but they
                    chose delegates, who, under the name of electors, voted for the members. At the
                    commencement of the disturbances, the electors, at the request of their
                    fellow-citizens, assumed a temporary authority; but of this they speedily became
                    weary, and as soon as possible procured the public election of a hundred and
                    twenty persons, as municipal officers, for the government of the city. The
                    citizens, having acquired the habit of meeting in their districts, grew fond of
                    doing ∙o; and assembling frequently, they made rules for their own government,
                    and sent commissioners to communicate with other districts. The tumultuous
                    nature of these meetings, and the vehemence of debate which prevailed in them,
                    were incredible; but they gradually ripened into clubs, which ere long assumed
                    the whole power of the state.</p>
                <p>The banishment of Neckar was of short duration. He returned to France in
                    consequence of an invitation by the king, and was received with equal joy by the
                    assembly and the capital. But on this occasion he committed what has been
                    considered as a great political error. In deploring the late excesses and
                    murders, and in noticing the arrest of Μ. Bezerwal, an officer of the Swiss
                    guards, he recommended to the electors at the Hôtel de Ville, in a solemn
                    harangue, that the past should be forgotten, that proscriptions should cease,
                    and that a general amnesty should be proclaimed. In a moment of enthusiasm, this
                    was agreed to, and the electors decreed what unquestionably exceeded their
                    powers. The districts of Paris were instantly in commotion. The electors,
                    alarmed, declared that they only meant that henceforth the people would punish
                    no man except according to law; and to prove that they themselves were free from
                    ambition, they formally renounced all their own powers. The assembly now took up
                    the question, upon which Lally-To-lendal, Meunier, Clermont-Tonnerre, Garat, and
                    others, declared that no person ought to be arrested without a formal
                    accusation; whilst Mirabeau, Robespierre, Barnave, and Gleizen, alleged, on the
                    contrary, that the people were entitled to lay hold of any man who had publicly
                    appeared at the head of their enemies. The debate ended by admitting the
                    explanation of the electors, and by a declaration that it was the duty of the
                    assembly to see justice executed in all cases.</p>
                <p>The commotions and enthusiasm which distracted the capital were speedily
                    communicated to the provinces. In every quarter the people seized upon all the
                    arms which could be found, and the military uniformly refused to act against
                    them. Many acts of outrage were committed in Bretagne, at Strasbourg, in the
                    Lyonnois, and elsewhere, in which the nobility were the sufferers. The mischiefs
                    which occurred were usually magnified at a distance; but that very circumstance
                    constituted an additional evil. It was stated in the National Assembly that Μ.
                    de Mesmay, lord of Quincey, had invited to his house a number of patriots,
                    amongst whom were the officers of a neighbouring garrison, to a splendid
                    entertainment, in celebration of the happy union of the three orders; and that
                    in the midst of the feast the master of the house contrived to withdraw
                    unnoticed, and to set fire to a train previously laid, which communicated with a
                    quantity of gunpowder in the cellars, by the explosion of which the whole
                    company were blown into the air. On inquiry, however, it was found that the
                    story was utterly destitute of truth. But before the fact could be ascertained,
                    all France had resounded with accounts of the bloody tragedy; and the whole
                    nobility of the kingdom suffered in a greater or less degree from the prejudices
                    excited by this unhappy report, the origin of which has never been well
                    explained. It would be vain to state all the idle rumours to which at this time
                    the blind credulity of the multitude gave currency. At one time the aristocrats
                    were cutting down the green com; at another they were burying flour in the
                    common sewers, or casting loaves into the river Seine. One report had no sooner
                    been proved to be false than another was invented, and the whole nation was
                    agitated by suspicion and alarm. The National Assembly were engaged in framing
                    the declaration of the Rights of Man, which was to form the basis of the new
                    constitution, when the alarming accounts, received from all quarters, of the
                    state of anarchy into which the kingdom was falling, obliged them suddenly to
                    turn their attention to questions of practical necessity. The privileged orders
                    finding themselves objects of universal jealousy and hatred, became convinced
                    that something must instantly be done to save their families and property, which
                    were menaced on every side with persecution and pillage: and regarding the
                    popular torrent as irresistible, they resolved to sacrifice a part in order to
                    save something oui of the general wreck.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514669" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4669-0054"/>
                <p>On the afternoon sitting of the 4th of August the Viscount de Noailles, seconded
                    by the Duke d’Aguillon, opened one of the most important scenes in the French
                    Revolution, or in the history of any country. These noblemen stated, that the
                    true cause of all the commotions which had convulsed the kingdom was to be found
                    in the misery of the people, who groaned under the double oppression of public
                    contributions and of feudal services. “For three months,” said Μ. de Noailles,
                    “the people have beheld us engaged in verbal disputes, whilst their own
                    attention and their wishes are directed only to things. What is the consequence?
                    They have armed to reclaim their rights, and they see no prospect of obtaining
                    them except by force.” He therefore proposed to do justice, as the shortest way
                    of restoring tranquillity, and for this purpose to decree that henceforth every
                    tax should be imposed in proportion to the wealth of the contributors, and that
                    no order of the state should be exempted from the payment of public burdens;
                    that feudal claims should be redeemed at a fair valuation, but that such claims
                    as consisted of personal services on the part of the vassal should be abolished
                    without compensation, as contrary to the imprescriptible rights of man. The
                    extensive possessions of the noblemen with whom these proposals originated,
                    added lustre to the disinterested sacrifice which they had made; the speeches
                    delivered on the occasion were received with the most enthusiastic applauses by
                    the assembly and the galleries, and their proposals were decreed by acclamation.
                    In fact, no nation is so powerfully influenced by sudden emotions as the French.
                    On this occasion the patriotic contagion spread with inconceivable rapidity, and
                    a contest of generosity ensued. The hereditary jurisdictions possessed by the
                    nobles within their own territories were unconditionally sacrificed. All places
                    and pensions granted by the court were suppressed, unless given as the reward of
                    merit or of actual services. The game laws, which condemned the husbandman,
                    under severe penalties, to leave his property a prey to infinite multitudes of
                    animals preserved for pastime, having always been numbered amongst the most
                    severe grievances of the French peasantry, were renounced, along with the
                    exclusive rights of rabbit-warrens, fisheries, and dove-cots. The sale of
                    offices was abolished, and the fees exacted from the poor, together with the
                    privilege of holding a plurality of livings, were relinquished by the clergy.
                    The deputies of the Pais d’Etat, or privileged provinces, with the deputies of
                    Dauphine at their head, next came forward, and offered to surrender their
                    ancient privileges, requesting that the kingdom might no longer remain parcelled
                    out amongst Dauphinois, Bretons, Provençaux, and others, but that they should
                    all form one great mass of French citizens. They were followed by the
                    representatives of Paris, Marseilles, Lyons, Bordeaux, Strasbourg, and other
                    places, who requested leave to renounce all their separate privileges as
                    incorporations, for the sake of placing everyman and every village in the nation
                    upon a footing of equality. And thus the assembly proceeded, until every member
                    had exhausted his imagination upon the subject of reform. To close the whole,
                    the Duke of Liancourt proposed that a solemn <hi rend="italic">Te Deum</hi>
                    should be performed, and a medal struck in commemoration of the events of that
                    night of sacrifices; and that the title of Restorer of Gallic Liberty should be
                    bestowed upon the reigning monarch. Several days were necessary to form into
                    laws the decrees of the 4th August, and committees were appointed to make out
                    reports for the purpose. But as one of these included the tithes and revenues of
                    the clergy amongst the abuses which were to be done away with, and proposed in
                    lieu of these to grant to the different ministers of religion a certain stipend
                    payable by the nation, the clergy now attempted to make a stand in defence of
                    their property; and violent debates ensued, in which they were ably supported by
                    the Abbé , Sieyes. As the clergy, however, had formerly deserted i the nobles,
                    so they were now in their turn abandoned to their fate by the hereditary
                    aristocracy; and the popular i party had long regarded the wealth of the church
                    as an; easy resource for supplying the wants of the state. Ne-</p>
                <p> ver, indeed, was there a more complete proof of the in- , fluence of opinion
                    over the affairs of men. The Catholic clergy of France, though possessed of more
                    property than ’ at the time when princes took up arms or laid them down , at
                    their command, now found so few defenders, that they i were terrified into a
                    voluntary surrender of all which they . and their predecessors had enjoyed for
                    ages. In their , overthrow they had not even the barren honour of falling i the
                    last of those privileged orders which had so long! ruled over this ancient
                    kingdom. They, as well as the nobles and the king, still possessed their former
                    titles and nominal dignity; but all of them were now subdued, and completely at
                    the mercy of the commons of France, who could now dismiss them at pleasure.</p>
                <p>As a short season of tranquillity in the country and in the National Assembly
                    succeeded these great popular sacrifices, the king thought it a fit opportunity
                    for the appointment of a new ministry, consisting of the Archbishop of Vienne,
                    the Archbishop of Bordeaux, Μ. Neckar, the Count de St Priest, Count de
                    Montmorin, the Count de la Luzerne, and the Count de la Tour du Pin Paulin. Μ.
                    Neckar, as minister of finance, stated the distressed situation of the revenue,
                    and presented the plan of a loan of thirty millions of livres. But Mirabeau
                    prevailed with the assembly to alter and narrow the conditions to such a degree
                    that very few subscribers were found, and the loan could not be tilled up. This
                    failure involved the assembly in considerable unpopularity, and they allowed Μ.
                    Neckar to prescribe his own terms for the purpose of obtaining a loan of eighty
                    millions. But the moment of public confidence had been allowed to pass away, '
                    and the loan was never more than half filled up. Recourse was next had to
                    patriotic contributions; and great numbers of gold rings, silver buckles, and
                    pieces of plate, were presented to the assembly. The royal family themselves
                    sent their plate to the mint, either to give countenance to these donations, or,
                    as Neckar has since asserted, through absolute necessity, for the purpose of
                    supporting themselves and their family. The confusion into which the nation had
                    been thrown by recent events had produced a suspension in the payment of all
                    taxes. There existed, in fact, no efficient government; and if society escaped
                    dissolution, it was only in consequence of those habits of order which are
                    produced by a state of long-continued civilization. The business of government
                    could not be transacted without money, and many vain efforts were made by the
                    ministry to procure it. At length Μ. Neckar was driven to the desperate resource
                    of proposing a compulsory loan, by which every individual possessed of property
                    was to advance to the state a sum equal to one fourth of his annual income. This
                    bold but unwise proposition was supported by Mirabeau, and adopted by the
                    assembly; but it does not appear to have ever been effectually executed.</p>
                <p>In the mean time the assembly was busily occupied in framing the celebrated
                    declaration of the Rights of Man, which was afterwards prefixed to the new
                    constitution; and this was followed by the discussion of a point of much
                    delicacy and difficulty, namely, what share of legislative authority the king
                    ought to possess under the new constitution, whether an absolute veto or
                    negative, a suspensive veto, or no veto at all. This question operated like a
                    touchstone for trying the sentiments of every person; and the assembly,
                    consisting of twelve hundred men, was now seen to arrange itself into two
                    factions, which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514682" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4682-0055"
                    />soon came into violent conflict. The debates, which were vehem'ent and
                    tumultuous, continued for several days. But as the assembly sat in public, and
                    as multitudes of people of all descriptions were admitted into the galleries,
                    and even into the body of the hall among the members, the public at large became
                    speedily interested in the discussion; the city of Paris took a side in
                    opposition to the veto; and the whole empire was thrown into agitation by new
                    and speculative questions. In fact, rumours of plots were spread throughout the
                    country, and a new storm was obviously gathering, when the question was got rid
                    of by a sort of compromise, which, however, involved an abridgment of the royal
                    authority. Mounier observed, that the executive power could possess no negative
                    against the decrees of the present assembly, which had been nominated by the
                    nation with supreme powers for the express purpose of framing a constitution, to
                    remain binding on all orders of men in the state; and with regard to future
                    legislatures, the king by a message declared that all he desired to possess was
                    a suspensive veto. It is not a little remarkable that Mirabeau concluded a
                    speech in favour of the absolute veto of the crown, by declaring that it would
                    be better to live in Constantinople than in France, if laws could be made
                    without the royal sanction. He is, however, accused of having caused a report to
                    be circulated in Paris that he had opposed the veto with all his influence; and,
                    to give credit to the story, he is said to have quitted the assembly immediately
                    before the division, that his vote might not appear on record against him.</p>
                <p>The month of August was spent in the debates about the veto; but in the beginning
                    of September a new constitutional question was presented to the assembly by one
                    of its numerous committees. This was, whether the legislative body should
                    consist of one or of two chambers. Mounier,Lally-Tollendal, Clermont-Tonnerre,
                    and others, who were zealous lovers of freedom upon moderate principles,
                    supported eagerly the idea of establishing two independent chambers, in
                    imitation of the British constitution; but they were deserted both by the
                    democratic and the aristocratic parties. The former regarded an upper house or
                    senate as a refuge for the old aristocracy, or at least as the cradle of a new
                    one; whilst the nobility and clergy were afraid lest such an arrangement might
                    prevent the future re-establishment of the ancient division into three orders.
                    Accordingly, of a thousand members who voted, only eighty-nine supported the
                    proposal for dividing the legislature into two chambers. Soon after this the
                    king gave his sanction to the important decrees of the 4th of August, though not
                    without hesitation, and expressing doubts of the wisdom of some of them in a
                    letter to the assembly. At the same time were decreed the inviolability of the
                    person of the monarch, the indivisibility of the throne, and its hereditary
                    descent from male to male in the reigning family.</p>
                <p>In consequence of the debates on the subject of the veto and that of the two
                    chamb« rs, the minds of parties had become much excited. Paris wore the same
                    threatening aspect as it had done in the months of June and of July preceding;
                    and everything seemed tending towards a crisis. The aristocratic party accused
                    their antagonists of a design to excite new insurrections; and the charge was
                    retorted by circulating a report that a plot for conveying the king to Metz was
                    already ripe for execution. From the period of the defection of the French
                    guards, who were now in the pay of the capital, the protection of the royal
                    family had been intrusted to the militia or national guard of Versailles,
                    together with the regiment of the <hi rend="italic">gardes du corps,,</hi> which
                    was composed entirely of gentlemen. But when the report of the intended flight
                    of the king was circulated, the French guards desired to be re stored to their
                    ancient employment of attending his person, in order to prevent any attempt of
                    the kind. This idea was eagerly caught hold of in the capital; and,
                    notwithstanding every effbrtwhich Μ. de Lafayette could use, the approach of
                    disturbances became every day more obvious. The popular party perceived the
                    advantage which they would derive from placing the assembly and the king in the
                    midst of that turbulent metropolis, which had given birth to the Revolution, and
                    upon the attachment of which they could most securely depend; and every
                    encouragement was therefore given by the most active leaders of what was now
                    called the democratic party to the project of establishing the court at Paris.
                    The ministry were under no small degree of apprehension; and the Count
                    d’Estaing, who commanded the national guard of Versailles, requested the aid of
                    an additional regiment. The regiment of Flanders was accordingly sent for, and
                    its arrival caused no small degree of anxiety; but every artiñce was instantly
                    employed in order to gain over both officers and soldiers to the popular
                    cause.</p>
                <p>On the first of October the <hi rend="italic">gardes du corps,</hi> probably for
                    the purpose of ingratiating themselves with the newly-arrived corps, and perhaps
                    to attach them more steadily to the royal cause, invited the officers of the
                    regiment of Flanders to a public entertainment; and several officers of the
                    national guard, and others of the military, were also invited. The entertainment
                    was given in the opera-house adjoining to the palace,and several loyal toasts
                    were drunk; but it is asserted, that when the favourite popular toast, The
                    Nation, was given, the <hi rend="italic">gardes du corps</hi> refused to drink
                    it. In ordinary cases, so trifling a circumstance as this would be regarded as
                    unworthy of notice; but such was now the position of affairs, that the most
                    trivial occurrences became instrumental in producing important consequences. The
                    queen, having seen from a window of the palace the gaiety which prevailed
                    amongst the military, prevailed on the king, who had just returned from hunting,
                    to visit them, in company with herself and the dauphin. The sudden appearance of
                    their majesties in the saloon kindled in an instant the ancient enthusiasm of
                    French loyalty. The grenadiers of the regiment of Flanders, along with the Swiss
                    chasseurs, had been admitted to the dessert; and they, as well as their
                    officers, drank the health of the king, queen, and dauphin, with their swords
                    drawn. The royal family then bowed to the company and retired. As they withdrew,
                    the music played the favourite air, <hi rend="italic">0 Ricard, O mon rot,
                    l’uni-oers</hi><hi rend="italic">t'abandonne;</hi> and, in the enthusiasm of the
                    moment, the national cockade was thrown aside, and white cockades mounted as
                    fast as they could be made by the ladies of the court. When these circumstances
                    were next, day reported in Paris, with the usual amount of exaggeration, they
                    gave rise to the most violent alarm. The capital was at that time suffering all
                    the horrors of famine; and in such a situation, the news of a feast enjoyed by
                    others seldom gives much pleasure to hungry men. A rumour of an intended flight
                    on the part of the royal family was also got up: it was also asserted that a
                    counter revolution was speedily to be attempted by force of arms; and the people
                    were told that the present scarcity had been artificially created by the court
                    for the purpose of reducing them to submission.</p>
                <p>For several days no notice was taken in the assembly of what had passed at the
                    entertainment given by the <hi rend="italic">gardes du corps</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but on the 5th of October Petion mentioned it for the first
                    time, and a violent debate ensued, during which Mirabeau rose and exclaimed,
                    “Declare that the king’s person alone is sacred, and I myself will bring forward
                    an impeachment ∙," thereby alluding to the conduct of the queen. During this
                    debate at Versailles, Paris was in the most violent coinmotion. A vast multitude
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514695" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4695-0056"/>of women of
                    the lowest rank, with some men in women’s clothes, having assembled at the Hôtel
                    de Ville, they resolved to proceed instantly to Versailles, to demand bread from
                    the king and from the National Assembly. Lafayette in vain opposed them; for his
                    soldiers refused to turn their bayonets against the women. Upon this Stanislaus
                    Maillard, who had distinguished himself at the taking of the Bastille, having
                    offered himself as leader of the insurgents, had the address to prevail on them
                    to lay aside the arms which they had procured; and about noon he set out for
                    Versailles, having established as much order amongst his followers as could well
                    be expected in such a motley assemblage. The mayor and municipality of Paris
                    also gave orders to Lafayette instantly to set out for that place at the head of
                    the national guard.</p>
                <p>In the mean time Maillard approached Versailles with his tumultuous band, which
                    he had arranged in three divisions, and persuaded to behave with tolerable
                    decency. The king was hunting in the woods of Mendon when he was informed of the
                    arrival of a formidable band of women calling aloud for bread. “Alas,” replied
                    he, “if I had it, I should not wait to be asked.” Maillard entered the assembly,
                    accompanied by a deputation of his followers, to state the object of their
                    journey; and, in order to pacify them, that body sent a deputation of their own
                    number along with them to lay their complaints before the king. His majesty
                    received them with great politeness, and readily agreed to go into any measures
                    which could be suggested for the supply of the capital. The report of this
                    gracious conduct produced a great effect upon the multitude collected around the
                    palace, and they began to disperse; but they were speedily succeeded by another
                    crowd not less numerous. A sudden resolution to fly seems now to have been
                    proposed by the court, as the king’s carriages were brought to the gate of the
                    palace which communicates with the orangery; but the national guard of
                    Versailles refused to allow them to pass, and the king himself declined to
                    remove, or to permit any blood to be shed in his cause.</p>
                <p>At length Lafayette, with his army, arrived, about ten o'clock at night, and
                    found the assembly in a very unpleasant predicament, their hall and galleries
                    being crowded by the Parisian fishwomen and others of the mob, who at every
                    instant interrupted the debates. Lafayette waited upon the king, and informed
                    him of the proceedings of the day; planted guards in every direction; and, alter
                    a scanty banquet had been procured for the multitude, prevailed with the
                    assembly to close their sitting for the night. For this last part of his conduct
                    Lafayette has been much censured, and not without reason; for it could scarce- .
                    ly be expected that such an immense assemblage of turbulent characters as were
                    now brought together would pass the night without disorder. All remained
                    tranquil, however, until about six in the morning of the 6th, when a great
                    number of women and desperate persons rushed towards the palace, and attempted
                    to force their way into it. Two of the <hi rend="italic">gardes du corps</hi>
                    were killed, and the crowd ascended the staircase leading to the queen’s
                    apartment, but were bravely resisted by a sentinel named Miemandre, who gave the
                    alarm, and defended his post until he fell covered with wounds, from which,
                    however, he afterwards recovered. The ruflians, reeking with blood, rushed into
                    the chamber of the queen, and pierced with bayonets and poniards the bed whence
                    she had scarcely had time to fly almost wholly undressed, and, through passages
                    unknown to the murderers, escaped to seek refuge at the feet of the king, who,
                    already alarmed, had gone to seek her. The tumult became every moment more
                    violent, and sudden death seemed to threaten the royal family; but Lafayette was
                    by this time at the head of his troops, whom he earnestly beseeched to save the
                    <hi rend="italic">gardes du corps</hi> from massacre; and in this he was happily
                    successful. Some who had been taken prisoners were surrounded by the grenadiers
                    of the French guards, who protected them, and the retreat of the whole corps was
                    secured. The crowd was speedily driven from the different parts of the palace,
                    which they had already begun to pillage; and the royal family at length ventured
                    to show themselves at a balcony. A few voices now exclaimed <hi rend="italic">Le
                    roi</hi> à <hi rend="italic">Paris,</hi> the king to Paris; the shout became
                    general, and the king, after consulting with Lafayette, declared that he had no
                    objection to take up his residence at Paris, provided he was accompanied by the
                    queen and his children. When this proposal was reported to the assembly, the
                    popular leaders expressed much satisfaction; they ordered a deputation of a
                    hundred members to attend the king thither, and voted the National Assembly
                    inseparable from the king. At two o’clock his majesty set out a prisoner in the
                    custody of a turbulent mob; and thus humbled, the royal captives were conducted
                    so slowly that a short journey of twelve miles was protracted during six hours.
                    The king, the queen, and their children, were lodged in the old palace of the
                    Louvre, whilst Monsieur went to reside at the Luxembourg; the city was
                    illuminated, and the evening spent in triumph by the Parisians. The removal of
                    the king to Paris was justly regarded as a triumph by the popular party. The
                    higher order of nobility considered it as completely ruinous to their hopes; and
                    many men of talents, such as Mounier, Lally-Tollendal, and others, now regarded
                    every prospect of attaining constitutional freedom as at an end, seeing the
                    national representatives would now be exposed to the insults, and overawed by
                    the influence, of a turbulent capital. Several members of the assembly
                    accordingly took refuge in foreign countries, and used every effort to excite
                    other nations against France. As the Duke of Orleans had been regarded as the
                    chief promoter of the late disturbances, Lafayette waited on him, and insisted
                    on his leaving the kingdom for a time. The duke, not less timid than intriguing,
                    felt overawed, and, on pretence of public business, proceeded to England, where
                    he remained during several months.</p>
                <p>On the 19th of October the National Assembly held its: first session in Paris.
                    The king was closely guarded in ι his own palace; and no apparent obstacle now
                    remained <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> to prevent the popular party giving to
                    their country such a constitution as they might judge expedient. Much, however,
                    was still to be done, and many difficulties, arising from the habits of men
                    educated under a different order of things, yet remained to be overcome. Two
                    days after the assembly had gone to Paris, a baker was publicly murdered by the
                    mob, upon a charge of having concealed a quantity of bread. Whilst the assembly
                    was at a distance, events of this nature had been little attended to, as the
                    leading party did not attempt to check those ebullitions of popular fury, from
                    which they had derived so much advantage; but that party had now become
                    all-powerful, and so flagrant an offence committed against the law was regarded
                    as an insult to the sovereignty of the National Assembly. Two leaders of the mob
                    were therefore tried and publicly executed; and a severe law was passed, of the
                    nature of our riot act, authorizing the magistrates to act by military force
                    against any assemblage of persons who should refuse to disperse when legally
                    required to do so. The peace of the capital was thus secured for several months;
                    but in the country no small degree of anxiety and excitement still existed. The
                    same suspicious temper which had prevailed at Paris agitated the provinces with
                    the apprehension of plots and monopolies of grain. Besides, the nobility in the
                    country were by no means satisfied with the liberality which their
                    representatives had evinced upon the 4th of August, in voting away their
                    privileges and their property; a circumstance which produced violent jealousies
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514708" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4708-0057"/>between the
                    peasantry and their landlords, and gradually conveyed to every corner of the
                    kingdom the political ferment which had commenced at Paris.</p>
                <p>The National Assembly being now in tolerable security, proceeded with the arduous
                    task of framing a free constitution for the kingdom of France. The Abbé Sieyes
                    presented a plan for dividing the kingdom into eighty-three departments, of
                    about three hundred and twenty-four square leagues each, the department into
                    several <hi rend="italic">arrondissement</hi> or districts, and the district
                    into <hi rend="italic">communes</hi> or cantons, of about four square leagues in
                    extent. Thus all the ancient divisions of the kingdom into governments,
                    generalities, and bailiwicks, was in an instant overturned. An attempt was also
                    made to simplify in an equal degree the relative situation of individuals in
                    civil life, by a decree which put an end to all distinction of orders and
                    immunities, as far as privileges were concerned. A bold and important measure
                    was at the same time adopted, namely, the confiscation of the whole lands
                    belonging to the church, for the purpose of supplying the exigencies of the
                    state. In this transaction all regard to justice was of course thrown aside. The
                    lands of the church were as certainly the property of those who then possessed
                    them, as any entailed estate amongst us is the property of the holder. In the
                    former the clergy had as clear a life interest as the heir of entail could by
                    possibility possess in the latter. The state may have had a right to appropriate
                    to itself the church lands upon the death of the incumbents; but it might with
                    as much justice have seized on the enormous revenues of the Duke of Orleans, as
                    confiscated a single acre belonging to the most useless abbot in the kingdom.
                    This iniquitous measure was proposed by the Bishop of Autun, Μ. de Talleyrand
                    Perigord, who had been promoted to the episcopal bench in an irregular manner,
                    in order to accomplish this premeditated robbery. On the property thus
                    confiscated it was resolved to issue assignats, which were to be received by the
                    state in payment of taxes, and of church lands when set up to sale. A provision
                    was at the same time made for the national clergy, who were in future to be paid
                    by the state. On the day following that upon which this important measure was
                    adopted, a decree was also passed, suspending the functions of the différent
                    parliaments of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>But proceedings in which the interests of so great a multitude of individuals
                    were involved, could not be carried into effect without opposition. The
                    parliaments in particular exerted themselves, by protests and other
                    publications, to invalidate the decrees of the assembly; but these privileged
                    bodies, who had long been accustomed to contend against the despotic
                    administration of their country, and who on that account had for ages been
                    objects of public favour, now found themselves unable to resist the mandate of a
                    popular assembly; and, after a few fruitless struggles, they were all of them
                    under the necessity of submitting to their fate. The assembly then proceeded to
                    organize the kingdom by the establishment of municipalities, and by reforming
                    the jurisprudence of the country. When the parliament of Paris had been
                    abolished, however, the second court in that city, called the Châtelet, was
                    retained for the purpose of trying such persons as bad become obnoxious by their
                    attachment to the royal cause; and this tribunal had the spirit to acquit the
                    Baron de Bezerwal, Marshal Broglio, and the Prince de Lambesc. But having
                    incurred much popular odium by this acquittal, they sought to regain credit by
                    condemning to death the Marquis de Favres, for a pretended conspiracy to
                    massacre Lafayette, Bailly, and Neckar, and to convey the king to Peronne.</p>
                <p>During the whole of this winter the king had been so <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> strictly watched by numerous guards placed round his palace, that in
                    other nations he was naturally considered as in a state of captivity. To do away
                    with this impression, if possible, and to make the king appear a voluntary agent
                    in the measures which had lately been adopted, every effort was employed to
                    prevail on him to repair to the assembly, and there, as of his own voluntary
                    motion, to declare his adherence to the measures in question. For some time,
                    however, he resisted the proposal to take such a step; but at length, on the 4th
                    of February, he suddenly appeared in the National Assembly, where he complained
                    of the attempts which had been made to shake the new constitution, and declared
                    his wish that it should be universally known that the monarch and the
                    representatives of the nation were united, and their wishes the same; that he
                    would defend the constitutional liberty of the state; and that, in conjunction
                    with the queen, he would early form the sentiments of his son in strict
                    accordance with the new order of things which the circumstances of the empire
                    had introduced. This declaration dispirited the aristocratical party, and
                    increased the unhappy tendency to look for aid from foreign countries, which
                    they had always been too prone to indulge. On the 13th of February, monastic
                    establishments were suppressed, and their lands confiscated; but the inmates of
                    these establishments were allowed pensions for their subsistence, and permitted
                    to continue the observance of their monastic vows if they thought fit to do
                    so.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is probable that,
                    in consequence of the suppression of the monasteries, the Breton Committee began
                    about this time to assume the appellation of the Jacobin Club, from the hall
                    belonging to the Jacobin friars at Faria, in which their meetings were now
                    held.</p></note></p>
                <p>An event occurred at this time (March 15th), which tended in no small degree to
                    increase the odium under which the old government already laboured. This was the
                    publication of the Red Book, or list of pensions and donations granted by the
                    crown. After many entreaties on the one hand, and the most solemn promises of
                    secrecy on the other, it had been communicated by Μ. Neckar to a committee of
                    the assembly; but it afforded too striking an advantage to the popular party not
                    to be made use of, and in a few days the minister, to his no small surprise,
                    found this register publicly sold by every bookseller in Paris. He ought not,
                    indeed, to have been surprised; and, in fact, the giving up of this list forms
                    one of the many proofs which the transactions of this period afford of his utter
                    unfitness for the office which he held. With much indignation, however, he
                    demanded why the committee had published it without the permission of the
                    assembly or the king; but he was told, that as to the assembly, they were sure
                    of its approbation, and as to the king, they were not his representatives. To
                    give an idea of the effect of this publication, it is only necessary to remark,
                    that, under the short administration of Calonne, the two brothers of the king
                    had received from the public treasury, independently of their legitimate income,
                    nearly two millions sterling, and that six hundred thousand pounds had been
                    granted to one individual, merely because he was the husband of Madame de
                    Polignac. Neckar’s opposition to the publication of this register tended in no
                    small degree to injure his popularity, and the rest of the ministry began to
                    lose the confidence of the public. Indeed, fertile causes of alarm prevailed on
                    all sides. The clergy were attempting to revive in the provinces the ancient
                    animosities between the Catholics and the Protestants, to whom the late decrees
                    of the assembly were ascribed. The German princes who possessed property in the
                    north of France complained loudly of the violation<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193514721" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4721-0058"/> of their rights by the
                    abolition of the feudal system, although the National Assembly had voted thèm a
                    compensation; and the most melancholy intelligence was received from the
                    colonies in the West Indies. The assembly had not recognized the right of the
                    free negroes to enjoy the same privileges with other citizens, but still they
                    hesitated to go the length of denying these privileges. This uncertain conduct
                    produced infinite mischief. "Die whites contended with those commonly called
                    people of colour, who again occasionally stood in opposition to the free negroes
                    or to the slaves; and hence it sometimes happened that at the same time, and in
                    the same colony, not less than three hostile assemblies were held, and made war
                    upon one another with the most inveterate fury; and each party found protectors
                    in the National Assembly, because those who favoured or opposed the existence of
                    distinctions at home, in general followed out the same principle in reference to
                    the colonies.</p>
                <p>Upon the 14th of May Μ. de Montmorency having made known to the National Assembly
                    the preparations for war in which England and Spain were engaged, this
                    communication gave rise to the constitutional question, Who ought to possess the
                    power of declaring war and making peace? Clermont-Tonnerre, Sarent, Virieu, and
                    Dupont, supported the royal prerogative; whilst, on the other side, the
                    exclusive right of the legislative body to exercise this important prerogative
                    was supported by D'Aiguillon, Garat, Fréteau, Jellot, Charles Lameth, Sií-léry,
                    Petion, Robespierre, and others. Petion proposed that the French nation should
                    for ever renounce all idea of conquest, and confine itself entirely to defensive
                    war; and this was decreed with universal acclamation. But Mirabeau at length
                    successfully proposed that the right of declaring war or making peace should be
                    vested in the king and the legislative body conjunctly; and the decree which was
                    passed on the subject formed a strange farrago of contradictions and
                    absurdities. It enjoined the king to guard the state from all external attacks;
                    but it did not say how this could be done, without repelling any attack which
                    might be made upon it. In fact, the king could do nothing without previously
                    informing the National Assembly; and if that body chanced not to be sitting at
                    the time, he was bound to let the enemy advance without opposition, until he had
                    convened the deputies, dispersed over twenty thousand square leagues, and
                    listened to their metaphysical quibbles in Paris.</p>
                <p>On the 16th of June a very singular farce was enacted in the assembly. A Prussian
                    refugee, called Anacharsis Clootz, on an evening sitting, which was generally
                    ill attended by persons of high rank, introduced to the assembly a number of
                    persons dressed in the habits of all the different countries that could be
                    thought of; and in a formal harangue told them that he was come, as the orator
                    of the human race, at the head of the representatives of all nations, to
                    congratulate them upon the formation of their new constitution. He was answered
                    by the president with much solemnity, upon which he retired with his motley
                    group. This fantastical piece of folly, which in any other country would
                    scarcely have excited a smile, was treated by the assembly in a serious light.
                    Alexander Lameth proposed, that the figures of different nations exhibited in
                    chains at the feet of Louis XIV. should be destroyed, as an insult to mankind.
                    Μ. Lambel, a lawyer, then proposed the abolition of all hereditary titles; and
                    in this he was supported by Lafayette, St Fargeau, and the Viscount de Noailles.
                    The decree passed, along with another for suppressing all armorial bearings. No
                    part of the proceedings of the French National Assembly was received with so
                    much indignation as this. The feudal system had been abolished, and the property
                    of the church wrested from it, with comparatively little notice; but when those
                    nominal distinctions which antiquity had sanctioned and personal vanity rendered
                    dear were attacked, the surrounding nations instantly took the alarm, and beheld
                    with terror the levelling precedent which had thus been established. Nor is it a
                    little remarkable, that of all the king’s ministers, Neckar alone, a plebeian, a
                    republican born, and bred in a democracy, advised his majesty to refuse his
                    assent to the decree, as a violent but useless encroachment upon the prejudices
                    of a powerful order in the state.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the capital was entirely engrossed with preparations for a
                    grand festivals Μ. Bailly having proposed to commemorate the anniversary of the
                    taking of the Bastille, his plan was adopted, because it flattered the vanity of
                    the people, by presenting them with a splendid spectacle, in commemoration of
                    their own exertions. As the army had been much disorganized, it was also
                    resolved to attempt to unite all its branches, as well as the whole departments
                    of the state, in one common attachment to the new order of things, by collecting
                    into one place deputations for the purpose of swearing fidelity to the new
                    constitution. In the middle of the Champ de Mars an altar was erected, at which
                    the civic oath was to be taken; and around the altar an amphitheatre was erected
                    capable of containing four hundred thousand spectators. All ranks of persons,
                    the nobility, clergy, and even ladies, with that eagerness for novelty which is
                    so peculiar to the French people, united their efforts; and crowds of
                    foreigners, as well as natives, hurried to the capital to be present at this
                    solemnity, which was denominated the Confederation. The long-expected 14th of
                    July at length arrived. At six o'clock in the morning the procession was
                    arranged on the boulevards, and consisted of the electors of the city of Paris,
                    the representatives of the commons, the administrators of the municipality, a
                    battalion of children with a standard on which was inscribed The Hopes of the
                    Nation; deputies from the troops of France wherever quartered, and of every
                    order, along with deputies from all the departments; to which were added immense
                    detachments of the military and of the national guards, with an almost infinite
                    multitude of drums, trumpets, and musical instruments. The procession was
                    extremely splendid, as every district had its peculiar decorations. The National
                    Assembly passed through a triumphal arch; and the king and queen, attended by
                    the foreign ministers, were placed in a superb box. After a solemn invocation to
                    God, the king approached the altar, and, amidst the deepest silence, took the
                    prescribed oath to employ the power delegated to him according to the
                    constitutional law of the state, to maintain the constitution, and to enforce
                    the execution of the law. The president of the National Assembly then went up to
                    the altar, and took the civic oath, swearing to be faithful to the nation, the
                    law, and the king, and to maintain the constitution as decreed by the National
                    Assembly, and accepted by the king; and every member of the assembly standing
                    up, said, “That I swear.” Lafayette then advanced and took the oath, which the
                    other deputies of the national guards pronounced after him; and the words were
                    solemnly pronounced by every individual of this immense assembly. <hi
                    rend="italic">Te</hi><hi rend="italic">Deum</hi> was then sung, and the
                    solemnity concluded. The performance was altogether sublime. Never before
                    perhaps was there such an orchestra, or such an audience; their numbers baffled
                    the eye to reckon, and their shouts fell on the ear like the noise of many
                    waters. It is impossible to enumerate all the means which were employed to add
                    splendour to this day; it ended with a general illumination, and no accident
                    disturbed the public tranquillity.</p>
                <p>The assembly now proceeded with the formation of the constitution; but the public
                    tranquillity was disturbed by an unhappy event at Nancy. Most of the officers of
                    the army were unfriendly to the late revolution; and every means had been
                    employed by them to excite disgust in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514734"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4734-0059"/>the minds of the soldiers. At Nancy, in
                    particular, necessaries had been denied them, and their pay was kept back, upon
                    the pretence that such was the will of the National Assembly. Driven to despair,
                    the regiments in garrison broke out in open mutiny; demanded loudly the
                    regimental accounts; and having seized the military chest, sent a deputation to
                    state their case to the National Assembly. But the officers had anticipated
                    their men, and prepossessed the minister of war against them, and upon his
                    representation a decree was passed, authorizing the commander-in-chief of the
                    province, Μ. Bouille, to reduce the mutineers by force. This was no sooner known
                    than the national guard of Nancy assembled, and sent a deputation to give a fair
                    statement of facts. But Bouille, without waiting the result of an explanation,
                    hastened to Nancy at the head of all the troops he could collect; and having
                    fallen upon the regiments of Chateauvieux and Mestre de Camp, put a number to
                    the sword, and took four hundred prisoners. The news of these events filled
                    Paris with indignation, and the assembly afterwards reversed its own decrees
                    against the mutineers at Nancy; but Bouille could not be punished, because he
                    had only acted in obedience to authority.</p>
                <p>As Neckar was unwilling to go all lengths with the ruling party, his popularity
                    had for some time been gradually declining. He therefore tendered his
                    resignation on the 4th of September, and immediately thereafter left the
                    kingdom. He was regretted by no party. Regarded, on the one hand, as having
                    ruined the kingdom, by the concessions which he had advised the king to make in
                    favour of the tiers <hi rend="italic">état,</hi> he was despised, on the other,
                    as a politician of lukewarm principles, narrow views, and limited understanding.
                    He retired, however, with an unblemished reputation for integrity. This minister
                    does not seem to have been capable of penetrating deeply into the characters of
                    men, or forming any adequate conception of the effects of that energy which is
                    called forth in a nation that attempts to make important changes in its ancient
                    manners and government; and having formed no just estimate of the important era
                    about to open on the country of which he was the minister, he was far from being
                    qualified to direct or control its affairs amidst the violent convulsions
                    through which it was destined to pass. Unable to brook the loss of his
                    popularity, he retired to Switzerland, and there published a work, which,
                    whatever it fails to establish, clearly shows the honest intentions of the
                    French king, and the boundless ambition of the popular leaders, whom he himself
                    had armed with power.</p>
                <p>The assembly commenced the year 1791 with a decree announcing the termination of
                    its session, which was to take place as soon as it should have finished the
                    discussion of a list of constitutional articles. In the mean time, hostile
                    appearances began to be exhibited on the side of Germany, Spain, Italy, and
                    Savoy, and bodies of troops advanced towards the French frontiers. The Emperor
                    Leopold was, however, too cautious to announce his intentions; and the king soon
                    communicated a letter which he had received from that potentate, containing
                    protestations of amicable dispositions, but adding, that the innovations
                    occasioned by the decrees of the 4th of August ought to be done away. The king
                    treated this merely as an official measure on the part of the emperor, in order
                    that he might not appear to compensate the claims of certain German princes on
                    Alsace and Lorraine. But the assembly expressed some alarm, and voted an
                    augmentation of the national force. On the 20th of February public attention was
                    roused by a circumstance, which in any other state of affairs would have been
                    accounted unimportant. The king announced to the assembly, that his aunts, the
                    daughters of Louis XV <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi> had that morning left Paris;
                    but as he did not apprehend that the existing laws laid them under any restraint
                    in this respect, he had not opposed their departure. After some debate, the
                    assembly agreed that the king had judged well; and these princesses were left to
                    pursue their journey to Rome. The kingdom bad thus been gradually deserted by
                    every branch of the royal family, excepting the king and his eldest brother; the
                    panic which had seized the nobility, and induced them to desert the country and
                    the throne at the moment when they ought to have stuck firm to both,
                    communicated itself to those most nearly connected with the latter, who also
                    abandoned their posts. The assembly, however, continued its labours with
                    unremitting perseverance and amidst tolerable tranquillity.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of the month of March, the National Assembly was deprived by
                    death of its most gifted member, and, in one sense, greatest ornament, Mirabeau.
                    The death of this extraordinary man had in it something sublime. Though sensible
                    of his approaching dissolution, he was so far from being intimidated by the
                    prospect, that he gloried in the name which he was to bequeath to posterity.
                    Towards the close of his illness his sufferings were acute; and at one moment,
                    when deprived of the power of speech, he wrote on a slip of paper the words of
                    Hamlet, “To die, to sleep; no more.” But a few hours before his death the
                    commencement of mortification relieved his sufferings, without overclouding the
                    brightness of his faculties. “Remove from the bed,” said he, “all that sad
                    apparatus. Instead of these useless precautions, surround me with the perfumes
                    and flowers of spring; dress my hair with care; let me fall asleep amidst the
                    sounds of harmonious music.” Aware that recovery was hopeless, he earnestly
                    implored his attendants to give him laudanum, to put a period to his sufferings.
                    “When a sick man is given over,” said he, “and he suffers frightful pains, can a
                    friendly physician refuse to give him opium ?” His extremities were already
                    cold, and death was fast doing its work; but his countenance still retained its
                    animation, his eye its wonted fire, his mind its energies unimpaired. Feigning
                    to comply with his request, his attendants gave him a cup containing what they
                    assured him was opium. He drank it off calmly, fell back on his pillow, and
                    almost instantly expired. Endowed with a constitution naturally robust, his
                    physical powers sunk under the combined waste of boundless ambition, continual
                    excitement, and excessive indulgence. At his death he received from his
                    countrymen marks of respect unparalleled in modern history. During his short
                    illness his door was besieged by anxious citizens. A mourning of eight days was
                    decreed by the assembly, and also a grand procession, which was attended by all
                    the public functionaries. He was likewise the first interred in the new
                    Pantheon, consecrated to receive the remains of illustrious men; but his ashes
                    were afterwards removed, in consequence of pretty conclusive proofs that he had
                    not been incorruptible.</p>
                <p>Such was the end of the first commanding spirit which arose amidst the troubles
                    of the Revolution. Mirabeau was upwards of forty years of age when he entered
                    public life; but even at the opening of the States General his reputation was
                    already great; and notwithstanding the disfavour produced by his vices, he was
                    regarded as the tribune who alone could support the cause of the people against
                    the designs of the court. Nor were these expectations disappointed,
                    notwithstanding all the defects inherent in his character. He was endowed with
                    splendid talents, but impelled by insatiable ambition; gifted with a penetrating
                    intellect, but the prey of inordinate passions sagacious in the perception of
                    truth, but indifferent as to the means by which distinction was to be acquired;
                    without great information derived from study, but unrivalled in the power of
                    converting that which he possessed to the best possible account; of matchless
                    tact and promptitude; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514747"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4747-0060"/>dauntless intrepidity, and unconquerable energy,
                    but of sue* pected integrity, and destitute of either moral or religious
                    principles. His temperament was too ardent and impetuous tn permit him to master
                    any subject; he studied nothing profoundly, and owed almost all the writings to
                    which his name was attached, and many of the most effective speeches he
                    delivered, to Dumont, Duroverai, and Clavière, who each assisted him in his
                    labours. Ĳis strength lay in a vivid imagination, a nervous elocution, and an
                    unrivalled power of seizing hold on the spirit of the assembly which he
                    addressed, and applying the whole force of his mind to the point whence the
                    resistance proceeded. It was in moments of the greatest difficulty that his
                    faculties shone forth in the greatest splendour; it was when apparently on the
                    verge of annihilation that he shot forth those thun. derbolts by which his
                    ascendency was confirmed. But great as was his influence in the National
                    Assembly, it fell far short of what it might have been but for the consequences
                    of his irregular life; and the general impression of his total want of
                    principle, combined with his habitual profusion and extravagance, made the
                    league which he formed with the court towards the close of his career be
                    ascribed to venal and corrupt motives. But in undertaking to heal the wounds of
                    the Revolution, which he believed himself to hold as it were in the hollow of
                    his hand, he miscalculated his own power, great as it undoubtedly was. The work
                    of destruction had proceeded too far to be suddenly stopped; a spirit had been
                    unchained which no magic of genius or talents could allay, until it bad spent
                    its force in levelling with the dust all old and time-honoured distinctions. In
                    the character of a mediator, which he proposed to assume, he would have most
                    probably sunk into insignificance; and, with the loss of his influence as a
                    popular tribune, his power to re-establish the monarchy, even upon the basis of
                    constitutional freedom, would also have vanished. Besides, the instruments with
                    which he proposed to work were not adapted to his handling; and, after a short
                    trial, he would have found himself obliged to throw them aside.<note

                    his death-bed Mirabeau foresaw, in the clearest manner, the consequences which
                    were certain to flow from the direction given to the Revolution, and the
                    boundless scope thus afforded to popular ambition. “when I am no more,” said he,
                    “my worth will become known. The misfortunes which 1 nave arrested will then
                    pour in on all sides on France; the criminal faction which now trembles before
                    me will be unbridled. I have before my eyes unbounded presentiments of disaster,
                    we now see liow much we erred in not preventing the commons from assuming the
                    name of the National Assembly. Since they gained that victory they have never
                    ceased to show themseives unworthy of it. They have chosen to govern the king,
                    instead of governing by him; but soon neither he nor they will rule the country,
                    but a vile faction which will overspread it with horrors.” (Dumont, 267, 268.)
                    The sagacity and foresight displayed in these remarkable words make us cease to
                    wonder that the death of Mirabeau, at this crisis, should nave been regarded as
                    a public calamity.</p></note></p>
                <p>During the whole of this spring great fear was entertained that attempts were to
                    be made to bring about a counter revolution. The emigrant army under the prince
                    of Condé had assembled on the borders of Alsace. The king also was surrounded by
                    crowds of nonjuring priests, and other disaffected persons. The popular
                    jealousy, which in every period of the Revolution strikingly marked the French
                    character, was thus kept on the alarm, and soon vented itself in an aggression
                    on the royal family. On the 18th of April, when the latter were preparing to
                    remove to St Cloud, there to pass some days, a report was instantly spread that
                    the king was about to <hi rend="italic">fly from</hi> the country. The carriages
                    were immediately surrounded by people. Lafayette called out the national guard,
                    but they refused to act. “We know,” said they, “that we are violating the laws,
                    but the safety of our country is the first law.” The king instantly went to the
                    assembly, and with much spirit complained of the insult. He was answered
                    respectfully by the président, and permitted to continue his journey. As the
                    royal family had enjoyed for some time a considerable degree of freedom, the
                    present opportunity was embraced to intimate to foreign courts his acceptance of
                    the constitution; and all obnoxious persons were dismissed from about his
                    person. But the breach of discipline on the part of the national guard was so
                    much resented by Lafayette, that he resigned his command, and Paris was thrown
                    into consternation; nor was it until after universal solicitation that he could
                    be prevailed upon to resume his functions.</p>
                <p>About this time Μ. de Bouille, to whom the protection of the frontiers had been
                    intrusted, was reported to be employing every means in his power in order to
                    render the country defenceless. The garrisons were left unprovided; disunion
                    spread amongst the national tr&lt;x&gt;ps, who were removed from the frontiers,
                    and their place occupied by foreigners; the emigrants abroad, and their friends
                    at home, were lying in wait for an opportunity to revolt: such were the rumours
                    in circulation, when suddenly, on the 21βt of June, it was announced from the
                    Tuilleries, that the king, the queen, the dauphin, with monsieur and madame, had
                    quitted the palace and the capital, without leaving any information of their
                    intention or their route. The feeling excited by this intelligence among the
                    multitude was a mixture of rage and consternation. The National Assembly,
                    however, acted with much coolness and promptitude. They instantly took upon
                    themselves the government, and decreed their sittings permanent; and they at the
                    same time sent messengers in all directions, to attempt to lay hold of the
                    fugitives. The latter, however, had taken different routes; and monsieur and
                    madame arrived safely at Brussels on the ⅛3d. The king, queen, and their
                    children, when they reached a considerable distance from the capital, were
                    furnished by Μ. de Bouille with a guard of dragoons, under pretence of
                    protecting treasure for the pay of the troops. But, at the distance of 156 miles
                    from the capital, and when only a few leagues from the frontier, they were
                    arrested at St Menehould by the postmaster, Μ. Drouet, formerly a dragoon in the
                    regiment of Condé. At half past seven o'clock in the evening, the carriages
                    having stopped at his house to change horses, Drouet thought that he recognized
                    the queen, and imagined that the king’s face resembled the impressions stamped
                    upon the assignats. The escort of dragoons increased the suspicion. He suffered
                    them to depart at eleven o’clock without notice; but taking a companion, be
                    proceeded by a shorter road to Varennes, and with the assistance of the
                    postmaster of that place, he gave the alarm; overturned a carriage on the
                    bridge, which detained the royal travellers till the national guard of the place
                    had assembled; and succeeded, without bloodshed, in effecting the arrest of the
                    whole party, who were brought back to Paris by a deputation from the assembly.
                    At his departure, the king had imprudently left behind him a memorial, in which
                    he declared that he never had thought any sacrifice too great for the
                    restoration of order; but that the destruction of the kingdom and the triumph of
                    anarchy being the only reward of all his efforts, he had thought it necessary to
                    leave it. He then took a review of the faults of the new constitution, with the
                    grievances he had suffered, and protested against every thing which he had been
                    compelled to do during his captivity.</p>
                <p>Different parties were variously affected by this ill-conducted and unfortunate
                    flight of the king. A republican <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514760"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4760-0061"/>party had already begun to appear; and during the
                    king’s abeence attempt« were made to induce the public at large to consider the
                    royal authority as no necessary part of a free constitution. But the minds of
                    men were not yet altogether prepared for the reception of this doctrine. The
                    idea, however, having been thus publicly proposed, left impressions which in
                    time contributed to give rise to important events. By far the greater number of
                    the leading men were at this time convinced that it was impossible to govern a
                    great empire like France without the assistance of an hereditary chief; and
                    hence they determined to pass over the journey to Varennes as quietly as
                    possible, and to hasten the period when the new constitution should be
                    completed. But their intentions, as will be seen in the sequel, were rendered
                    abortive; and there is reason to believe that this unfortunate journey was, in
                    its consequences, instrumental in bringing about the tragedy which consummated
                    the overthrow of the monarchy. The flight of the king seemed the signal for a
                    general emigration. Many of the aristocratic party sent in resignations of their
                    seats in the National Assembly; and troops were levied on the frontiers in the
                    name of the king, though he took care to disavow any connection with such
                    proceedings.</p>
                <p>The assembly, in sanctioning the detention of the king at Varennes, and sending
                    commissioners to bring him back to Paris, yielded to popular clamour, in
                    opposition probably to their better judgment; at all events they committed a
                    great political error. The leaders of the democratic party had every reason to
                    rejoice at the near prospect of a republic which his flight opened up; the
                    constitutionalists must have desired to see him established at Montmedy, and
                    emancipated from the state of thraldom in which he had been so long held by the
                    rabble of Paris; many of the royalists were not probably displeased at the
                    retreat of a king whose concessions had brought the monarchy to the brink of
                    ruin; and all the better part of society must have been gratiĥed at his escape
                    from the iron despotism of the Parisian mob. But all these considerations went
                    for nothing in opposition to the clamours of the multitude; end, either from
                    cowardice or a base love of popularity, the assembly adopted a course which
                    their own minds must have disapproved, and which men of all parties have united
                    to condemn. “The National Assembly," says Napoleon, “never committed so great an
                    error as in bringing back the king from Varennes. A fugitive and powerless, he
                    was hastening to the frontier, and in a few hours would have been out of the
                    French territory. What should they have done in these circumstances? Clearly
                    facilitated his escape, and declared the throne vacant by his desertion: they
                    would thus have avoided the infamy of a regicide government, and attained their
                    great object of republican institutions. Instead of this, by bringing him back,
                    they embarrassed themselves with a sovereign whom they had no just reason for
                    destroying, and lost the inestimable advantage of getting rid of the royal
                    family without an act of cruelty.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    acquiesce.</p>
                <p>A considerable calm followed the events just related, and France might almost be
                    regarded as in a state of tranquillity. It contained, indeed, parties who
                    entertained much animosity against each other, and many citizens had withdrawn
                    to foreign countries; but the general peace was not disturbed, and moderate men
                    hoped that prosperity would succeed to the late agitations. But this calm was
                    delusive; and in the midst of it projects were formed which were destined
                    afterwards to prove fata) to the peace of France and Europe. Towards the dose of
                    summer the famous meeting at Pi)nitz in Saxony took place between die emperor
                    and the king of Prussia, and led to the celebrated declaration, which was
                    conceived in the following terms: “Their majesties, the emperor, and king of
                    Prussia, having considered the representations of monsieur, brother of the king,
                    and of his excellency the Count d’Artois, declare conjointly that they consider
                    the situation of the king of France as a matter of common interest to all the
                    European sovereigns. They hope that the reality of that interest will be duly
                    appreciated by the other powers, whose assistance they will invoke, and that in
                    consequence they will not decline to employ their forces conjointly with their
                    majesties, in order to put the king of France in a situation to lay the
                    foundation of a monarchical government, conformable alike to the rights of
                    sovereigns and the wellbeing of the French nation. In that case the emperor and
                    king are resolved to act promptly with the forces necessary to attain their
                    common end. In the mean time they will give the requisite orders for the troops
                    to hold themselves in immediate readiness for active service.” Such was the
                    celebrated declaration of Piłnitz; but, either from a cooling of zeal upon the
                    part of the allied sovereigns, or a sense of the danger which the king of France
                    would have run, after he had, in consequence of the flight to Varennes, become a
                    prisoner in the hands of the assembly, it remained without effect. It was
                    alleged by the French, however, that there was a treaty as well as a declaration
                    of Pilnitz, or, in other words, that several secret articles, stipulating the
                    partition of some of the fairest provinces of France, were at the same time
                    agreed to by the allied sovereigns; but no sufficient evidence has ever been
                    produced to substantiate the allegation, and it is now indeed generally agreed
                    that there was no such thing as a treaty of Pilnitz.<note anchored="true"

                    more than questionable. Jt may have been fabricated by the National Assembly, to
                    unite all parties against the foreign powers which threatened France with
                    invasion. But, in relating the events of this revolution, it is as necessary,
                    for the purpose of rendering the actions of men comprehensible, to give an
                    account of what was at the time believed to have occurred, as it is to ascertain
                    what was actually true. The treaty in question bears, “That his majesty the
                    emperor will take all that Louis XIV. conquered in the Austrian Netherlands,
                    will give ĭt to his serene highness the elector palatine; tnat he will preserve
                    for ever the property and possession of Bavaria, to form in future an
                    indivisible mass with the domains and hereditary possessions of the house of
                    Austria; that the Archduchess Maria Christina shall be, conjointly with her
                    nephew the Archduke Charles, put into hereditary possession of the duchy of
                    Lorraine; that Alsace shall be restored to the empire; that if the Swiss Cantons
                    consent to accede to the coalition, it may be pro∣&gt;osed to them to annex to
                    the Helvetic league the bishopric of Porentrui, the defiles of Franche Comté,
                    and even those of Tyrol, with the neighbouring bailiwicks, as well as the
                    territory of versoy, which intersects the Pays de vaud; that should his majesty
                    the king &lt;∣f Sardinia subscribe to the coalition, La Bresse, Le Bugey, and
                    the Pays de Gex, usurped by France from Savoy, shall be restored to him; that in
                    case bis Sardinian majesty can make a grand diversion, he shall be suffered to
                    take Dauphiné, to belong to him for ever, as the nearest descendant of the
                    ancient dauphins; that the king of Spain shall have lioussiłlon and Bearn, with
                    the island of Corsica, and also the French part of the island of St Domingo;
                    that the empress of all the Russias shall take upon herself the invasion of
                    Poland, and at the same time retain Kaminiech, with that part of Podolia which
                    borders on Moldavia; that the em-ρeror shall oblige the porte to give up
                    Choczim, as well as the small forts of 8ervia, and those on the river Lurna;
                    that the king of Prussia, by means of the above-mentioned invasion of Poland,
                    shall make an acquisition of Thorn and Dantzic, and unite the palatinate on the
                    east to the confines of Silesia; that the king of Prussia shall besides acquire
                    Lusace, and the elector of Saxony shall in exchange receive the rest of Poland,
                    and occupy the throne as hereditary sovereign; that the king of Poland shall
                    abdicate the throne <pb corresp="kp-eb0710-4773-0062" xml:id="pbn7062"/>on
                    receiving a suitable annuity; and that the elector of Saxony shall give his
                    daughter in marriage to the youngest son of the grand duke of all the Ilussiaa,
                    who will be the father of the race of the hereditary kings of Poland and
                    Lithuania.” And this is signed by <hi rend="smallcaps">Leopold, Prince Nassau,

                <p>In the mean time, the National Assembly was hastening towards the completion of
                    the new constitution, which was finished on the 3d of September, and immediately
                    presented to the king. It begins with a declaration of the rights of man; this
                    is followed by the provisions regarding other matters. According to it, all men
                    are born, and remain, free and equal in rights; and social distinctions can only
                    be founded on common utility. The end of all political associations is the
                    preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man; and these rights
                    are liberty, property, security, and resistance against oppression. The
                    principle of sovereignty resides essentially in the nation; and no body of men,
                    no individual, can exercise an authority which does not emanate expressly from
                    that source. Liberty consists in the power of doing every thing except that
                    which is hurtful to another; and hence the exercise of the natural rights of
                    every man has no other bounds than those which are necessary to ensure to the
                    other members of society the enjoyment of the same rights; bounds which can only
                    be determined by law. The law has a right to forbid those actions alone which
                    are hurtful to society. Whatever is not forbidden by the law cannot be hindered;
                    and no person can be constrained to do that which the law does not ordain. The
                    law is the expression of the general will; and all the citizens have a right to
                    concur personally, or by their representatives, in the formation of the law; it
                    ought therefore to be the same for all, whether it protect or whether it punish.
                    All citizens being equal in the eye of the law, are equally admissible to
                    dignities, places, and public offices, according to their capacity, and without
                    any other distinction than that of their virtue and their talents. No man can be
                    accused, arrested, or detained, except in cases determined by the law, and
                    according to the forms which the law has prescribed. Those who solicit,
                    dispatch, execute, or cause to be executed, arbitrary orders, ought to be
                    punished; but every citizen who is summoned or seized in virtue of the law ought
                    to obey instantly, otherwise he becomes culpable by resistance. The law ought to
                    establish such punishments only as are strictly and evidently necessary; and no
                    person can be punished except in virtue of a law established and promulgated
                    prior to the offence, and legally applied. Every man being presumed innocent
                    till such time as he has been declared guilty, if it shall be deemed absolutely
                    necessary to arrest a man, ever]' kind of rigour employed, not necessary to
                    secure his person, ought to be severely repressed. No person shall be molested
                    for his opinions, even such as are religious, provided the manifestation of
                    those opinions does not disturb the public order established by the law. The
                    free communication of thought and of opinion is one of the most precious rights
                    of man. Every citizen, therefore, may freely speak, write, and publish his
                    sentiments; subject, however, to answer for the abuse of this liberty in the
                    cases determined by the law, The guarantee of the rights of men and citizens
                    involves a necessity of public force; but this force is then instituted for all,
                    and not for the particular utility of those to whom it is confided. For the
                    maintenance of the public force, and for the expenses of the administration, a
                    common contribution is indispensably necessary; but this contribution should be
                    equally divided amongst all the citizens in proportion to their abilities. Every
                    citizen has a right, by himself or by his representatives, to decide concerning
                    the necessity of the public contribution; to consent to it freely; to look after
                    the employment of it; and to determine the quantity, the distribution, the
                    collection, and duration. Society has a right to demand from every public agent
                    an account of his administration. Every society in which the guarantee of rights
                    is not assured, nor the separation of powers determined, has no constitution.
                    Property being a right inviolable and sacred, no person can be deprived of it,
                    except when the public necessity, legally ascertained, shall evidently require
                    it, and on condition of a just and previous indemnification.</p>
                <p>The constitution guarantees, as natural and civil rights, first, that all
                    citizens are admissible to places and employments, without any distinction but
                    that of ability and virtue; secondly, that all contributions shall be divided
                    equally among all the citizens, in proportion to their meansļ thirdly, that the
                    same crimes shall be subject to the same punishments, without any distinction of
                    persons. The constitution, in like manner, guarantees, as natural and civil
                    rights, liberty to all men, of going, staying, or departing, without being
                    arrested or detained, except according to the forms prescribed by the
                    constitution; liberty to all men, of speaking, writing, printing, and publishing
                    their thoughts, without having their writings subjected to any examination or
                    inspection before publication, and of exercising the religious worship to which
                    they are attached; liberty to all citizens, of assembling peaceably, and without
                    arms, complying with the laws of police; liberty of addressing to all
                    constitutional authorities petitions individually signed; and the inviolability
                    of property, or a just and previous indemnity for that of which public
                    necessity, legally proved, shall require the sacrifice. A system of public
                    instruction shall be created and organized, common to all citizens, gratuitous
                    with regard to those parts of tuition indispensable for all men, and of which
                    the establishment shall be gradually distributed, in a proportion combined with
                    the division of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>The kingdom is one and indivisible; its territory for administration is
                    distributed into eighty-three departments, each department into districts, each
                    district into cantons. Those are French citizens who are born in France of a
                    French father; who, having been born in France of a foreign father, have fixed
                    their residence in the kingdom; who, having been born in a foreign country, of a
                    French father, have returned to settle in France, and have taken the civic oath;
                    and, lastly, who, having been born in a foreign country, being descended in
                    whatever degree from a Frenchman or Frenchwoman, have left their country from
                    religious motives, come to reside in France, and taken the civic oath. The right
                    of French citizenship is lost, first, by naturalization in a foreign country;
                    secondly, by being condemned to penalties which involve the civic degradation,
                    provided the person condemned be not reinstated; thirdly, by a sentence of
                    contumacy, provided the sentence be not annulled; fourthly, by initiation into
                    any foreign order or body which supposes either proofs of nobility or
                    distinctions of birth, or requires religious vows. The law considers marriage as
                    only a civil contract.</p>
                <p>The sovereignty is one, indivisible, unalienable, and imprescriptible, and it
                    belongs to the nation; no section of the people, and no individual, can arrogate
                    the exercise of it. The nation, from which alone flow all powers, cannot
                    exercise them but by delegation. The French constitution is representative, and
                    the representatives are the legislative body and the king. The National
                    Assembly, forming the legislative body, is permanent, and consists of one
                    chamber only. It shall be formed by new elections every two years. The
                    legislative body cannot be dissolved by the king. The number of representatives
                    to the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514786" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4786-0063"
                    />legislative body shall be seven hundred and forty-five, on account of the
                    eighty-three departments of which the kingdom is composed, and independently of
                    those who may be granted to the colonies. The representatives shall be
                    distributed among the departments, according to the three proportions of land,
                    of population, and of the direct contributions or taxes. Of the seven hundred
                    and forty-five representatives, two hundred and forty-seven are attached to the
                    land. Of these, each department shall nominate three, excepting the department
                    of Paris, which shall nominate only one. Two hundred and forty-nine
                    representatives are attached to the population. The total mass of the active
                    population of the kingdom is divided into two hundred and forty-nine parts, and
                    each department nominates as many of the deputies as it contains paru of the
                    population. Two hundred and forty-nine representatives are attached to the
                    direct contributions. The sum total of the direct contributions of the kingdom
                    is likewise divided into two hundred and forty-nine parts, and each department
                    nominates as many deputies as it pays parts of the contribution.</p>
                <p>In order to form a Legislative National Assembly, the active citizens shall
                    convene, in primary assemblies, every two years in the cities and cantons. The
                    primary assemblies shall meet of full right on the first Sunday of March, if not
                    convoked sooner by the public officers appointed to do so by the law. To be an
                    active citizen, it is necessary to be a Frenchman, or to have become a
                    Frenchman; to have attained twenty-five years complete; to have resided in the
                    city or the canton during the time determined by the law; to pay in any part of
                    the kingdom a direct contribution or tax, at least equal to the value of three
                    days’ labour, and to produce the acquittance; not to be in a menial capacity,
                    namely, that of a servant receiving wages; to be inscribed in the municipality
                    of the place of his residence in the list of the national guards; to have taken
                    the civic oath. The primary assemblies shall name electors in the proportion of
                    the number of active citizens residing in the city or canton. There shall be
                    named one elector to the assembly or not, according as there shall happen to be
                    present a hundred active citizens. There shall be named two when there are
                    present from a hundred and fifty-one to two hundred and fifty, and so on in this
                    proportion. The electors named in each department shall convene in order to
                    choose the number of representatives whose nomination shall belong to their
                    department, and a number of substitutes equal to the third of the
                    representatives. The assemblies shall be held of full right on the last Sunday
                    of March, if they have not been before convoked by the public officers appointed
                    to do so by law. All active citizens, whatever be their state, profession, or
                    contribution, may be chosen representatives of the nation; excepting,
                    nevertheless, the ministers and other agents of the executive power, and other
                    persons named. The members of the legislative body may be re-elected to a
                    subsequent legislature, but not till after an interval of one legislature. No
                    active citizen can enter or vote in an assembly if he be armed. The
                    representatives shall meet on the first Monday of May, in the place of the
                    sittings of the last legislature.</p>
                <p>The royalty is indivisible, and delegated hereditarily to the race on the throne
                    from male to male, by order of primogeniture, to the perpetual exclusion of
                    women and their descendants. Nothing is prejudged as to the effect of
                    renunciations in the race on the throne. The person of the king is inviolable
                    and sacred; his only title is King of the French. If the king put himself at the
                    head of an army, and direct the forces of it against the nation, or if he do not
                    oppose, by a formal act, any such enterprise undertaken in his name, he shall be
                    held to have abdicated, if the king, having gone out of the kingdom, do not
                    return to it, after an invitation by the legislative body, within the space
                    which shall be fixed by the proclamation, and which cannot be less than two
                    months, he shall be held to have abdicated the royalty. After abdication,
                    express or legal, the king shall be in the class of citizens, and may be accused
                    and tried like them for acts posterior to his abdication. The nation makes
                    provision for the splendour of the throne by a civil list, of which the
                    legislative body shall fix the amount at the commencement of each reign, for the
                    whole duration of that reign. The king is a minor till the age of eighteen
                    complete; and during his minority there shall be a regent of the kingdom. The
                    regency belongs to the relation of the king next in degree according to the
                    order of succession to the throne, who has attained the age of twenty-five,
                    provided he be a Frenchman resident in the kingdom, and not presumptive heir to
                    any other crown, and have previously taken the civic oath. The presumptive heir
                    shall bear the name of Prince Hoyal. The members of the king’s family called to
                    the eventual succession of the throne shall add the denomination of French
                    Prince to the name which shall be given them in the civil act proving their
                    birth; and this name can neither be patronymic nor formed of any of the
                    qualifications abolished by the present constitution. The denomination of prince
                    cannot be given to any individual, and shall not carry with it any privilege or
                    exception to the common right of all French citizens. To the king alone belong
                    the choice and dismission of ministers.</p>
                <p>The members of the present National Assembly, and of the subsequent legislatures,
                    the members of the tribunal of appeal, and those who shall be of the high jury,
                    cannot be advanced to the ministry, nor receive any place, gift, pension,
                    allowance, or commission of the executive power, or its agents, during the
                    continuance of their functions, or during two years after ceasing to exercise
                    them; and the same shall be observed respecting those who shall only be
                    inscribed on the list of high jurors as longas their inscription shall continue.
                    No order of the king can be executed if it be not signed by him, and
                    countersigned by the minister or comptroller of the department. In no case can
                    the written or verbal order of the king shelter a minister from
                    responsibility.</p>
                <p>The constitution delegates exclusively to the legislative body the powers and
                    functions following: To propose and decree laws, as the king can only invite the
                    legislative body to take a subject into consideration; to fix the public
                    expenses; to establish the public contributions; to determine the nature of
                    them, the amount of each sort, the duration, mode of collection, and so forth.
                    War cannot be resolved on except by a decree of the National Assembly, passed on
                    the formal and necessary proposition of the king, and sanctioned by him. During
                    the whole course of war the legislative body may require the king to negotiate
                    peace; and the king is bound to yield to this requisition. It belongs to the
                    legislative body to ratify treaties of peace, alliance, and commerce; and no
                    treaty shall have effect but by this ratification.</p>
                <p>The deliberations of the legislative body shall be public, and the minutes of the
                    sittings shall be printed. The legislative body may, however, upon any occasion
                    form itself into a general committee. The project of a decree or law shall be
                    read thrice, at three intervals, the shortest of which cannot be less than eight
                    days. The decrees of the legislative body are presented to the king, who may
                    refuse them his consent. In case of a refusal of the royal consent, that refusal
                    is only suspensive. When the two following legislatures shall successively
                    present the same decree in the same terms in which it was originally conceived,
                    the king shall be deemed to have given his sanction. The king is bound to
                    express his consent or refusal to each decree within two months after its
                    présentation<pb break="no" facs="nls:193514799" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4799-0064"/>.
                    No decree to which the king has refused his consent can be again presented to
                    him by the same legisla∙ ture.</p>
                <p>The supreme executive power resides exclusively in the hands of the king. The
                    king is the supreme head of the land and sea forces. He names ambassadors,'and
                    the other agents of political negotiations. He bestows the command of armies and
                    fleets, and the ranks of marshal of France and admiral: he names two thirds of
                    the rear-admirals, one half of the lieutenant-generals, major-generals, captains
                    of ships, and colonels of the national gendarmerie: he names a third of the
                    colonels and lieutenant-colonels, and a sixth of the lieutenants of ships: he
                    appoints, in the civil administration of the marine, the directors, the
                    comptrollers, the treasurers of the arsenals, the masters of the works, the
                    under-masters of civil buildings, half of the masters of administration, and the
                    undermasters of construction. He appoints the commissaries of the tribunals; as
                    also the superintendents in chief of the management of indirect contributions,
                    and the administration of national domains. He superintends the coinage of
                    money, and appoints officers intrusted with this superintendence in the general
                    commission and the mints. The effigy of the king is struck upon all the coinage
                    of the kingdom. There is in each department a superior administration, and in
                    each district a subordinate administration. The administrators are specially
                    charged with distributing the direct contributions, and with superintending the
                    money arising from the contributions, and the public revenues in their
                    territory. The king has the right of annulling such acts of the administrators
                    of department as are contrary to the law or the orders transmitted to them; and
                    he may, in case of obstinate disobedience, or of their endangering, by their
                    acts, the safety or peace of the public, suspend them from their functions. The
                    king alone can interfere in foreign political connections. Every declaration of
                    war shall be made in these terms: “By the king of the French, in the name of the
                    nation.” The judicial power can in no case be exercised either by the
                    legislative body or the king. Justice shall be gratuitously administered by
                    judges chosen from time to time by the people, and instituted by letters-patent
                    of the king, who cannot refuse them. The public accuser shall be nominated by
                    the people. The right of citizens to determine disputes definitively by
                    arbitration, cannot receive any infringement from the acts of the legislative
                    power. In criminal matters, no citizens can be judged except on an accusation
                    received by jurors, or decreed by the legislative body in the case in which it
                    belongs to it to prosecute the accusation. After the accusation shall be
                    admitted, the facts shall be examined and declared by the jurors. The person
                    accused shall have the privilege of challenging twenty jurors, without assigning
                    any reason. The jurors who declare the fact shall not be fewer than twelve. The
                    application of the law shall be made by the judges. The process shall be public;
                    and the person accused cannot be denied the aid of counsel. No man acquitted by
                    a legal jury can be apprehended or accused on account of the same fact.</p>
                <p>For the whole kingdom there shall be one tribunal of appeal, established near the
                    legislative body. A high national court, composed of members of the tribunal of
                    appeal and high jurors, shall take cognizance of the crimes of ministers, and
                    the principal agents of the executive power; and of crimes which attack the
                    general safety of the state, when the legislative body shall pass a decree of
                    accusation. It shall not assemble except on the proclamation of the legislative
                    body, and at the distance of thirty ∣ thousand toises at least from the place of
                    meeting of the legislative body.</p>
                <p>The national guards do not form a military body, or an</p>
                <p>- institution in the state; they are the citizehs themselves ι-called to assist
                    the public force. Officers are chosen for a time, and cannot again be chosen
                    till after a certain ine terval of service as privates. None shall command the e

                <p>- longer than the last day of the following session, if they</p>

                    ministers or comptrollers-general, shall be printed . and published at the
                    commencement of the sessions of , each legislature; and the same shall be done
                    with the statements of the receipt of the different taxes, and all . the public
                    revenues.</p>
                <p>i The French nation renounces the undertaking of any f war with the view of
                    making conquests, and will never employ its forces against the liberty of any
                    people. And it is also declared, that the nation has the imprescriptible: right
                    of changing its constitution; but considering that it is more conformable to the
                    national interest to employ only, by means provided in the constitution itself,
                    the right of reforming those articles of it of which experience shall have shown
                    the inconveniences, it is further decreed, that the proceeding by an assembly of
                    revision shall be regulated in the form following: When three successive
                    legislatures shall have expressed an uniform wish for the change of any
                    constitutional article, the revision demanded shall take place. The next
                    legislature, and the following, cannot propose the reform of any constitutional
                    article. The fourth legislature, augmented by two hundred and forty- ’ nine
                    members, chosen in each department, by doubling the ordinary number which it
                    furnishes in proportion to its population, shall form the assembly of
                    revision.</p>
                <p>The French colonies and possessions in Asia, Africa, and America, though they
                    form part of the French empire, are not included in this constitution.</p>
                <p>With respect to the laws made by the National Assembly which are not included in
                    the act of constitution, and those anterior laws which it has not altered, they
                    shall be observed as long as they are not revoked or modified by the legislative
                    power.</p>
                <p>On the 13th of September the king announced, by a letter to the president of the
                    assembly, his acceptance of this constitution, which, however defective in some
                    points, is based upon solid principles of liberty; and the event was ordered to
                    be notified to all the foreign courts, whilst the assembly decreed a general
                    amnesty with respect to the events of the Revolution. On the following day the
                    king repaired in person to the National Assembly; and being conducted to a chair
                    of state prepared for him by the side of the president, he signed the
                    constitutional act, and took an oath to maintain it. He then withdrew, and was
                    attended back to the Tuilleries by the whole assembly, with the president at
                    their head. On the 30th of September, the National, which has since been known
                    by the name of the Constituent Assembly, dissolved itself, and gave place to the
                    Legislative National Assembly, which had been elected according to the rules
                    prescribed in the new constitution.</p>
                <p>Of the character and labours of £he Constituent Assembly, which contained many
                    men of distinguished talents, and not a few of eminent virtue, it is by no means
                    easy, even at this distance of time, to form an accurate and altogether
                    dispassionate estimate. Called together at a period of unexampled difficulty and
                    distress; intrusted with the performance of duties altogether new to its
                    members; required at once to regenerate a superannuated monarchy and to lay the
                    foundations of constitutional liberty; and placed m <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193514812" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4812-0065"/>the midst of a famishing
                    people, resolved to cast off their chains, but not yet prepared for the
                    enjoyment of freedom; it “as expected to reform every abuse which tune and
                    misgovernment had engendered, to renovate an empire gray with feudal corruption,
                    and to direct into safe channels the recently-excited energy of the people. The
                    convocation of the States General formed the last resource of the monarchy
                    overburdened by its own vices, and the first hope of the nation groaning under
                    the pressure of accumulated evils; and to this body, therefore, the court looked
                    for help in overcoming the difficulties with which it was beset, at the expense
                    of some concessions in favour of general liberty, and the people for an entire
                    re-organization of the system of government on a footing adapted to their
                    opinions and their wants. How it accomplished the task thus imposed on it, is
                    now matter of experience. That much still remains in dispute cannot be denied;
                    but time, the great expositor of truth, has nevertheless unfolded its errors and
                    illustrated its virtues.</p>
                <p>The principal evils which afflicted France were removed by this assembly. Liberty
                    of religious worship, which had been but imperfectly provided for in 1787, was
                    secured in its fullest extent; torture and the punishment of the wheel were
                    abolished; trial by jury, publicity of criminal proceedings, the examination of
                    witnesses in presence of the accused, and counsel for his defence, were fixed by
                    law; the ancient parliaments, the fastnesses of prejudice and partiality, were
                    suppressed, and one uniform system of criminal jurisprudence established; <hi
                    rend="italic">lettres</hi><hi rend="italic">de cachet</hi> were abolished for
                    ever; the exemption from taxation of the nobility and the clergy was
                    extinguished, and an equal system of contribution established throughout the
                    kingdom; the most oppressive imposts, as those on salt and tobacco, together
                    with the taille and the tithes, were abrogated; and the privileges of nobility,
                    with the feudal burdens, were abolished. To the Constituent Assembly France has
                    also been indebted for the institution of national guards; the opening of the
                    army to the courage and ability of every class of society; and the division of
                    landed property amongst the middle ranks, one of the greatest benefits which can
                    be conferred upon a nation. The same body also had the merit of authoritatively
                    recognising and proclaiming the natural, social, and civil rights of man; of
                    establishing that equality in the eye of the law without which there can be no
                    true liberty; and of rendering the whole genius, talent, and virtue of the
                    nation available to the public service in all its departments. These were no
                    doubt mighty changes, and their beneficial effects w ere demonstrated even
                    amidst all the calamities and convulsions which ensued. They enabled the nation
                    to bear up and prosper under a vast accumulation of evils, any one of which
                    would have exhausted the national strength under the monarchy; under public
                    bankruptcy, enormously-depreciated assignats, civil divisions, political
                    anarchy, the reign of terror, the wars of Napoleon, foreign invasion, and
                    subjugation by Europe. In a word, by means of these reforms, France has at
                    length, in spite of every obstacle, become great, glorious, and free; the terror
                    of the despots of continental Europe, and one of the greatest bulwarks of modem
                    civilization.</p>
                <p>The errors of the Constituent Assembly, though scarcely of less magnitude, have
                    happily not produced consequences equally lasting. By destroying in a few months
                    die constitution of a thousand years, they set afloat the ideas of men, and
                    spread the fever of innovation throughout the empire; by confiscating the
                    property of the church, they established a precedent for injustice, which was
                    but too closely followed in subsequent years; by establishing the right of
                    universal suffrage, and conferring on the nation the nomination to all offices
                    of trust, they conceded the exercise of powers incompatible with the monarchical
                    form of government they themselves had established, and which the people were as
                    yet incapable of exercising with advantage. They diminished the influence of the
                    crown to such a degree as to render it incapable of controlling the people; they
                    limited the royal negative in such a manner as to render it nearly inoperative;
                    and they thus left the kingdom a prey to the factions to which the recent
                    changes had unavoidably given birth. Lastly, by excluding themselves from the
                    Legislative Assembly (and this was their greatest error), they deprived France
                    of the benefit of their experience, and permitted their successors to commence
                    the same circle of experimental innovation, to the extreme hazards of which they
                    had latterly been fully awakened. But all these were either reparable or
                    terminable evils, which, though severely felt for a season, have, in the natural
                    course of events, been either cured or ended; and, fortunately for France, the
                    good seed sown by this body is still producing its fruits, whilst the tares
                    scattered amongst it have at length withered and died</p>
                <p>The new assembly was opened by the king in person on the 7th of October, in a
                    speech recommending unanimity and confidence between the legislative and the
                    executive powers, which speech was received with unbounded applause. The
                    character of the men who composed the new National Assembly was inauspicious to
                    the court. At the commencement of the Revolution, the great body of the people
                    at a distance from the capital felt little interested in those projects of
                    freedom which occupied the more enlightened but more turbulent inhabitants of
                    Paris. But they had gradually been roused from their lethargy. The variety of
                    powers conferred upon the people at large by the new constitution, and the
                    multiplicity of offices of which it gave them the patronage, had kindled in the
                    minds of men a sense of their own importance, and a desire to intermeddle in
                    public affairs. This attached them to the new order of things. The love of
                    power, which is perhaps the least disguised passion in the human heart, and
                    equally strong in the breast of the meanest and most elevated of mankind, had
                    thus, under the name of liberty, become a leading passion throughout the empire;
                    and they who flattered it most, and were loudest in praise of the rights of the
                    people, became speedily the favourites of the public. The new National Assembly
                    was chiefly composed of country gentlemen of principles highly democratic, or of
                    men of letters who had published popular books or conducted periodica]
                    publications; and as the members of the Constituent Assembly had by their own
                    act excluded themselves from holding seats in the Legislative Assembly, the
                    members of the latter entertained but little regard for a constitution which
                    they themselves had not framed, and which was not protected by the sanction of
                    antiquity.</p>
                <p>When this assembly first met, it showed much attention to formalities, and an
                    extreme jealousy of the ministers of the crown; and as the treaty of Pilnitz now
                    began to be rumoured abroad, France was thrown into a state of great anxiety for
                    the safety of its newly-acquired liberties. Although the Prussians and Germans
                    still continued to temporize, Sweden and Russia had entered into strict
                    engagements to restore the old despotism of France. Accordingly, on the 9th of
                    November a decree was passed, by which it was provided that the emigrants who,
                    after the first of January 1792, should be found assembled in a hostile manner
                    beyond the frontiers, should be considered as guilty of a conspiracy, and suffer
                    death; and that the French princes and public functionaries who should not
                    return before that period, should be punishable in the same manner, and their
                    property forfeited during their lives. On the 18th a number of severe decrees
                    were also passed against such of the ejected clergy as still refused to take the
                    civic oath. But to all these the king opposed his <hi rend="italic">veto</hi> or
                    negative. The moderate party, who were attached to the constitution, rejoiced at
                    this, as a proof of the freedom of the sovereign; but, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193514825" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4825-0066"/>on the other hand, it raised
                    a violent clamour, and became the means of exciting new suspicions against the
                    court. About this time answers from the different foreign courts to the
                    notification sent them of the king having accepted the new constitution were
                    received. These were generally conceived in a style of great caution, and
                    avoided employing language calculated to produce irritation. The emperor even
                    prohibited all assemblages of emigrants within his states; and Louis intimated
                    to the assembly that he had declared to the elector of Treves, that unless the
                    emigrants ceased before the 15th of January to make hostile preparations within
                    his territories, he would be considered as the enemy of France. All this,
                    however, did not serve to allay suspicion; for although the different foreign
                    courts had openly declared pacific intentions, yet the French emigrants boldly
                    asserted that all Europe was actually arming in their favour, and accordingly
                    ceased not to solicit such of their friends as still remained within the country
                    to leave it and join them in what they called the royal cause. Placed between a
                    republican party which was gradually gathering strength, and an aristocratical
                    party which was rousing Europe to arms against a nation of which he was the
                    constitutional chief, with a combination of princes suspected of wishing to
                    seize upon part of his dominions, the unhappy king stood in a situation which
                    would have perplexed the most skilful statesman; and it is no prpof of
                    incapacity that he fell a sacrifice to circumstances which might have
                    overwhelmed any ordinary measure of human sagacity. Addresses were crowding into
                    the assembly disapproving the conduct of the court. Μ. Montmorin resigned; Μ.
                    Delessart succeeded him; and Μ. Cahier de Gerville became minister of the
                    interior. Μ. Duportail resigned also, and was succeeded as minister of war by Μ.
                    de Narbonne. In the month of November Μ. Bailly’s mayoralty terminated; and the
                    once popular Lafayette appeared as a candidate for the office. But he was
                    successfully opposed by Μ. Petion, a declared republican, who was elected mayor
                    by a great majority.</p>
                <p>At this period the moderate men, friends of the constitution, attempted to
                    counteract the influence of the Jacobin Club by the establishment of a similar
                    one. This new club derived its name from the vacant convent of the Feuillants,
                    in which it assembled; and the most active members of the Constituent Assembly
                    belonged to it, such as MM. d’André, Barnave, the two Lameths, Duport, Rabaud,
                    Sieyes, Chapelier, Thouret, Labord, Talleyrand, Montesquieu, Beaumetz, and
                    others. But the Jacobins contrived to excite a riot at the place of their
                    meeting, which was in the vicinity of the hall of the National Assembly; and
                    this afforded a pretext for applying to the assembly for the removal of the new
                    club. The assembly complied with the request, and thereby evinced its favourable
                    disposition towards the Jacobins.</p>
                <p>At the close of the year 1791 the kingdom of France was by no means in a
                    prosperous state. The public revenue had fallen far short of the expenditure;
                    the emigrant nobility had carried out of the kingdom the greater part of the
                    current coin; and a variety of manufacturers, who depended upon their
                    ostentatious luxury, were reduced to much distress. The dispositions of foreign
                    courts appeared at best doubtful. The year 1792, however, opened with a delusive
                    prospect of tranquillity. The German princes seemed to be satisfied with the
                    mode of compensation which the French had offered for the loss of their
                    possessions in Alsace and Lorraine; tire Prince of Lowenstein accepted of an
                    indemnification; the Princes of Hohenlohe and Salm-Salm declared themselves
                    ready to treat upon the same terms; whilst Prince Maximilian, and the Dukes of
                    Wirtemberg and Deux-Ponts, also negotiated an arrangement. It is unnecessary to
                    state in detail the subterfuges employed by Leopold for amusing the French with
                    the appearances of peace. To these, and probably also to the undecided character
                    of Louis, Μ. Delessart, minister of foreign affairs, fell a sacrifice. He was
                    accused by Brissot of not having given timely notice to the National Assembly of
                    the dispositions of foreign powers, and of not pressing proper measures for
                    securing the honour and safety of the nation; a decree of accusation was passed
                    against him in his absence; and having been apprehended, tried by the high court
                    at Orleans, and convicted, he was executed in virtue of its sentence.</p>
                <p>The unexpected death of Leopold on the first of March gave rise to a transient
                    hope that peace might still be preserved. On the 16th of the same month the king
                    of Sweden was wounded by a nobleman of the name of Anker-ström, and died on the
                    29th. This enterprising prince, having overturned the constitution of his own
                    country, had formed the project of conducting in person his troops to the
                    frontiers of France, and of commanding or accompanying the combined armies of
                    Europe in their attempt to avenge the cause of insulted royalty; and it was in a
                    great measure to counteract this scheme that he was assassinated.</p>
                <p>The sudden fall of these two enemies, however, rather accelerated than retarded
                    the meditated hostilities. The young king of Hungary, who succeeded to the
                    empire, made no secret either of his own intentions or of the existence of a
                    concert of princes against France. Dumouriez was now at the head of the war
                    office, Roland held the portfolio of the interior, and Clavière was minister of
                    finance. The Jacobins were all-powerful, and the court gave way to the torrent.
                    The property of the emigrants was confiscated, reserving only the rights of
                    creditors. Meanwhile the imperial minister, Prince Kaunitz, demanded three
                    things of France: first, the restitution of all their feudal rights to the
                    German princes; secondly, the restoration of Avignon to the pope, the
                    inhabitants of which had some time previously thrown off their allegiance, and
                    prevailed with the Constituent Assembly to receive their country as part of
                    France; and, lastly, a guarantee that the neighbouring powers should have no
                    reason for apprehension from the present weakness of the internal government of
                    France. On receiving these demands, the king proposed a declaration of war,
                    which, on the 20th of April, was accordingly decreed by tire National Assembly
                    against tire king of Hungary and Bohemia.</p>
                <p>The French immediately began the contest, by attack- ' ing in three different
                    columns the Austrian Netherlands. ’ Dillon advanced from Lisle to Tournay, where
                    he found a' strong body of Austrians ready to receive him. But the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> national force, unaccustomed to sustain tire fire of
                    regular troops, were instantly thrown into confusion, and fled even, to the
                    gates of Lisle. The cry of treason resounded on all sides; and their commander,
                    an experienced and faithful officer, was murdered by his own soldiers and the
                    mob. A second division of ten thousand men, under General Biron, took possession
                    of Quivcrain on the 29th, and marched towards Mons, at which place he was
                    attacked by the Austrians, whom he repulsed; but hearing of the defeat of
                    Dillon, he retreated. A third division advanced to Fumes, but afterwards
                    withdrew; and Lafayette, who had simultaneously advanced towards Bouvines, half
                    way to Namur, was also obliged to retire. All these expeditions were ill
                    contrived, inasmuch as they divided the French undisciplined troops, and exposed
                    them in small bodies to the attack of veteran forces. Some time elapsed before
                    the Austrians attempted to retaliate. At length, however, on the llth of June
                    they attacked Gouvion, who commanded the advanced guard of Lafayette’s army,
                    near Maubeuge; but Lafayette having come to his assistance, the Austrians
                    abandoned the field.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, matters were hastening towards a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193514838" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4838-0067"/>violent crisis in Paris. Two
                    parries, both equally hostile to the present constitution, had been gradually
                    formed, one of which wished to give more effectual support to the royal
                    authority, by establishing a senate, to prevent the king’s vote from being the
                    sole check upon popular enthusiasm; whilst the other desired to set aside
                    royalty altogether, and to hazard the perilous experiment of converting France
                    into a republic. These last were supported by the Jacobin Chib, which had now
                    contrived to concentrate within itself an immense mass of influence. In every
                    town and village of the provinces innumerable popular societies were
                    established; and with these a regular correspondence was kept up, both by
                    letters and by emissaries. Every scheme was thus instantaneously propagated
                    throughout the empire, and all the violent spirits which it contained were
                    enabled to act in concert. But the more immediate engine of the republican party
                    consisted of the immense population of the metropolis, whom they now endeavoured
                    to keep in a state of continual alarm. For this purpose, it was alleged that an
                    Austrian committee, or a conspiracy in favour of the enemies of the country,
                    existed amongst the friends of the court; and both Gensonné and Brissot offered
                    in the assembly to prove the existence of this pretended committee. A re[κ&gt;rt
                    was next circulated that the king intended to abscond from the capital on the
                    23d of May; and though his majesty publicly contradicted the rumour, which he
                    treated as a calumny, it made no small impression upon the minds of the public.
                    New decrees were now passed against the refractory clergy, but these his majesty
                    refused to sanction. A proposal was also made and adopted in the assembly to
                    form a camp of twenty thousand men under the walls of Paris, and for this
                    purpose to levy from every canton in the kingdom one horse and four infantry
                    soldiers. But the national guard of Paris disliked the proposal, and the king
                    gave it his negative. At this time the king seems to have come to a resolution
                    of making a stand against the Jacobin party, to which he had for some time
                    yielded. With the exception of Dumouriez, therefore, the ministry were
                    dismissed, and others appointed in their stead. Dumouriez lost the confidence of
                    the Jacobin Club in consequence of the exception in his favour; but he saw his
                    error, resigned his office, and immediately joined the army. In the mean time a
                    decree had been passed, authorizing the manufactory of pikes for the purpose of
                    arming cheaply the lower class of citizens. Attempts were also made, by means of
                    inflammatory writings and harangues, to render the king odious; and in both ways
                    Marat, who afterwards acquired such infamous notoriety, appears to have taken
                    the lead.</p>
                <p>On the 20th of June, Roederer, the procureur-general, informed the assembly that,
                    contrary to law, formidable bodies of armed men were preparing to present
                    petitions to the king and to the assembly; and part of them speedily made their
                    appearance, with St Huruge, and Santerre, a brewer, at their head. They marched
                    through the hall in a procession which lasted two hours, and to the number of
                    about forty thousand. They then surrounded the Tuilleries, the gates of which
                    were thrown open; and on an attempt to break open the door of the apartment
                    where the kin·’ was, he ordered them to be admitted. During the four or five
                    hours that <hi rend="italic">þe</hi> was surrounded by the multitude, and
                    compelled to listen to every indignity, his sister the Princess Elizabeth never
                    departed from his side. All this time Petion, the mayor of Paris, was most
                    unaccountably absent; but at length he arrived at the palace, as did also a
                    deputation from the assembly. The queen, with her children and the Princess de
                    Lamballe, were in the mean while in the council-chamber, where, though protected
                    from violence, they were nevertheless exposed to insult. At last, on the
                    approach of evening, the multitude, yielding to the entreaties of Petion,
                    gradually dispersed. The indignities suffered by the royal family on this
                    occasion were in some respects not unfavourable to their cause. The respectable
                    inhabitants of the capital, ashamed of such proceedings, complained of them in a
                    petition which they presented to the assembly; and addresses to the same purpose
                    were received from several departments. The directory of the department of
                    Paris, at the head of which were Μ. Roche-foucault and Μ. Talleyrand, published
                    a declaration, disapproving of the conduct of the mayor, and of Manuel the
                    procureur of the commune, whom they afterwards suspended from their offices, to
                    which .however the delinquents were speedily restored by a decree of the
                    assembly. About the same time Lafayette having suddenly quitted the army,
                    appeared at the bar of the assembly, where he declared that he came to express
                    the indignation with which the whole army regarded the events of the 20th, and
                    called upon the assembly to punish the promoters of these excesses, and to
                    dissolve the factious clubs. The sudden appearance of Lafayette threw the
                    Jacobins into consternation, and from that period they never ceased to
                    calumniate him.</p>
                <p>On the 1st of July the assembly, on the motion of Jean de Brie, ordered a
                    proclamation to be issued that the country was in danger; and on the 6th, Louis
                    intimated that the king of Prussia was marching with fifty-two thousand men to
                    operate against France. The French armies had about this time obtained some
                    successes in the Austrian Netherlands; but the cabinet thought it necessary to
                    order them to retreat, a measure which was afterwards publicly censured by
                    Marshal Luckner. On the 7th an extraordinary scene took place in the National
                    Assembly. At the moment when Brissot was about to commence an oration, Μ.
                    Lam-mourette, bishop of Lyons, requested to be heard for a fewminutes, and after
                    expatiating on the necessity of union amongst the members of the assembly, and
                    of sacrificing their passions and prejudices on the altar of their country,
                    concluded an animated address by proposing that all who held in equal
                    detestation a republic and two chambers, and who wished to maintain the
                    constitution as it stood, should immediately rise up. The w-ords were scarcely
                    pronounced when the whole assembly started from their seats; men of all parties
                    solemnly embraced each other, protesting their adherence to the constitution;
                    and a deputation announced the happy event to the king, who came to the
                    assembly, and congratulated them on what had occurred. But the only good effect
                    produced by this temporary agreement was, that the festival of the 14th of July,
                    which was celebrated with the usual magnificence, passed in tranquillity.</p>
                <p>On the 25th of July, the Duke of Brunswick issued at Coblentz his celebrated
                    manifesto. It declared that the purpose of the intended invasion of France was
                    to restore the French king to full authority; held the national guard
                    responsible for the preservation of tranauillity; and threatened with the
                    punishment of death, as rebels to their king, all those who should appear in
                    arms against the allied powers. The same language was employed towards all
                    persons holding offices, civil as well as military; whilst the city of Paris and
                    the National Assembly were declared responsible for every insult which might be
                    offered to the royal family. It was added, that if the latter were not
                    immediately placed in safety, the allies were resolved to inflict upon those who
                    should deserve it the most exemplary and ever-memorable punishment, by giving up
                    the city of Paris to military execution, and exposing it to total destruction;
                    and the same vengeance was denounced against all those who should be guilty of

                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4851-0068"/>universal credit. The sovereigns of Prussia and of
                    Hungary announced to the French nation that their monarch was secretly hostile
                    to the constitution; and the restoration of the king and his family to despotic
                    power was made the sole pretence for a most unjustifiable aggression. The
                    republican party saw at once the advantage which they had gained, and resolved
                    on the deposition of the king. The chief engine which they meant to employ in
                    this service consisted of about fifteen hundred men, who had come to Paris at
                    the period of the confederation on the 14th of July, hence called <hi
                    rend="italic">Fédérés.,</hi> and who were also sometimes denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">Marseillais,</hi> from the place which had sent the greater
                    number; and next to these, dependence was placed upon the populace of the
                    suburbs of the capital. The designs of the republicans were not unknown to the
                    court, and both parties now formed their plans of operation. The royal party
                    intended, it is said, that the king and his family should suddenly leave the
                    capital, and proceed to as great a distance as the constitution permitted;
                    whilst the republicans, on the other hand, are alleged to have meditated seizing
                    the person of the king, and confining him in the castle of Vincennes until a
                    national convention should decide upon his fate. Both assertions are probably
                    true. Every motive which can influence the mind of man must have induced Louis
                    to wish to be at a distance from the factious and sanguinary capital; and the
                    subsequent conduct of the republicans warrants us in believing that they already
                    contemplated the destruction of the king and the monarchy.</p>
                <p>Various charges had at different times been brought forward in the assembly
                    against Lafayette, and the 8th of August was appointed for their discussion. In
                    the mean time, on the 3d of August, Petion the mayor, at the head of a
                    deputation from the sections of Paris, appeared at the bar, and formally
                    demanded the deposition of the king. The discussion of the accusation against
                    Lafayette was considered as a trial of strength between the parties; but he was
                    acquitted by a majority of nearly two hundred; and the republican party,
                    despairing of carrying their point by a vote of the assembly, resolved to have
                    recourse to the bolder experiment of insurrection.</p>
                <p>On the evening of the 9th, about fifteen hundred gentlemen, officers of the army,
                    and others, repaired to the palace, resolved to protect the royal family, or to
                    die in their defence; and besides these, there were within its walls seven
                    hundred Swiss guards, with a body of cavalry amounting to about a thousand.
                    Mandat, the commander of the national guards, a man firmly attached to the
                    constitution, had also procured two thousand four hundred of that body, with
                    twelve pieces of cannon. There can be no doubt that, with such a force
                    vigorously directed, the palace, which is a kind of castle, might have been
                    successfully defended; and that which is now termed a revolution might have
                    received the name of a rebellion. But. unhappily for the cause of monarchy in
                    France, its supporters, military as well as civil, were paralysed by the
                    uncertainty and vacillation which characterized the royal counsels, and, through
                    indecision, all was lost. Meanwhile the assembly declared its sittings
                    permanent. Petion was at the palace late in the evening of the 9th; and as some
                    apprehensions were entertained, or pretended to be entertained, for his safety,
                    a deputation from the assembly brought him away. At midnight the tocsin was
                    sounded, and the drums beat to arms throughout the city, when a number of the
                    most active leaders of the republican party assembled, and elected a new common
                    council. The persons thus irregularly chosen instantly took possession of the
                    common-hall, and drove out the lawful members, who, infected with that weakness
                    which shrinks from stations of responsibility in perilous times, readily gave
                    place to the usurpers. The new council then sent repeated messages to Mandat,
                    requiring his attendance upon important business. He was occupied in arranging
                    the troops around the palace; but suspecting nothing, he went to the commonhall,
                    and was there astonished to find a different assembly from that which he
                    expected to meet there. He was abruptly accused of a plot to massacre the
                    people, and ordered to prison; but as he descended the stairs he was shot
                    through the head with a pistol, and Santerre appointed in his stead to command
                    the national guard. In the palace all was anxiety and alarm.</p>
                <p>About six o’clock in the morning of the 10th the king descended into the gardens
                    to review the troops. He was received with shouts of <hi rend="italic">Vive le
                    roi,</hi> excepting from the artillery, who shouted <hi rend="italic">Vive la
                    nation.</hi> The king returned to the palace, and the multitude continued to
                    assemble. The national guard seemed undecided what to do, <hi rend="italic"
                    >as</hi> they assembled in divisions near the palace; and had a steady
                    resistance been made from within, it is probable they would have joined the
                    royal party. But towards eight o’clock Μ. Roederer procured admission into the
                    palace, and told the king that armed multitudes were assembling in hostile array
                    around the Tuilleries; that the national guard was not to be depended upon; and
                    that, in the event of resistance, the whole royal family would certainly be
                    massacred. He therefore advised the king to seek protection in the hall of the
                    National Assembly; and with this advice the king, with his usual facility of
                    temper, prepared to comply; but the queen vehemently opposed the humiliating
                    proposal. Having, however, become gradually alarmed for the safety of her
                    children, she at length gave her consent; and the king, queen, and Princess
                    Elizabeth, together with the prince and princess royal, went on foot to the hall
                    of the assembly. “I am come hither,” said his majesty, “to prevent a great
                    crime. Among you, gentlemen, I believe myself in safety.” But by an article of
                    the constitution the assembly could not deliberate in presence of the king. The
                    royal family were, therefore, placed in a narrow box separated from the hall by
                    a railing, where they remained during fourteen hours, without having any place
                    to which they could retire for refreshment, excepting a small closet adjoining;
                    and here they sat listening to debates in which the royal character and office
                    were treated with every species of contumely and insult.</p>
                <p>When the king left the palace of the Tuilleries, he un, fortunately forgot to
                    order it to be immediately surrendered. This he recollected as soon as he
                    reached the assembly, and sent orders accordingly; but unhappily it was now too
                    late. The insurgents, amounting to about twenty thousand in number, were drawn
                    up in tolerable order by Westermann, a Prussian by birth, and had with them
                    thirty pieces of cannon. The gentlemen within the palace, who had assembled to
                    protect the king’s person, now became dispirited, and knew not what to do. Afry,
                    the commander of the Swiss, was absent, and the captains were left without
                    orders, whilst, in consequence of the death of Mandat, the national guard had no
                    leader. About nine o’clock the outer gates were forced, and the insurgents
                    formed their line in front of the palace. A bloody combat now commenced, chiefly
                    between the Marseillois and the Swiss. But after a brave resistance of about an
                    hour, the latter were overpowered by numbers, and gave way. All those found in
                    the palace were massacred, some even whilst imploring quarteron their knees; but
                    others escaped into the city, and were protected by individuals. Of this brave
                    regiment only two hundred survived; but every human being, including even the
                    lowest domestics, found within the palace, was put to death. Those of the Swiss
                    who had been made prisoners in various quarters were conducted to the door of
                    the assembly, and, by a decree, taken under the protection of the state; but the
                    sanguinary multitude insisted upon putting<pb break="no" facs="nls:193514864"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4864-0069"/> them to instant death; and the assembly would, in
                    all probability, have been unable to protect them, had not the Marseillois
                    generously interfered in their favour.</p>
                <p>The suspension of the royal authority was now decreed, and the nation invited to
                    elect a convention to determine the nature of its future government. On this
                    occasion all Frenchmen of twenty-one years of age were declared capable of
                    electing, and of being elected, deputies to the new National Convention. The
                    same evening commissioners were dispatched to give to the armies a favourable
                    account of the transactions which had just taken place. The royal family were
                    sent to the old palace of the Temple, there to remain under a strict guard; and
                    all persons of rank who had been attached to them were seized and committed to
                    different prisons.</p>
                <p>As an instance of the temper by which the people of Paris were at this time
                    actuated, it is proper to mention, that at the very moment when the multitude
                    were massacring the menial servants in the palace, and could scarcely be
                    restrained from offering violence to the Swiss who had been made prisoners, they
                    would not suffer an act of pillage to pass unpunished; and several attempts of
                    the kind were instantly followed by the death of the offenders. The plate,
                    jewels, and money found in the Tuilleries were brought to the National Assembly,
                    and thrown down in the hall; and one man, whose dress and appearance bespoke
                    extreme poverty, cast upon the table a hat full of gold. But the minds of those
                    men were elevated by enthusiasm; and they conceived themselves at the moment the
                    champions of freedom, and objects of terror to the kings of the earth.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the situation of France had become extremely critical, and it
                    appeared doubtful if the new Convention would ever be suffered to assemble.
                    Lafayette having accidentally got early notice of the events of the tenth of
                    August, advised the magistrates of the town of Sedan to imprison the
                    commissioners of the National Assembly as soon as they should arrive there; and
                    this was accordingly done. He at the same time published an address to the army,
                    calling upon them to support the king and the constitution; but finding that
                    they were not to be depended upon, he left the camp in the night of the 19th
                    August, accompanied only by his staff and a few sen-ants. The party took the
                    route of Rochefort in Liège, which was a neutral country; but having been met by
                    a small body of the enemy, they were made prisoners, and Lafayette was detained
                    for several years in close confinement. The severe treatment of this weak but
                    well-meaning man was a great error in policy upon the part of the allies. His
                    fidelity to the king and the constitution is now generally admitted; and though
                    some have entertained strong suspicions of his conduct towards that unfortunate
                    monarch, and in the British House of Commons he was even stigmatized as an
                    abandoned ruffian, it is certain that he was actuated by the purest motives, and
                    would have saved the king if it had been in his power to do so. His errors, in
                    fact, were those of the head rather than of the heart; he still fancied that he
                    could guide a revolution which he had had a share in originating, and seemed
                    altogether unconscious that the direction of the movement had passed into other
                    hands. But, however this may be, he should have been protected by the allies, if
                    for no other reason, at least to encourage desertion amongst the officers of the
                    republican army. The commissioners arrested at Sedan were soon afterwards set at
                    liberty, and received with applause by the army of Lafayette. General Arthur
                    Dillon at first entered into the sentiments of Lafayette; but Dumouriez diverted
                    him from his purpose, and thus regained his credit with the Jacobins, by whose
                    influence he was appointed commander-in-chief. The other generals, Biron,
                    Montesquieu, Kellerman, and Custines, offered no opposition to the will of the
                    National Assembly.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the combined armies of Austria and of Prussia had entered France. The
                    Duke of Brunswick’s army was above fifty thousand strong; and General Clairfayt
                    had joined him with fifteen thousand Austrians and a considerable body of
                    Hessians, besides twenty thousand French emigrants, amounting in all to near
                    ninety thousand men. To oppose these, Dumouriez had only seventeen thousand men
                    collected near the point from which the enemy were approaching in Luxembourg.
                    The French emigrants had given the Duke of Brunswick such an account of the
                    distracted state of the country, and of the alleged disaffection of all orders
                    of men towards the ruling faction in Paris, that no resistance of any importance
                    was expected by him; and, in fact, when the combined forces, consisting either
                    of steady Austrian or Hungarian battalions, or of well-trained Prussians, whom
                    Frederick had inured to the best discipline, were reviewed in Germany before
                    setting out on their march, the spectators, amongst whom the French cause was
                    not unpopular, beheld them with anxiety and regret, pitying the unhappy country
                    against which this irresistible force was to be directed. The officers and
                    soldiers considered themselves as departing for a hunting match, or an excursion
                    of pleasure; and many of the usual accommodations of an army were in consequence
                    but ill attended to. The commencement of their invasion of France justified
                    these expectations. Longwy surrendered after a siege of fifteen hours, although
                    well fortified, possessed of a garrison of near four thousand men, and defended
                    by seventy-one pieces of cannon.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The news of this event greatly irritated the assembly, who
                    decreed, that when the town was retakend, the houses of the citizens should be
                    razed to the ground: and, mistrustful of the officers of the army, they also
                    ordained that the municipal officers of a town should hereafter have power to
                    control the deliberations of the council of war.</p></note> Verdun was next
                    summoned, and the governor, Μ. Beaurepaire, compelled by the municipality to

                    disappointed and enraged, shot himself dead with a pistorl in presence of the
                    council; and on the 2nd of September the Prussian troops entered the
                    town.</p></note> The news of this second capture, and of the approach of the
                    Prussians, spread consternation throughout Paris; and it was proposed to raise a
                    volunteer army, which should set out immediately to meet the enemy. The
                    municipality, which was now led by Robespierre, Danton, Marat, and others of the
                    most sanguinary character, ordered the alarm guns to be fired, and enjoined the
                    populace to meet in the Champ de Mars to enroll themselves to march against the
                    enerriy. The people assembled, and, either in consequence of a premeditated
                    plan, or, which is not very probable, of an instantaneous movement, a number of
                    voices exclaimed, that the domestic foes of the nation should be destroyed
                    before its foreign enemies were attacked.</p>
                <p>Parties of armed men proceeded without delay to the prisons where the nonjuring
                    clergy, the Swiss officers, and those confined since the tenth of August on
                    account of alleged practices against the state, were detained in custody. They
                    took out the prisoners one by one, gave them a kind of mock trial before a jury
                    of their own number, acquitted some few, and murdered the remainder. Amongst
                    these was the Princess de Lamballe, who was taken from bed, dragged before this
                    bloody tribunal, and massacred; after which her head, stuck on a pike, was
                    carried by the populace to the Temple, that it might be seen by her <pb

                    These massacres continued two days and upwards of a thousand persons were put to
                    death. Ir all history, indeed, there is scarcely any thing to parallel them;
                    they were committed, it is believed, by less than three hundred men, in the
                    midst of an immense city, which heard of them with horror, and in the vicinity
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the National Assembly, which, by going in a body,
                    could have put an end to them. But such was the confusion and dismay which
                    prevailed during these two disgraceful days, that no man dared to stir from his
                    house; every one believed that the whole city, excepting his own street, was
                    involved in massacre and bloodshed. The national guards were all ready at their
                    respective posts, but no man directed them to act; and there is good reason to
                    suspect that Santerre and the chiefs of the commune connived at, if indeed they
                    were not actually implicated in, this atrocious butcher}'.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, General Dumouriez was occupied in taking measures to protract
                    the march of the enemy till the army of Kellerman, consisting of about twenty
                    thousand men, could arrive from Lorraine, and that of Bournonville, amounting to
                    thirteen thousand, from Flanders; together with whatever new levies Luckner
                    might be able to send from Chalons. The forest of Argonne, extending from north
                    to south upwards of forty miles, lay directly in the line of march of the Duke
                    of Brunswick, who had either to force his way through it, or to make a circuit
                    of forty miles by the pass of Grandpre on the north, or by Barleduc on the
                    south. The pass which lay most directly in his line of march was that of Biesme.
                    But after examining Dillon’s position at this point, the duke left a force of
                    twenty thousand men to observe it, and with the main body of his army took the
                    circuitous route by Grandpré on the north. Here Dumouriez waited to receive him,
                    and was attacked on the 12th and 13th without success; but on the 14th the
                    attack of the Prussians was irresistible, and Dumouriez abandoned his position.
                    On his retreat he was so closely pressed by the cavalry of the Prussian advanced
                    guard, that his army was seized with a panic, and fled before fifteen hundred
                    horse, who, if they had pushed their advantage, might have entirely dispersed
                    it. On the 15th, however, Dumouriez having encamped at St Menehould, began to
                    fortify his position, and Bournonville’s army joined him on the 17th. The Duke
                    of Brunswick now resolved to attack Kellerman before he could effect his
                    junction with Dumouriez; and, accordingly, on the 19th, when that officer had
                    arrived within a mile of the French camp, the projected attack took place. The
                    Prussians manoeuvred with their usual coolness and address; but in an attempt to
                    surround Kellerman’s army they were completely foiled, and, in the face of the
                    enemy, Kellerman joined Dumouriez at the close of the action. At the same time
                    that the army of Kellerman was attacked, an attempt was also made to force
                    Dillon’s camp at Biesme, by the twenty thousand men who had been left in its
                    vicinity; but the attempt failed, and this large detachment was thus prevented
                    from penetrating the forest of Argonne and joining the Duke of Brunswick. In
                    these engagements the French owed the advantage they obtained chiefly to the
                    superiority of their artillery; a circumstance which served to convince their
                    enemies that they had to contend with regular military bodies, and not, as they
                    expected, with undisciplined multitudes.</p>
                <p>The Duke of Brunswick now encamped his army at La Lun, near the position of
                    Dumouriez; and here the Prussians began to suffer extreme distress, both from
                    sickness and from famine. No temptation could induce the inhabitants of the
                    country to carry provisions to the hostile camp, whilst at the same time the
                    French army was abundantly supplied; whilst Bournonville, with a body of four
                    thousand men, had intercepted several herds of cattle and other convoys of
                    provisions destined for the Prussians. The rain fell in torrents, and the roads
                    were uncommonly deep. Exposed to cold and damp, and suffering from want of
                    provisions, the Prussians ate freely of the grapes of Champagne; in consequence
                    of which an epidemical distemper appeared, and spread through the army with such
                    rapidity, that ten thousand men were at one time unfit for duty. The Duke of
                    Brunswick, however, was still at the head of a force more numerous than that of
                    Dumouriez; and he has therefore been much censured for not attacking his
                    opponent, and forcing him to receive battle. It has been said that the numerous
                    and veteran force which he commanded would have marched to certain victory
                    against the raw troops who opposed them; and that, having defeated Dumouriez’s
                    army, there was nothing to oppose his march towards Paris. But the Duke of
                    Brunswick having entered France upon the supposition that in its present
                    distracted state no regular army could be brought into the field against him,
                    and that the people at large were hostile to the ruling faction, felt
                    disconcerted by discovering that he had been deceived, and that all his
                    expectations were disappointed. Instead of a friendly he found himself in the
                    midst of a hostile people; where he had expected to meet with nothing but
                    confusion, disorder, and weakness, he observed all enthusiastically united in
                    defence of their country; and, so far from encountering little or no resistance,
                    he saw before him armies, imperfectly disciplined, it is true, but hourly
                    increasing in numbers and improving in training, and at the same time conducted
                    by skilful military chiefs. In such a situation a defeat would have brought
                    certain ruin on his army; and even a victory might in its consequences have
                    proved equally fatal. Accordingly, after proposing a truce for eight days, which
                    was agreed to, he commenced his retreat towards Grandpré, and continued it
                    without molestation. Verdun was retaken by the French on the 12th of October,
                    and Longwy on the 18th; and the siege of Thionville, a small but strong fortress
                    under the command of General Wimpfen, was at the same time raised.</p>
                <p>Whilst the Prussians were advancing from the northeast, the Austrians under the
                    Duke of Saxe-Teschen laid siege to Lisle. To the summons of the besiegers the
                    council-general of the commune answered that they had just renewed their oath to
                    be faithful to the nation, and to maintain liberty and equality, or to die at
                    their post; and that they would not perjure themselves. The Austrian batteries
                    opened on the 29th, and were chiefly directed against that quarter of the town
                    which was inhabited by the lower class of citizens, in the hope, no doubt, of
                    exciting disturbance within. But this proceeding was exceedingly ill judged. The
                    lower classes of mankind are always accustomed to hardships, and hence they are
                    prepared to go much further in support of any principle which they may have
                    enthusiastically adopted, than those who have been accustomed to enjoy all the
                    comforts and luxuries of life. Accordingly, though a great part of the city was
                    reduced to a heap of ruins, the citizens of Lisle became daily more obstinate;
                    every vault and cellar was occupied; and although upwards of thirty thousand
                    red-hot balls and six thousand bombs were thrown into the city, not to mention
                    the effect produced by an immense battering train, yet the loss sustained by the
                    garrison and people did not exceed five hundred persons, most of whom were women
                    and children. After a fortnight of fruitless labour, the Austrians were
                    therefore obliged to raise the siege. Meanwhile war had been declared against
                    the king of Sardinia, whose conduct towards France had for some time assumed a
                    threatening character. On the 20th of September General Montesquieu entered the
                    territories of Savoy, and was received at Chambery, and throughout the whole
                    country, with marks of unbounded welcome; and on the 29th <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193514890" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4890-0071"/>General Anselm, with another
                    body of troops, took possession of Nice and the surrounding country. On the 30th
                    General Custines advanced to Spires, where, finding the Austrians drawn up in
                    order of battle, he attacked and drove them out of the city, taking three
                    thousand prisoners. The capture of Worms succeeded that of Spires; Mente
                    surrendered by capitulation; and Frankfort fell into the hands of the French on
                    -the 23d. Out of this last place, however, they were afterwards driven on the 2d
                    of December.</p>
                <p>On the 20th of September the French National Convention assembled. This body was
                    found to contain men of all ’characters, orders, and ranks. Many distinguished
                    members of the Constituent Assembly were returned as members, and several who
                    had belonged to the Legislative Assembly were also elected; whilst even
                    foreigners were invited to become French legislators. Thomas Paine and Dr
                    Priestley were elected by certain departments; and Clootz, whom we formerly
                    noticed as having appeared at the bar of the Constituent Assembly at the head of
                    a grotesque deputation professing to represent all the nations of the earth, was
                    also chosen. The general aspect of the new Convention showed that the republican
                    party had acquired a decided superiority. On the first day of meeting
                    Collot-d’Herbois, who had formerly been an actor, ascended the tribune, and
                    proposed the eternal abolition of royalty in France. This proposition was
                    carried by acclamation, after which the house adjourned. Messages were then sent
                    to all parts of the country intimating the decree, and through the influence of
                    the Jacobins these were everywhere received with applause. Next day it was
                    decreed that all public acts should be dated by the year of the French Republic;
                    and every citizen was declared eligible to vacant offices and places. Nor was
                    this all. The rage of republicanism soon proceeded so far that the ordinary
                    titles of Monsieur and Madame were abolished, and the appellation of Citizen
                    substituted in their stead, as more suitable to the principles of liberty and
                    equality.</p>
                <p>It was soon discovered that the leading republicans were divided into two
                    opposite factions. The one of these was called Girondists, because Vergniaud,
                    Gensonné, Guadet, and some others of its leaders, were members for the
                    department of the Gironde. The celebrated Condorcet also belonged to this party,
                    which was sometimes denominated Brissotine, from Brissot their principal leader.
                    The Girondists supported the ministry now in office, at the head of which was
                    Roland; and the majority of the Convention was obviously attached to them. In
                    opposition to these was the smaller party of the Mountain, so called from its
                    members usually sitting on the upper seats of the hall of the Convention. They
                    were men possessed of less personal respectability, and inferior literary
                    accomplishments, but of daring and sanguinary characters. At the head of this
                    party were Danton and Robespierre, and subordinate to these were Couthon,
                    Bazire, Thuriot, Merlin de Tbionville, Saint-André, Camille Demoulins, Chabot,
                    Collot-d’Herbois, Sergent, Legendre, Fabre d’Eglantine, Panis, Marat, and
                    others. These two parties evinced the diversity of their characters in the
                    manner in which they treated the massacres of the 2d and 3d of September. The
                    Brissotines, with the majority of the Convention, wished to bring the murderers
                    to trial; but the question was always eluded by the other party, with the
                    assistance of the Jacobin Club and of the populace.</p>
                <p>On the 9tb of October it was resolved that all emigrants, when taken in arms,
                    should suffer death; and on the 15th of November, in consequence of an
                    insurrection in the duchy of Deux Ponts, and an application for aid upon the
                    part of the insurgents, a decree was passed, declaring that “the National
                    Convention, acting in name of the</p>
                <p>French nation, would grant fraternity and assistance to all those people who
                    wished to procure liberty and charging the executive power to send orders to the
                    generals to give assistance to such people as had sufl’ered, or were still
                    suffering, in the cause of liberty. Of this decree foreign nations loudly
                    complained, as calculated, if not intended, to provoke insurrection in other
                    states; and in the rupture which subsequently took place between Great Britain
                    and France, it was founded on by the government of the former country as of
                    itself affording a sufficient justification of hostilities, and, in fact, as
                    rendering war with France a necessary measure of self-defence.</p>
                <p>But it is now time to return to the military affairs of the Republic. The final
                    retreat of the allies had left Dumouriez at liberty to carry into execution a
                    project he had long meditated, of invading the Low Countries, rescuing these
                    fine provinces from the Austrian dominion, and thus advancing the frontier of
                    the Republic to the Rhine. He received unlimited powers from the government, and
                    the losses sustained by the allies during their invasion of France gave him a
                    great superiority of force. His right wing consisted of sixteen thousand men,
                    detached from the Argonne Forest, whilst between it and the centre was placed
                    General d’Harville with fourteen thousand; Dumouriez himself commanded the main
                    body, amounting to forty thousand men; and the left wing, under Labourdonnaye,
                    was about thirty thousand strong; in all a hundred thousand men, filled with
                    enthusiasm, and anticipating nothing but victory. To oppose this immense force,
                    the Austrians had only about forty thousand men, who, according to the tactics
                    of the time, were disseminated along an extended line of nearly thirty miles.
                    Their main body, consisting of about eighteen thousand men, was entrenched in a
                    strong position, which had been deliberately chosen by the imperialists, and
                    extended through the villages of Ausmes and Jemmappes to the heights of
                    Ber-thaimont on the one hand, and the village of Sifly ∂n the other, sweeping
                    over a succession of eminences which commanded the adjacent plain; whilst
                    fourteen redoubts, strengthened by all the resources of art, and armed with a
                    hundred pieces of cannon, seemed amply to compensate for inferiority in point of
                    number. But formidable as this position undoubtedly was, Dumouriez resolved to
                    assault it, and to make trial of the new system of accumulating masses upon one
                    point, which, if thus forced, would necessitate the abandonment of the
                    whole.</p>
                <p>The battle commenced at day-break on the 6th of November, with an attack on the
                    village of Cuesmes, led by BournonviDe; but, after sustaining a severe fire of
                    artillery, which for some hours arrested his efforts, he at length succeeded in
                    turning the village of Jemmappes, and the redoubts on the left of the Austrian
                    position were carried by the impetuous onset of the French columns. Dumouriez
                    now caused his centre to advance against the front of Jemmappes, and the column
                    moved forward rapidly to the attack; but upon approaching the village, they were
                    taken in flank by some squadrons of horse, which broke through the column, and
                    drove back the French cavalry which supported it. The moment was eminently
                    critical; for whilst the flank of the column was thus maltreated, the leading
                    battalions, checked by a destructive fire of grape, were beginning to waver at
                    the foot of the redoubts. In this extremity, an attendant of the
                    general-in-chief rallied the disordered troops, and arrested the victorious
                    squadrons, whilst a young officer restored the front of the attack. Rallying the
                    disordered regiments into one mass, which he called the column of Jenm&gt;appes,
                    the latter placed himself at its head, renewed the attack on the redoubts,
                    carried the village, and at length drove the Austrians from their intrenchments
                    in the centre of the position<pb break="no" facs="nls:193514903"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4903-0072"/>.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This young officer was the Duke de Chartres, then called
                    General Egalité and now Louis Philippe, king of the French.</p></note> But
                    though thus victorious in the centre, Dumou. riez had still great cause for
                    anxiety respecting the attack on the right. Bournonville, though at first
                    successful on that side, had hesitated when he observed the confusion in the
                    column of the centre, vacillating between a reluctance to abandon the ground he
                    had gained, and a desire to withdraw part of his forces to support the column in
                    the plain. As soon as this hesitation was perceived by the enemy, they redoubled
                    their fire, and kept in hand a large body of cavalry ready to charge on the
                    least appearance of disorder. Ďumouriez flew to the spot, rode along the front
                    of two brigades of old soldiers from the camp at Maulde, and succeeded in
                    rallying the squadrons of horse, who were beginning to fall into confusion. The
                    imperial horse charged immediately after, but receiving a close and
                    well-directed volley, they wheeled, and, being instantly attacked by the French
                    cavalry, were completely routed, and driven from the field. The victorious
                    brigades now advanced, chanting the <hi rend="italic">Marseillaise,</hi> and
                    entering the redoubts by the gorge, carried every thing before them. Ďumouriez
                    was still uneasy about his centre; but whilst he was in the act of setting off
                    to that point with a reinforcement of six squadrons of cavalry, he received
                    intelligence that the battle there was already won, and that the Austrians were
                    retiring at all points towards Mons. Such was the battle of Jemmappes, the first
                    pitched battle which had been gained by the republican armies, and on that
                    account not only celebrated beyond its real merits, but most important in its
                    consequences. The loss on both sides was great, that of the Austrians amounting
                    to five thousand men, whilst the French lost above six thousand; but the results
                    of the victory upon the spirits and the moral strength of the two parties were
                    incalculably different, and in fact led to the immediate conquest of the whole
                    Netherlands. Mons and Brussels surrendered to Dumouriez; Tournay, Malines,
                    Ghent, and Antwerp, were taken possession of by General Labourdonnaye; Louvaine
                    and Namur submitted to General Valence; and the whole Austrian Netherlands,
                    Luxembourg only excepted, fell into the hands of the French. Liège was taken on
                    the 28th of November, after a successful engagement, in which the Austrians lost
                    five or six hundred men and an immense train of artillery.</p>
                <p>France was now in a situation not unusual in the history of nations, successful
                    abroad, but distracted by contending factions at home. The two parties in the
                    Convention were engaged in a struggle, which daily became more and more
                    implacable. The party called the Mountain did not hesitate to employ any means,
                    however criminal, to effect the ruin of their antagonists; and they are even
                    suspected of having, through the medium of the minister of war, retarded the
                    supplies for the armies, in order to render the ruling party odious from want of
                    success. But they were for some time unfortunate in this respect, and the daily
                    news of victories obtained supported the credit of the Girondists. A new subject
                    was therefore started, namely, how the dethroned monarch was to be disposed of.
                    The moderate party wished to save him, and this was a sufficient reason for
                    their antagonists resolving on his ruin. A committee was accordingly appointed
                    to report upon his conduct; and a variety of charges having in consequence been
                    brought against him, the Convention resolved to constitute itself at once
                    prosecutor and judge.</p>
                <p>On the 11th of December the ill-fated monarch was ordered to the bar of the
                    Convention; and when the act of accusation had been read, he was summoned by the
                    president Barrère to answer the charges separately. These Consisted of an
                    enumeration of the whole crimes of the</p>
                <p>Revolution, from its commencement in 1789, all of which were imputed to him. The
                    following is the substance of this extraordinary act of accusation :—</p>
                <p>“Louis, the French nation accuses you of having committed a multitude of crimes
                    to establish your tyranny, by destroying her freedom. You, on the 20th of June
                    1789, attacked the sovereignty of the people, by suspending the assemblies of
                    their representatives, and expelling them with violence from the places of their
                    sittings. This is proved in the procès-verbal entered at the tennis court of
                    Versailles by the members of the Constituent Assembly. On the 23d of June you
                    wanted to dictate laws to the nation; you surrounded their representatives with
                    troops; you presented to them two royal declarations, subversive of all liberty,
                    and ordered them to separate. You ordered an army to march against the citizens
                    of Paris. Your satellites have shed the blood of several of them, and you would
                    not remove this army till the taking of the Bastille and a general insurrection
                    announced to you that the people were victorious. The speeches you made on the
                    9th, 12th, and 14th of July, to the deputations of the Constituent Assembly,
                    show what were your intentions; and the massacres of the Tuilleries rise in
                    evidence against you. After these events, and in spite of the promises which you
                    made on the 15th in the Constituent Assembly, and on the 17th in the Hôtel de
                    Ville of Paris, you have persisted in your projects against national liberty.
                    You long eluded the execution of the decrees of the 11th of August, respecting
                    the abolition of personal servitude, the feudal government, and the tithes; you
                    long refused acknowledging the rights of man; you doubled the number of the
                    life-guards, and called the regiment of Flanders to Versailles; you permitted,
                    in orgies held before your eyes, the national cockade to be trampled under foot,
                    the white cockade to be hoisted, and the nation to be slandered. At last you
                    rendered necessary a fresh insurrection, occasioned the death of several
                    citizens, and did not change your language till after your guards had been
                    defeated, when you renewed your perfidious promises. You took an oath at the
                    confederation of the 14th of July, which you did not keep. You soon tried to
                    corrupt the public opinion, with the assistance of Talon, who acted in Paris,
                    and Mirabeau, who was to have excited counter revolutionary movements in the
                    provinces. You lavished millions of money to effect this corruption, and you
                    even used your popularity as a means of enslaving the people. These facts are
                    the result of a memorial of Talon, on which you have made your marginal comments
                    in your own handwriting; and of a letter which Laporte wrote to you on the 19th
                    of April, in which, recapitulating a conversation he had had with Rivarol, he
                    told you, that the millions which you had been prevailed upon to throw away had
                    been productive of nothing.</p>
                <p>“For a long time you had meditated on a plan of escape. A memorial was delivered
                    to you on the 28th of February, which pointed out the means for you to effect
                    it; you approved of it by marginal notes. On the 28th a great number of the
                    nobles and military came into your apartments in the castle of the Tuilleries,
                    to favour that escape. You wanted to quit Paris on the 10th of April, to go to
                    St Cloud; but the resistance of the citizens made you sensible that their
                    distrust was great. You endeavoured to discredit it, by communicating to the
                    Constituent Assembly a letter, which you addressed to the agents of the nation
                    near foreign powers, to announce to them that you had freely accepted the
                    constitutional articles, which had been presented to you; and, notwithstanding,
                    on the 21st you took flight with a false passport. You left behind a protest
                    against these self-same constitutional articles; you ordered<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193514916" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4916-0073"/> the ministers to sign none
                    of the acts issued by the National Assembly; and you forbade the minister of
                    justice to deliver up the seals of state. The public money was lavished to
                    ensure the success of this treachery; and the public force was employed to
                    protect it, under the orders of Bouille, who shortly before had been charged
                    with the massacre of Nancy, and to whom you wrote on this head, ‘ to take care
                    of his popularity, because it would be of service to you.’</p>
                <p>“After your detention at Varennes, the exercise of the executive power was for a
                    moment suspended in your hands, and you again formed a conspiracy. On the 17th
                    of July the blood of citizens was shed in the Champ de Mars. A letter, in your
                    own handwriting, written in 1790 to Lafayette, proves that a criminal coalition
                    subsisted between you and Lafayette, to which Mirabeau had acceded. The revision
                    began under these cruel auspices; all kinds of corruptions were made use of. You
                    have paid for libels, pamphlets, and newspapers, designed to corrupt public
                    opinion, to discredit the assignats, and to support the cause of the emigrants.
                    You seemed to accept the constitution on the 14th of September; your speeches
                    announced an intention of supporting it; and you were busy in overturning it,
                    even before it was completed. A convention was entered into at Pilnitz on the
                    24th of July, between Leopold of Austria and Frederic-William of Brandenburg,
                    who pledged themselves to re-erect in France the throne of absolute monarchy;
                    and you were silent upon this convention till the moment when it was known by
                    all Europe. Arles had hoisted the standard of rebellion; you favoured it by
                    sending three civil commissaries, who made it their business not to repress the
                    counter revolutionists, but to justify their proceedings. Avignon, and the
                    county of Venaissin, had been united with France; you caused the decree to be
                    executed; but a month afterwards civil war desolated that part of the country.
                    The commissaries you sent thither helped to ravage it. Nismes, Montauban, Mende,
                    Jales, felt great shocks during the first days of freedom. You did nothing to
                    stifle those germs of counter revolution, until the moment when Saillant’s
                    conspiracy became notorious. You sent twenty-two battalions against the
                    Marseillais, who marched to reduce the counter revolutionists of Arles. You gave
                    the southern command to Wittgenstein, who wrote to you on the 21st of April
                    1792, after he had been recalled: ‘ A few instants more, and I shall call around
                    the throne of your majesty thousands of French, who are again become worthy of
                    the wishes you form for their happiness.’ You paid your late life-guards at
                    Coblentz; the registers of Septeuil attest this; and general orders signed by
                    you prove that you sent considerable remittances to Bouille, Rochefort,
                    Vauguyon, Choiseul, Beaupre, Hamilton, and the wife of Polignac. Your brothers,
                    enemies to the state, caused the emigrants to rally under their banners; they
                    raised regiments, contracted for loans, and concluded alliances in your name;
                    you did not disclaim them. The soldiers of the line, who were to be put on the
                    war establishment, consisted of only a hundred thousand men at the end of
                    December; vou therefore neglected to provide for the safety of the state from
                    abroad. Narbonne required a levy ol fifty thousand men; but he stopped the
                    recruiting at twenty-six thousand, giving assurances that all was ready; yet
                    there was no truth in these assurances. Servan proposed after him to form a camp
                    of twenty thousand men near Paris; it was decreed by the Legislative Assembly,
                    but you refused your sanction. A spirit of patriotism made the citizens repair
                    to Paris from all quarters. You issued a proclamation, tending t <hi
                    rend="subscript"> o</hi> stop their march; at the same time our camps were
                    without soldiers. Dumouriez, the successor of Servan, declared that the nation
                    had neither arms, nor ammunition, nor provisions, and that the posts were left
                    defenceless. You waited to be urεed by a request made to the minister Ląįard,
                    when the Legislative Assembly wished to point out the means of providing for the
                    external safety of the state, by proposing the levy of forty-two battalions. You
                    gave commission to the commanders of the troops to disband the army, to force
                    whole regiments to desert, to make them pass the Rhine, and to put them at the
                    disposal of your brothers, and of Leopold of Austria, with whom you had
                    intelligence. You charged your diplomatic agents to favour this coalition of
                    foreign powers and your brothers against France, and especially to cement the
                    peace between Turkey and Austria, and to procure thereby a larger number of
                    troops against France from the latter. The Prussians advanced against our
                    frontiers: your minister was summoned on the 8th of July to give an account of
                    the state of our political relations with Prussia; you answered, on the 10th,
                    that fifty thousand Prussians were marching against us, and that you gave notice
                    to the legislative body of the formal acts of the pending hostilities, in
                    conformity to the constitution. You intrusted Da-bancourt, the nephew of
                    Calonne, with the department of war; and such has been the success of your
                    conspiracy, that the posts of Longwy and Verdun were surrendered to the enemy at
                    the moment of their appearance. You have destroyed our navy; a vast number of
                    officers belonging to that corps had emigrated; there scarcely remained any to
                    do duty in the harbours: meanwhile Bertrand was granting passports every day;
                    and when the legislative body represented to you his criminal conduct on the 8th
                    of March, you answered that you were satisfied with his services.</p>
                <p>“You have favoured the maintenance of absolute government in the colonies; your
                    agents fomented troubles and counter revolutions throughout them, which took
                    place at the same epoch when it was to have been brought about in France, which
                    indicates plainly that your hand laid this plot. The interior of the state was
                    convulsed by fanatics; you avowed yourself their protector, in manifesting your
                    evident intention of recovering by them your ancient power. The legislative body
                    had passed a decree on the 29th of January, against the factious priests; you
                    suspended its execution. The troubles had increased; the minister declared that
                    he knew nothing in the laws extant upon which to arraign the guilty. The
                    legislative body enacted a fresh decree, which you likewise suspended. The
                    uncitizen-like conduct of the guards whom the constitution had granted you had
                    rendered it necessary to disband them; the day after, you sent them a letter
                    expressive of your satisfaction, and continued their pay. You kept near your
                    person the Swiss guards; the constitution forbade you this, and the Legislative
                    Assembly had expressly ordained their departure. You had private companies at
                    Paris, charged to operate movements useful to your projects of a counter
                    revolution. You wished to suborn, with considerable sums, several members of the
                    Legislative and Constituent Assemblies. You suffered the French name to be
                    reviled in Germany, Italy, and Spain, since you omitted to demand satisfaction
                    for the bad treatment which the French suffered in those countries. You reviewed
                    the Swiss on the tenth of August, at five o’clock in the morning; and the Swiss
                    were die first who fired upon the citizens. You authorized Septeuil to carry on
                    a considerable trade in corn, sugar, and coffee, at Hamburg.” It was asked, “Why
                    did you affix a veto on the decree which ordained the formation of a camp of
                    twenty thousand men <hi rend="italic">ĩ*</hi> To which Louis answered, “The
                    constitution left to me the free right of refusing my sanction of the decrees;
                    and even from that period I had demanded the assemblage of a camp at
                    Soissons.”</p>
                <p>Valazé, who sat near the bar, now presented and read a memoir of Laporte and
                    Mirabeau, and some other papers, containing plans of a counter revolution, which
                    the king, however, disowned. He then presented a number of other papers on which
                    the act of accusation was founded, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514929"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4929-0074"/>having asked the king it he recognized them, the
                    latter re- ∣ plied that he did not. By the admission even of his enemies, ' the
                    answers of Louis were brief, firm, and for the most 1 part judicious; he
                    displayed remarkable presence of mind, and in most cases negatived the charges
                    by the most satis- 1 factory replies. The affair of Nancy, the journey to Va-ι
                    rennes, the suppression of the revolt in the Champ de Mars, were justified by
                    the decrees of the assembly; and the catastrophe of the tenth of March, by the
                    power of self-defence conferred on him by the laws. To every question, in fact,
                    he replied with clearness and precision; denying some, showing that the matters
                    referred to in others were the work of his ministers, and justifying all that
                    had been done by the powers conferred on him by the constitution. In a loud
                    Voice he repelled the charge of shedding the blood of the people on the tenth of
                    August, exclaiming, “No, sir, it was not I who did it.” But he was careful in
                    his answers not to implicate any members of the Constituent and Legislative
                    Assemblies; and many who now sat as his judges trembled lest he should
                    compromise them with the dominant faction. The deep impression made on the
                    Convention by the simple statements, and temperate but firm demeanour, of the
                    sovereign, struck the Jacobins with such dismay that the most violent of the
                    party proposed he should be hanged that very night. But the majority, composed
                    of the Girondists and the neutrals, decided that he should be formally tried and
                    defended by counsel. He then returned to the Temple, where the resolution of the
                    municipality, that he was no longer to be permitted to see his family, was
                    communicated to him; or, in other words, that a consolation, which is never
                    withheld even from the most atrocious criminals, was denied him. Next day,
                    however, the Convention, less inhuman than the commune, decreed that the
                    unfortunate father might enjoy the society of his children; but the king
                    thinking them more necessary to the queen’s comfort than his own, declined to
                    take them from her, and, after a struggle with feelings which even demons might
                    have respected, he submitted to the separation with a resignation which nothing
                    could shake.</p>
                <p>Louis had desired to be furnished with copies of the accusation, and of the
                    papers upon which it was founded; and also to have the choice of his own
                    counsel. Both requests were conceded, and he accordingly chose as his counsel Μ.
                    Tronchet and Μ. Target. The former accepted, and faithfully discharged his
                    duty;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Napoleon knew how
                    to admire heroism, even when exerted in another cause, and regarded it as the
                    noblest title to preferment. One of his first acts, on attaining to sovereign
                    power, was to place 'l’ronchet at the head of the supreme court of
                    Cassation.</p></note> the latter basely declined, on the pretence of age and
                    infirmity. The venerable Malesherbes, whose official career had been
                    distinguished by many wise and useful reforms, now came forward and volunteered
                    his services as counsel for his sovereign. “I have been twice honoured,” said
                    he, in a letter to the president of the Convention, “with a place in the
                    counsels of my sovereign, when it was an object of ambition to all the world; I
                    owe him the same service when it imposes a duty which many consider as
                    dangerous.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This
                    generous offer drew tears from the eyes of many in the Convention, and even the
                    Jacobins were silent; for a moment their humanity was in the ascendant. As to
                    the poor king, he was deeply affected by this proof of devotion on the part of
                    his venerable friend, when the latter entered the Temple, Louis clasped him in
                    his arms, exclaiming, with tears in his eyes, “Ah! it is you, my friend. You see
                    to what a state I am reduced by the excess of my affection for my people, and
                    the self-denial which ied me to remove the troops intended to protect the throne
                    from the enterprises of the factions.’ You fear not to endanger your own life to
                    save mine; but it is in vain; I am well aware they will bring me to the
                    scaffold; but that is of no moment; let us enter upon the defence as if I were
                    sure to be successful. I wUl gain it in reality through your exertions, since my
                    memory will descend unspotted to posterity.” (LacreteUe, χ. 18G, 193; Hue, p.
                    42; Mignet, i. 236; Thiers, iii. 336; Alison, i.^S13.)</p></note> Malesherbes
                    and Tronchet afterwards called in the assistance of Μ. Desèze, a celebrated
                    pleader, who had at first embraced the popular side, but had withdrawn from
                    political life since the Revolution had assumed a sombre and threatening aspect;
                    and, unlike Target, who shrunk from a task which would have immorta- ' lized his
                    name, he entered upon his arduous duties with great earnestness, and even more
                    than his wonted ability. “I have often wished,” said the king to Malesherbes, “I
                    had the means of recompensing the zeal of your colleagues. I have thought of
                    leaving them a legacy; but would it be respected by the Convention? would it not
                    endanger them ?” “Sire,” replied Malesherbes, <hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi>
                    the legacy is already bequeathed; in choosing them for your defenders, your
                    majesty has immortalized their names.”</p>
                <p>On the 26th of December the king was again conducted to the assembly. He evinced
                    as great serenity and self-possession as on the former occasion; discoursed of
                    Seneca, Livy, and the public hospitals; and even addressed himself in a vein of
                    pleasantry to one of the municipality who sat covered in the carriage. Whilst in
                    the ante-chamber, Malesherbes, in conversing with the king, happened to make use
                    of the words, “Sire, your majesty.” “What,” exclaimed Treilhard, a furious
                    Jacobin, interrupting him, “what has rendered you so bold as to pronounce these
                    words, which the Convention has proscribed?” “Contempt of life,” replied the
                    intrepid old man. W ’ hen admitted into the assembly, Louis seated himself
                    between his counsel, surveyed the crowded benches of his adversaries with
                    perfect com]xβure, and was even observed sometimes to smile as he conversed with
                    Malesherbes. Μ. Desèze then read a defence which had been prepared by the king’s
                    counsel, and which was equally admired for the solidity of the argument and the
                    beauty of the composition. In this address, the inviolability of the sovereign
                    was ably argued; and it was proved that, if it were destroyed, the weaker party
                    in the Convention would have no security against the stronger; a prophetic
                    deduction, which the Girondists soon found fatally verified in their own
                    persons, when conducted to the scaffold by their implacable enemies. The
                    advocate then examined the whole life of the king, and showed that in every
                    instance he had been actuated by a sincere love of his people. With reference to
                    the tenth of August he observed, “Was the monarch under the necessity of
                    submitting to an armed multitude? Was he constrained by law to yield to force?
                    Was not the power which he held in the constitution a deposit, for the
                    preservation of which he was answerable to the nation? If you yourselves were
                    surrounded by a furious and misguided rabble, which threatened, without respect
                    for your sacred character, to tear you from this sanctuary, what could you do
                    other than what he has done? The magistrates themselves authorized all that he
                    did, by having signed the order to repel force by force. But notwithstanding
                    their sanction, the king was unwilling to make use of his authority, and retired
                    into the bosom of the Convention, to avoid the shedding of blood. The combat
                    which followed was neither undertaken by him, nor continued by his orders; he
                    interfered only to put a stop to it, as is proved by the fact that it was in
                    consequence of an order signed by him that the Swiss abandoned the defence of
                    the Chateau, and surrendered their lives. There is a crying injustice therefore
                    in reproaching him with the blood shed on the tenth of August; in truth, his
                    conduct in that particular is above reproach.” Μ. Desèze concluded with these
                    words: “Louis mounted the throne at the age of twenty, and even then he set an
                    example of an irreproachable life; he was governed by no weak or corrupt
                    passion; he was <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514942" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4942-0075"
                    />economical, juβt, and severe. He proved himself from the beginning the friend
                    of his country. The people desired the removal of a destructive tax; he removed
                    it. They wished the abolition of servitude; he abolished it in his domains. They
                    prayed for a reform in the criminal laws; he reformed it. They demanded that
                    thousands of Frenchmen, whom the rigour of our usages had excluded from
                    political rights, should enjoy them; he conceded them. They longed tor liberty;
                    he gave it. He even anticipated their wishes; and yet it i&gt; the same people
                    who now demand his punishment."</p>
                <p>When the defence was concluded, the king rose, and holding a paper in his hand,
                    pronounced, in a calm manner, and with a firm voice, what follows: “Citizens,
                    you have heard my defence, I will not recapitulate it; but when now addressing
                    you, perhaps for the last time, I declare that my conscience has nothing to
                    reproach itself with, and that my defenders have said nothing but the truth. I
                    have no fears for the public examination of my conduct; but my heart bleeds at
                    the accusation brought against me of having caused the misfortunes of my people,
                    and, most of all, of having shed their blood on the tenth of August. The
                    multiplied proofs I have given in every period of my reign, of my love for my
                    people, and the manner in which I have conducted myself towards them, might, I
                    had hoped, have saved me from so cruel an imputation.” Having said these words,
                    he withdrew along with his counsel, and in a tran-sļ×xt of gratitude he embraced
                    Μ. Desèze, exclaiming, “I am now at ease; I will have an honoured memory; the
                    French will regret my death.”</p>
                <p>A stormy discussion immediately ensued in the assembly, and Lanjuinuis had the
                    boldness to demand a revocation of die decree by which the king had been brought
                    to the l&gt;ar of the Convention. “If you insist on being judges,” said he, in
                    concluding a j×&gt;werful speech, “cease to be accusers. My blood boils at the
                    thought of seeing in the judgment-scat men who openly conspired against the
                    throne on the tenth of August, and who have in such ferocious terms anticipated
                    the judgment without hearing the defence.” The delivery of diese words was
                    instantly followed by the mo« violent agitation; and cries of “To the Abbaye
                    with the peijured deputy; let the friends of the tyrant perish along with him,”
                    resounded dirough the hall. But the storm was at length appeased by a proposal
                    to discuss the question, whether an appeal should be made to the people; a
                    proposal which was adopted, and the discussion that thereupon ensued lasted
                    twenty days. The most powerful declaimer against the sovereign was the infamous
                    Saint-Just; the most vehement and direct, the sanguinary Robespierre. Vergniaud
                    replied in a strain of impassioned eloquence worthy of his reputation as die
                    first orator of France. But his forcible, nay sublime, appeal wus unavailing. At
                    the conclusion of the debate die assembly unanimously pronounced the ill-fated
                    Louis guilty of the offences charged against him. and the appeal to the people
                    was rejected by a majority of 4⅛3 to si81.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Eight members were absent from bad health; thirty-seven
                    declared Louis guilty, but voted only for precautionary measures; six hundred
                    and eighty-three declared him guilty. ( Thiers, iii. 377∙)</p></note> This
                    unanimous vote upon the question of guilt is one of the most remarkable facts in
                    the history of the Revolution. That among seven hundred men great difference of
                    opinion must have existed on this subject, is beyond all doubt; and if any
                    evidence were wanting to establish the fact, it would be supplied by the
                    division which immediately followed on the proposal to appeal to the people, and
                    by the narrow majority which decreed the punishment of death. But sufch was the
                    temper of the time, and the ascendency of democratic influence in the
                    Convention, that even the friends of the king were compelled to commence their
                    efforts for his salvation by voting him guilty of the crimes which had been
                    charged against him.</p>
                <p>The only question which now remained to be decided was, what punishment should be
                    inflicted. The debate on this subject lasted forty hours, during which Paris was
                    in the most violent agitation. The Jacobin Club resounded with cries for death;
                    the avenues leading to the Convention were filled with a ferocious rabble,
                    menacing alike the supporters of the king and the neutrals; and as the
                    termination of the voting drew near, the tumult increased. The most breathless
                    anxiety pervaded the Convention, when the president, Vergniaud, at length rose
                    to announce the result, which he did in these words: “Citizens, I announce the
                    result of the vote; when justice has spoken, humanity should resume its place;
                    there are seven hundred and twenty-one votes; a majority of twenty-six have
                    voted for death. In the name of the Convention, I declare that the punishment of
                    Louis Capet is <hi rend="italic">death?</hi> Without the defection of the
                    Girondists on this occasion, the king’s life would have been saved. Forty-six of
                    their party, including Vergniaud, voted conditionally or unconditionally for his
                    death. This was a fatal error, which almost all of them subsequently expiated on
                    the scaffold. They were really anxious to save the king; but, destitute of
                    political courage, and hurried on by the democratic fury of die times, they
                    trusted to accomplish their object by an appeal to the people. In this, however,
                    they were baffled; their weak and timid, policy ruined all. The triumph of the
                    Jacobins was complete. They had committed the Revolution by an act which cut off
                    all retreat; and they hail compelled their most able and dangerous enemies to
                    participate in the guilt of the bloody deed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Of thuse who voted for &lt;leath. there were many, such as
                    the i)uke of Orleans, influenced by base or selfish motives; and even at that
                    moment their characters were appreciated. When Egalité, with a faultering step,
                    and a countenance pale as a corpse, advanced to the place where he was to put
                    the seal to his infamy, and rea&lt;l in these terms his vote, “Exclusively

                    forth from alľsides, and he returned to his seat amidst the imprécations even of
                    the assassins of September, and all the wretches of every description who were
                    there assembled. But there were other persona of a very diilerent character;
                    many men, both great and good, who inclined with sorrow to the side of severity,
                    from an b&gt;&gt;nest opinion of ita absolute necessity to annihilate a
                    dangerous enemy, and establish the republic on a settled basis. Amongst thia
                    number was Carnot, who, wiιen called on for his vote, gave it in these words:
                    “Death, and never did word weigh so heavily on my heart." (Alison, i. 523;
                    Caraut, <hi rend="italic">ilinmra,</hi> p. S&gt;7 t <hi rend="italic">U'uMrc

                    113.)</p></note></p>
                <p>When the counsel of the unfortunate monarch were called in to hear the sentence,
                    they were greatly affected. Malesherbes attempted to speak, but emotion choked
                    his utterance. Desèze then read a protest, in which the king solemnly declared
                    his innocence; and Tronchet urged the revocation of a decree which had been
                    passed by so slender a majority. “You have either forgotten or destroyed,” said
                    this celebrated advocate, “the humane principle of the criminal law, which
                    requires a majority of two thirds to constitute a definitive sentence.” “The
                    laws,” it was answered, “are passed by a simple majority.” “True,” rejoined
                    Desèze, “but die laws may be repealed; and who can recall human life ?” The
                    Girondists, as a last resource, then proposed a limited delay; but in this they
                    also failed, and the fatal sentence was pronounced. This decisive step produced
                    an intense sensation in Paris. The members of die Coté Droit, and the royalists,
                    secret or avowed, were in equal consternation. But the Jacobins, who could <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193514955" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4955-0076"/> hardly believe
                    that so great a victory had been gained, re- ' doubled their activity, and put
                    every engine in motion to keep up an incessant agitation; they besought their
                    adherents to be vigilant for the next two days, and thus secure the fruits of so
                    mighty a triumph. Nor were their efforts and entreaties in vain. The’ greater
                    number were overawed and put to silence by the audacity of their movements;
                    whilst, by the resolute few, whose minds burned with indignation at their
                    conduct, nothing could be attempted.</p>
                <p>Louis was fully prepared for his fate. When Malesherbes, dissolved in tears, came
                    to announce the sentence of death, he found the unhappy king alone, with his
                    elbows resting on a table, his forehead leaning on his hands, and absorbed in
                    profound meditation. Without inquiring concerning his fate, Louis raised himself
                    as his friend approached, and observed to him, “For two hours I have been
                    revolving in my memory whether during my whole reign I have voluntarily given
                    any cause of complaint to my subjects; and with perfect sincerity I can declare,
                    when about to appear in the presence of God, that I deserve no reproach at their
                    hands, and that I have never formed a wish but for their happiness.” Malesherbes
                    encouraged him to hope that the sentence might yet be superseded. Louis shook
                    his head, and only entreated his friend not to leave him in his last moments.
                    Malesherbes promised to return, and repeatedly applied at the gate for
                    admission, which however was refused by order of the municipality. Louis often
                    asked for his aged friend, and was deeply afflicted at not seeing him again. He
                    received without emotion the official announcement of his sentence made by the
                    minister of justice on the 20th of January, and demanded a respite of three days
                    to prepare himself for death, and also to be allowed an interview with his
                    family, and to have the assistance of a confessor whom he named. The two last
                    requests were alone conceded by the Convention, and the execution was fixed for
                    the following morning at ten o’clock. The interview with his family presented a
                    heart-rending scene, which lasted nearly two hours, and may be more easily
                    imagined than described. When the terrible moment of separation arrived, Louis
                    promised to see them again on the morrow; and having embraced them all in the
                    tenderest manner, bade them a mournful adieu; but on entering his chamber he
                    felt that a second trial would be too much for all parties, and resolved to
                    spare them the agony of a final separation. This was his last struggle; he now
                    only thought of preparing for death. The remainder of the evening was therefore
                    spent with his confessor, the Abbé Edgeworth, who, with heroic devotion,
                    discharged the perilous duty of administering the last consolations of religion
                    to his dying sovereign. On the night which preceded his death, Louis slept
                    tranquilly until five in the morning, when he was awaked by Cléry, whom he had
                    ordered to call him at that hour. He then gave his last instructions to his
                    faithful attendant, and put into his hands the little property which he had at
                    his disposal, a ring, a seal, and a lock of hair. Already the drums were
                    beating, and the heavy roll of cannon dragged along the streets, interrupted at
                    intervals by a confused sound of voices, was also heard.</p>
                <p>About nine o’clock, Santerre arrived at the Temple. “You come to seek me,” said
                    the king; “allow me a minute.” He went into his closet, and immediately returned
                    with his testament in his hand, which he intrusted to a municipal officer; after
                    which he asked for his hat, and said with a firm voice, “Let us set off.” He
                    calmly seated himself in the carriage beside his confessor, and during the
                    passage from the Temple to the Place de la Revolution, which occupied two hours,
                    he never ceased reciting the psalms which were pointed out by his spiritual
                    guide. The route was lined with double files of soldiers; more than forty
                    thousand men were under arms; and the aspect of Paris was mournful. Amongst the
                    citizens who were present at the execution there reigned the most profound
                    silence, uninterrupted by any external manifestation either of approbation or
                    regret. When the procession arrived at the place of execution, he descended from
                    the carriage, ascended the scaffold with a firm step, and received on his knees
                    the sublime benediction of his confessor, “Son of St Louis, ascend to heaven.”
                    He suffered his hands to be bound, though not without repugnance, nor until
                    after Μ. Edgeworth had exclaimed, “Submit to that outrage, as the last
                    resemblance to the Saviour who is about to recompense your sufferings and
                    advancing quickly to the left of the scaffold, “I die innocent,” said he; “I
                    forgive my enemies, and you, unfortunate people....” At these words his voice
                    was drowned by the sound of drums placed at the front of the scaffold to prevent
                    his being heard; three executioners seized and hurried him to the block; and in
                    a few seconds he had ceased to live. One of the assistants grasped his head, and
                    waved it in the air, whilst the blood fell on the confessor, who was still on
                    his knees beside the mutilated body of his sovereign.</p>
                <p>Thus perished, in the thirty-ninth year of his age, and seventeenth of his reign,
                    one of the best but at the same time weakest of sovereigns. He inherited a
                    revolution from his ancestors, but he was better fitted than any of his
                    predecessors to prevent or to terminate it; for he was capable of being a
                    reforming king before it broke out, and of becoming a constitutional sovereign
                    under its influence. He was perhaps the only prince who had no passion, not even
                    that of power, and who united the two qualities most essential to a good king,
                    the fear of God and the love of his people. He perished the victim of passions
                    which he did not participate; of those of his supporters to which he was a
                    stranger, and those of the multitude, which he had not excited. Few kings have
                    left so spotless a memory, and history will say of him, that, with a little more
                    force of mind and decision of character, he would have bequeathed to posterity a
                    name unique among princes. Such, in the opinion of the ablest of the republican
                    writers of France,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    adorn a private station than to govern a great people at a period of unexampled
                    excitement; one whose virtues ought to have ensured him a different fate, and
                    whose misfortunes were the result of that long-continued misrule which he had
                    endeavoured to correct.</p>
                <p>In a political point of view, this tragical event proved ] injurious to the
                    republican cause throughout Europe. No' man out of France ventured to justify
                    it; and in all coun- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> tries it excited the most
                    violent indignation against the rulers of the French republic. Accordingly new
                    enemies now hastened to join the general league against France. It is
                    unnecessary here to enter into any detail of the political struggles which
                    occurred in other countries, particularly our own. It is sufficient to remark
                    generally, that at this time the British government thought itself endangered by
                    the propagation of those speculative opinions which had overturned the French
                    monarchy, and that almost all the men of property in the kingdom concurred with
                    the ministry in thinking a war with France necessary for the purpose of securing
                    the constitution, and checking the progress of levelling doctrines. After the
                    tenth of August the British minister had been recalled; but the Republic had
                    still suffered the ambassador of France, Μ. Chauvelin, to remain in England.</p>
                <p>The ostensible grounds of quarrel on the part of Great Britain were two; the
                    decree of the 15th of November 1792, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193514968"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4968-0077"/>by which it was considered that encouragement to
                    rebel- ' lion had been held out to the subjects of every state, and war thereby
                    waged against every established government; and the question relative to the
                    opening of the Scheldt. Of the decree the French executive council gave
                    explanations, denying the fairness of the interpretation put upon it, and
                    alleging that the intention of the Convention was only to give aid to such
                    countries as had already acquired their freedom, and by a declaration of the
                    general will requested aid for its perservation. But this explanation was not
                    admitted, inasmuch as the decree expressly says that the French nation will
                    “grant assistance to all who wish to procure liberty and, considering the
                    notions of liberty then entertained in France, it was not doubted that their
                    real intention was to excite rebellion in foreign nations. With regard to the
                    opening of the Scheldt, as this river runs from Brabant through the Dutch
                    territory to the sea, the Dutch had shut up its mouth, and thus prevented any
                    maritime commerce being carried on by the people of Brabant by means of the
                    river. To render themselves popular in Brabant, however, the French declared
                    that they would open the navigation of the Scheldt. But Great Britain having
                    some time previously become bound by treaty with the Dutch to assist them in
                    obstructing this navigation, now intimated to the French government that the
                    project of opening the Scheldt must be abandoned. The French, however, alleged
                    that by the law of nations navigable rivers ought to be open to all who reside
                    upon their banks; that nevertheless the point was of no importance either to
                    France or to England, and but of little importance even to Holland; and that if
                    the people of Brabant themselves chose to give it up, they would make no
                    objection. In the mean time the Dutch gave themselves no concern about the
                    matter. They did not even solicit the assistance of England; and the merchants,
                    when applied to individually, declared that if the Scheldt was opened, they
                    could conduct their commerce as well at Antwerp as at Amsterdam. But in all this
                    there is nothing remarkable. Amongst the Dutch there were many republicans, who
                    wished for the downfall of the stadtholder, and rejoiced at every thing which
                    distressed him, or had a tendency to render his office useless in the eyes of
                    the people; whilst others who thought differently were afraid to speak their
                    sentiments, as Dumouriez was in their neighbourhood at the head of a victorious
                    army. The result of the whole was, that the British government ordered Μ.
                    Chauvelin to quit this country. The French executive council accredited another
                    minister, Μ. Maret, who was also invested with powers to negotiate, and
                    requested that a passport might be given him; but he was not even suffered to
                    land. The republicans having thus far humbled themselves before the British
                    government, were fired with indignation at the manner in which their envoy was
                    treated; and on the 1st of February 1793 the National Convention, on the motion
                    of Brissot, decreed that George king of England had never ceased, since the
                    revolution of the tenth of August 1792, to give the French nation proofs of his
                    attachment to the concert of crowned heads; that he had drawn into the same
                    combination the stadtholder of the United Provinces; that, contrary to the
                    treaty of 1783, the English ministry had granted protection to the emigrants and
                    others who had openly appeared in arms against the French; that they had
                    committed an outrage against the French republic, by ordering the ambassador of
                    France to quit Great Britain; that the English had stopped different boats and
                    vessels laden with corn for France, whilst, at the same time, contrary to the
                    treaty of 1786, they continued the exportation of grain to other foreign
                    countries; and that, to thwart more efficaciously the commercial transactions of
                    the republic with England, they had by an act of parliament prohibited the
                    circulation of assignats. The Convention therefore declared, that in conseouence
                    of these acts of hostility and aggression, the French republic was at war with
                    the king of England and with the stadtholder of the United Provinces. The
                    absurdity of pretending that any treaty with France made in 1783 could be
                    violated by protecting the emigrants who fled from the vengeance of the
                    Convention, must be sufficiently obvious. The Convention itself was a usurpation
                    of the government with which that treaty had been concluded. On the other hand,
                    the prohibition of the assignats was certainly contrary to no law, and was
                    sanctioned by every motive of expediency, unless the Convention could prove that
                    all nations were bound by the law of nature to risk their own credit upon that
                    of the French republic. About a fortnight after this declaration appeared, war
                    was likewise declared against Spain; and in the course of the summer France was
                    in hostility with all Europe, excepting only Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, and
                    Turkey.</p>
                <p>In the mean time General Dumouriez, proceeding agreeably to his orders, made an
                    attack upon Holland; but in doing so he disseminated his troops in such a manner
                    as to expose himself to attack upon the side of Germany. He commanded General
                    Miranda to invest Maestricht, whilst he advanced to blockade Breda and
                    Bergen-op-Zoom. Breda, however, surrendered on the 24th of February, Klun-dert
                    was taken on the 26th, and Gertruydenberg yielded on the 4th of March. But here
                    the triumphs of Dumouriez ended. The sieges of Williamstadt and Bergen-op-Zoom,
                    though vigorously pressed, proved unsuccessful. On the 1st of March General
                    Clairfayt, having passed the Roer, attacked the French posts, and compelled them
                    to retreat with the loss of about two thousand men. The following day the
                    archduke attacked them anew with considerable success; and on the 3d the French
                    were driven from Aix-la-Chapelle, with the loss of four thousand men killed and
                    sixteen hundred taken prisoners. The siege of Maestricht was now raised, and the
                    French retreated to Tongres, where they were also attacked, and forced to
                    retreat to St Tron. Here Dumouriez joined them, but did not bring his army along
                    with him from Holland. After some skirmishes, a general engagement took place at
                    Neerwinden, and was contested on the part of the French with great obstinacy;
                    but they were at length overpowered by numbers, and forced to retreat. This
                    defeat had well nigh proved fatal to the republican arms. The French lost three
                    thousand men in the battle, and six thousand immediately afterwards deserted and
                    returned to their homes. Dumouriez continued to retreat, and on the 22d he was
                    again attacked near Louvain; but, through the medium of Colonel Mack, who
                    afterwards became so unenviably famous, he entered into an arrangement with the
                    imperialists that his retreat should not be seriously interrupted. It was also
                    fully agreed that whilst the imperialists took possession of Condé and
                    Valenciennes, he should march to Paris, dissolve the Convention, and place the
                    son of the late king upon the throne.</p>
                <p>The rapid retreat and successive defeats of General Dumouriez having rendered his
                    conduct suspicious, commissioners were sent by the executive government, for the
                    purpose of discovering and defeating his designs. The latter dissembled, and
                    pretended to communicate to him a scheme of a counter revolution. Dumouriez fell
                    into the snare which they had laid for him, and confessed his intention of
                    dissolving by force the Convention and the Jacobin Club, and restoring monarchy.
                    On the report of these commissioners the Convention sent Bournonville, the
                    minister of war, along with Camus, Blancal, Lamarque, and Quinette, as
                    commissioners, to supersede and arrest Dumouriez. The attempt on the part of
                    these functionaries to arrest a general in the midst of his army was certainly
                    hazardous; and in fact Dumouriez, on the first of April, sent them prisoners to
                    General Clairfayt’s head-quarters at Tournay, as hostages for the safety of the
                    royal family. He next attempted<pb break="no" facs="nls:193514981"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4981-0078"/> to seduce his army from their fidelity to the
                    Convention; but he speedily found that he had mistaken the character of his
                    troops. When the report reached them that their general was to be carried as a
                    criminal to Paris, they were seized with vehement indignation; but as soon as
                    they learned that an attempt was being made to prevail on them to turn their
                    arms against their country, their sentiments underwent a sudden alteration, and
                    resentment succeeded to the generous feeling of indignation which at first
                    prompted them to interpose in his behalf. On the 5th of April two proclamations
                    were issued, one by General Dumouriez, and the other by the Prince of
                    Saxe-Cobourg, declaring that their only purpose was to restore the constitution
                    of 1789, 1790, and 1791. The latter announced that the allied powers wished
                    merely to co-operate with General Dumouriez in giving to France a constitutional
                    king and the constitution which she had framed for herself; and he declared,
                    upon his word of honour, that he came not into the French territory for the
                    purpose of making conquests. On the same day Dumouriez went to the advanced
                    guard of his own camp at Maulde; but he there learned that the corps of
                    artillery had risen upon their general, and were marching to Valenciennes; and
                    he also found that the whole army were resolved to stand by their country. Seven
                    hundred cavalry and eight hundred infantry were all who deserted with Dumouriez
                    to the Austrians, and many of these afterwards returned.</p>
                <p>By the defection of Dumouriez, however, the army of the north was dissolved, and
                    in part disbanded, in presence of a numerous, well-disciplined, and victorious
                    enemy. The Prussians were at the same time advancing in immense force, and were
                    about to commence the siege of Mayence. In the interior of the Republic, evils
                    even more serious were threatened. In the departments of La Vendée and La Loire,
                    or the provinces of Bretagne and Poitou, immense multitudes of emigrants and
                    other royalists had gradually assembled in the course of the winter, professing
                    to act in the name of Monsieur, as regent of France; and about the middle of
                    March they advanced against Nantes to the number of about forty thousand. In the
                    beginning of April they defeated the republicans in two pitched battles,
                    possessed themselves of fifty leagues of country, and even threatened, by their
                    own efforts, to shake the republic to its very foundations. On the 8th of April
                    there assembled at Antwerp a congress of the combined powers, which was attended
                    by the Prince of Orange and his two sons, with his excellency Vander Spiegel, on
                    the part of Holland; by the Duke of York and Lord Auckland on the part of Great
                    Britain; and by the Prince of Saxe-Cobourg, Counts Metternich, Staremberg, and
                    Dargenteau, and the Prussian, Spanish, and Neapolitan envoys. In this congress
                    it was definitively determined to commence active operations against France; the
                    Prince of Cobourg⅛ proclamation was recalled, and a scheme of conquest
                    announced.</p>
                <p>Commissioners from the Convention now set up anew the standard of the republic,
                    and the scattered battalions flocked around it. General Dampierre was appointed
                    commander-in-chief, and on the 13th he was able to resist a general attack upon
                    his advanced posts. On the 14th his advanced guard yielded to superior numbers,
                    but on the 15th he was victorious in a long and well-fought battle. On the 23d
                    the Austrians were again repulsed, and on the 1st of May General Dampierre was
                    himself defeated in an attack upon the enemy. On the 8th another engagement took
                    place, in which the French general was killed by a cannon ball. On the 23d a
                    determined attack was made by the allies u∣&gt;on the fortified camp of Famars,
                    which covered the town of Valenciennes. The French made a very gallant
                    resistance, but were at length overcome, and in the night abandoned their camp.
                    By this victory the allies were enabled to commence the siege of Valenciennes;
                    Condé having been blockaded since the first of April. About the same time
                    General Custines on the Rhine made a vigorous but unsuccessful attack upon the
                    Prussians, and in consequence they were soon enabled to lay siege to Mayence. At
                    this period also the Corsican general Paoli revolted; and the Republic,
                    assaulted from without by the whole strength of Europe, was undermined by
                    treachery and faction within.</p>
                <p>Whilst the country was in a state verging upon utter ruin, the parties in the
                    Convention were gradually waxing fiercer and fiercer in their animosity; and,
                    regardless of what was passing at a distance, they seemed only anxious for the
                    extermination of each other. In the month of March the Revolutionary Tribunal
                    was established, for the purpose of trying crimes committed against the state;
                    and the Girondists, the mildness of whose administration had contributed not a
                    little to increase the evils of their country, began to see the necessity of
                    adopting measures of severity. But the public calamities, which now followed in
                    rapid succession, were ascribed by their countrymen to the imbecility or perfidy
                    of that party. This gave to the party of the Mountain a fatal advantage. On the
                    15th of April the communes of the forty-eight sections of Paris presented a
                    petition, requiring that the chiefs of the Girondists therein named should be
                    impeached and expelled from the Convention; and this was followed on the 1st of
                    May by another petition of the same description from the faubourg St Antoine. In
                    the mean time the Girondist party impeached Marat, but the miscreant was
                    acquitted by the jury. With the assistance of the Jacobin Club, the Mountain had
                    now acquired a complete ascendency over the city of Paris. The Girondists
                    therefore proposed to remove the Convention from the capital; and to prevent
                    this, the Mountain resolved to make the same use of the people of the capital
                    against the Girondist party which they had formerly done against the monarch on
                    the tenth of August. It is unnecessary to relate in detail all the tumults which
                    occurred either in Paris or in the Convention during the remaining part of the
                    month of May. On the 31st, at four o’clock in the morning, the tocsin was
                    sounded, the générale beat, and the alarm guns fired. All was commotion and
                    terror. The citizens flew to arms, and assembled round the Convention, where
                    some deputations demanded a decree of accusation against thirty-five of its
                    members. The day, however, passed without coming to a decision. On the afternoon
                    of the 1st of June an armed force made the same demand, which was repeated on
                    the 2d of June, when the tocsin again sounded, and an hundred pieces of cannon
                    surrounded the hall of the Convention. At length Barrère, who was considered as
                    a moderate man, and respected by both parties, mounted the tribune; but he now
                    artfully deserted the Girondists, and invited the denounced members voluntarily
                    to resign theiι character of representatives. Some of them complied, and the
                    president attempted to dissolve the sitting; but tht members now found
                    themselves prisoners in their own hall. There Henriot, commander of the armed
                    force, compelled them to remain; and the obnoxious deputies, amounting to
                    upwards of ninety in number, were put under arrest, and a decree of accusation
                    passed against them. It is very obvious that on this occasion the liberties of
                    France were trodden under foot. The minority of the national representatives,
                    with the assistance of an armed force raised in the capital, had compelled the
                    majority to submit to their measures, and taken the leading members prisoners.
                    The city of Paris thus assumed to itself the whole powers of the French
                    Republic; and the nation was no longer governed by representatives freely
                    chosen, but by a minority of the Convention of whose sentiments the city of
                    Paris and the Jacobin Club had thought proper to approve. The history of
                    nations, and, above all, of factions, is a mass of contradictions<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193514994" xml:id="kp-eb0710-4994-0079"/>. The mountain party came
                    into power by preaching boundless liberty, and by practically violating its
                    fundamental principles! How far the plea of political necessity may serve to
                    excuse their conduct, we shall not venture to decide. Certain it is that they
                    soon commenced, both at home and abroad, a career of the most terrible energy
                    which is to be found in the records of nations.</p>
                <p>The first result of their victory in the capital was calamitous to the Republic
                    at large. Brissot and some other deputies escaped, and endeavoured to kindle the
                    flames of civil war. In general, however, the influence of the Jacobin Club, and
                    of its various branches, was such, that the north of France adhered to the
                    Convention; but the southern departments were speedily in a state of rebellion.
                    The department of Lyons declared the Mountain party outlawed. Marseilles and
                    Toulon followed the example of Lyons, and entered into a confederacy, which has
                    since been known by the appellation of Federalism. The departments of La Gironde
                    and Calvados broke out into open insurrection. In a word, the whole of France
                    was in a state of violent convulsion. Still, however, the enthusiastic garrisons
                    of Mayence and Valenciennes protected it against the immediate entrance of a
                    foreign force, and afforded leisure for one of its internal factions to gain an
                    ascendency, and thereafter to protect its independence. In fact, the political
                    enthusiasm of all orders of persons was such, that even the female sex did not
                    escape its contagion. In the beginning of July a young woman of the name of
                    Charlotte Corday came from the department of Calvados to devote her life for
                    what she deemed the cause of freedom and her country. Having requested an
                    interview with Marat, the most obnoxious of the Mountain party, she at length
                    contrived to obtain it, and after conversing with him for some time, suddenly
                    plunged a dagger in his breast, and walked carelessly out of the house. But she
                    was immediately seized, condemned, and executed; behaving throughout with
                    infinite constancy, and with her last breath shouting Five <hi rend="italic">la
                    République.</hi> The party to which Marat was attached derived advantage from
                    the manner of his death, as it seemed to fasten the odious charge of
                    assassination upon their antagonists, and to give them the appearance of
                    suffering in the cause of liberty; though the real truth is, that assassination
                    was sanctioned by both parties, under pretence of defending the liberties of the
                    Republic.</p>
                <p>One of the first acts of the Mountain party after their triumph was to complete
                    the republican constitution. Previously to their fall, the Girondists had
                    brought forward the plan of a constitution, which was chiefly the work of
                    Condorcet; but it was never sanctioned by the Convention, and much too intricate
                    to be practically useful. The constitution now framed, which was afterwards
                    sanctioned by the nation, but never put in practice, abolished the former mode
                    of electing the representatives of the people through the medium of electoral
                    assemblies, and appointed them to be chosen immediately by the primary
                    assemblies, which were to consist of from two to six hundred citizens, whilst
                    each man was to give his suffrage by ballot or otherwise at his option. One
                    deputy was allowed for every forty thousand individuals, and population formed
                    the sole basis of representation. The elections were to take place every year on
                    the first of May. Electoral assembles were, however, retained. Every two hundred
                    citizens in the primary assemblies named one elector, and an assembly of all the
                    electors of the department was afterwards held, which chose candidates for the
                    executive council, or ministry of the Republic; and out of this list of
                    candidates the legislative body selected the members of the execut e cmucu. one
                    nan of tins council was to be renewed by each legislature in the last month of
                    the session. Every law, after being passed by the legislative body, was to be
                    sent to the department; and if in more than half of the departments the tenth of
                    the primary assemblies of each did not object to it, it became effectual. Trial
                    by jury was also established. National conventions might be called for altering
                    the constitution, and were to be summoned, if required, by the tenth of the
                    primary assemblies of each department in a majority of the departments. The
                    publication of this constitution secured no small degree of applause to the
                    Convention and the Mountain party. The rapidity with which it had been
                    framed<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This constitution
                    was only the work of a fortnight; a short space, no doubt, for so important an
                    undertaking.</p></note> seemed to cast a reflection upon the slowness of the
                    moderate party, and was regarded as a proof that its framers were decidedly
                    serious in the cause of republicanism. No regard, however, was paid to it by the
                    Convention, which declared itself permanent; nor indeed did it seem possible to
                    carry it into execution.</p>
                <p>We have mentioned that Condé was invested ever since the beginning of April; but
                    it did not yield till the 10th of July, when the garrison was so much reduced by
                    famine and disease, that out of four thousand men, of which it originally
                    consisted, only fifteen hundred were fit for service. The eyes of all Europe
                    were in the mean time fixed upon the siege of Valenciennes. Colonel Moncrieff
                    had contended tnat batteries ought to be placed immediately under the walls,
                    without approaching it by regular parallels; but the imperial engineer Ferraris
                    asserted that the work of the great Vauban must be treated with more respect,
                    and his opinion was adopted by the council of war. The trenches were opened on
                    the 14th of June. Few sallies were attempted by the garrison, on account of the
                    smallness of their number. The inhabitants at first wished to surrender; but the
                    violence of the bombardment prevented their assembling, or giving much trouble
                    to General Ferrand, the governor. The principal labour of the siege consisted of
                    mines and countermines, some of which having been successfully sprung by the
                    assailants, the town was surrendered by capitulation on the 27th of July, and
                    the Duke of York took possession of it in behalf of the emperor of Germany. The
                    siege of Mayence at the same time proceeded, and the place suffered much from
                    famine; but at last, after an unsuccessful attempt to raise the siege by the
                    French army of the Rhine, it surrendered on the 22d of July.</p>
                <p>After the termination of the siege of Valenciennes the· allied powers became much
                    divided as to their future, proceedings. The Austrian commanders are understood
                    to have presented two plans; the one to penetrate to Paris by means of the
                    rivers which fall into the Seine;' the other to take advantage of the
                    consternation occasioned by the surrender of Valenciennes, and with fifty
                    thousand light troops to penetrate suddenly to Paris, whilst a descent should be
                    made on the coast of Bretagne to assist the royalists. The proposal of the
                    British ministry, however, to divide the grand army, and to attack West
                    Flanders, beginning with the siege of Dunkirk, was ultimately adopted; but this
                    determination proved ruinous to the allies, as the French found means to
                    vanquish in detail that army which they were unable to encounter when
                    united.</p>
                <p>It has been asserted that the Duke of York was in secret correspondence with
                    Omeron, the governor of Dunkirk; but the latter was removed before any advantage
                    could be taken of his treachery. On the 24th of August the Duke of York attacked
                    and drove into the town the French outposts, after an action in which the
                    Austrian general Dalton<pb break="no" facs="nls:193515007"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-5007-0080"/> was killed. A naval armament was expected from
                    Great Britain to co-operate in the siege, but it did not arrive in time to be of
                    any avail. Meanwhile a strong republican force menaced the covering army of the
                    allies, commanded by General Freytag; and, in point of fact, he was soon
                    afterwards attacked and totally routed, in consequence of which the siege was
                    raised. The British lost their heavy cannon and baggage, with several thousand
                    men; but the Convention, lκ&gt;Reving that their general, Houchard, might have
                    cut off the Duke of York’s retreat, tried and executed him for this alleged
                    neglect of duty. In the mean time the Prince of Saxe-Cobourg and General
                    Clairfayt unsuccessfully attempted to besiege Cambray and Bouchain. Quesnoy was,
                    however, taken by General Clairfayt on the 11th of September; and here
                    terminated the success of the allies in the Netherlands during the present
                    campaign.</p>
                <p>A considerable part of the French army of the north having taken a strong
                    position near Maubeuge, were there blockaded by Prince Cobourg; but upon the
                    15th and 16th of October the latter was repeatedly attacked by the French troops
                    under General Jourdan, who had succeeded Houchard in the command. The French
                    having now recovered their vigour, brought into the field a formidable train of
                    artillery; and commissioners from the Convention harangued the soldiers,
                    threatening the timid and applauding the brave. The attacks were repeated and
                    furious, and the Austrians had the disadvantage, in consequence of which the
                    Prince of Saxe-Cobourg retired during the night. The French now menaced maritime
                    Flanders, took Fumes, and besieged Nieuport. But a detachment of British troops
                    ready to sail to the West Indies were hastily sent to Ostend, and for the
                    present prevented the further progress of the French.</p>
                <p>The multiplicity of the events which now occurred in France was so great, that it
                    is difficult to give an outline of these with tolerable perspicuity. It has been
                    already mentioned that violent dissensions occurred throughout the Republic, in
                    consequence of the triumph of the Mountain party on the 31st of May. The
                    department of Calvados was first in arms against the Convention, under the
                    command of General Wimpfen; but before the end of July the insurrection had been
                    subdued. The federalism of the cities of Marseilles, Lyons, and Toulon, however,
                    still remained. On the 8th of August Lyons was attacked by the Conventional
                    troops; and several actions followed, which were attended with great loss both
                    on the part of the assailants and of the besieged. The city in fact was reduced
                    almost to ruins; but it held out during the whole month of September. The
                    besieging general, Kellerman, was removed from his command on account of his
                    supposed inactivity; and the city surrendered on the 8th of October to General
                    Doppet, a man who had lately been a physician. The walls and public buildings of
                    Lyons were ordered to be destroyed, and its name changed to that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ville</hi><hi rend="italic">Affranchie;</hi> many hundreds of its
                    citizens were dragged to the scaffold on account of their alleged treasonable
                    resistance to the Convention; and the victorious party, weary of the slow
                    operation of the guillotine, at last destroyed their prisoners in multitudes, by
                    discharges of grape-shot. With the party of the Mountain terror was now the
                    order of the day. In the end of July General Carteaux was sent against
                    Marseilles. In the beginning of August he gained some successes over the
                    advanced guard of the federalist troops; and on the 24th he took the town of
                    Aix, upon which the Mar-sellois submitted. But the leading persons of the
                    important town of Toulon, one of the first naval stations in France, entered
                    into a negotiation, which terminated in their submitting to the British admiral
                    Lord Hood, upon the conditions that he would preserve as a deposit the town and
                    shipping for Louis XVII. and assist in restoring the constitution of 1789. The
                    siege of Toulon was commenced by General Carteaux in the beginning of September;
                    and it continued without much vigour during that and the succeeding month,
                    Neapolitan, Spanish, and English troops having been brought by sea to assist in
                    its defence. But in the beginning of November, General Carteaux was removed to
                    the command of the army in Italy, and General Dugommier succeeded him in the
                    direction of the siege. General O’Hara also arrived with reinforcements from
                    Gibraltar, and assumed the command of the town, under a commission from his
                    Britannic majesty. Upon the 30th of November the garrison made a vigorous sally,
                    in order to destroy some batteries which were erecting upon heights that
                    commanded the city. The French were surprised, and the assailants effected their
                    object; but, elated with this success, the troops rushed onward in pursuit of
                    the enemy, and were unexpectedly met by a strong French force brought up by the
                    commandant of artillery to check their advance. General O'Hara now arrived from
                    the city to endeavour to bring off his troops; but he received a wound in the
                    arm, and was taken prisoner. The total loss of the assailants in this affair was
                    estimated at a thousand men. The French now mustered in great force around
                    Toulon, and prepared to prosecute the attack with vigour. It commenced on the
                    19th of December, and was chiefly directed against Fort Mulgrave, occupied by
                    the British. This fort was protected by an intrenched camp, and thirteen pieces
                    of cannon consisting of twenty-four and thirty-six pounders, with five mortars
                    and three thousand troops; but such was the fury of assault, that it was carried
                    in an hour, and the whole garrison either killed or taken. The British and their
                    allies now found it impossible to defend the place; and in the course of the day
                    embarked their troops, after having set on fire the arsenal and the ships. A
                    scene of confusion now ensued, such as has rarely been exhibited in modern
                    warfare. Crowds of people of every rank, age, and sex, hurried on board the
                    ships, to escape the vengeance of their enraged countrymen. Some of the
                    inhabitants began to fire upon their late allies; others in despair were seen
                    plunging into the sea, and making a vain effort to reach the ships; and not a
                    few put an end at once to their own existence on the shore. No language, indeed,
                    can do justice to the horrors of the scene. Mothers clasping their helpless
                    babes, and old men weighed down with the load of years, might be seen stretching
                    their hands towards the harbour, shuddering at every sound behind them, and even
                    rushing into the waves to escape the less merciful death which awaited them from
                    their countrymen. Sir Sidney Smith, with honourable humanity, suspended the
                    retreat until not a single individual who claimed his assistance remained on
                    shore, though the total number borne away amounted to nearly fifteen thousand.
                    Of thirty-one ships of the line found by the British at Toulon, thirteen were
                    left behind, ten were burned, and four had been previously sent to Brest and
                    Rochefort, with five thousand republicans who could not be trusted; so that
                    Great Britain finally obtained by this expedition only three ships of the line
                    and five frigates. The recovery of this important place by the French was in a
                    great measure, if not altogether, owing to the superior genius and conduct of
                    the commandant of artillery, Napoleon Bonaparte, who here made his first
                    conspicuous essay in arms.</p>
                <p>The storm which now burst on the devoted heads of the Toulonese was indeed
                    terrible. The infuriated soldiers rushed into the town, and, in their frantic
                    rage, massacred two hundred Jacobins who had gone out to welcome their approach.
                    During twenty-four hours the inhabitants were left at the mercy of the soldiers,
                    and the galley slaves, who had been let loose on the city; and a <pb break="no"

                    horrors by the citizens redeeming themselves for four millions of francs.
                    Dugommier, a brave, honourable, and humane soldier, did his utmost to check the
                    violence of the troops, and to mitigate the severity of the Convention; but
                    though he succeeded in restraining the former, nothing could soften the
                    inexorable hearts of the latter. Several thousand citizens of every age and both
                    sexes perished in a few weeks, either by the sword or the guillotine; for a
                    considerable time two hundred were beheaded daily; and twelve thousand labourers
                    were hired from the surrounding departments to demolish the buildings of the
                    city. On the motion of Barrère, it was decreed that the name of Toulon should be
                    changed to that of Port de la Montagne, that the houses should be razed to the
                    foundations, and nothing should be left but the naval and military
                    establishments; and Barras, Fréron, and Robespierre the younger were chosen to
                    execute the vengeance of the Convention upon the fallen city. Military
                    commissions were immediately formed, and a revolutionary tribunal was
                    established; the prisons were crowded with the unhappy persons destined for the
                    guillotine; and the mitraillades of Lyons were imitated with fearful effect. One
                    of the victims, an aged merchant, named Hugues, was eighty-four years old, deaf,
                    and nearly blind. His only crime consisted in the possession of a fortune of
                    L.800,000, all of which, excepting L.20,000, be offered, to save his life. The
                    judge, however, deeming the offer inadequate, sent him to the guillotine, and
                    confiscated the whole. “When I beheld this old man executed,” said Napoleon, “I
                    felt as if the end of the world was at hand.” It seemed, indeed, as if a legion
                    of evil spirits had been let loose upon earth, to revel for a season in crimes
                    hitherto unheard of among the children of men.<note anchored="true"

                    and in the mountainous country of Piedmont advantage had been gained on either
                    side. But more terrible scenes were acting in other quarters. In La Vendée a
                    most fierce and sanguinary contest was maintained by the royalists. In that part
                    of the country the language of the rest of France was but little understood. The
                    people were superstitious, and had acquired almost no knowledge of the new
                    opinions which had recently been propagated throughout the rest of the country.
                    They were chiefly headed by priests, and taught to regard their cause as that of
                    religion. Their usual mode of warfare was to proceed in their ordinary
                    occupations as peaceable citizens, but suddenly to assemble in immense bands at
                    the prescribed rendezvous, when the alarm was given. Atone time, indeed, they
                    were said to amount to one hundred and fifty thousand men. They besieged Nantes
                    and Orleans; and even Paris itself was not considered altogether safe from their
                    enterprises. The war was inconceivably bloody; neither party gave quarter; and
                    La Vendée proved a dreadful drain on the population of France. On the 28th of
                    June the Conventional general Biron drove the royalists from Lucon; and Nantes
                    was relieved by General Beysser. But after obtaining some success, General
                    Westermann was surprised, and compelled to retreat to Parthenay. In the
                    beginning of August the royalists were defeated by General Rossignol; but on the
                    10th of that month they again, under Charette their commander-in-chief, attacked
                    Nantes, though without success. Our limits do not admit of our entering into the
                    details of this fierce contest, rich as it is in daring actions and heroic
                    adventures. The royalists were often defeated and apparently dispersed, but they
                    as often appeared again in crowds around the astonished republicans. At last,
                    about the middle of October, they were completely defeated, driven from La
                    Vendée, and forced to divide into separate bodies; one of which threw itself
                    into the island of Noirmoutier, where they were destroyed, whilst another took
                    the road of Maine and Bretagne, where they struggled for some time against their
                    enemies, and were at last either cut to pieces or dispersed. The royalists had
                    long expected assistance from England; and an armament under the Earl of Moira
                    was actually fitted out for that service, but it did not arrive till too late,
                    and returned home without even attempting a landing. The Mountain party
                    invariably disgraced their successes by the most ferocious cruelties. Humanity
                    is shocked, and history would almost cease to obtain credit, were we to state in
                    detail the unrelenting barbarities which were exercised against the unfortunate
                    royalists, especially by Carrier, a deputy of the Convention, who had been sent
                    into this quarter with unlimited powers. Multitudes of prisoners were crowded on
                    board vessels in the Loire, which were afterwards scuttled and sunk. No age or
                    sex was spared; and these executions were performed with every circumstance of
                    wanton barbarity and insult. The infernal republican marriages, as they were
                    denominated by the demon who invented them, usually preceded these <hi

                <p>On the side of the Rhine a great variety of events occurred during the months of
                    August and September. Several engagements took place, in which the French were
                    upon the whole successful. In September, however, Landau was invested by the
                    combined powers; and it was resolved to make every possible effort to drive the
                    French from their position on the Lauter. They occupied the ancient and
                    celebrated lines of Weissenberg, constructed in former times for the protection
                    of the Rhenish frontier, and stretching from the town of Lauterburg on the
                    Rhine, through the village of Weissenberg to the Vosges Mountains; and during
                    four months all the resources of art had been employed in strengthening them.
                    Having approached the extreme left of this position, the allies formed the
                    design of attacking it from left to right, and thus forcing the French to
                    abandon the whole line of the intrenchments. Accordingly the Prussians, under
                    the Duke of Brunswick, assaulted the left of the lines by the defiles of the
                    Vosges Mountains, whilst the Austrians under Prince Waldeck crossed the Rhine to
                    turn the right, and Wurmser, with the main body, endeavoured to force the
                    centre. The attack on the right by Lauterburg obtained only a momentary success;
                    but Wurmser having carried several redoubts in the centre, soon got possession
                    of Weissenberg; and the left having been turned and forced back, the French army
                    retired in confusion, and some of the fugitives even fled as far as Strasburg.
                    Such was the tardiness of the allies, however, that the French, though
                    completely routed, lost only a thousand men; whereas, if the victory had been
                    improved, the ruin of the whole army would have been inevitable. The French
                    retreated to Hagenau, from which they were driven on the 18th; and they suffered
                    two other defeats on the 25th and 27th. Some of the principal citizens of
                    Strasburg now sent a private deputation to General Wurmser, offering to
                    surrender the town, upon condition that it should be restored to Louis XVII. But
                    General Wurmser declined to accede to these terms, and insisted upon an
                    unconditional surrender. The delay occasioned by this disagreement led to the
                    discovery of the negotiation, and those citizens of Strasburg who had been
                    engaged in it were seized by Saint-Just and Lebas, the commissioners of the
                    Convention, and brought to the scaffold.</p>
                <p>Prodigious efforts were now made by the French in order to recover the ground
                    which they had lost. On the 9th of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515033"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-5033-0082"/>November General Irembert was. shot at the head of
                    the army, upon a charge, probably ill founded, of treachery in the storming of
                    the lines of Weissenberg. But on the 14th Fort Louis was taken by the allies,
                    not without suspicion of treachery on the part of the governor. With this the
                    success of General Wurmser may be said to have terminated. On the 21st, the
                    republican army drove back the Austrians, and penetrated almost to Hagenau;
                    whilst the army of the Moselle advanced to co-operate with the army of the
                    Rhine. On the 17th the Prussians were defeated near Sarbruck, and next day their
                    camp at Blieseastel was stormed; the French then advanced to Deux-Ponts. On the
                    29th and 30th, however, the French were repulsed with great loss in two violent
                    attacks which they made on the Duke of Brunswick near Lautern. It was obvious,
                    indeed, that they had come into the field with a determination to conquer,
                    whatever it might cost. Every day was a day of battle, and torrents of blood
                    flowed on both sides. The allies had the advantage of the ground, which is very
                    strong, on account of its inequalities and morasses; but the French army was far
                    more numerous than theirs; and although inferior in point of discipline, yet it
                    derived great moral force from the enthusiasm with which the troops were
                    animated. On the 8th of December the French under Pichegru carried the redoubts
                    which covered Hagenau at the point of the bayonet. In a word, the finest troops
                    in Europe were unable to withstand the fury of the republicans, whose
                    determination seemed only to increase in proportion to the slaughter of their
                    companions in arms, and who were never more likely to conquer than immediately
                    after a defeat. On the 22d the allies were driven with great loss from Hagenau,
                    notwithstanding the works which they had thrown up for their defence. The
                    intrenchments on the heights of Reishoffen were considered as stronger than
                    those of Jemmappes; yet they were stormed by the army of the Moselle and the
                    Rhine, under Hoche and Pichegru. On the 23d and 24th the allies were pursued to
                    the heights of Wrotte; and on the 26th the intrenchments which they had thrown
                    up there were, after a desperate conflict, forced at the point of the bayonet.
                    On the 27th the republican army arrived in triumph at Weissenberg. Wurmser
                    retreated across the Rhine, and the Duke of Brunswick hastily fell back to cover
                    Mayence. The blockade of Landau, which had lasted four months, was raised; Fort
                    Louis was evacuated by the allies, and Kayserslautern, Germersheim, and Spires,
                    submitted to the French. During the last month of the year 1793 the loss of men
                    on both sides was immense, and is said to have amounted to between seventy and
                    eighty thousand.</p>
                <p>In the mean time violent efforts were made at Paris by the new administration,
                    established under the auspices of the Jacobin Club and of the party called the
                    Mountain. The new republican constitution had been presented to the people in
                    the primary assemblies, and accepted; so that the business for which the
                    Convention had been called together, namely, that of forming a constitution for
                    France, was at an end. It was therefore proposed that they should now dissolve
                    themselves, and order a new legislative body to assemble, according to the rules
                    prescribed by the constitution; but the dominant party considered it as
                    hazardous to convene a new assembly, possessing only limited powers, in the
                    present distracted state of the country; and in fact it was obvious that France
                    at this time required a dictatorship, or a government possessed of more absolute
                    authority than can ever be enjoyed by one which acts, or pretends to act, upon
                    constitutional principles. It was therefore determined that the Convention
                    should remain undissolved until the end of the war; and that a Revolutionary
                    Government should be established, and invested with uncontrolled powers.
                    Committees of its own body were therefore elected for the purpose of conducting
                    every department of business. The principal of these was called the Committee of
                    Public Safety, whose duty it was to superintend all the others, and to give to
                    the administration all the secrecy and dispatch which have been accounted
                    peculiar to a military government, together with a combination of skill and
                    energy hitherto unknown among mankind. A correspondence was maintained with all
                    the Jacobin Clubs throughout the kingdom; and commissioners appointed by the
                    Convention were sent into all parts of the country, with unlimited authority
                    over every description of persons. In this way a government was established,
                    possessed of infinite vigilance, and more absolute and uncontrolled power than
                    was ever enjoyed by any single despot; and the whole transactions and resources
                    of the country were known to its rulers. On the 23d of August, Barrère, in name
                    of the Committee of Public Safety, proposed the celebrated decree for placing
                    the whole French nation in a state of requisition for the public service. “From
                    this moment,” says the decree, “till that when every enemy shall have been
                    driven from the territory of the Republic, all Frenchmen shall be in permanent
                    readiness for the service of the army. The young men shall march to the combat;
                    the married men shall forge arms, and transport the provisions; the women shall
                    make tents and clothes, and attend in the hospitals; the children shall make
                    lint of old linen; the old men shall cause themselves to be carried to the
                    public squares, to excite the courage of the warriors, and to preach hatred
                    against the enemies of the Republic; the cellars shall be washed to procure
                    saltpetre; the saddle-horses shall be given up to complete the cavalry; the
                    unmarried citizens, from the age of eighteen to twenty-five, shall march first,
                    and none shall send a substitute; and every battalion shall have a banner with
                    this inscription, <hi rend="italic">The French nation risen against
                    tyrants.</hi> The Republic is only a great city besieged, and France must
                    therefore be converted into a vast camp.” The measures proposed by Barrère were
                    immediately decreed. All Frenchmen from the age of eighteen to twenty-five took
                    the field; the armies, recruited with requisitions of men, were supported with
                    requisitions of provisions; and the Republic had soon fourteen armies, and
                    twelve hundred thousand soldiers. France was thus transformed at once into a
                    camp and arsenal for the supply of the armies, and terror enforced all the
                    provisions of this celebrated decree. The bayonets of the allies appeared less
                    formidable than the guillotine of the Convention; and safety, despaired of
                    everywhere else, was found only in the armies on the frontier.</p>
                <p>In the centre the dictatorial government struck down all the parties, however
                    elevated, with whom it had been at war. The condemnation of the queen,
                    Marie-Antoinette, was directed against Europe generally; that of the Twenty-one
                    against the Girondists; that of the virtuous Bailly against the old
                    constitutionalists; and that of the Duke of Orleans against certain members of
                    the Mountain, who were supposed to have plotted his elevation to the throne. The
                    widow of the unfortunate Louis XVI. was sent to the guillotine on the 16th of
                    October, after a mock trial, in which justice and humanity were equally
                    disregarded. Her conduct, both during her trial and at the place of execution,
                    was distinguished for calmness and dignity, and she died, amidst the savage
                    shouts of the infuriated multitude, with a firmness that did honour to her race.
                    The deputies of the Gironde party, who had been proscribed on the 2d of June,
                    soon followed her to the scaffold, where they ended their career on the 31st of
                    the same month. They were in number twenty-one; Brissot, Vergniaud, Gensonné,
                    Fonfrède, Ducos, Valazé, Lasourcc, Silléry, Gardien, Carra, Duprat, Beauvais,
                    Duchâtel, Mainvielle, Lacaze, Boileau, Lehardy, Antiboul, Vigée, Dufriche, and
                    Duperret. Sixty-three of their colleagues, who had protested against their
                    arrest, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515046" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5046-0083"/>were
                    also imprisoned, but the terrorists did not venture to send these also to the
                    guillotine. During their sham trial before the Revolutionary Tribunal, which
                    lasted nine days, they displayed the most sustained and serene courage. For an
                    instant Vergniaud made his eloquent voice be heard, but in vain. The vehemence
                    of Brissot was equally unavailing. Their destruction had become necessary to the
                    ruling party, and they were condemned without being heard in their own defence.
                    When the sentence was pronounced, Valazé stabbed himself with a poniard, and
                    expired in presence of the court; whilst Lasource, addressing his judges,
                    exclaimed, “I die at a moment when the people have lost their reason; you, you
                    also will perish on the day when they recover it.” Vergniaud had been provided
                    by his friends with a certain and speedy poison; but he refused to make use of
                    it, that he might accompany his friends to the scaffold. The condemned deputies
                    marched to punishment with all the stoicism of the time, singing as they went
                    the <hi rend="italic">Marseillaise</hi> hymn, which, by a slight change, they
                    applied to their own situation:</p>
                <p>Allons, enfants de la patrie, Le jour de glorie est arrivé; Contre nous de la
                    tyrannie <hi rend="italic">I</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> j</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> couteau sanglant est levé.</p>
                <p>When they arrived at the place of execution they mutually embraced, exclaiming,
                    <hi rend="italic">Vive la République,</hi> and died, like Romans, protesting
                    with their last breath their attachment to freedom and the Republic.<note

                    v. 392; Mignet, ii. 294; Toulangeon, iv. 115. A young man, named Girey Dufocé,
                    was brought to the bar of the Revolutionary Tribunal. “You have been a fnend of
                    Brissot,” said the president. “I had that happiness." what is your opinion of
                    him ř” That he lived like Aristides, and died like Sidney,” was the answer.
                    Dufocé was sent to the caffold, where, by his heroic firmness, he vindicated the
                    friendship of Brissot.</p></note></p>
                <p>Of the other chiefs of this party, almost all met with an untimely end. Salles,
                    Guadet, Barbaroux, were discovered in the caves of Saint-Emilion, near Bordeaux,
                    and perished on the popular scaffold. Pétion and Buzat, after having wandered
                    about for some time, committed suicide, and were found dead in a field, with
                    their bodies half devoured by the wolves. Rabaud Saint-Etienne was betrayed by a
                    wretch in whom he confided. Madame Roland was also condemned, and died with the
                    courage of a Roman matron; her husband, on learning her death, quitted his
                    asylum, and stabbed himself on the high road between Paris and Rouen, that he
                    might not betray the generous friends who had sheltered him in his misfortunes.
                    Condorcet, who had been put beyond the protection of the law since the 2d of
                    June, was discovered when in the act of concealing himself from his pursuers,
                    and escaped punishment by taking poison. Louvet, Kervelegan, Lanjuinais,
                    Henri-la-Rivière, Le Sage, and La Reveillere-Lepeaux, were the only Girondists
                    who, in secure asylums, waited for the cessation of this furious tempest. And
                    thus perished this celebrated party, blameable for its rashness, but estimable
                    for its intentions, illustrious for its talents, and glorious in its fall; a
                    party which, embracing all men who were philanthropists from feeling, or
                    republicans from principle, the brave, the humane, and the benevolent, fell the
                    victim of a base and despicable faction, composed of men sprung from the dregs
                    of the populace, and impelled by coarse and vulgar ambition; a party, in short,
                    which, though adorned by the most splendid talents, supported by the most
                    powerful eloquence, and actuated by the most generous intentions, was destroyed,
                    because its members refused to countenance the sanguinary violence which alone
                    commands success in revolutions.</p>
                <p>The Duke of Orleans was soon afterwards condemned, on ’ a charge of having, from
                    the commencement of the Revolution, aspired to the sovereignty. The execution of
                    Egalité gave satisfaction to all parties. His vote for the death of the king had
                    done him little honour, even in the opinion of the Mountainists, and had
                    rendered him odious to the rest of mankind. It was, in fact, an unparalleled
                    outrage on humanity.</p>
                <p>The Committee of Public Safety was now remodelled, conformably to the views of
                    the dictators. Until the 31st of May, when the decree for the arrest of the
                    Girondists had passed, it consisted of neutral members of the Convention; now it
                    was composed of the most furious partisans of the Mountain. Barrère remained,
                    but Robespierre was elected a member, and, by means of Saint-Just, Couthon,
                    Collot-d’Herbois, and Billaud-Varennes, his party had a complete ascendency. He
                    struck off some Dantonists, such as Hérault de Séchelles and Robert Lindet, who
                    still remained; gained Barrère; and took under his own management the
                    departments of the police and public opinion. His associates also cast their
                    parts. Saint-Just undertook the surveillance and denunciation of persons
                    suspected; Couthon, that of violent propositions, which required to be softened
                    in the form of expression: Billaud-Varennes and Collot-d’Herbois directed the
                    proconsulates in the departments; Carnot the war; Cambon that of the finances
                    department; Prieur de la Côte d’Or, Prieur de la Marne, and others, the
                    administration of the interior; and Barrère was the daily orator and ever-ready
                    panegyrist of the dictatorial committee. Below this was placed as an auxiliary
                    in the details of revolutionary administration and inferior measures the
                    Committee of General Safety, constituted in the same spirit as the great
                    committee, and, like it, consisting of twelve members, re-eligible every three
                    months, and always continued in their functions. In such hands was the whole
                    revolutionary force now placed. “Vous n’avez plus rien à ménager contre les
                    ennemis du nouvel ordre des choses,” said Saint-Just; “et la liberté doit
                    vaincre à tel prix que ce soit Dans les circonstances où se trouve la
                    République, la constitution ne peut être établie; elle deviendrait la garantie
                    des attentats contre la liberté, parce qu’elle manquerait de la violence
                    nécessaire pour les réprimer. Le gouvernement présent est aussi trop embarrassé.
                    Vous êtes trop loin de tous les attentats; il faut que le glaive des lois se
                    promène partout avec rapidité, et que votre bras soit présent partout.” And thus
                    was created that terrible power which first devoured the enemies of the
                    Mountain, then devoured both the Mountain and the Commune, and at length ended
                    by devouring itself. The committee disposed of every thing in name of the
                    Convention, which was merely its tool. It was this body which appointed and
                    dismissed generals, ministers, representative commissioners, judges, and juries;
                    which struck down opposing factions; which possessed the initiative of all
                    measures. By means of its commissioners the armies and the generals were kept
                    under its control; it exercised sovereign power in the departments; by the law
                    in regard to suspected persons, it disposed of the liberty, and by the
                    Revolutionary Tribunal, of the life, of every one; by <hi rend="italic"
                    >requisitions</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">maximum,</hi> it had the unlimited
                    disposal of all fortunes; and by the terrified Convention, it could command
                    decrees of accusation against any member of that body. Every thing, in short,
                    was at its feet, and, supported by the multitude, its despotism was for the time
                    as complete as it was terrible.</p>
                <p>When the human mind is once roused, its activity extends to every object. At this
                    time a new system of weights and measures, in which thedecimal arithmetic alone
                    is employed, was established by the Convention. The court of Spain,
                    notwithstanding the war, had the liberality to permit Mechain to proceed with
                    his operations for measuring a degree of the meridian in that country; and he
                    ac-cordinġly<pb break="no" facs="nls:193515059" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5059-0084"/>
                    carried on his system of triangulation from Barcelona to Perpignan, whence the
                    mensuration was continued to Paris. Delambre and his pupil La François also
                    measured a degree of latitude in the vicinity of the metropolis. In all, twelve
                    degrees of the meridian were measured, the mean of which is 57,027 toises; and
                    by this the universal standard of measure was calculated. MM. Borda and Cassini
                    also determined the length of a pendulum which vibrates seconds <hi
                    rend="italic">in vacuo,</hi> and in a mean temperature at Paris, to be three
                    feet eight hundred and six lines; and MM. Lavoisier and Haüy found that a cubic
                    foot of distilled water at the freezing point weighs <hi rend="italic">in
                    vacuo</hi> seventy pounds and sixty gros French weight. From these data the new
                    table of weights and measures was constructed. The astronomical circles with
                    which MM. Borda and Cassini had made their observations were also divided
                    according to the centesimal plan; so that the quadrant contains a hundred
                    degrees, and each degree a hundred minutes. Hence the minute of a great circle
                    of the sphere is equal to a <hi rend="italic">mithare</hi> or new French mile;
                    and if, for the reduction of this measure, we estimate the Paris toise,
                    according to the comparison made with the standard kept in the Royal Society of
                    London, at 6∙3925 English feet, the <hi rend="italic">milliare</hi> or minute
                    will be equal to 1093∙633 yards, and the <hi rend="italic">mètre</hi> to
                    3∙280899 feet.</p>
                <p>Separated by the war and by their own laws from all states and forms of
                    government, the innovators sought to isolate themselves still more. For an
                    unparalleled revolution they established an entirely new era; they changed the
                    divisions of the year, and the names of the months and days; they replaced tire
                    Christian kalendar by the republican, the week by the decade, and fixed the day
                    of rest, not on the Sabbath, but on the tenth day. The new era dated from the
                    22d September, or autumnal equinox, the epoch of the foundation of the Republic.
                    The year was divided into twelve equal months of thirty days each, which
                    commenced on the 22d September, and were arranged in the order following, viz.
                    <hi rend="italic">Vendémiaire, Brumaire, Frimaire,</hi> for autumn; <hi
                    rend="italic">Nivose, Pluviose, Ventose,</hi> for winter; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Germinal,</hi><hi rend="italic">Floréal, Prairial,</hi> for spring; and <hi
                    rend="italic">Messidor, Thermidor, Fructidor,</hi> for summer. Each month had
                    three decades, each decade ten days, and each day received its name from its
                    place in the decade; thus, <hi rend="italic">primidi, duodi, tridi, quartidi,
                    quintidi, sexlidi, septidi, octidi, nonidi, decadi.</hi> Five complementary days
                    were thrown to the end of tire year, or added after the 30th Fructidor, in order
                    to complete it; these received the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sans-culotides,</hi> and were consecrated, the first to the festival of <hi
                    rend="italic">Genius,</hi> the second to that of <hi rend="italic">Labour,</hi>
                    the third to that of <hi rend="italic">Actions,</hi> the fourth to that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Recompenses,</hi> and the fifth to that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Opinion.</hi> The constitution of 1793 naturally led to the republican
                    kalendar, and the republican kalendar to tire abolition of the Christian
                    worship. Accordingly, the Commune and the Committee of Public Safety proposed
                    each a new kind of religion; the Commune the worship of Reason, and the
                    Committee that of the Supreme Being.</p>
                <p>The religion of France had for some time been gradually losing ground; and on the
                    7th of November, Gobet, bishop of Paris, along with a great multitude of other
                    ecclesiastics, came into the hall of the Convention, and at once resigned their
                    functions and renounced the Christian religion. All the clergymen, whether
                    Protestant or Catholic, who were members of the Convention, followed this
                    example, excepting only Grégoire, whom we formerly mentioned as having been one
                    of the first of his order to join the <hi rend="italic">tiers</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">état</hi> after the meeting of the States General, and who had now
                    the courage to profess himself a Christian, although the emoluments of his
                    bishopric were, he said, at the service of the Republic. Amidst the acclamations
                    of the Convention, it was decreed that hereafter the only French deities should
                    be Liberty, Equality, and Reason; and they would seem to have consecrated these
                    abstractions as the only objects of worship. What political purpose the leaders
                    of the Convention intended to serve by this proceeding does not clearly appear;
                    unless, perhaps, their object was to change so completely the French manners and
                    habits of thinking, that it should never be in their power to return to the
                    state from which they had just emerged, or to unite in intercourse with the
                    other nations of Europe. The populace, however, could not at once relinquish the
                    religion of their fathers. The municipality of Paris ordered the churches to be
                    shut up, but the Convention found it necessary to annul this order; and
                    Robespierre gained no small degree of popularity by supporting the liberty of
                    religious worship on this occasion. Hebert and Fabre d’Eglantine, who led the
                    opposite party, hastened their own fall by an ill-judged contempt of popular
                    opinion on the subject of religion.</p>
                <p>To the abjuration of Christianity by Gobet, followed as it was by the apostacy of
                    many of the constitutional bishops and clergy in the Convention, who joined in
                    the declaration, that no other national religion was now required but that of
                    liberty, equality, and morality, the wildest excesses of profanity and
                    irréligion succeeded. Drunken artisans and shameless harlots crowded to the bar
                    of the Convention, and there trampled under their feet the sacred vases
                    consecrated for ages to the holiest purposes of religion; the churches were
                    despoiled of their plate and ornaments; busts of Marat and Leļrelletier replaced
                    the images of Christ and the Virgin, which were trodden in the mire; and
                    parodies on the Hallelujah were sung as an accompaniment to the Carmagnole
                    dance. Hebert, Chaumette, and their associates, appeared at the bar of the
                    Convention, and there declared that there was no God, and that the worship of
                    Reason ought to be substituted instead of his; whilst an opera singer, known in
                    more than one character to most of the Convention, was introduced as the
                    personification of the new divinity. The services of the Christian religion were
                    universally abandoned, and the pulpits deserted throughout the revolutionized
                    districts; the church bells were everywhere silent; Sabbath was entirely
                    obliterated; baptisms ceased; the burial service was no longer heard; the sick
                    received no consolation, the dying no communion; and the rites of heathenism,
                    blended with the profanities of the most fanatical infidelity, desecrated, the
                    unhappy land. On every tenth day atheism was publicly preached to the bewildered
                    people by some revolutionary leader; and on all the public seminaries was placed
                    the inscription, “Death is an Eternal Sleep.” Marat was deified; God was
                    insulted and defied. Such is the wild reaction which follows the overthrow of
                    systems which exclude all reformation, and cherish the abuses engendered by time
                    as their most valuable prerogatives and distinctions. For seven years did the
                    reign of impiety continue in France; and when at length the worship of
                    Christianity was restored by Napoleon, its ruinous effects were generally felt;
                    it had demoralized the old, and left the young without any impressions of
                    religion.</p>
                <p>But now when the Republic saw itself successful in all quarters, when the
                    Mountain party and the Jacobins had no rivals at home, and accounted themselves
                    in little immediate danger from abroad, they began to split into factions, and
                    to entertain the fiercest jealousies. The Jacobin Club was the usual place in
                    which their contests were carried on; but at this time Robespierre acted the
                    part of a mediator between all parties, and attempted to turn their attention
                    from private animosities to public affairs. Having spread a report that Great
                    Britain intended speedily to invade France, he proposed that the Jacobin Club
                    should endeavour to discover the vulnerable parts of the British constitution
                    and government. They caught at the bait which had thus been thrown out to them;
                    made speeches and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515072"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-5072-0085"/>wrote essays without number; and were in this way
                    occupied and amused for a considerable time.</p>
                <p>The winter passed in tolerable tranquillity, and no military enterprise was
                    undertaken either by the allies or by the French. On the first of February
                    Barrère asserted in tlwe Convention that the confederate powers were willing
                    provisionally to acknowledge the French Republic, to consent to a cessation of
                    hostilities for two years, and at the end of that time to conclude a lasting
                    peace with the French people. But this assertion met with no credit, and the
                    Convention declared itself determined to reject any proposition founded on it,
                    as affording to the other nations of Europe the means of undermining the new
                    government. In the mean time the Revolutionary Government was gradually becoming
                    more vigorous. Thirty committees of the Convention managed the whole business of
                    the state, without sharing much of the direct executive government, which
                    remained in the hands of the Committee of Public Safety; and these different
                    committees were engaged in a great variety of matters. The ruling party had no
                    competitors for power. The most extensive plans were therefore carried into
                    effect, without confusion or opposition. The Convention was little more than a
                    court in which every project was formally registered. At a single sitting thirty
                    decrees were passed, relating to subjects the most widely different, and some of
                    them of the greatest importance. The finances were under a committee, at the
                    head of which was Cain-bon, and which found resources for the most lavish
                    expenditure. The assignats were received as money throughout the state; so that
                    a paper mill had become more valuable than a mine of gold. The credit of this
                    paper was supported by an arbitrary law regulating the <hi rend="italic"
                    >maximum</hi> or highest price of all provisions, and by the immense mass of
                    wealth which had come into the hands of the Convention by the seizure of the
                    church-lands, and by the confiscation of the property of royalists, emigrants,
                    and other persons condemned by the Revolutionary Tribunal. So unequally, indeed,
                    had property been divided under the ancient government, that, by means of these
                    confiscations, about even tenths of the national territory was supposed to have
                    been transferred to the state. To this was added the plunder of the churches,
                    consisting of gold and silver images, and vessels employed in divine worship,
                    along with other articles of less value, amongst which may be mentioned the
                    church bells, which were considered as sufficient for the manufacture of fifteen
                    thousand pieces of cannon. These resources formed altogether a mass of property
                    such as was never perhaps possessed by any other government.</p>
                <p>Other committees were engaged in very different occupations. Highways were
                    constructed, and canals planned. Immense manufactories of arms were everywhere
                    established. At Paris alone eleven hundred muskets were fabricated daily, and a
                    hundred pieces of cannon cast every month. Public schools were instituted, and
                    the French language taught in its purity from the Pyrenees to the Rhine. The
                    Convention possessed immense resources, and they did not hesitate to lavish them
                    upon their schemes. Every science and every art was called upon for aid; and the
                    most accomplished men in every profession were employed in giving splendour to
                    theft country. The chemists, in particular, gave essential aid by the facility
                    with which they supplied materials for the manufacture of gunpowder; and in
                    return for their services, Lavoisier, the greatest of them all, suffered death
                    by a most iniquitous sentence. Not fewer than two hundred new dramatic
                    performances, the object of which was to attach the people to the existing order
                    of things, were produced in less than two years. The vigour with which the
                    committees of subsistence exerted themselves is particularly remarkable. All
                    Europe was at war with France; and as England, Holland, and Spain, the three
                    maritime powers, were engaged in the contest, it had been thought practicable to
                    reduce France to great distress by famine, especially as it was imagined that
                    the country had not resources to supply its immense population. But the rulers
                    of that country acted with the policy of a besieged garrison. They seized upon
                    the whole provisions of the country, and carried them to public granaries; they
                    registered the cattle, and made their owners responsible for them; they provided
                    the armies abundantly; and, as the people were accurately numbered, they dealt
                    out in every district, on stated occasions, what was absolutely necessary for
                    subsistence, and no more. To all this the people submitted; and, indeed,
                    throughout the whole of the mixed scenes of the Revolution, the calm judgment of
                    the historian is not a little perplexed. It is impossible not to admire the
                    patience with which they endured every hardship which was represented as
                    necessary to the common cause; and equally so not to honour the enthusiastic
                    energy with which they lavished their blood in defence of the independence of
                    their country. On the other hand, no one can regard without indignation and
                    horror the sanguinary proceedings of the factions in the Convention and the
                    capital, or reconcile with our ordinary knowledge of humanity the spirit of
                    mutual extermination by which all of them were in turn actuated.</p>
                <p>During the winter the dissensions of the Jacobins increased. They were divided
                    into two clubs, one of which (that recently instituted) assembled in a hall
                    w∣ιicħ once belonged to the Cordeliers. The leaders of this club were Hebert,
                    Ronsin, Vincent, and others; butthat of the Jacobins still retained its
                    ascendency, and Robespierre had now become decidedly its leader. This
                    extraordinary man had gradually combined in his own person the confidence of the
                    people and the direction of the government. But as the committees were above the
                    Convention, which had become little more than a court of record, so that of
                    Public Safety was above the other committees; and Robespierre was the leader of
                    this dominant committee, Barrère, Saint-Just, Couthon, and others of its
                    members, only acting a secondary part. These persons laboured in the business of
                    the state, but the supreme power was in Robespierre. He surrounded the members
                    of the Convention with spies, and being equally jealous and implacable, set no
                    bounds to the shedding of blood. On the 25th of March he brought to trial the
                    following active Jacobins, who were condemned and executed the day after, viz.
                    Hebert, Ronsin, Momoro, Vincent, Du Croquet, Koch, Laumur, Bourgeois, Mazuel,
                    Laboureau, Ancard, Leclerc, Proly, Dessieux, Anacharsis Clootz, Pereira,
                    Florent, Armand, Descombles, and Dubuisson. And not satisfied with this, on the
                    2d of April he brought to trial nine of those who had once been his most
                    vigorous associates; Danton, Fabre d’Eglantine, Bazire, Chabot, Philipeaux,
                    Camille Desmoulins, Lacroix, Dela-may d’Angers, and Hérault de Sechelles, all of
                    whom were executed, along with Westermann, on the evening of the 5th.</p>
                <p>The fall of the Hebertists was regarded with satisíaction by every one beyond the
                    pale of the municipality of Paris. This faction, which had laboured in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Père</hi><hi rend="italic">Duchene</hi> to popularise obscenity of
                    language, with grovelling and cruel sentiments, and whose characteristic it was
                    to blend derision with ferocity, had for some time made redoubtable progress;
                    and Robespierre, finding it untractable for his purposes, resolved on its
                    destruction, upon the pretence that, whilst it corrupted the people, it served
                    the purposes of foreigners by promoting anarchy. This he effected by a
                    compromise. His object was to sacrifice both the commune and the anarchists;
                    whilst the committees desired to sacrifice the Mountain and the moderate party.
                    The parties came to a mutual understanding, in consequence of which Robespierre
                    gave up Danton, Camille Desmoulins, and their friends to the members of the
                    committee, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515085" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5085-0086"
                    />the members of the committee in return gave up Hebert, Clootz, Chaumette,
                    Ronsin, and their accomplices. In at first favouring the moderate party in the
                    Convention, he prepared the destruction of the anarchists, and thus attained two
                    objects advantageous to his power; he ruined a redoubtable faction, and he
                    disencumbered himself of a revolutionary reputation which rivalled his own.</p>
                <p>But the latter object was, after all, that which he had probably most at heart,
                    because the party of Danton stood most in his way. Their principles were, that
                    terror was to be used only for the establishment of freedom, not made an
                    instrument of destruction in the hands of those who had obtained it; they wished
                    above all things that the Republic should be consolidated by victory, but that
                    success should be used with moderation. Hence, whilst they vehemently reprobated
                    the proceedings of the dictators after the 31st of May had ensured the triumph
                    of the populace, they desired to humble the anarchists of the municipality, to
                    put down the Revolutionary Tribunal, to discharge from confinement those
                    imprisoned as suspected persons, and to dissolve the despotic committees of
                    government. But these objects were manifestly opposed to that supreme and
                    undisputed domination which Robespierre was now labouring to secure for himself
                    by means of the revolutionary machinery; and, accordingly, after the
                    understanding already mentioned had been come to, it was not long ere he
                    commenced hostilities, by attacking the Jacobin Club, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vieux Cordelier</hi> of Camille Desmoulins,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In this production Desmoulins discoursed of liberty with the
                    profound sense of Machiavel, and of men with the wit of voltaire. His picture of
                    the horrors of this gloomy period is drawn with a powerful hand. “At the present
                    epoch,” said he, “words became state-crimes; and from this the transition is
                    easy to simple looks, which, with sadness, compassion, sighs, nay even absolute
                    silence itself, are made the ground-work of suspicion. Is a citizen popular? He
                    is a rival of the dictator, and might excite commotions. Does he, on the other
                    hand, avoid society, and live retired in the bosom of his family? This secluded
                    fife makes him remarked, and excites the suspicion that he is meditating
                    sinister designs. Are you rich? There is imminent peril that the people may be
                    corrupted by your largesses. Are you poor <hi rend="italic">ĩ</hi> You must be
                    the more closely watched, because there is none so enterprising as those who
                    have nothing to lose. Are you of a thoughtful and melancholy character, with a
                    neglected exterior? You are afflicted because in your opinion public affairs are
                    not well conducted. Does a citizen indulge in dissipation and bring on
                    indigestion? He is concealing ambition under the mask of pleasure. Is he
                    virtuous and austere in his morals? He has constituted himself the censor of the
                    government. Is he a philosopher, an orator, a poet? He will soon acquire more
                    consideration than the rulers of the state. Has he acquired reputation in war?
                    His talents only make him the more dangerous, and render it indispensable to
                    remove him from the army, perhaps to send him to the scaffold. The natural death
                    of a distinguished person, particularly if in place, has become so rare, that
                    historians transmit it as an event worthy of record to future ages. Even the
                    death of so many innocent and estimable citizens seems a less calamity than the
                    insolence and scandalous fortunes of those who have denounced and murdered them.
                    Every day the accuser makes his triumphal entry into the palace of death, to
                    reap the harvest of some rich succession; and the tribunals which were once the
                    protectors of life and property have become mere slaughter-houses, where that
                    which bears the name of punishment and confiscation is nothing but robbery and
                    murder.” In Camille Desmoulins the anarchists had an able, active, and redoubted
                    antagonist. This atrocious faction he attacked with unsparing severity, and in
                    an especial manner fastened on its head the infamous Hebert, whom he described
                    as “a miserable intriguer, a caterer for the guillotine, a traitor paid by Pitt;
                    a wretch who had at different times received two hundred thousand francs from
                    the factions of the Republic to calumniate their adversaries; a thief and
                    robber, who had been expelled from his situation as lacquey in the theatre for
                    common stealing, and now pretended to drench France in blood by his prostituted
                    journal.” Such is Desmoulins' description of the man on whose testimony
                    Marie-Antoinette was condemned, and whose evidence was also held sufficient to
                    send the Revolutionists themselves to the scaffold.</p></note> and indirectly
                    denouncing Danton himself.</p>
                <p>Danton, who had not yet discontinued his relations with Robespierre, demanded an
                    interview, which took place at the residence of the latter. Both parties were
                    cold and bitter. Danton complained violently; Robespierre was haughty and
                    reserved. “I know,” said Danton, “all the hatred which the committee bear me,
                    but I do not fear it.” “You are wrong,” replied Robespierre; “there are no bad
                    intentions towards you, but it is well to be explicit.” “To be explicit,”
                    rejoined Danton, “good faith is necessary.” But observing Robespierre assume a
                    lowering look, “It is doubtless necessary,” he added, “to coerce the royalists;
                    but we ought to strike blows which are useful to the Republic, and should not
                    confound the innocent with the guilty.” “Eh! who has told you,” replied
                    Robespierre sharply, “that one innocent person has suffered ř” Danton turned to
                    the friend who had accompanied him, and with a bitter smile, “What say you <hi
                    rend="italic">ĩ</hi> Not one innocent man has perished !” At these words they
                    parted; all hope of reconciliation was at end.</p>
                <p>The fall of the anarchists ensued. They were brought before the Revolutionary
                    Tribunal, upon a charge of being agents of foreigners, and of having conspired
                    to give a tyrant to the state. From the time of their arrest, their audacity
                    abandoned them; and as they had neither talents nor enthusiasm, they defended
                    themselves without ability, and died without courage.</p>
                <p>It was now time for Danton to look to his own safety; the proscription had
                    reached the commune, and was fast approaching him also. His friends urged him to
                    act; but having failed to shake the dictatorial power by exciting public opinion
                    and rousing the Convention, where could he look for support? The Convention was
                    well disposed towards him and his cause; but it was in complete subjection to
                    the revolutionary power of the committees. Having neither the government, nor
                    the assembly, nor the commune, nor the clubs, Danton therefore awaited the
                    proscription without taking any step to ensure his safety. Still his friends
                    pressed him to act. “I would rather,” said he, “be guillotined than become
                    guillotiner; besides, my life is not worth the trouble of preserving; I am weary
                    of existence.” “The members of the committee seek your death.” “What !”
                    exclaimed he, in anger; “if ever—if Billaud— if Robespierre... They will be
                    execrated as tyrants; the house of Robespierre will be razed; salt will be
                    scattered on its foundations, and a stake of infamy planted to avenge the
                    crimes...But my friends will say of me that I have been a good father, a good
                    friend, a good citizen; they will not forget me.” “But you may escape.” “I would
                    rather be guillotined than become guillotiner.” “Still it is necessary to fly.”
                    “To fly !” exclaimed he with a mixture of anger and disdain; “do you suppose
                    that a man carries his country in the soles of his shoes ?’ Danton had only one
                    resource; to lift up his well-known and powerful voice, denounce Robespierre and
                    the committees, and rouse the Convention against their tyranny. He was warmly
                    pressed to adopt this course; but, not to mention the difficulty of overturning
                    an established domination, however atrocious, he knew too well the subjugation
                    and terror of that assembly to trust to the efficacy of such an attempt. He
                    therefore awaited his fate, in the belief however that his enemies would shrink
                    from the proscription of one who had dared so much. He was mistaken. On the 10th
                    Germinal he received notice that the question of his arrest was under the
                    consideration of the Committee of Public Safety, and he was once more urged to
                    fly; but, after a moment’s consideration, he answered, “They dare not.” In the
                    night his bouse was surrounded, and he was conducted to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193515098" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5098-0087"/>Luxembourg, with Camille
                    Desmoulins, Philipeaux, Lacroix, Hérault de Sechelles, and Westermann. On
                    entering the prison he cordially greeted the captives who pressed around him.
                    “Gentlemen,” said he, “I had hoped to have been the means of releasing all of
                    you from this place; but here I am among you, and I know where all this will
                    end.” An hour afterwards he was shut up in a solitary cell, which Hebert had
                    recently before occupied, and which was soon to be tenanted by Robespierre
                    himself. The past now rose up to the review of his mind, and, giving way to
                    reflection and regret, he observed, “It is just a year since I caused the
                    Revolutionary Tribunal to be instituted. I ask pardon of God and man for doing
                    so; but I never imagined that it would become the scourge of humanity.”</p>
                <p>The arrest of Danton and his friends produced a violent agitation in Paris; the
                    Convention also was stricken with dismay. Legendre made a powerful appeal in
                    behalf of his friend, and demanded that, before the report of the committee was
                    received, Danton should be examined in their presence. The proposition was
                    favourably received, and for a moment the assembly seemed disposed to cast off
                    its fetters. But the spell of the dictatorship of terror was still strong on
                    that body. Robespierre ascended the tribune, and having by menace reduced the
                    Convention to silence, proceeded to mark out for vengeance the intrepid
                    Legendre. “You affect to be afraid,” said he, in conclusion; “but I say, whoever
                    trembles at this moment is guilty; for never did innocence fear the vigilance of
                    the public authorities." None dared to incur the fatal imputation; terror had
                    frozen every heart. The assembly crouched beneath their tyrants, and unanimously
                    sent the accused to the Revolutionary Tribunal. When brought before this
                    Rhadamanthine judgment-seat, they assumed an attitude of haughty deĥance,
                    evincing at once an audacity of purpose, and a contempt for their judges,
                    altogether extraordinary. Danton, in answer to the usual interrogatories as to
                    his name, age, and residence, put by the president Dumas, replied, “I am Danton,
                    well known in the Revolution; I am thirty-five years of age; my abode will soon
                    be in nothingness; and my name will live in the Pantheon of history.” The
                    disdainful and vehement responses of Danton, the cool and measured discussion of
                    La- &lt;⅜oix, the austerity of Philipeaux, and the nervous vigour of Desmoulins,
                    began to make an impression on the people. The accused were therefore put <hi
                    rend="italic">hors de débats,</hi> on the pretence that they had been wanting in
                    respect to the court, and they were immediately condemned without any further
                    hearing. “We are immolated,” cried Danton, “to the ambition of a few cowardly
                    brigands; but they will not long enjoy the fruit of their criminal victory. I
                    pull down Robespierre; Robespierre follows me.” They were conducted to the
                    Conciergerie, and thence to the scaffold. On their way to the place of
                    execution, they displayed the stoical courage common at that period. A body of
                    troops had been assembled, and their escort was numerous; but the people, who,
                    on 'such occasions, are usually clamorous and approving, maintained a profound
                    silence. Camille Desmoulins, even when on the fatal cart, was still astonished
                    at his condemnation, and could not comprehend it. “This, then,” said he, “is the
                    recompense destined to the first apostle of liberty.” Danton held his head
                    erect, and cast a calm and intrepid look around him. At the foot of the
                    scaffold, however, his feelings for a moment overmastered him: “Oh, my
                    well-beloved,” cried he; “oh, my wife, shall 1 then never see thee more I” But
                    immediately checking himself, “Danton, no weakness,” said he. He ascended the
                    scaffold with a firm step, and received the blow of the fatal axe with unshaken
                    courage. And thus perished the tardy but last defenders of humanity and
                    moderation; men who had desirefl to establish peace amongst the conquerors in
                    the revolutionary struggle, and to extend mercy to the vanquished. After their
                    fall no voice was for some time raised against the dictatorship of terror,
                    which, from one end of France to the other, now struck down its victims in
                    silence.</p>
                <p>Still, however, the preparations for the ensuing campaign were pursued with
                    unabated vigour. The committee for military affairs, at the head of which stood
                    Carnot and others, were busily occupied in arranging along the frontiers the
                    immense force which the requisition had called forth. Plans of operations were
                    drawn out by this committee, and, when approved by the Committee of Public
                    Safety, were sent to the generals to be executed. On the other hand, the allies
                    were making powerful preparations for another attempt to subjugate France; and
                    the emperor himself took the field at the head of the armies in the Netherlands.
                    The plan of the campaign is said to have been framed by Colonel Mack, who
                    afterwards acquired so much negative celebrity. West Flanders was to be
                    protected by a strong body of men; whilst the main army was to penetrate to
                    Landrecies, get within the line of French frontier towns, and cut off the armies
                    from the interior by covering the country from Maubeuge to the sea. This plan
                    was bold; but it belongs to military men to judge whether boldness was not its
                    only merit. In fact, the allies seem to have had no correct information of the
                    immense force which the French were collecting against them. Even the town of
                    Lisle alone, which was capable of containing a numerous army within its walls,
                    and which was to be left in their rear, should have seemed an insurmountable
                    obstacle to the execution of this plan.</p>
                <p>On the 16th of April, the Austrian, British, and Dutch! armies assembled on the
                    heights above Cateau, where they “were reviewed by the emperor; and on the
                    following day <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> they ad vanced.in eight columns
                    against the French, drove in their posts, and penetrated beyond Landrecies. The
                    allied army now amounted in all to a hundred and eighty-seven thousand men, who
                    were disposed in the following manner: Fifteen thousand Dutch and fifteen
                    thousand Austrians, under the Prince of Orange and General Latour, formed the
                    siege of Landrecies; fifteen thousand British and fifteen thousand Austrians,
                    commanded by the Duke of York and General Otto, encamped towards Cambray; the
                    emperor and the Prince of Saxe-Cobourg, at the head of sixty thousand Austrians,
                    advanced as far as Guise; twelve thousand Hessians and Austrians, under General
                    Worms, were stationed near Douai and Bouchain; Count Kaunitz, with fifteen
                    thousand Austrians, defended the Sambre and the country near Maubeuge; and
                    General Clairfayt, with forty thousand Austrians and Hanoverians, protected
                    Flanders from Tournay to the sea; whilst sixty thousand Prussians, for whom a
                    subsidy had been paid by Great Britain, were expected to take the field, but in
                    fact never arrived.</p>
                <p>The French now commenced active operations. On the morning of the 26th of April
                    they attacked, in great force, the Duke of York near Cateau; but after a severe
                    conflict they were repulsed, and General Chapuy was taken prisoner. At the same
                    time they attacked the troops under his imperial majesty, but were again
                    repulsed with the loss of fifty-seven pieces of cannon. On the same day,
                    however, Pichegru advanced from Lisle, attacked and defeated Clairfayt, took
                    thirty-two pieces of cannon, and, in the course of a few days, made himself
                    master of Vervic, Menin, and Courtray. On the 29th of April the garrison of
                    Landrecies surrendered to the allies. When this event was known in the
                    Convention, it excited a considerable degree of alarm. But it was the last
                    decided success obtained by the allies during this disastrous campaign. Clairfay
                    t was again completely defeated by Pichegru in a general engagement, and it was
                    found necessary to send the Duke of York to his assistance. This movement<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193515111" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5111-0088"/> no doubt seems to
                    have been unavoidable; but its effect was to divide the allied army into a
                    number of detachments, capable indeed of carrying on a desultory warfare, but
                    unfit for the prosecution of vigorous measures. On the 10th of May the Duke of
                    York was attacked near Tournay by a body of the enemy, whom he repulsed; but he
                    was unable to effect a junction with Clairfayt, upon the destruction of whom the
                    French were chiefly bent; for whilst the Duke of York was occupied with the
                    attack made on himself, Pichegru fell upon Clairfayt with such irresistible
                    impetuosity, that the latter was compelled to retreat in confusion, and part of
                    his army fled to the neighbourhood of Bruges. Whilst Pichegru was thus advancing
                    successfully in West Flanders, Jourdan in East Flanders advanced from Maubeuge,
                    crossed the Sambre, and forced Kaunitz to retreat. On the 18th, however, Kaunitz
                    succeeded in repulsing the enemy in his turn, and in forcing them to re-cross
                    the Sambre with considerable loss.</p>
                <p>The allies now found that no progress could be made in France whilst General
                    Pichegru was advancing successfully and occupying West Flanders in their rear.
                    The emperor, therefore, withdrew the greater part of his army to the
                    neighbourhood of Tournay, and resolved to make a grand effort to intersect the
                    communications between Courtray and Lisle, and thus to cut off the retreat of
                    Pichegru. With this view, the army, on the night of the 16th, moved forward in
                    five columns; and Clairfayt was at the same time directed to cross the Lys, and
                    if possible to effect a junction, and complete the plan. The attempt seemed at
                    first to promise success; but, in the course of the 17th, the division under the
                    Duke of York was overpowered by numbers and defeated. The advance of the other
                    columns was thus checked, and Clairfayt sustained another repulse. The plan of
                    the allies had been completely frustrated, and their army in consequence
                    withdrew to the neighbourhood of Tournay.</p>
                <p>Ptchegru speedily attempted to retaliate. On the 22d of May, at day-break, he
                    directed his whole force against the enemy. The attack commenced with a heavy
                    fire of artillery, and all the advanced posts were driven in, upon which the
                    action became general; the attacks were repeatedly renewed on both sides, and
                    the day was spent in a succession of obstinate battles. All that military skill
                    could effect was performed on both sides; the French and the allied soldiers
                    fought with equal courage and obstinacy; but at nine o’clock in the evening the
                    assailants reluctantly withdrew from the attack. The day, however, on which a
                    vanquished enemy quits the field is not always that upon which the victory is
                    won. In this engagement the French were unsuccessful in their immediate object;
                    but the weight of their fire, their steady discipline, and the determined
                    obstinacy of their attacks, raised their military character in the estimation of
                    the officers and soldiers of the allied army. And it was soon perceived that, in
                    addition to these, they possessed other advantages. Their numbers were immense;
                    they implicitly obeyed their generals; and the generals as implicitly submitted
                    to the directions of the Committee of Public Safety. A combination of efforts
                    was thus produced, and the effect was not impaired by divided counsels. On the
                    other hand, the numbers of the allies were daily declining, and their leaders
                    were independent princes or powerful men, whose sentiments and interests were
                    often at variance, and whose exertions were consequently disunited.</p>
                <p>On the 24th the French again crossed the Sambre, but were driven back with
                    considerable loss. On the 27th an attempt was made to besiege Charleroi, but on
                    the Sd of June the Prince of Orange compelled the enemy to raise the siege. On
                    the 12th the attempt was renewed, but with no better success. In West Flanders,
                    however, Pichegru was sufficiently strong to commence the siege of Ypres, which
                    was garrisoned by seven thousand men. General Clairfayt made an attempt to raise
                    it, but without success. Reinforcements were sent to Clairfayt from the grand
                    army, to enable him to renew his efforts for the relief of the place, and a
                    series of sanguinary contests ensued, in which that unfortunate general was
                    almost uniformly unsuccessful. Ypres held out till the 17th of June, when it
                    capitulated. In consequence of this and of other events, the Duke of York found
                    it necessary to retreat to Oudenarde; for Jourdan, after storming the Austrian
                    camp of Wattignies, now advanced in such strength upon Charleroi, that its
                    immediate fall was anticipated. But as this would have enabled the two French
                    armies to encircle the whole of Flanders, the Prince of Cobourg advanced to its
                    relief; nevertheless Charleroi surrendered at discretion on the 25th. This
                    circumstance was not known to the Prince of Cobourg when he advanced on the 26th
                    to attack the covering army in their intrenchments near Fleuruβ; but the latter
                    having by this time been reinforced by the accession of the besieging force,
                    repulsed the assailants without difficulty. Jourdan then drew his men out of
                    their intrenchments, attacked the Austrians in his turn, and, though three times
                    repulsed, was at last successful.</p>
                <p>The allies were now obliged to retreat at all points/ Nieuport, Ostend, and
                    Bruges, were taken; and Tournay, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Mons, Oudenarde,
                    and Brussels, at which place the French ' armies of East and West Flanders
                    formed a junction, opened their gates. The allied troops having evacuated Namur,
                    formed a line from Antwerp to Liège, in order to protect the country behind. But
                    the French having advanced in force, attacked General Clairfayt, cut to pieces
                    half the troops which now remained under his orders, and broke the line, upon
                    which the allies retreated before them. The Duke of York was joined by some
                    reinforcements under the Earl of Moira, which had with much difficulty made
                    their way from Ostend; and with these and the Dutch troops he retired to the
                    neighbourhood of Bergen-op-Zoom and Breda for the protection of Holland. The
                    Prince of Cobourg evacuated Liège, crossed the Maese, and threw a garrison into
                    Maestricht; but he soon found it necessary to send back part of his troops to
                    the neighbourhood of Tongres. Here the French armies, to the astonishment of all
                    Europe, made a voluntary pause in their career of victory, and ceased to pursue
                    their retiring foes. The war on the Rhine was equally successful on the part of
                    the French. On the 12th, 13th, and 14th of July, repeated, battles were fought,
                    in which the French obtained their usual success. As their armies were numerous,
                    their practice was to fight in great bodies day after day till their object was
                    accomplished. The Palatinate was next overrun, and Treves taken, by General
                    Michaud. Flanders and the Palatinate have always been accounted the granaries of
                    Germany, and both of them, at the commencement of the harvest, now fell into the
                    hands of the French.</p>
                <p>During the four months which succeeded the fall of Danton, the power of the
                    committees was exercised without opposition and without reserve. Death became
                    the only instrument of government, and the Republic was abandoned to daily and
                    systematic executions. Then were invented the conspiracies of the prisons, which
                    had been crowded by the operation of the law in regard to suspected persons, and
                    which were emptied by that of the 22d Prairial, which might be called the law of
                    the condemned: it was then that the emissaries of the Committee of Public Safety
                    suddenly replaced those of the Mountain; that Carrier, the creature of Billaud,
                    appeared in the west; Maignet, the creature of Couthon, in the south; and Joseph
                    Lebon, the creature of Robespierre, in the north. The .extermination <hi

                    the mitraillades, became still more horrible when effected by means of the
                    noyades of Nantes and the scaffolds of Paris, Arras, and Orange, The terrorists
                    were now so completely united, that they seemed to have but one body and one
                    soul, in which all feelings, sentiments, and desires, had merged in a craving
                    and insatiable appetite for blood. Posterity will find it difficult to credit
                    the extent to which this appetite had grown by what it fed on. “The more the
                    social body perspires, the sounder it becomes,” said Collot-d’Herbois. “It is
                    the dead only who never return,” said Barrère. “The vessel of the Revolution can
                    only arrive in port on a sea reddened with torrents of blood,” said Saint-Just.
                    “A nation is only regenerated on heaps of dead bodies,” rejoined Robespierre.
                    Nor were their actions at variance with the creed they professed. For months
                    together these principles were daily carried into practice in every town in
                    France. Alone and unopposed, the Committee of Public Safety struck numberless
                    blows from one end of the kingdom to the other. The mandates of death issued
                    from the capital, and the guillotine was immediately set to work in almost every
                    town and village of France. Amidst the roaring of cannon, the roll of drums, and
                    the sound of the tocsin, the suspected were everywhere arrested, whilst the
                    young and active were marched off to the frontiers; fifteen hundred bastilles,
                    spread throughout the departments, were found insufficient to contain the
                    multitude of captives; and the monasteries, the palaces, the chateaux, were in
                    consequence converted into prisons. Rapidly as the guillotine did its work,
                    however, it reaped not the harvest of death which everywhere presented itself.
                    But disease came to its assistance, and contagious fevers, produced by the
                    crowded state of the prisons, swept off thousands who had been destined to
                    perish by the revolutionary axe. Over the portals of these dread abodes might
                    have been written the inscription which Dante has placed over the entrance of
                    the infernal regions; hope never crossed their thresholds, and despair of life
                    produced its usual diversified effects on the minds of the unhappy captives.
                    Some sunk into sullen indifference; others indulged in immoderate gaiety; many
                    became frantic with horror; not a few sought to amuse life even at the foot of
                    the scaffold. Rising in one wild and heart-rending chorus might be heard raving,
                    blasphemy, lamentation, commingled with the loud shouts of obstreperous
                    laughter; in short, all the varied sounds which intimate the absence of hope,
                    and a desperate recklessness of the future. Terror was now in its zenith, and
                    death at every door.</p>
                <p>On the 10th of May, Madame Elizabeth, sister of the late king, was sacrificed by
                    the Revolutionary Tribunal; and multitudes of every rank and both sexes daily
                    shared the same fate. The rich were naturally the great objects of persecution,
                    because the confiscation of their property added to the strength of the ruling
                    powers; but neither were the poor safe in their poverty from the vengeance of
                    this ferocious and sanguinary government. No security was to be found in any
                    station of life, however humble or mean; a word, a look, a gesture, might excite
                    suspicion, and suspicion was death. By the instrumentality of the guillotine
                    Robespierre had contrived to destroy every avowed rival. The constituted
                    authorities consisted of persons nominated by hun, or with his approbation; the
                    committees which conducted the business of the state were at Ins disposal, and
                    his will was irresistible throughout the Republic. In the Convention he met with
                    no op-positιon; for that body had ceased to be the turbulent popular assembly
                    which it once appeared, and had become little more than a name employed to give
                    a sort of sanction to such schemes as were proposed to it. But notwithstanding
                    all this, the dictator was last approaching the crisis of <hi rend="superscript"
                    > h,β</hi> fate, and at the very culmmating point of his power destruction
                    awaited both his system and himself. All hope would indeed have been lost if the
                    issue had depended on the efforts of the virtuous classes; these were completely
                    subdued by terror; but as it is the natural effect of suffering to induce a
                    remedy, so it was in the shock of the wicked among themselves that the only hope
                    of salvation remained. From the beginning of 1794, indeed, men gifted with
                    foresight had entertained the conviction that, in pity to an afflicted land,
                    heaven would throw the apple of discord among the tyrants themselves, and strike
                    them with that judicial blindness which is the instrument it makes use of to
                    punish men and nations. Nor was this expectation disappointed. The Girondist
                    party, it is true, was indeed subdued and silent; its illustrious leaders were
                    no more; but many members of the Convention still remained attached to its
                    principles, and deeply repented having ever deserted them. The party , of the
                    Mountain, too, by means of which Robespierre had . risen to power, now found
                    itself not only disregarded, but i ready at every instant to fall a sacrifice to
                    that system of: terror which they had contributed to erect. And even &gt; the
                    Jacobins themselves, though neither timid nor scru- <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi>
                    pulous in the shedding of blood, began to murmur when; they saw that fearful
                    privilege confined to a few, or rather monopolized by one man.</p>
                <p>For a time things remained in this state, during which it ' was seen how possible
                    it isforan individualtogovernagreat nation, even when that nation is hostile to
                    his authority. It is far easier, indeed, to uphold the worst form of government,
                    than to establish the best which human genius or patriotism ever devised. But
                    still the power of Robespierre rested upon no solid foundation, and his fall was
                    therefore inevitable. He had no organized force; his partisans, though numerous,
                    were not organized; he was sustained only by terror and a great force of
                    opinion; and hence, not being able to overpower his enemies by an act of
                    violence, he sought to strike them with dismay. And for a time he succeeded. But
                    such a system soon attains the utmost limit to which it can be urged, and when
                    the tension becomes extreme, the recoil is near at hand. On the day after the
                    festival of the Supreme Being, when the power of the tyrant had reached its
                    apex, his sanguinary intentions were fully disclosed. By the decree of the 22d
                    Prairial, passed on the motion of Couthon, every form, delay, or usage,
                    calculated to protect the accused, was at one fell swoop annihilated. “Every
                    delay,” said Couthon, “is a crime; every formality indulgent to the accused is a
                    crime; the delay in punishing the enemies of the country should not be greater
                    than the time requisite for identifying them.” Accustomed as the Convention had
                    been to blind obedience, a project calculated to place every member of that body
                    at the mercy of the dictator startled its apathy. “If this law passes,” said
                    Ruamps, “nothing remains but to blow out our brains.” But the hour of
                    deliverance had not yet arrived. Robespierre mounted the tribune, and demanded,
                    that instead of pausing on the proposal of adjournment, the assembly should sit
                    until the project of the law was discussed. The assembly felt its weakness, and
                    in thirty minutes the decree was unanimously adopted. From this moment, however,
                    may be dated the commencement of the re-action. Proscriptions increased with
                    fearful rapidity, and the cruelties committed in the provinces equalled, if not
                    exceeded, those perpetrated in the capital. Lebon at Arras, and Carrier at
                    Nantes, revelled in horrors such as the world had never before witnessed. Since
                    the law of the 22d Prairial, heads fell at the rate of fifty or sixty a day; yet
                    the Committee of Public Safety, not satisfied with this dreadful amount of
                    carnage, incessantly urged the public accuser, Fouquier Tinville, to accelerate
                    the executions. But whilst the apprehensions of the terrorists themselves
                    inflamed and maddened their <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515137"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-5137-0090"/>• ferocity,'discord arose in their conclave; the
                    active mem· <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> bers of the committees were divided;
                    on one side were Robespierre, Saint-Just, and Couthon; on the other
                    Billaud-Varennes, Collot-d’Herbois, Barrère, and the members of the Committee of
                    General Safety. After several fruitless attempts to regain his ascendency,
                    Robespierre absented himself from the committees, and threw himself on the
                    Jacobins and the commune, where his influence was still paramount. Meanwhile his
                    more furious partisans urged the immediate adoption of the most vigorous
                    measures. Henriot and the mayor of Paris were ready to commence a new massacre,
                    and three thousand young assassins were provided for the purpose. “Strike soon
                    and strongly,” said Saint-Just. <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Dare</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that is the sole secret of revolutions.”
                    Tallien, Bourdon de 1’Oise, Thuriot, Rovère, Lecombre, Panis, Monestier,
                    Legendre, Fréron, Barras, Cambon, were marked out as the first victims. But as
                    the conspirators had no armed force at their command, as the Jacobin Club was
                    only powerful from its influence on public opinion, and as the committees of
                    government were all arrayed upon the other side, Robespierre was compelled to
                    commence the attack in the Convention, which he hoped to sway by the terror of
                    his voice, or at all events to overwhelm by a popular insurrection similar to
                    that which had proved so successful on the SI st of May. Nor were the leaders of
                    the Convention and the committees idle on their side. The immediate pressure of
                    danger united all parties against the tyrant, who, in the popular society, had
                    made no secret of his resolution to decimate the assembly.</p>
                <p>At length, on the 8th Thermidor (26th July), the contest commenced in the
                    National Convention. The discourse of Robespierre was dark and enigmatical, but
                    its real object was not doubtful. The dictator was listened to with breathless
                    attention; not a sound interrupted the delivery of his speech; not a whisper of
                    applause followed its close. On the proposal that it should be printed, the
                    first symptoms of resistance showed themselves. Bourdon de l’Oise opposed its
                    publication; but Barrère supported it, and the assembly, fearful of prematurely
                    committing itself, agreed to the proposal. Seeing the majority wavering, the
                    Committee of General Safety now deemed it necessary to take decisive steps. The
                    time for dissembling had passed. “One man paralyses the assembly, and that man
                    is Robespierre,” said Cambon. “I would rather that my carcass served for a
                    throne to the tyrant,” said Billaud-Varennes, “than render myself by my silence
                    the accomplice of his crimes.” Fréron proposed to throw off the hated yoke of
                    the committees, and to reverse the decree which permitted the arrest of the
                    representatives of the people; but as Robespierre was still too powerful to be
                    overthrown by the Convention unaided by the committees, this proposal was
                    rejected, and the assembly contented itself with reversing the decree for the
                    publication of his address, which was sent to the committees for examination. In
                    the evening the tyrant, attended by Henriot, Dumas, Coffinhal, and his other
                    satellites, repaired to the popular society, where he was received with
                    enthusiasm; and during the night he made arrangements for disposing his
                    partisans on the following day. The two committees, on their side, were not
                    idle. They sat in deliberation du-: ring the whole night; and it was felt by
                    every one that a ] combination of all parties was requisite to shake the power ι
                    of the tyrant. To this object, accordingly, all their er-ι forts were directed;
                    and, by unremitting exertions, the I Jacobins of the Mountain succeeded in
                    forming a coali- 1 tion with the leaders of the centre and the right. “Do ι not
                    flatter yourselves,” said Tallien to the Girondists, <hi rend="italic">ι</hi>
                    “that he will ever spare you; you have committed an <hi rend="italic">ι</hi>
                    unpardonable offence in being freemen. Let us bury our &lt; ruinous divisions in
                    oblivion. You weep for Vergniaud; ‘ we weep for Danton. Let us unite their
                    shades by striking Robespierre." Before daybreak all the assembly had united for
                    the overthrow of the tyrant.</p>
                <p>At an early hour on the morning of the 9th Thermidor (27th July), the benches of
                    the Convention were crowded with members, and the leaders walked about in the
                    passages confirming one another in their generous resolution. At noon Saint-Just
                    ascended the tribune, and Robespierre took his seat on a bench directly
                    opposite, to intimidate his adversaries by that look which had so often stricken
                    them with terror. But its spell was powerless; fear had now changed sides. As he
                    proceeded to take his seat his knees trembled; and the colour fled from his
                    lips; the hostile appearance of the assembly already gave him an anticipation of
                    his fate. Saint-Just began by declaring that he belonged to no party, and would
                    combat them all. “The course of events has possibly determined,” said he, “that
                    this tribune shall become theTarpeian rock for him who now tells you that the
                    members of the committees have strayed from the path of wisdom.” Here he was
                    vehemently interrupted by Tallien, the intrepid leader of the revolt. “Shall the
                    speaker,” said he, “for ever arrogate to himself, with the tyrant of whom he is
                    the satellite, the privilege of denouncing, accusing, and proscribing the
                    members of the assembly? Shall he for ever go on amusing us with imaginary
                    perils, when real and pressing dangers are before our eyes? After the
                    enigmatical expressions which fell from the tyrant yesterday, can we doubt what
                    Saint-Just is about to propose? You areabout," added he, “to raise the veil; I
                    will rend it asunder. Yes, I will exhibit the danger in its full extent; the
                    tyrant in his true colours. It is the whole Convention which he now proposes to
                    destroy; he knows well, since his overthrow yesterday, that however much he may
                    mutilate that great body, he will no longer find it the instrument of his
                    tyrannical designs.” Loud applauses followed this intrepid declaration. “Two
                    thousand assassins,” he proceeded, “are sworn to execute his designs; I myself
                    last night heard their oaths, and fifty of my colleagues heard them with me. The
                    massacre was to have commenced in the night, with the Committees of Public
                    Safety and General Security, all of whom were to have been sacrificed, excepting
                    a few creatures of the tyrant. Let us instantly take measures commensurate with
                    the magnitude of the danger; let us declare our sittings permanent, until the
                    conspiracy is broken and its chiefs arrested.” Billaud-Varennes gave fuller
                    details of the conspiracy which had been matured in the society of the Jacobins,
                    and de - nounced Robespierre as its chief; at the same time de daring that the
                    assembly would perish if it showed the least symptom of weakness. “We will never
                    perish,” exclaimed the members, rising in a transport of enthusiasm. Tallien
                    then resumed, and in impassioned language called upon the assembly to pass the
                    decree of accusation. During this agitating scene Robespierre sat motionless
                    from terror. The Convention, amidst violent uproar, decreed the arrest of Dumas,
                    president of the Revolutionary Tribunal, Henriot, commander of the national
                    guard, and their associate conspirators; it also declared its sittings
                    permanent, and numerous measures of precaution were &gt;uggested. But as the
                    main object of destroying Robespierre was in danger of being lost sight of
                    amidst these nultifarious proposals, Tallien again ascended the tribune, ιnd, in
                    the most emphatic terms, demanded that the dicator should be declared <hi
                    rend="italic">hors la loi.</hi> “Let there be no 'ormalities with the accused,”
                    said he; “you cannot too nuch abridge his punishment, he has told you so himself
                    ι hundred times.” Robespierre now attempted to obtain ι hearing, but in vain.
                    His voice was drowned by the in- :essant ringing of the president’s bell, and by
                    shouts of ‘ Down with the tyrant,” which resounded throughout <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193515150" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5150-0091"/>the balls. A moment of
                    silence ensued, during which he made a last effort to be heard. “For the last
                    time, president of assassins,” exclaimed he, turning to the chair, “will you
                    allow me to speak?” But Thur!of recommenced ringing his bell; and, amidst
                    renewed cries of “Down with the tyrant,” he sunk on his seat exhausted with
                    fatigue and rage. The foam now issued from his mouth, and his speech failed.
                    “Wretch,” exclaimed a voice from the Mountain, “the blood of Danton chokes
                    thee!” The act of accusation was then passed amidst the most violent agitation;
                    the two Robespierres, Lebas, Couthon, Saint-Just, Dumas, and some others, were
                    unanimously put under arrest, and sent to prison; and, after a scene perhaps
                    unexampled in history, the assembly broke up at five o'clock.</p>
                <p>The Jacobins, who had fully expected that Robespierre would be victorious in the
                    Convention, no sooner heard of his arrest than they instantly gave orders to
                    sound the tocsin, to close the barriers, to convoke the council-general, and
                    assemble the sections; they also declared their sittings permanent, and
                    established the most rapid means of communication between the two centres of
                    insurrection. Meanwhile Henriot endeavoured to excite the people to revolt, by
                    parading the streets, at the head of his staff, with a sabre in his hand,
                    exclaiming, “To arms to save the country.” But having been met by two deputies
                    who prevailed upon some horsemen to obey the orders of the Convention, he was
                    seized, handcuffed, and sent to the Committee of General Safety. Peyan, the
                    national agent, was about the same time arrested; and the Convention seemed
                    triumphant. But between six and seven o’clock the insurgents regained the
                    advantage, chiefly in consequence of the energetic measures of the municipality.
                    Robespierre having been sent to the Conciergerie, and the rest of the
                    conspirators to the other prisons of Paris, the commune sent detachments to
                    deliver them; and Robespierre was speedily brought in triumph to the Hôtel de
                    Ville, where he was joined by his brother and Saint-Just; whilst Coffinhal, at
                    the head of two hundred cannoniers, forced the guard of the Convention,
                    penetrated to the rooms of the Committee of General Safety, and delivered
                    Henriot. The assembly met again at seven o’clock, when it received intelligence
                    of the success of the insurgents, the liberation of the terrorists, the
                    assemblage at the Hôtel de Ville, and the convocation of revolutionary
                    committees, and of the sections. In a short time the delivery of Henriot, and
                    the presence of an armed force around the Convention, were also communicated;
                    and when the agitation was at its height, Amar entered and announced that the
                    cannoniers had pointed their guns against the ball of the assembly. The moment
                    was truly terrible. But in this extremity Tallien and his friends acted with
                    that dauntless intrepidity which so often proves successful in revolutions.
                    Henriot was declared <hi rend="italic">hors la</hi><hi rend="italic">loi,</hi>
                    and Barras appointed to the command of the military, whilst Fréron, Bourdon de
                    1’Oise, and other determined men, were associated with him in this perilous
                    duty; the Committee of Public Safety was fixed on as the centre of operations;
                    and emissaries were instantly dispatched to all the sections to summon them to
                    the defence of the Convention. Fortunately for this body, Henriot in vain
                    attempted to induce the cannoniers to fire. They had obeyed his orders in
                    marching from the Hôtel de Ville, and to this they limited their obedience. The
                    refusal of the cannoniers decided the fortune of this day. Dispirited and
                    alarmed, Henriot withdrew to the Hôtel de Ville; the armed forced followed his
                    example; and the Convention, which had just been besieged in its hall, became
                    the as- ∙ailing party.</p>
                <p>The battalions of the sections, who had been convoked by the emissaries of the
                    Convention, now began to arrive at the Tuileries; and in a short time a
                    considerable force assembled. The night was dark, the moon being in the first
                    quarter; but the public anxiety had supplied this defect by a general
                    illumination. The defenders of the National Convention took the line of the
                    quay, carrying with them several pieces of cannon; they marched in silence,
                    sustaining their courage without the aid of those vociferations and exclamations
                    which are the resource of men who march to pillage and disorder. The space in
                    front of the Hôtel de Ville was filled with detachments of the national guard,
                    who had obeyed the summons of the municipality, companies of cannoniers,
                    squadrons of gendarmerie, and a multitude of individuals, some armed, and others
                    not, but all apparently inflamed with the most violent spirit of Jacobinism,
                    though perhaps in secret actuated by fear alone. At midnight a rumour began to
                    circulate through the ranks of the insurgents that the municipality had been
                    declared <hi rend="italic">hors la loi;</hi> that the sections had joined the
                    Convention; and that their forces were advancing to attack the Hôtel de Ville.
                    In the Place de Grève there were stationed about two thousand insurgents, with a
                    powerful train of artillery; but their firmness was much shaken when the light
                    of the torches showed the heads of the columns of the national guards appearing
                    in all the avenues which lead into the square, and thus made obvious the
                    defection of their fellow-citizens. Still it was a fearful moment. Ten pieces of
                    artillery had been placed in battery by the troops of the Convention; and the
                    cannoniers of the municipality, with burning matches in their hands, stood
                    beside their guns on the opposite side. But happily the authority of the
                    legislature prevailed; its decree which declared the commune <hi rend="italic"
                    >hors la loi</hi> was read by torch-light, and in an instant the Place de Grève
                    was deserted. A few moments afterwards, Henriot descended the stair of the Hôtel
                    de Ville, with a sabre in his hand, and finding no one, “How !” exclaimed he,
                    “is it possible? These scoundrels of cannoniers who saved my life five hours
                    ago, thus abandon me now !”</p>
                <p>With terror In his looks and imprecations in his mouth, Henriot re-ascended the
                    stair, and announced the total defection of the troops. Instantly despair took
                    possession of that band of assassins; every one turned his fury on his
                    neighbour; nothing but mutual execrations could be heard. In a transport of rage
                    Coflinhal seized Henriot in his arms, and exclaiming, “Vile wretch, your
                    cowardice has undone us all,” hurled him headlong down the stair. Saint-Just
                    implored Lebas to put an end to his life. “Coward, follow my example,” exclaimed
                    the latter, and blew out his brains. Robespierre tried to imitate him; but his
                    hand trembled, and he only broke his under jaw, which disfigured him in a
                    frightful manner. Couthon was found under a table, feebly attempting to strike
                    with a knife, which he wanted courage to plunge into his heart; Coffinhal and
                    the younger Robespierre threw themselves from the windows, and were seized in
                    the inner court of the building; Henriot, bruised and mutilated, had contrived
                    to crawl into the entrance of a sewer, out of which he was dragged by the troops
                    of the Convention. Robespierre and Couthon, being thought dead, were dragged by
                    the heels to the Quai Pelletier, where it was proposed to throw them into the
                    river; but when daylight appeared, and it was found that they still breathed,
                    they were stretched on a board and carried to the Committee of General Safety.
                    There, extended on a table, with his visage disfigured and bloody, the fallen
                    tyrant lay for some hours exposed to invectives and execrations, saw men of
                    every party rejoicing in his overthrow, and heard himself charged with all the
                    crimes which had been committed. “Il montra,” says Mignet, “beaucoup
                    d’insensibilité pendant son agonie.” He was then conveyed to the Conciergerie,
                    where for a brief space he occupied <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515163"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-5163-0092"/>the same cell in which Danton, Hebert, and
                    Chaumette had been confined. When brought with his associates before the
                    Revolutionary Tribunal, the process was short; as soon as the identity of their
                    persons had been established, they were ordered for execution. About five in the
                    morning of the 29th July, he was placed on the death-cart, between Henriot and
                    Couthon, who were as mutilated as himself. A linen bandage soaked in blood
                    supported his broken jaw; his countenance was livid, and his eye almost extinct.
                    An immense multitude crowded around the cart, testifying their feelings in loud
                    and reiterated shouts of exultation; some shed tears of joy, others embraced,
                    and others again poured forth execrations against the tyrant, whom, from time to
                    time, the gendarmes pointed out to the people with their sabres. Saint-Just was
                    the only one who evinced any firmness or self-possession; the others, to the
                    number of twenty-two, were excessively dejected. Robespierre was executed the
                    last; when the fatal axe descended, an exulting shout arose, which was prolonged
                    for several minutes after the tyrant was no more.</p>
                <p>With the fall of Robespierre ended the system of terror, of which however he was
                    not the most zealous partisan of his party. Aspiring to supreme power,
                    moderation would have become necessary to him had he succeeded, and terror,
                    which ceased by his fall, would have equally ceased by his triumph. But his
                    destruction was inevitable. He had no organized force; his partisans, though
                    numerous, were not embodied and disciplined; he had only the force of opinion
                    and terror; and being thus unable to surprise his enemies by a sudden act of
                    violence, he sought to strike them with dismay. When fear did not succeed he
                    attempted insurrection; but as the Convention, when supported by the committees,
                    had become courageous, so the sections, reckoning on the courage of the
                    Convention, declared against the insurgents. In attacking the government, he
                    roused the assembly; in rousing the assembly, he let loose the people; and this
                    coalition proved his ruin. The Convention, on the 9th Thermidor, was no longer
                    what it had been on the 31st May; divided and undecided, in the presence of a
                    compact, numerous, and daring faction. All parties were united by defeat,
                    misfortune, and an ever-menacing proscription, and under the pressure of common
                    danger they were prepared to combat together. The overthrow of Robespierre was
                    therefore inevitable. He could not avoid separating himself from the committees.
                    “Au point où il était arrive, on veut être seul, on est dévoré par ses passions,
                    trompé par ses espérances et par sa fortune jusque-là heureuse; et, la guerre
                    one fois déclarée, la paix, le repos, le partage du pouvoir ne sont pas plus
                    possibles que la justice et la clémence lorsque les échaufauds ont été one fois

                    naturally terminate their career on the scaffolds, by which they had sought to
                    establish their power. We may add, that the 9th Thermidor was the first day of
                    the Revolution in which those who attacked had failed. The ascending

                    </table><p>Of the victims sacrificed by Carrier, 500 children were shot, and
                    1500 drowned; 264 women were shot, and 500 drowned; 300 priests were shot, and
                    460 drowned; 1400 nobles were drowned; and 5300 artisans were drowned.</p><p>The
                    general results of this enumeration are strikingly curious. The nobles and
                    priests guillotined are only 2413, whilst the persons of plebeian origin put to
                    death in this manner exceed 13,000. The nobles and priests exterminated at
                    Nantes do not much exceed 2000, the infants drowned and shot amount exactly to
                    this number, and the artisans drowned exceed 5000. It thus appears that the
                    middling and lower ranks were the greatest sufferers by the Revolution, which
                    professed to have been undertaken and carried on exclusively in their interest.
                    Finally, the total number of persons destroyed at Nantes and Lyons alone
                    exceeded the total number guillotined in virtue of the judgments pronounced by
                    the Revolutionary Tribunals, by no less than 42,397.</p><p>In this enumeration
                    are not included the massacres at Versailles, the Abbaye, the Carmes, and other
                    prisons, on the 2d of September; the victims of the Glacière of Avignon; those
                    shot at Toulon and Marseilles; nor the persons slain in the little town of
                    Redoin, which was almost entirely depopulated. (Prudhomme, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>After the fall of Robespierre the Convention exhibited a remarkable change of
                    appearance. Instead of the silence which had formerly prevailed, all was now
                    bustle and activity. The success of the general rising of all the parties
                    against one man destroyed the compression under which they had laboured; but the
                    momentary union which had ensured the victory was soon at an end, and the
                    conquerors speedily arranged themselves into two parties, namely, that of the
                    committees, and that consisting of partisans of the Mountain, which received the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">parti</hi><hi rend="italic">Thermidorien.</hi> But the
                    committees were vanquished with Robespierre, and their government lost the <hi
                    rend="italic">prestige</hi> of terror which constituted its whole force. Besides
                    the loss of their chief, they had no longer the commune, whose insurgent
                    members, to the number of seventy-two, were sent to the scaffold, and which,
                    after its double defeat under Hebert and under Robespierre, was not
                    re-organized, and lost in consequence all its influence. The democratic power of
                    the committees accordingly declined, and the Thermidorien party, including a
                    great majority of the Convention, prevailed; whilst a new character was given to
                    that assembly by the coalition of the moderates, Boissy-d <hi rend="superscript"
                    > ,</hi> Anglas, Sièyes, Cam bacérès, Chénier, Thibaudeau, with the Dantonists
                    Tallien, Fréron, Legendre, Barras, Bourdon de l ’ Oise, Rovère, Bentabold,
                    Dumont, and the two Merlins. The former <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515176"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-5176-0093"/>«ystem of terror was consequently declared to be
                    at an end, and a new system of moderatism succeeded, which was carried to as
                    great a height as that of terror had formerly been; and all means were taken to
                    render popular the fall of the tyrant. The committees were organized anew, and
                    their members ordered to be frequently changed. The correspondence between the
                    affiliated Jacobin Clubs was prohibited, and the Jacobin Club itself was at
                    length abolished. This last event was accomplished without difficulty, and that
                    society which had been the great engine of the Revolution was overturned almost
                    without resistance. Seventy-one deputies of the Girondist party, who had been
                    imprisoned since the 31st of May 1793, were set at liberty. The name of Lyons
                    was restored. Some of the agents of Robespierre, particularly Lebon and Carrier,
                    the former of whom had signalized himself by unheard-of cruelties at Arras and
                    Cambray, and the latter at Nantes, were brought before the Revolutionary
                    Tribunal, condemned, and executed, with the greater part of their
                    accomplices.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lebon was a
                    young man of a feeble constitution, and apparently mild in his disposition. In
                    his first mission he had been humane; but he was reproached by the committee for
                    his lenity, and sent to Arras with orders to show himself a little more
                    revolutionary. Determined not to disappoint the inexorable policy of the
                    committee, he now abandoned himself to the most unheard-of excess; combined
                    debauchery with extermination; had the guillotine, which he called <hi
                    rend="italic">holy,</hi> always in his presence; and made an habitual companion
                    of the executioner, whom he admitted to his table. But Carrier having more
                    victims to destroy, surpassed Lebon in the art of extermination. Bilious,
                    fanatical, and naturally sanguinary, he wanted only an opportunity to execute
                    all which the imagination of Marat would have darc&lt;l to conceive. Sent to the
                    borders of an insurgent country, he condemned to death the whole hostile
                    population, priests, women, children, old men, and young girls. As the scaffolds
                    were not sufficient for his purpose, he had replaced the Revolutionary Tribunal
                    by a company of assassins, called the company of Marat, and the guillotine by
                    scuttled boats, in which he drowned his victims in the Loire. Immediately after
                    the 9th Thermidor, loud cries of vengeance and of justice for these crimes were
                    raised in the Convention. Lebon was first attacked, as he had been more
                    particularly the agent of Kobespierre; the proceedings against Carrier, who had
                    been the agent of the Committee of Public Safety, and whose conduct had been
                    disapproved by Robespierre, were not instituted until some time thereafter; but
                    both happily met the fate which their unparalleled crimes so richly
                    merited.</p></note> Still, however, the Convention appeared so little decided
                    with regard to objects of the first importance, that in all probability they
                    would not have conducted the important struggle against the nations of Europe
                    with more success than the Girondist party had formerly done, if the
                    revolutionary government and the late system of terror had not already
                    accumulated in their hands vast resources, and traced out a plan of procedure,
                    which rendered it comparatively an easy matter to preserve their numerous armies
                    in the train of success to which they were now habituated.</p>
                <p>The allies in their retreat having left strong garrisons in the French towns
                    Condé, Valenciennes, Quesnoi, and Landrecies, which had surrendered to them,
                    these now surrendered to the republican armies with so little resistance, that
                    the conduct of the emperor began to be considered as ambiguous, and he was even
                    suspected of having entered into some kind of compromise with the French. But
                    this suspicion proved groundless; and as soon as the army which had besieged
                    these towns was able to join the grand army under Picħegru and Jourdan, the
                    operations of the campaign were resumed after a suspension of almost two months.
                    The French army divided itself into two bodies. One of these under Jourdan
                    advanced against General Clairfayt, who had succeeded the Prince of Cobourg in
                    the command in the neighbourhood of Maestricht. On the 15th of September the
                    French attacked the whole Austrian posts, extending along a line of five leagues
                    from Liège to Maestricht; and on the following day the attack was renewed with
                    nearly an equal loss on both sides. On the 17th the French, with fifty pieces of
                    cannon, attacked General Kray in his intrenched camp before Maestricht; and the
                    latter was already retiring when General Clairfayt arrived with a strong
                    reinforcement, and, after a severe combat, compelled the French once more to
                    fall back. On the 18th the French having renewed the attack with increased fury
                    upon every part of the Austrian line, obliged the whole to fall back to the
                    neighbourhood of Aix-la-Cha∙ pelle. General Clairfayt now took up a strong
                    position on the banks of the Roer, where he declared it to be his wish that he
                    might be attacked; but by this time the spirit of his army had been humbled,
                    desertions were numerous, and discipline became extremely relaxed. On the first
                    of October the French crossed the Maese and the Roer, attacked the whole
                    Austrian positions from Ruremond to Juliers, and, after a bloody engagement,
                    compelled the brave and active though unfortunate Clairfayt hastily to repass
                    the Rhine with the loss of ten or twelve thousand men. The French general did
                    not attempt to cross that river; but one detachment of his army took possession
                    of Coblentz, whilst others laid siege to Venlo and Maestricht, which soon
                    afterwards surrendered.</p>
                <p>In the mean time the French army under Pichegru entered Holland, and having
                    attacked the allied army under the Duke of York between Bois-le-Duc and Grave,
                    forced the advanced post of Boxtel. Lieutenant-general Abercromby was sent to
                    attempt to recover this post, on the 15th of September; but he found the French
                    in such force that he was obliged to retreat. They were in fact discovered to be
                    nearly eighty thousand strong; and the Duke of York, unable to contend against a
                    force so greatly superior, retired across the Maese with the loss of about
                    fifteen hundred men. Pichegru immediately laid siege to Bois-le-Duc. On the 30th
                    of September, Crevecoeur was taken, and Bois-le-Duc surrendered in ten days
                    thereafter.</p>
                <p>The French now followed the Duke of York across the Maese; whereupon the greater
                    part of the allied army under his royal highness crossed the Rhine and took post
                    at Arnheim, whither the remainder followed soon afterwards. Nimeguen was
                    occupied by the French on the 7th of November. At this time the Duke of
                    Brunswick was requested to assume the command of the allied army, and if
                    possible to protect Holland; and with that view he proceeded to Arnheim; but
                    after attentively examining the state of affairs, he declined undertaking the
                    heavy responsibility which such a command would involve. The allied troops had
                    now so often fled before their victorious enemies, they had so long been in want
                    of almost every necessary, and had been received so ill by the inhabitants of
                    the countries through which they passed, amongst whom the French cause was
                    extremely popular, that they had lost that regularity of conduct and discipline
                    which alone can afford a reasonable prospect of success in military affairs. The
                    French, on the contrary, well received, abundantly supplied with every thing,
                    and proud of fighting in a popular cause, now conducted themselves with much
                    order, and submitted to the strictest discipline; and, in addition to all these
                    advantages, their leaders had the dexterity to persuade the world that new and
                    unknown arts were employed to give aid to their cause.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>At this period the telegraph was first used
                    for conveying intelligence from the frontiers to the capital, and from the
                    capital to the frontiers. Balloons were also employed by the French during this
                    campaign, to procure knowledge of the position of the ene <pb break="no" n="094"

                    height, but prevented from being carried away by a long line), made plans for
                    the enemy’s encampment, and during at attack send down notice of every hostile
                    movement.</p></note> In human affairs, and more especially in military <pb

                    opinion or moral force is all-powerful. The French soldiers confided in their
                    officers as men possessed of a kind of omniscience, whilst the allied troops
                    attributed their misfortunes to the incapacity of those in command, and beheld
                    with anxiety new contrivances employed against them, the importance of which was
                    magnified by ignorance, or exaggerated by fear.</p>
                <p>Whilst these events were occurring in the north, the French arms were scarcely
                    less successful on the side of Spain. Bellegarde was taken, Fontarabia and St
                    Sebastian surrendered, and the whole kingdom of Spain seemed panic-stricken.
                    That feeble government, with an almost impregnable frontier and the most
                    powerful fortresses, made but little resistance; and the difficult nature of
                    their country seemed now their only protection. The history of this war is
                    merely a list of victories gained by the French. On the 17th of November the
                    French general Dugommier was killed in an engagement fought in the Eastern
                    Pyrenees, where, however, his army was successful. On the 20th of the same month
                    the French again attacked the Spaniards, and routed them with the bayonet,
                    without firing a single shot. Tents, baggage, and cannon, for an army of fifty
                    thousand men, fell into the hands of the conquerors, along with the greater part
                    of the province of Navarre. Towards the end of the year an army of forty
                    thousand Spaniards, intrenched behind eighty redoubts, the work of six months,
                    suffered themselves to be completely defeated; their general was found dead upon
                    the field of battle, and the whole Spanish artillery was taken. Three days
                    afterwards, Figueiras, containing a garrison of above nine thousand men,
                    surrendered, although it mounted a hundred and seventy-one pieces of cannon, and
                    possessed abundance of provisions. The French continued their conquests; Rosas
                    surrendered, and the whole province of Catalonia was left at the mercy of the
                    invaders.</p>
                <p>But the successes of this wopderful campaign were not yet terminated; the last,
                    and perhaps the most important, although no great effort was necessary to its
                    execution, yet remains to be noticed. The winter had now set in with uncommon
                    severity. For some years past the seasons of Europe had been uncommonly mild;
                    there had been little frost in winter, and no intense heat in summer. But during
                    the preceding season the weather had been remarkably dry until the latter part
                    of the harvest, when there fell a considerable, though by no means an unusual,
                    quantity of rain. Towards the end of December a severe frost bound up the whole
                    of the rivers and lakes of Holland, and in the beginning of January the Waal was
                    frozen over, which had not occurred for fourteen years past. Taking advantage of
                    this circumstance, the French crossed that river on the ice, and seized with
                    little opposition the important pass of Bommel!, which at other seasons is so
                    strong by reason of its inundations. The allied army, having been joined by
                    seventeen thousand Austrians, had received orders to defend Holland to the last
                    extremity. They did so, and were successful in repulsing the French for some
                    days between the Waal and the Leck; but the republican army, amounting t <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi> seventy thousand men, having at last advanced in full
                    force, the allied troops were compelled to retire across the Yssel into
                    Westphalia. In the course of their march through this desert country, in the
                    midst of severe frost and deep snow, they suffered
                    incredi-blehardships,andlostagreatnumberofmen. The French, in the mean time,
                    advanced rapidly across the country to the Zuyder-Zee, to prevent the
                    inhabitants from flying and carrying off their property. On the 16th of January
                    1795 a party of horse, without resistance, took possession of Amsterdam. The
                    other towns surrendered at discretion; and in consequence of an order from the
                    States-General, Bergen-op-Zoom, Williamstadt, Breda, and other strong places,
                    opened their gates to the French. By the intenso frost, thefleet and the
                    shipping were fixed in their stations, and became a prey to the enemy, who thus,
                    with little effort, made a complete conquest of this rich and highly-defensible
                    country. The people were almost everywhere favourable to their cause; and in
                    fact the power of the stadtholder had been supported solely by the influence of
                    Prussia and England. Through hatred of this office, which had now become odious
                    chiefly to the mercantile aristocracy of Holland, the people were unfriendly to
                    the allies, and, during the war, gave them as little support as possible. The
                    stadtholder and his family now fled to England. And thus terminated a campaign,
                    in the course of which, even before the conquest of Holland, the French had
                    taken two thousand pieces of cannon and sixty thousand prisoners; whilst after
                    that event the conquered territories added a population of nearly fourteen
                    millions to the Republic. Luxembourg and Mayence were the only places on the
                    Rhine which resisted them. But the former was closely blockaded; and the latter,
                    though several times assaulted, successfully held out.</p>
                <p>As the constitution which had been framed in the year 1793 was justly deemed
                    impracticable, a committee was appointed to frame a new one. It was composed of
                    Sièyes, Cambacérès, Merlin de Douai, Thibaudeau, Mathieu, Lesage de 1’Eure, and
                    Latouche. On the 19th of April Cambacérès reported that, in the opinion of the
                    committee, a commission should be appointed for this important purpose; and a
                    number of qualified persons were accordingly chosen, whilst all citizens were
                    invited to communicate their sentiments upon the subject, and the committee was
                    instructed to order the best plans to be published. The feelings of the nation
                    at large received additional gratification from the conduct of the Convention
                    towards Fouquier-Tinville, the public accuser,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>"Je demande," said Fréron, making himself the
                    organ of public indignation; "je emande qu'on purge enfin la terre de ce
                    monstre, et que Fouquier aille cover, dans les enfers, le sang qu'il a
                    versé."</p></note> and fifteen judges and jurors of the Revolutionary Tribunal.
                    Having been fully convicted on the 8th of May, they were executed on the 9th,
                    amidst the loud execrations of a vast multitude of spectators.</p>
                <p>But although the Jacobins were defeated on the 1st and 2d of April, they did not
                    consider themselves as entirely subdued. On the contrary, they were now plotting
                    a more extensive insurrection, which was not to be confined to the capital
                    alone, and they had fixed upon the 20th of May as the period of revolt. In
                    truth, the Convention had been borne along too rapidly by the force of the
                    re-action, and, in its desire at once to repair and to punish, it fell into a
                    most imprudent excess of justice. In this way it drove to despair a numerous
                    party, which had ceased to be formidable, and by threatening it with vast and
                    eternal reprisals, left it no resource but in insurrection, to which many were
                    but too well disposed from other causes, including famine. The arrest of
                    Billaud-Varennes, Collot-d’Herbois, Barrère, and Vadier, not to mention other
                    circumstances, convinced the Jacobins that their whole party was doomed to
                    destruction. Accordingly, on the morning of the day fixed on, the tocsin
                    sounded, and the drums beat to arms in the faubourgs of Saint Antoine and Saint
                    Marceau, in which the Jacobins had always enjoyed the greatest influence. The
                    Convention met on the first alarm; but although the insurrection was far from
                    being a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515202" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5202-0095"/>
                    secret, the Committee of Public Safety did not appear to have taken any measures
                    to prevent it; and it was only at the moment when the insurgents were
                    approaching that General Hoche was appointed to the command of the armed force,
                    and sent to collect the military and citizen* for the protection of the
                    Convention. The hall was presently surrounded, the guards were overpowered, and
                    the mob forced their way into the midst of the assembly. The multitudes of women
                    who appeared on this occasion shouted for bread and the constitution of 1793.
                    Vernier, the president, a man far advanced in years, quitted the chair to
                    Boissy-d’Anglas, who kept it with unexampled fortitude during the remainder of
                    the day. The mob had written on their hats with chalk, “Bread, the constitution
                    of 1793, and the liberation of the patriots.” One of the party attached to the
                    Convention having imprudently torn off the hat of one of the insurgents, the
                    multitude attacked him with swords; and he was killed by a musket shot as he
                    fled for protection towards the chair of the president. The majority of the
                    members gradually retired from this scene of lawless intrusion, and left the
                    multitude masters of the hall; but several of the members who remained espoused
                    the cause of the insurgents. The triumph of the latter, however, was but of very
                    short continuance. In the evening they were overpowered by a large body of
                    military, aided by the citizens; the powers of the Convention were restored; and
                    the deputies who had espoused the cause of the mob were put under arrest. But
                    this day decided nothing.</p>
                <p>It would appear, indeed, that the Convention and the citizens of Paris considered
                    their triumph as complete; at all events no measures were adopted sufficient to
                    prevent the repetition of a similar outrage. The Jacobins, however, were by no
                    means disposed to consider their cause as desperate. Next day they collected
                    their forces in the suburbs, and in the afternoon made a second attempt to
                    regain the ascendency. The Place de Carrousel was taken without opposition, and
                    some pieces of cannon were even pointed against the hall of the Convention. The
                    members, being wholly unprotected, now endeavoured to gain over the mob by
                    flattery; they fraternised with the faubourgs, without however making them any
                    positive promise; and the intruders retired on receiving an assurance that the
                    Convention was solicitously occupied with the means of procuring subsistence,
                    and that it would soon publish the organic laws of the constitution of 1793. On
                    the 23d, the citizens assembled, and proceeded to the Tuileries to defend the
                    Convention from insult and violence. The military also collected in considerable
                    force; and the Convention, at length encouraged to act on the offensive, decreed
                    that if the faubourg of Saint Antoine did not immediately surrender its arms and
                    cannon, together with the assassin of Féraud, who had been murdered in the very
                    hall whilst covering the president with his body, it would be declared in a
                    state of rebellion. The generals of the Convention at the same time received
                    orders to reduce it by force if necessary; and the insurgents, finding
                    themselves unequal to the conflict, were forced to surrender unconditionally, in
                    order to preserve their property from the depredations of the military. All
                    soldiers found amongst the prisoners were put to death. Six members of the
                    Convention who had been concerned in the insurrection were also tried by a
                    military commission, and condemned. These were Goujon, Bourbotte, Romme, Duroy,
                    Duquesnoy, and Soubrany, all democrats of the Mountain party. When they heard
                    the sentence pronounced they all stabbed themselves with the same knife, which
                    they passed from one to another, exclaiming <hi rend="italic">Vive la
                    République.</hi> Romme, Goujon, and Duquesnoy were fortunate enough to strike
                    home; the other three were conducted to the scaffold in a dying “ate, but with
                    their countenances still serene.</p>
                <p>In the south of France, the Jacobins, equally turbulent with their brethren in
                    Paris, excited an insurrection at Toulon on the 20th of May; seized on the
                    gates, which they planted with cannon; set at liberty such of their associates
                    as had been incarcerated; and detained the fleet which was about to put to sea.
                    From Toulon they proceeded to Marseilles, forming in all a body about three
                    thousand strong, with twelve pieces of cannon; but on their march they were
                    encountered by Generals Charton and Pactod, by whom they were defeated, and
                    three hundred sent as prisoners to Marseilles.</p>
                <p>The Mountain party were now much reduced, and exposed in many places to violent
                    persecution; indeed associations were formed for the purpose of avenging the
                    crimes committed by them during the continuance of their power. The character of
                    Robespierre’s government, and the amount of suffering which it inflicted on
                    persons of all ranks and parties, renders it truly astonishing that any number
                    of men should hazard their lives in attempting its restoration. The party was of
                    course gradually abandoned on the fall of the tyrant; but there still remained a
                    small number of its adherents, men of superior activity and enterprise, but
                    uncompromising republicans, who fancied they beheld the revival of royalty and
                    aristocracy in every attempt to establish a mild, sober, and regular government.
                    Hence, even amidst the universal odium cast upon them, the Jacobins expected to
                    rise once more into power; and, what is more singular, the revival of their
                    strength may be dated from the unsuccessful insurrection to which we have just
                    adverted. Their unpopularity began to affect even the Convention, for the people
                    remembered how tamely that body had submitted to the tyranny of Robespierre, and
                    how the majority of its members had been the servile instruments of his power.
                    The press being now free, the most hideous picture of their conduct was
                    accordingly held up to the public; and the greater number began to repent of
                    their victory over the Jacobins, which they foresaw might in the end prove fatal
                    to themselves.</p>
                <p>On the 23d of June, Boissy-d’Anglas presented the report of the committee
                    relative to the project of a new constitution. Like its predecessors, it was
                    prefaced with a declaration of the rights of man, and, besides, consisted of
                    fourteen chapters on as many different subjects, viz. the extent of the
                    republican territories; the political state of citizens; primary assemblies;
                    electoral assemblies; the legislature; the judicial authority; the public force;
                    public instruction; the finances; foreign treaties; the mode of revising the
                    constitution; with a provision that no rank or superiority should exist amongst
                    citizens except such as might arise from the exercise of public functions. The
                    legislature was composed of two assemblies; the Council of the Ancients,
                    consisting of two hundred and fifty members, into which none but married men and
                    widowers turned of forty could be admitted; and the Council of Five Hundred,
                    consisting of as many members, who enjoyed the exclusive privilege of proposing
                    the laws, whilst the Council of Ancients might reject or oppose, but without
                    having powet to alter, the bills or projects of law submitted to them. The
                    executive power was intrusted to five persons, who were required to be forty
                    years of age at least, and denominated the Executive Directory. The two councils
                    had the power of electing its members; the Council of Five Hundred proposing ten
                    times as many candidate⅛ as could be chosen, whilst the Council of Ancients
                    selected the five directors from amongst the fifty candidates thus designed. One
                    member of the Directory was to go out of office annually, by which means they
                    wouk all be changed in the course of five years. In enacting laws the Directory
                    had no vote, being appointed mere!) to superintend their execution, to regulate
                    the coining <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515215" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5215-0096"/>of
                    money, and to dispose of the armed force. The treaties made by the Directory
                    with foreign courts were not binding without the sanction of the legislature,
                    and war could not be declared without a decree of the two assemblies. All the
                    articles of the new constitution underwent each a separate discussion, after
                    which they were ordered to be transmitted to the primary assemblies for their
                    approbation. Previously to this event, however, the Convention, in order to
                    avert the danger which now threatened it from the loss of public favour, decreed
                    that at the approaching general election the electors should be bound to return
                    two thirds of the present members; and if this failed, that the Convention might
                    themselves fill up the vacancies. Decrees to this effect accompanied the
                    constitution; but at Paris the idea of re-electing two thirds of the old members
                    was rejected with indignation, and the absurdity of doing so pointed out with
                    every expression of acrimony and contempt.</p>
                <p>The Convention, however, did not fail to publish the approbation of the decrees,
                    as well as of the constitution, by the primary assemblies; although it is pretty
                    certain that great numbers had confounded the one with the other, and given
                    their approbation accordingly. Such, indeed, was the rage of many against the
                    Convention, on account of the decrees already mentioned, that it was even
                    proposed to try all the members before a new revolutionary tribunal, and to
                    punish each according to his crimes. The sections remonstrated to the Convention
                    against the decrees, and the more eager they appeared in the matter, the more
                    persuaded was the Convention of its own imminent danger. Every remonstrance was
                    accordingly disregarded, and the contending parties formed the resolution of
                    settling the question by force.</p>
                <p>About a hundred electors of Paris met in the hall of the theatre in the suburb of
                    St Germain, before the day of meeting which had been appointed by the
                    Convention, and having chosen the Duke de Nivernois as their president, began
                    their debates, absurdly concluding that the sovereignty was vested in the hands
                    of the electors after these had been chosen by the primary sections. A body of
                    troops was sent to dissolve them as an illegal assembly, and this was
                    accomplished without any difficulty, because the citizens had not been unanimous
                    in their sentiments respecting it. This, however, did not prevent the sections
                    from presuming that, by steady perseverance, they would finally prove
                    victorious; they had always found that the party favoured by the co-operation of
                    the Parisian populace had carried their point ever since the commencement of the
                    Revolution. The armed force with which the Convention was surrounded gave the
                    people but little concern, as they had persuaded themselves that the military
                    could never be brought to act against the citizens. The members of the
                    Convention also appeared to suspect their fidelity, and therefore applied
                    forassistance to those very Jacobins whom they had humbled on the 24th of May.
                    If the sections of Paris detested the members for their connection with the
                    atrocities of Robespierre, the Jacobins admired them for this very reason; and
                    from fifteen to eighteen hundred of the latter, released from prison, were put
                    in a state of requisition for assisting the legislative body, and regimented
                    under the denomination of “Battalion of the Patriots of Eighty-nine." The
                    sections of Paris beholding the Convention surrounded by men who had justly
                    obtained the appellations of terrorists and men of blood, now exhibited the
                    strongest desire to engage them. Their leaders designed to make the members
                    prisoners till they could be conveniently brought to trial, and in the interval
                    to conduct public affairs by committees of the sections, till a new legislative
                    body could be chosen. General Miranda was to nave the command of the armed force
                    after the overthrow of the Convention; but as it was still problematical which
                    party would be triumphant, he retired to the country till the event should
                    declare it, ready to share the reward of a conquest to which he had resolved to
                    contribute nothing. The superior officers of the Convention were not to be
                    depended on; but the subalterns and the soldiers continued firm, to which they
                    were strongly exhorted by their Jacobin auxiliaries. It was also greatly in
                    favour of the Convention, that the first moments of enthusiasm were permitted to
                    pass away; this was a fatal error, which no subsequent vigour could repair.</p>
                <p>As the danger, however, was imminent, the Convention had declared its sittings
                    permanent; called around its enceinte the troops in the camp at Sablons; and
                    concentrated its powers in a committee of five persons, instructed to adopt such
                    measures as they should judge necessary for the public safety. These members
                    were Colombe!, Barras, Daunou, Letourneur, and Merlin de Douai. In the night of
                    the 11th Vendémiaire the decree which dissolved the college of electors, and
                    armed the battalion of the patriots of 1789, excited the greatest agitation; the
                    générale was beaten; the section Lepelletier thundered against the despotism of
                    the Convention, and the return of terror; and during the whole day of the 12th
                    it was occupied in disposing the other sections to combat. In the evening, the
                    Convention, not less agitated itself, resolved to assume the initiative,
                    surround the disaffected section, and terminate the crisis by disarming it. The
                    general of the interior, Menou, and the representative Laporte, were charged
                    with this mission. The head-quarters of the sec· tionaries was in the convent of
                    the Filles-Saint-Thomas, before which they were drawn up in order of battle to
                    the number of six or seven hundred. They were surrounded by superior forces, on
                    flank by the boulevards, and in front on the side of the Rue Vivienne. Instead
                    of disarming, however, the chiefs of the expedition parleyed with them; and it
                    was at length agreed that both parties should retire. But scarcely had the
                    troops of the Convention withdrawn when the sectionaries returned in greater
                    force than before. This was to them a real victory, which, being exaggerated in
                    Paris, excited their partisans, augmented their number, and gave them courage to
                    attack the Convention the following day. At eleven o’clock, the latter received
                    information of the issue of this expedition, and the dangerous effect which it
                    had produced. Menou was immediately deprived of the command, which was conferred
                    on Barras; and the latter demanded of the committee of five the appointment, as
                    his second in command, of a young officer who had distinguished himself at the
                    siege of Toulon; “a man,” said he, “of head and resolution, and capable of
                    serving the Republic at such a moment of peril.’ This young officer was
                    Bonaparte, who immediately presented himself before the committee; but nothing
                    in his appearance or demeanour yet indicated his astonishing destinies. Little
                    connected with party, and called for the first time to perform a part on a great
                    scene, his countenance betrayed something of timidity and want of confidence,
                    which, however, he lost in the preparations for action and in the heat of the
                    battle. He caused the artillery to be brought in all haste from the camp of
                    Sablons, and disposed the guns as well as the troops, amounting to five thousand
                    men, on the different points of attack. On the 13th of Vendémiaire (5th
                    October), about mid-day, the enceinte of the Convention had the appearance of a
                    strong place, which could only be taken by assault. The line of defence
                    extended, on the left of the Tuileries, along the river, from the Pont-Neuf to
                    the Pont Louis XV., and on the right occupied all the little streets which
                    debouch into that of Saint-Honoré, from those of Rohan, L’Echelle, and the
                    cul-de-sac Dauphin, to that of the Revolution. In front, the Louvre, the garden
                    of the Infanta, and the Carrousel were planted with cannon; and behind, the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193515228" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5228-0097"/> Pont-Tournant and
                    the Place de la Revolution formed a park of reserve.</p>
                <p>Thue prepared, the Convention waited for the insurgents, who soon advanced upon
                    several points. They had about forty thousand men under arms, commanded by
                    Generals Danican and Duhoux, and an ex-garde-du-corps named Lafond. The
                    thirty-two sections which formed the majority had furnished their military
                    contingents; but of the sixteen others, several sections of the faubourgs had
                    their troops in the battalion of 1789; some sent reinforcements during the
                    action, others, though well disposed, were unable to do so, and a few remained
                    neutral. About three o'clock General Carteaux, who occupied the Pont-Neuf with
                    four hundred men and two four pounders, was overpowered by several columns of
                    sectionaries, and obliged to fall back as far as the Louvre. This advantage
                    emboldened the insurgents, who were in force upon all points, and General
                    Danican now summoned the Convention to withdraw the troops and to disarm the
                    terrorists. Several members declared for conciliatory measures. Boissy-d’Anglas
                    was for entering into a conference with Danican; Gamon proposed a proclamation,
                    in which, on the citizens engaging to retire, the Convention should promise to
                    disarm the battalion of 1789; and Lanjuinais, after some observations on the
                    imminence of the danger, and the miseries of civil war, supported this
                    proposition. But Chénier having declared that there was now nothing for the
                    National Convention but victory or death, that body, on the motion of Fermoud,
                    passed to the order of the day. Seven hundred muskets were now brought in, and
                    the members of the Convention armed themselves as a corps de reserve. The combat
                    began in the Rue Saiñt-Honoré, of which the insurgents were masters; the first
                    shots proceeded from the Hôtel de Noailles, and a heavy fire was instantly
                    opened along the whole of that line. On the other flank, two columns of
                    sectionaries, about four thousand strong, commanded by Count de Maulevrier,
                    debouched by the quays a few minutes afterwards, and attacked the Pont-Royal.
                    The battle now became general; but it could not last long, as the place was too
                    formidably defended to be taken by assault. After an hour’s hard fighting the
                    sectionaries were driven out of Saint-Roch and the Rue Saint-Honoré, by the
                    cannon of the Convention and the battalion of 1789. The column of the Pont-Royal
                    received three discharges of artillery, directly along the bridge, and obliquely
                    from the quays, by which means it was completely shattered, and driven back in
                    the greatest disorder. At seven o’clock, the troops of the Convention,
                    victorious at all points, assumed the offensive; and at nine they had dislodged
                    the sectionaries from the theatre of the Republic, and the posts which they
                    occupied in the neighbourhood of the Palais-Royal. The latter had prepared to
                    form barricades during the night; but several discharges of round shot fired
                    along the Rue Richelieu prevented them. On the morning of the 14th the
                    Conventional troops disarmed the section Lepelletier, and re-established order
                    in the others. The victory was used with moderation. The assembly had only
                    combated in its own defence, and had no vengeance to gratify.</p>
                <p>The victors attributed this insurrection to the influence of the royalists; but
                    whether they were right in this opinion or not, it is certain that the cause of
                    royalty had now become less odious to the people generally than the bloody
                    extravagance of republicanism; though, as to the mob, they seem to have looked
                    no further than the disarming of the Jacobins, and obtaining new
                    representatives. The sittings of the Convention terminated on the 27th of
                    October, and it was succeeded by the new legislature, in terms of the
                    constitution. Amongst its last decrees was one granting a general amnesty for
                    all crimes and proceedings of a revolutionary nature; but the emigrants,
                    transported priests, and every one concerned in the last insurrection, were
                    excluded from the benefit of it.</p>
                <p>The first step of the new legislature was to divide itself into two councils, and
                    proceed to the election of an’ Executive Directory. The Council of Five Hundred
                    was, bound to present to the other council fifty candidates, andι a list was
                    accordingly made out; but it consisted of no more than the five whom the council
                    wished to be chosen, the other forty-five being obscure persons, farmers and
                    peasants, so that the Council of Ancients, deprived of all power of election,
                    were obliged to appoint Sièyes, Barras, Rewbell, Lareveillère-Lepeaux, and
                    Letourneur de la Manche, none of the others being qualified for the office.
                    Sièyes, however, did not deem it prudent to become one of the five republican
                    kings; and on his declining to accept of the new dignity, Carnot was appointed
                    in his stead. The form of government now established did not promise to be
                    productive of much happiness or tranquillity, as the most important offices in
                    the state were filled by men odious to the people. The members of the Executive
                    Directory, excepting only Lareveillère-Lepeaux, had always been connected with
                    the party of the Mountain, and employed the Jacobins in almost every official
                    department; a circumstance which could scarcely fail to render the government
                    peculiarly obnoxious. It was feared that a directory chosen by the Jacobins, and
                    new legislators appointed by the people, might one day be the means of totally
                    subverting the constitution; and the result showed that this apprehension was
                    not groundless.</p>
                <p>On the 10th of April a treaty of peace with the king of Prussia was presented to
                    the Convention, in order to be ratified. By virtue of this treaty, it was agreed
                    that the republican troops should be immediately withdrawn from the territories
                    of Prussia on the right bank of the Rhine, but that the territories which France
                    then possessed on the left bank of that river should be retained till a general
                    peace. A mutual exchange of prisoners of war was agreed on, and the intercourse
                    between the two countries placed on its former footing. Measures were also
                    adopted to transfer the theatre of hostilities from the northern parts of
                    Germany. The king of Sweden at the same time acknowledged the French Republic,
                    and his ambassador was received at Paris with great solemnity. In the month of
                    May another treaty was concluded with Prussia, which had a special reference to
                    the line of neutrality. The cantons of Switzerland followed the example of the
                    king of Sweden; and on the 22d of July a treaty of peace was also concluded at
                    Basle, between the Republic and the court of Spain, in consequence of which
                    France gave up all the conquests she had made in that country, and the original
                    frontier was restored; whilst, in return, the Republic received all the Spanish
                    part of St Domingo. In this treaty the Dutch Republic was included, and the
                    mediation of the king of Spain, in favour of Portugal and the Italian princes,
                    was accepted by France.</p>
                <p>On the 9th of June, the dauphin, the heir to the throne of the unfortunate Louis
                    XVI., and also his only son, died in the prison of the Temple, where he had been
                    confined with his sister since the death of his father. His death interested the
                    French nation so deeply in favour of his family, that the Convention found it
                    prudent to liberate the princess. The Committee of Public Safety proposed to the
                    emperor to give her in exchange for the commissioners whom Dumouriez had sent as
                    prisoners to the Austrians, together with Semonville and another person, who had
                    been seized on their way to Turkey as envoys extraordinary from the French
                    Republic.. This proposition was agreed to, and the exchange took place in
                    consequence, at Basle in Switzerland.</p>
                <p>If Britain was unfortunate upon the Continent, she still retained her superiority
                    on her own element. On the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515241"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-5241-0098"/>14th of March a fleet under Admiral Hotham engaged
                    a French fleet, and took two sail of the line, the Ça Ira and Censeur; but this
                    was nearly counterbalanced by the loss of the Berwick and Illustrious. Three
                    French ships of the line were captured by Lord Bridport on the 23d of June, in
                    an attack on the enemy’s fleet off Port L'Orient; the rest effected their
                    escape. Britain having thus evinced her usual superiority by sea, advantage was
                    taken of this circumstance to send assistance to the royalists in the western
                    departments; but unfortunately for them it came too late. The Convention had
                    offered them a treaty, which was accepted and signed at Nantes on the 3d of
                    March, by deputies from the Convention on the one part, and, on the other, by
                    Charette, Sapineau, and the rest of the chiefs of La Vendée, and by Cormartin,
                    as representatives of the party called Chouans. Stofflet also submitted to the
                    Republic on the 20th of April. But the countenance given by Britain to the
                    royalists induced them to disregard these treaties. The troops sent to their aid
                    were composed of emigrants in the pay of Great Britain, and a number of
                    prisoners who had agreed to join the royal cause. Puisaye commanded this motley
                    army, and the Count de Sombreuil afterwards joined him with an inconsiderable
                    reinforcement. The expedition arrived in the bay of Quiberon on the 25th of
                    June, and arms were put into the hands of the inhabitants of the country; but it
                    was soon found that the latter could not be of much advantage to regular troops.
                    A resolution was therefore adopted to withdraw the emigrant army within the
                    peninsula of Quiberon; and the fort of the same name, with a garrison consisting
                    of about six hundred men, was taken on the 8d of July, and occupied by the
                    emigrants. But all the posts without the peninsula were carried by an army under
                    General Hoche, the emigrants and Chouans escaping in the boats of the British
                    fleet, or flying for protection under the cannon of the fort. The republicans
                    then began to erect formidable works on the heights of St Barbe, which commanded
                    the entrance of the peninsula. To prevent these operations, a sally was made
                    from the fort on the 7th, but without effect; and another in still greater force
                    had no better success. The whole forces in the peninsula, including Chouans,
                    amounted to about twelve thousand men, five thousand of whom were sent to attack
                    the heights of St Barbe. On this position the republicans were intrenched in
                    three camps, two of which were taken without difficulty; but as the emigrants
                    rushed forward to attack the third, a masked battery was opened upon them with
                    grape shot, which caused a dreadful slaughter, and few of the emigrants would
                    have effected their escape, had not the fire of the British ships compelled the
                    republicans to abandon the pursuit.</p>
                <p>It was now evident what would be the fate of this expedition, and desertion
                    amongst the emigrants became very frequent, especially those who had been
                    liberated from prison on condition of serving against the Republic. On the
                    evening of the 20th, the weather was tempestuous, and this induced the emigrants
                    to indulge in a fatal security. The troops of the Republic were conducted in
                    silence along an unguarded part of the shore, and surprised one of the posts,
                    where they found the artillerymen asleep. They extinguished the lanthorn which
                    was intended to give the British fleet the alarm, and seized on their matches.
                    Some of the emigrants threw down their arms and joined the republicans, whilst
                    others maintained an obstinate contest before they surrendered. The Count de
                    Sombreuil was taken and put to death, together with the Bishop of Doi and his
                    clergy; none being spared but such as pretended that their appearing in arms
                    against the republicans was purely owing to compulsion.</p>
                <p>But it is time to return to the affairs of the Continent. Alter a protracted
                    siege Luxembourg surrendered on the</p>
                <p>7th of June, and put the French in possession of the whole left bank of the
                    Rhine, excepting Mayence, which the Austrians could conveniently supply with
                    every necessary from the opposite bank of the river. The republicans therefore
                    determined to cross the river, and to invest it on every side; but the attempt
                    was delayed until the result of the Quiberon expedition should be fully known.
                    In the month of August, the passage of the Rhine at Dusseldorf was effected by
                    Jourdan, who had been appointed commander-in-chief of the army of the Sambre and
                    Meuse. Having driven in the Austrian posts, he crossed the Maine, and invested
                    Mayence and Cassel; whilst Pichegru, having crossed the river near Manheim with
                    the army of the Rhine and Moselle, at the same time took possession of that
                    city. But a strong detachment of this army having driven Wurmser from an
                    important post, began to plunder, and getting into confusion, the Austrians took
                    prompt advantage of the circumstance, returned to the charge, and defeated the
                    republicans. Jourdan was pursued by Clairfayt as far as Dusseldorf, where he
                    made a stand; and Pichegru recrossed the Rhine near Manheim, leaving in that
                    city a garrison of eight thousand men. But after a vigorous siege it surrendered
                    to the Austrians; and the republicans were also driven from the vicinity of
                    Mayence, upon which an armistice of three months was agreed to.</p>
                <p>The Directory, however, still resolved to prosecute the war with vigour, and
                    therefore, during the winter, made great preparations for another campaign. But
                    the Mountain party being again possessed of power, now began to discover their
                    restless and turbulent disposition; incapable of long submitting peaceably to
                    any government, they soon became disgusted with the Directory which they
                    themselves had established, and were continually disturbing the public
                    tranquillity. After the 5th of October, the people of Paris durst not openly
                    avow their abhorrence of the Jacobins; but as it was understood that wearing
                    green cravats was a token of contempt for these partisans, this piece of dress
                    was prohibited by the Directory, on the pretence of its being a mark of
                    attachment to royalty. Ashamed of this absurdity/however, they in a few weeks
                    recalled their edict, and the proscription of green cravats ceased. In the south
                    of France, the authority of the Jacobins produced very serious effects. Fréron,
                    by whom they had been abandoned after the death of Robespierre, rejoined them
                    before the 5th of October, and was sent with full administrative powers to
                    Toulon, where he dismissed the municipality which had been chosen by the people,
                    restored the Jacobin clubs, and caused to be imprisoned every person whom he
                    suspected. Alarmed at the numerous complaints which were made from every quarter
                    against the conduct of these turbulent men, the Directory resolved to obtain the
                    confidence and affections of the people by deserting them entirely. Fréron was
                    recalled from Toulon, and moderate men replaced the Jacobins in most public
                    employments. The Directory also issued a public declaration that its confidence
                    had been abused. The minister of police was charged to remove from Paris the
                    members of former revolutionary tribunals, and such as had been active leaders
                    of the Jacobins; and ten thousand men, called the Legion of Police, who had
                    acted against the Parisians on the 5th of October, and were decidedly favourable
                    to the Jacobins, received orders to join the armies on the frontiers. This
                    induced the violent Jacobins to concert a plan for the ruin of the Directory and
                    the majority of the councils, who had now abandoned them. But their designs were
                    discovered and completely defeated. On the 10th of May the guards were
                    increased, and large bodies of cavalry were stationed round the Luxembourg and
                    Tuileries. The Council of Five Hundred was informed by the Directory that a
                    ter-riblc<pb break="no" facs="nls:193515254" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5254-0099"/> plot
                    was ready to break forth on the ensuing morning. The conspirators, at the
                    ringing of the morning bell, were to proceed in small parties of three or four,
                    to the houses of those persons whom they had singled out for destruction; and
                    having murdered these, they were then to unite in one body against the
                    Directory, whose guard they conceived themselves able to overpower. Some of the
                    leaders of this conspiracy were arrested, amongst whom was Drouet, postmaster of
                    Varennes, who had stopped the unfortunate Louis on his way to the frontiers:
                    with ten others, he was condemned at Vendome, but he subsequently contrived to
                    make his escape. The defeats which the Jacobins thus experienced, and the
                    disgrace into which they had fallen, determined the moderate party in the two
                    councils to attempt to procure the repeal of the decrees of the Convention,
                    which had granted them an amnesty, and confirmed the laws against emigrants. A
                    number of days were occupied in the discussion of these topics, but the moderate
                    party gained nothing in favour of the emigrants; and with respect to the
                    Jacobins, al] they obtained was, that such of that party as had owed their
                    preservation to the amnesty, should be deemed incompetent to hold any public
                    offices.</p>
                <p>; Another matter of no less serious a nature now called for the attention of the
                    republican government. This was the deplorable state of the finances. Whilst the
                    usurpation of Robespierre continued, terror supported the credit of the
                    assignats, which, joined to the sale of the church lands and the property of the
                    emigrants, furnished ample resources; but no provision was at all thought of for
                    future exigencies. If money was wanted, more assignats were fabricated, and no
                    inquiry was made concerning the public expenditure, as no taxes were demanded
                    from the people. The Directory having complained to the councils of the great
                    distress under which they laboured, and of the want of sufficient funds to meet
                    the unavoidable expenses of the ensuing campaign, a law was passed on the 25th
                    of March, giving authority to dispose of the remainder of the church lands at
                    the value formerly fixed on them, namely, twenty-two years’ purchase. A new
                    paper currency, termed <hi rend="italic">mandats,</hi> was also to be issued,
                    and to be received in payment; but government had now lost aD credit, and the
                    mandats became rapidly depreciated in value, which increased the demand for
                    national property. To prevent this, the legislature decreed that one fourth of
                    every purchase should be paid in cash; a provision which obstructed the sale of
                    the national property, and increased the circulation of mandats.</p>
                <p>During the preparations for the approaching campaign, the Directory attempted to
                    render themselves popular at l∙ home, by establishing, under the protection of
                    government, the French National Institute. Every man of science or learning who
                    had escaped the persecution of the Mountain party was invited to become a
                    member; and it was opened on the 4th of April, in the hall of the Louvre, when
                    the ambassadors of Spain, Prussia, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, America, Tuscany,
                    Genoa, and Geneva, were present, and the members of the Directory attended in
                    their robes of state. The directorial president expressed the determination of
                    the executive government to afford every encouragement to the improvement of
                    science, literature, and the arts; and the president of the Institute replied
                    that it was the determination of the members to endeavour to give lustre to the
                    republican government, by the exercise of their talents, and by their
                    publications. The speeches were enthusiastically applauded by a multitude of
                    spectators, and the general expectation was, that France would now enter upon a
                    career of glory and prosperity wholly unprecedented in her past history.</p>
                <p>About this time an approach towards a negotiation with France was made on the
                    part of Great Britain, through Mr Wickham, ambassador to the Swiss Cantons. On
                    the 8th of March a note was communicated to Μ. Barthélémy, ambassador of the
                    French Republic, in which it was inquired, whether France would be willing to
                    send ministers to a congress to negotiate peace with his Britannic majesty and
                    his allies? whether she would be inclined to communicate the general grounds
                    upon which she would be willing to cone!ude peace, that his majesty and his
                    allies might consider them in concert? and, whether she would desire to
                    communicate any other mode of accomplishing a peace? Any answer which might be
                    returned was directed to be transmitted to the British court; but it was at the
                    same time intimated that Mr Wickham had no authority to discuss these subjects.
                    On the 26th of the same month an answer was returned by Barthélémy in name of
                    the Directory, complaining of the insincerity of the British court in giving its
                    ambassador no authority to negotiate, and stating that the proposal of a
                    congress rendered negotiation endless. The Directory expressed their wish to
                    obtain peace, but declared that no portion of territory would be relinquished
                    which, in virtue of the constitutional decree, formed part of the Republic. To
                    this note no reply was made; but it was complained of to the foreign ministers
                    resident at the court of London, and considered as leaving Britain no
                    alternative but the prosecution of the war.</p>
                <p>During the winter season the Directory found means to reduce the western
                    departments. The expedition from England had tempted the royalists once more to
                    try their' fortune in the field; but after a number of defeats, their leaders,
                    Charette and Stoffict, were apprehended and put to death on the 29th of March;
                    and this tended to suppress the insurgents in every quarter. Domestic enemies
                    being thus subdued, the republican government was enabled to make the most
                    vigorous exertions on the frontiers. Their military force was divided into three
                    armies: the army of the Sambre and Meuse under Jourdan, principally stationed
                    about Dusseldorf and Coblentz; the army of the Rhine and Moselle, commanded by
                    General Moreau, stationed on the Upper Rhine, from Landau to Treves; and the
                    army of Italy, which occupied the Italian coast from Nice towards Genoa, the
                    command of which was now bestowed on General Bonaparte, who had so greatly
                    signalized himself on the 13th Vendémiaire.</p>
                <p>The army of Italy, which had hitherto operated on the flank of the Alps, was
                    destitute of every thing, and scarcely thirty thousand strong; but it was full
                    of courage and <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> patriotism, and by means of it
                    Bonaparte commenced that ' brilliant career of victory which had nearly
                    terminated in J the subjugation of all Europe. His plan was to debouch ‘ into
                    Italy between the Alps and the Appennines, to turn the former range, intersect
                    the enemy’s line, and operate on his flanks. He had before him the allied force,
                    consisting of ninety thousand men, placed in the centre under Argen-tau, on the
                    left under Colli, and on the right under Beaulieu; but in a few days this
                    immense force was dispersed by prodigies of genius and of courage. On the 9th of
                    April the campaign was opened by General Beaulieu attacking the post of Voltri,
                    six leagues from Genoa; the republicans defended themselves till the evening,
                    when they retreated to Savona. Next day Beaulieu renewed his attempts, and
                    penetrated to Montenotte, which was occupied by Colonel Rampon, with fifteen
                    hundred men. In a moment of enthusiasm, their commander prevailed on them to
                    swear that they would never abandon their post; and they kept their oath; for,
                    in spite of every effort that could be made on the part of the enemy, they
                    succeeded in arresting the progress of the Austrian general during the remaining
                    part of the day. During the night the right wing of the French army, under
                    Laharpe, took up a position in rear of the redoubt of Montenotte; whilst
                    Bonaparte, Massena, Berthier, and Salicetti, advanced by Altara, to take the
                    enemy in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515267" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5267-0100"/>flank
                    and rear. Powerful reinforcements were in the mean time sent to Beaulieu, who,
                    on the morning of the 11 th, again attacked the position of Montenotte; but the
                    obstinate resistance of Laharpe, and the approach of Massena, at length forced
                    the Austrians and Sardinians to give way on all sides; two of the enemy’s
                    generals were wounded, and two thousand five hundred men became prisoners. The
                    republicans pursued them beyond Cairo, which, on the following day, fell into
                    their hands.</p>
                <p>On the 13th April, General Augereau forced the defiles of Millesimo, and by a
                    rapid movement surrounded General Provera at the head of fifteen hundred
                    grenadiers; but instead of surrendering, this brave officer forced his way
                    through the enemy, and intrenched himself in the ruins of an old castle situated
                    on the summit of the hill. Augereau with his artillery endeavoured to dislodge
                    him, but without success; he then arranged his troops in four columns, and made
                    an attempt to carry Provera’s intrenchments by storm, which also proved
                    unsuccessful. In this affair the French had two generals killed, and Joubert was
                    wounded. A division was now left to continue the blockade of Provera The hostile
                    armies continued in presence during the 14th. On the following day the Austrians
                    made an attack on the republican centre; but Massena turned the left flank of
                    their left wing in the vicinity of Dego, whilst Laharpe turned the right flank
                    of the same wing; one column kept in check the centre of the Austrians, another
                    attacked the flank of their left wing, and a third gained its rear. They were
                    completely defeated at all points, with the loss, besides killed and wounded, of
                    eight thousand prisoners. General Provera also surrendered.</p>
                <p>After his defeat at Millesimo, Beaulieu made a vigorous effort to change the
                    fortune of war. With seven thousand of his best troops he attacked Dego, where
                    the republicans after their success were indulging in security, and made himself
                    master of the village; but the troops rallied under Massena, who renewed the
                    combat, and employed the greater part of the day in his efforts to retake it.
                    The republicans were thrice repulsed, but Bonaparte having arrived in the
                    evening with reinforcements, the village was retaken, and fourteen hundred men
                    were made prisoners. Bonaparte had now accomplished his object of separating the
                    Austrian and Sardinian armies; for his right wing being secured against the
                    efforts of Beaulieu by the village of Dego, he was enabled to act against the
                    Piedmontese troops with the greater part of his force. Augereau powerfully
                    seconded his exertions, and having opened a communication with the Tanaro,
                    Serrurier was now approaching the town of Ceva, in the vicinity of which the
                    Piedmontese had an intrenched camp with eight thousand men. The redoubts which
                    covered this camp were, on the 16th, attacked by Augereau, who carried the
                    greater number of them, and thus forced the Piedmontese, during the night, to
                    evacuate Ceva, which Serrurier entered in triumph on the morning of the 17th.
                    Count Colli repulsed Serrurier on the 20th; but Bonaparte, on the 22d, defeated
                    the Sardinian general at Mondovi, and there decided the fate of Piedmont. The
                    beaten army endeavoured to make a stand at Fossano, whilst its wings rested on
                    Coni and Cherasco; but on the 25th the latter place was taken by Massena,
                    Fossano by Serrurier, and Alba by Augereau.</p>
                <p>Previously to these movements, however, Count Colli had requested an armistice,
                    which General Bonaparte granted, on condition that the fortresses of Coni, Ceva,
                    and Tortona should be given up to him, with their magazines and artillery, and
                    that he should have permission to cross the Po at Valentia. The armistice was
                    signed on the 29th of April, and a definitive treaty was concluded at Paris on
                    the 17th of May. The conditions, in as far as they concerned his Sardinian
                    majesty, were unquestionably humiliating. The duchy of Savoy was given up to
                    France, as were also the counties of Nice, Tende, and Breteuil; an amnesty was
                    granted to all his subjects who had been prosecuted for political opinions; and
                    it was agreed that the French troops should have free access to Italy through
                    his territory. His Sardinian majesty also bound hims*elf not to erect fortresses
                    on the side of France, to demolish those of La Brunette and Suza, and to confess
                    that his conduct to the last ambassador of the Republic had been

                <p>In the mean time, the republican army advanced towards the Po. Deceived
                    respecting the article of the armistice which stipulated permission to Bonaparte
                    to pass die river at Valentia, Beaulieu, concluding that t⅛e republican chief
                    seriously intended to cross at that place, made every possible preparation to
                    oppose him; whilst Bonaparte rapidly penetrated into Lombardy, and on the 7th of
                    May was sixty miles down the river towards Piacenza before the enemy had
                    obtained information of his march. Ĳe passed the river without difficulty. Six
                    thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry were dispatched by Beaulieu, when it
                    was too late, to oppose the passage of Bonaparte across the river; but they were
                    met and defeated on the following day, near the village of Fiombio, whilst five
                    thousand more who had advanced to their assistance were repulsed by Laharpe. On
                    the 9th an armistice was granted by General Bonaparte to the Duke of Parma, on
                    condition of paying two millions of francs, and delivering ten thousand quintals
                    of wheat, five thousand quintals of oats, and two thousand oxen, for the use of
                    the army. The duke likewise consented to give up twenty of his best paintings,
                    to be selected by the republicans.</p>
                <p>Forced to abandon the Po, General Beaulieu crossed' the Adda at Lodi,
                    Pizzighettone, and Cremona, leaving· some troops to defend the approaches to
                    Lodi. On the 10th, the latter were attacked by the advanced guard of the
                    republicans, who drove them into the town, and pursued them so rapidly that they
                    had not time to break down the bridge on the Adda. The Austrians defended the
                    passage with thirty pieces of cannon, and the republican officers, after holding
                    a consultation, were of opinion that the bridge could not be forced. Bonaparte,
                    however, having addressed his grenadiers, who declared themselves willing to
                    make the attempt, formed them in close column, and, waiting a favourable moment,
                    ordered them to advance. Under cover of the smoke of the enemy’s artillery they
                    reached the middle of the bridge unobserved; but the moment they were perceived
                    a tremendous fire of grape and canister shot in a few seconds strewed the bridge
                    with dead bodies. The republican officers, including the general-inchief, now
                    flew to the head of the column, and, urging on the troops, broke into the
                    Austrian ranks, took the cannon, and forced the enemy to fly in all
                    directions.</p>
                <p>All that seems to have been expected from the campaign of Bonaparte in Italy was
                    to induce the different princes and states to abandon the coalition against
                    France, which every one of them had assisted, either with troops or with money
                    and provisions. But this youthful chief far surpassed all that even the most
                    sanguine had anticipated. The occupation of Alessandria, which opens the w hole
                    of Lombardy; the demolition of the fortresses of Suza and La Brunette on the
                    side of France; the acquisition of the county of Nice and of Savoy; and the
                    disengagement of the other army of the Alps under Kellerman, which was now
                    rendered disposable; such were the fruits of a campaign of fifteen days, during
                    which six victories had been gained. The king of Sardinia was also detached from
                    the coalition against France, and so humbled and weakened as to be no longer in
                    a condition to occasion any uneasiness to that country. Bonaparte likewise made
                    himself master of Ferrara, Bologna, and Urbino, and granted to his holiness and
                    the Duke of Modena an armistice on the usual terms of large contributions in
                    money, as well as in paintings<pb break="no" facs="nls:193515280"

                    France. Terrified by his march into the Roman States, the Neapolitan cabinet, in
                    like manner, requested a peace; and Bonaparte agreed to an armistice without any
                    of the humiliating conditions demanded from the other states of Italy. He next
                    proceeded to Leghorn, in order to drive out the English, and confiscate their
                    property; and thus finished the task assigned him before the campaign on the
                    Rhine had commenced. Mantua, it is true, was still in possession of the imperial
                    troops; but that fortress was in a state of siege, and the rest of Italy had
                    submitted to the French Republic.</p>
                <p>With a view to. lessen the exertions of the republicans <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> in Italy, the contest was renewed in Germany. General Jourdan was
                    therefore instructed to denounce the armistice, and renew hostilities on the
                    31st of May. Jourdan at this time had to contend with General Wartensleben,
                    whilst the archduke put himself at the head of the army in the Hundsruck to
                    oppose Moreau on the Upper Rhine. The commencement of the campaign on the part
                    of the French was distinguished by a singular stratagem, employed with the view
                    of drawing the whole of the Austrian forces to the Lower Rhine, that an
                    opportunity might thus be afforded General Moreau of suddenly entering Suabia,
                    and carrying the war into the hereditary dominions of Austria. Jourdan began to
                    make vigorous exertions, and Moreau remained inactive. On the 31st of May the
                    lines of Dusseldorf were abandoned by the left wing of Jourdan’s army, under the
                    command of General Kleber, who defeated the Austrians in his march towards the
                    Sieg. Advancing with his centre and right wing, Jourdan forced the Austrian
                    posts on the Nahe, effected the passage of the Rhine, blockaded Ehrenbreitstein,
                    and hastened forward as if he had intended to form the siege of Mayence. As
                    these movements brought the archduke into the perilous situation of having
                    Moreau in his front and Jourdan in his rear, he therefore crossed the river in
                    haste, leaving the fortresses of Mayence and Manheim to retard the advance of
                    Moreau, and attacked the advanced guard of General Jourdan, which, after an
                    obstinate conflict, he forced to retire. Jourdan then withdrew to his former
                    position, and Kléber on the 20th entered the lines of Dusseldorf’.</p>
                <p>But the archduke had no sooner withdrawn from the palatinate to force Jourdan
                    down the Rhine, than Moreau marched speedily towards Strasburg, so that the
                    hostile armies seemed to be receding from instead of approaching each other. The
                    passage of the river opposite to Kehl was effected by Moreau on the 24th of
                    June; an operation attended with considerable difficulty, owing to a sudden
                    swell, which prevented the Austrians being taken by surprise, as appears to have
                    been the original intention of the republican commander. The intrenchments on
                    the islands occupied by troops were instantly carried at the point of the
                    bayonet, and two thousand six hundred republicans effected a landing on the
                    opposite bank, where they were exposed to the Austrian cannon from the camp of
                    Wilstedt, and also to the fire of the fort. Still, however, they maintained
                    their ground, and even acted on the offensive, until the boats returned with
                    reinforcements, when the fort and redoubts were carried by storm, and the
                    Austrians retreated towards Offenburg.</p>
                <p>In consequence of the archduke’s departure to the Lower Rhine in pursuit of
                    Jourdan, and the detachments sent to Italy to check the victorious career of
                    Bonaparte, Moreau was in a condition to enter Suabia at the head of a superior
                    force. On the 26th of June he succeeded in compelling the Austrians to abandon
                    their camp at Wilstedt, and next day proceeded with his army in three columns
                    against another body of fifteen thousand men posted near Offenburg. A strong
                    detachment was sent to their assistance by Wurmser, but the reinforcement was
                    defeated on its march by two republican columns, and Offenburg was evacuated
                    during the night. On the 2d of July a body of the French under General Laroche
                    seized on the loftiest point in the ridge of mountains denominated the Black
                    Forest; and the Austrians were next day, after an obstinate resistance, driven
                    from the pass of Friedenstadt, by which their communication with the emigrants
                    under the Prince of Condé was entirely cut off. On the 8th the Austrians were
                    attacked at Rastadt by the left wing of the republican army, commanded by
                    General Dessaix, and, after a most determined resistance, obliged to retreat to
                    Ettingen.</p>
                <p>The archduke now arrived with his army on the Lower Rhine, leaving Wartensleben
                    to check the advance of General Jourdan, who, as soon as he received information
                    of the archduke’s departure, resumed the offensive. Kléber, as before, set out
                    from the lines at Dusseldorf, whilst the centre and right wing crossed the Rhine
                    in the vicinity of Coblentz. The French forced the posts of Ukareth and
                    Altenkirchen; the whole army under Jourdan crossed the Lahn on the 9th of July;
                    and next day Wartensleben was defeated with great slaughter, and the loss of
                    five hundred prisoners. On the 12th the republicans entered Franckfort. The two
                    imperial armies were now at no great distance from each other, being in fact in
                    the centre between those of Moreau and Jourdan. Had the archduke, therefore,
                    found it practicable to resist for a time one of these armies, whilst he fell
                    upon the other with the main body of his army, it is not improbable that an end
                    might thus have been put to any further invasion of Germany. But the activity of
                    the republican officers was not to be easily checked, nor could their progress
                    be arrested by any partial exertions. His last resource, therefore, was to give
                    battle to Moreau, which he accordingly did; and the action was obstinately
                    contested on both sides. The French, in their endeavours to force the heights of
                    Rollensolhe, were four times repulsed; but, after a terrible slaughter, they at
                    length succeeded in carrying the position at the point of the bayonet.</p>
                <p>In consequence of the loss sustained at the battle of Ettingen, the imperial
                    armies retired eastward, the archduke retreating through Suabia towards Ulm,
                    where he had magazines. At every position of any strength he made a stand, in
                    order, as much as possible, to obstruct General Moreau’s advance; whilst
                    Wartensleben, in his retreat through Franconia, offered a similar opposition to
                    Jourdan. The archduke was forced by Moreau to cross the Neckar, and afterwards
                    the Danube, by which means the whole circle of Suabia was in the rear of the
                    republicans; and Wartensleben was obliged to retreat through Aschaffenburg,
                    Wartsburg, Schweinfurt, and to cross the Rednitz, in order to avoid the army of
                    Jourdan, which was pressing on his rear. Jourdan continued his advance until his
                    right wing, commanded by General Bernadotte, reached Neumarck, and his advanced
                    posts Teining; and the main body of the army having pursued Wartensleben beyond
                    the Nab, arrived at Amberg on the 22d of August.</p>
                <p>The three republican armies under Moreau, Jourdan, and Bonaparte, thus commanded
                    an immense tract of country, extending from the frontiers of Bohemia to the
                    shores of the Adriatic (excepting only a part of the mountains of TyroD, and
                    caused unspeakable alarm throughout the whole of Germany. The payment of four
                    millions of francs procured a peace for the Duke of Wirtemburg; and the circle
                    of Suabia obtained it on condition of paying twelve millions of livres, and
                    delivering for the use of the army eight thousand four hundred hones, five
                    thousand oxen, a hundred thousand quintals of wheat, fifty thousand quintals of
                    rye, a hundred thousand sacks of oats, a hundred thousand pairs of shoes, and a
                    large quantity of hay. Peace was granted to the Margrave of Baden upon similar
                    terms; and negotiations were also entered into by the Elector of Bavaria and the
                    circle of Franconia, each party offering large sums in order to obtain it; and
                    even the diet of Ha-tisbon<pb break="no" facs="nls:193515293"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-5293-0102"/> sent a deputation to the republican generals to
                    treat for a neutrality. About the same time Spain concluded a treaty offensive
                    and defensive with France, and in consequence soon afterwards declared war
                    against Great Britain. Bonaparte was still detained in Italy; but had it been in
                    his power to traverse the Tyrol, and reach the Danube, it is probable that the
                    emperor of Germany would have been obliged to accept peace upon any terms which
                    the conquerors thought proper to prescribe. But though abandoned by every member
                    of the coalition except Britain, the pecuniary aid furnished by the latter
                    enabled the emperor to extricate himself from the dangers which surrounded him;
                    with an almost unlimited command of money, one army after another was raised to
                    check the career of Bonaparte in Italy, whilst his German armies were recruited
                    by extensive levies, and by mercenary troops drawn from the states which had
                    made peace with France.</p>
                <p>The Archduke Charles having received strong reinforcements, came to the
                    resolution of encountering Moreau at Umersheim. A battle accordingly ensued,
                    which lasted seventeen hours, when one of the wings of the Austrian army
                    succeeded in gaining about four leagues of territory in the rear of the
                    republican army; but as the archduke had received information that Wartensleben
                    was unable to maintain his ground against Jourdan, he deemed it prudent to
                    retreat, and adopt new measures. On the 17th of August he left General Latour to
                    keep Moreau in check, and crossing the Danube at Ingolstadt, marched to the
                    relief of General Wartensleben, determined with their united forces to fall upon
                    Jourdan. On the 23d he attacked Bernadotte at Teining, and compelled him to
                    retreat towards Nuremberg. The archduke having thus placed himself on Jourdan’s
                    right, whilst Wartenβleben menaced him in front, the French general was forced
                    to fall back, which he did accordingly on the 24th. The state of the French
                    finances at the beginning of this campaign was such that the armies of Jourdan
                    and Moreau were under the necessity of making the war support itself, or, in
                    other words, supplying their immediate wants by means of requisitions. This was
                    particularly the case with Jourdan’s army, which, when it commenced its retreat,
                    suffered nearly as much from the exasperated inhabitants as from the pursuing
                    enemy. The archduke and Wartensleben having effected a junction of their forces,
                    the former was enabled to detach General Nauendorf with reinforcements to
                    Latour, in order to keep Moreau in check, whilst he continued his pursuit of
                    Jourdan towards Würtzburg. Here the French made a stand on the 3d of September,
                    and a severe engagement ensued, in which Jourdan was defeated with great loss,
                    and obliged to continue his retreat during the night. Having crossed the Lahn,
                    he made a feeble resistance, and marched along the banks of the Rhine, till his
                    army on the 17th arrived at Coblentz and Dusseldorf, the points from which it
                    had formerly taken its departure.</p>
                <p>The army of Moreau was now in a situation of extreme peril; yet he maintained his
                    position till the 17th of September, the day upon which Jourdan reached
                    Dusseldorf. But he obviously wavered as to his future movements, and indeed
                    seemed completely at a loss what course to pursue. He made an unsuccessful
                    attempt to arrest the archduke in his pursuit of Jourdan, and frequently
                    attacked, but without effect; on whatever side he moved, the Austrian generals
                    gave way before him. But finding that the retreat of Jourdan was irretrievable,
                    and that Bonaparte was still detained in Italy, he finally resolved to retire.
                    To prepare for this arduous undertaking, he had crossed the Lech, which he
                    suddenly repassed as if fully determined to penetrate further into Austria, and
                    thus compelled Latour to fall back on Lansberg. Having thus obtained a free
                    passage, he commenced his memorable retreat, passing between the Danube at U)m
                    and the Lake of Constance, whilst Latour continued pressing upon his rear. The
                    defiles of the Black Forest were occupied by numerous bodies of Austrians and
                    armed peasantry, whilst his right flank was harassed by Nauendorf and Petrasch
                    at the head of twenty-four thousand men. To disengage himself he once more
                    turned upon Latour with terrible impetuosity, defeated him, and took five
                    thousand prisoners. He then continued his retreat, checking Nauendorf and
                    Petrasch with the right wing of his army under General Dessaix, whilst the
                    remainder cleared the passage» in front, till he reached the Valley of Hell.
                    This pass, which is a narrow defile extending some leagues between lofty
                    mountains, and in particular places not more than a few fathoms broad, he forced
                    with the centre of his army in a mass, whilst the wings opposed the enemy under
                    Nauendorf and Latour; and after incredible efforts he arrived at Fribourg on the
                    13th of October. The archduke having discontinued the pursuit of Jourdan, now
                    arrived, forced Moreau to abandon all his positions on the Suabian side of the
                    Rhine, excepting the forts of Kehl, and a tête-de-pont at Hünningen. This
                    memorable retreat has been severely censured by Napoleon in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoires,</hi> dictated at St Helena; but apparently without
                    sufficient reason. His dislike of Moreau seems to have biassed his judgment, and
                    sharpened the edge of his criticism.</p>
                <p>As the French frontier was at this time in a defenceless state, the imperial
                    forces took advantage of the circumstance to cross the Rhine at Manheim, and
                    march in different detachments to Weissenberg, Seitz, and Hagenau, almost to the
                    gates of Strasburg, levying contributions and demanding hostages wherever they
                    went. When these detachments were recalled, the archduke formed the resolution
                    of terminating the campaign by the reduction of Kehl and the fortification at
                    Hünningen; but this he found no easy task. Much of the winter was spent by the
                    Austrians in endeavouring to reduce these places; but the French at length
                    agreed to evacuate Kehl on the 10th of January, and the fortification at
                    Hünningen was surrendered in the month of February.</p>
                <p>But although the republicans had experienced considerable reverses of fortune in
                    Germany, yet Bonaparte continued to be victorious in Italy. Having laid the
                    whole of that country under contribution, he had the means of preserving a
                    vigorous and steady discipline over a well-paid army. The great secret of his
                    tactics consisted in keeping his army always in hand, advancing with the utmost
                    rapidity, and operating in masses on the decisive point; a system which could
                    scarcely fail to succeed against that of cordons, to which it was opposed.<note

                    considered as the most important rule or maxim in the art of war, replied,

                    great action, was well calculated to inspire them with enthusiasm. He knew the
                    soldier, and possessed the invaluable art of awakening in his mind all those
                    feelings which prompt to the performance of daring actions. His address to the
                    army on entering Lombardy is a masterpiece of its kind. “Soldiers,” said he,
                    “you have rushed like a torrent from the summit of the Appennines, you have
                    driven back and dispersed all who opposed your march. Your fathers, your

                    victories; they will form an epoch to posterity, and you will have the immortal
                    glory of renovating the fairest portion of Europe. The French nation, free and
                    respected by all the world, will give to Europe a glorious peace. You will then
                    return to your homes, and your fellow-citizens, who, when pointing to you, will
                    say, ‘ He was of the army of Italy.'”</p>
                <p>During the early part of the month of July Bonaparte was occupied in commencing
                    the siege of Mantua, a place of which he expected to become master towards the
                    end of the month. In this, however, he miscalculated. Aided by Britain, Austria
                    made great efforts, and poured reinforcements from all points into Italy. Twenty
                    thousand troops were sent from the Rhine; large masses arrived from other
                    quarters; and Italy had once more to be conquered. Bonaparte was therefore
                    obliged to raise the siege, in order to make head against fresh masses
                    descending from the Tyrol to dispute the possession of Italy with the youthful
                    conqueror. On the 29th of July Massena was attacked and driven from his post at
                    La Corona, whilst fifteen thousand Austrians forced the republicans to retire,
                    first from Salo, and next from Brescia, with the loss of all the stores and
                    magazines belonging to the army. The imperial troops, however, committed a fatal
                    blunder in dividing into two columns, separated by physical obstacles, an army
                    which, united, would have been more than a match for the enemy, and thus
                    exposing themselves to be beaten in detail. Of this error the republican chief
                    was fully aware, and,did not fail to take advantage of it. He unexpectedly
                    raised the siege of Mantua, and leaving only a small body of troops to keep the
                    Austrians in check, marched rapidly westward, and on the 1st of August retook
                    Brescia, with all the magazines and hospitals. Carrying the mass of his army
                    along with him, he exceeded his enemies in numbers wherever he attacked them.
                    Having formed a large body of his troops into close columns, he awaited the
                    Austrians, who, as yet unacquainted with the new tactics, extended their line
                    with the view of surrounding him. The result was such as might easily have been
                    foreseen. He penetrated their line in all directions, threw them into the utmost
                    confusion, made four thousand prisoners, and took twenty pieces of cannon. A
                    division of the Austrians finding Salo in possession of the republicans,
                    wandered about in quest of a road by which to make their escape, and, believing
                    that the bulk of the French army had marched in search of Wurmser to give him
                    battle, summoned Lonato to surrender. Their belief was well founded, but
                    Bonaparte was still in Lonato, though with no more than twelve hundred men. His
                    situation was no doubt critical, but, with great presence of mind, he threatened
                    to destroy the whole division, for daring to insult the French army, by
                    summoning its commander-in-chief to surrender. Persuaded that the whole army was
                    in the place, the Austrians abandoned all idea of resistance; and by this
                    admirable acting on the part of Bonaparte, four thousand men were induced to lay
                    down their arms.</p>
                <p>On the 5th and 6th Wurmser was attacked by Bonaparte, and driven from Peschiera
                    and the line of the Mincio. But on the 7th the Austrians were obliged to abandon
                    Verona, and again to betake themselves to the mountains of Tyrol; losing in a
                    contest of a few days upwards of twenty thousand men, three fourths of whom were
                    prisoners. The siege of Mantua was again undertaken by the French; but as their
                    works had been destroyed by the enemy in their absence, and the cannon which
                    they had left behind taken into the city, the French could not undertake a
                    regular siege; and by the beginning of September Wurmser was in a condition to
                    attempt the relief of the place. Informed of his approach, Bonaparte left α
                    division to maintain the blockade of Mantua; and, directing his march northward
                    with the main body of his army, drove the Austrians from Santo Marco and
                    Roveredo to the pass of Calliano. Here however they made a stand, and an
                    engagement ensued, in which the Austrians were defeated with the loss of six
                    thousand prisoners, upon which the French entered Trent in triumph. But instead
                    of retiring, Wurmser threw himself into Bassano, upon the flank and rear of
                    Bonaparte, and then marched with great rapidity towards Mantua. He endeavoured
                    to make a stand at Bassano, but was defeated with the loss of five thousand
                    prisoners. He then crossed the Adige at Porto Legnago, and entered Mantua with
                    no more than eight thousand five hundred men, infantry and cavalry. The loss
                    which Wurmser had sustained was great beyond example, but still it had the
                    effect of detaining Bonaparte in Italy to watch the numerous garrison of Mantua.
                    He expected that, owing to its numbers, famine would soon reduce it to the
                    necessity of capitulating; but the flesh of more than four thousand horses,
                    which Wurmser carried into the place, afforded the troops subsistence for a
                    considerable time, and enabled the gallant veteran to signalize himself by as
                    brave a defence as any on record.</p>
                <p>The emperor now endeavoured to relieve Mantua, by J sending another army into
                    Italy under the command of <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> General Alvinzi. But
                    having crossed the Piava, Alvinzi was met by the republicans, and compelled to
                    repass that river. Davidovich, however, having with his division driven the
                    French down the Adige towards Verona, Bonaparte found it necessary to
                    concentrate his forces. Leaving General Vaubois to keep Davidovich in check, he
                    therefore marched in person against General Alvinzi, and came up with the
                    Austrians in position at the village of Arcole. But as the village could not be
                    speedily turned, on account of a canal, the French were obliged to attempt the
                    passage of a narrow bridge under the fire of the whole Austrian army. Their
                    officers rushed to the head of the column, and in vain endeavoured to urge the
                    troops to advance. Augereau rushed to the end of the bridge with a standard, but
                    he was followed by no one. At length the general-in-chief hastened to the
                    bridge, and exclaimed, “Grenadiers, follow your general the soldiers followed
                    till within thirty yards of the bridge, when they became intimidated by the
                    tremendous fire of the Austrians, and Bonaparte judged it prudent to withdraw
                    the troops. In the evening General Guieux carried the village at the head of two
                    thousand men, but the Austrians again recovered possession of it. On the 16th of
                    November a desperate engagement took place in the vicinity of Arcole; but next
                    day the Austrians, whilst pressing on the centre of the republican army, were
                    unexpectedly taken in flank by the left wing of the French army, which was lying
                    in ambuscade. Bonaparte having sent into their rear a party of horse with
                    twenty-five trumpeters, the Austrians concluded from the noise that they were
                    surrounded, and fled in all directions in the utmost confusion. Having driven
                    Alvinzi across the Brenta, Bonaparte resumed the positions of Rivoli and La
                    Corona, and Davidovich was driven back into Tyrol. Wurmser still defended
                    Mantua, which held out during the remainder of the year; but with these
                    operations the campaign in Italy terminated.</p>
                <p>Whilst such was the fortune of the field of battle, Great <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193515319" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5319-0104"/>Britain made an attempt to
                    negotiate with France. Passports were obtained from the Directory, and Lord
                    Malmesbury set out as ambassador to Paris. He commenced negotiations with
                    Lacroix, the minister for foreign affairs; but his lordship soon discovered, or
                    fancied he discovered, I that the Directory had no serious intention of
                    concluding a peace with Britain. As individuals, the British ministry did not
                    approve of a peace at this time, yet officially they considered it as prudent to
                    treat; that is, they sought from policy, what they had no desire, either from
                    interest or inclination, to obtain. It was proposed by Lord Malmesbury, that the
                    principle of mutual restitution should be agreed upon as the basis of the
                    treaty; but the Directory desired that specifications should be made. Lord
                    Malmesbury therefore proposed that the French should give up the Austrian
                    Netherlands, in return for which Britain, he said, would consent to give up the
                    foreign settlements belonging to the Republic which had been taken during the
                    war. Many of the Dutch possessions abroad would also be relinquished, on
                    condition that the authority of the stadtholder was acknowledged. His lordship
                    was next required to give in the ultimatum of his government in twenty-four
                    hours; and when he complained of this demand, he was informed, on the 19th of
                    December, that the Directory would agree to no conditions repugnant to the
                    French constitution, and that his further residence was unnecessary. During this
                    year Great Britain maintained her accustomed superiority on the ocean. On the
                    16th of September 1795 the Cape of Good Hope was taken by Admiral Elphinstone;
                    but as the Dutch were extremely anxious to recover this settlement, they
                    advanced money to the French to enable them to fit out a squadron destined to
                    co-operate in an attempt to reduce it. Seven ships of the line were accordingly
                    sent out for this purpose, under the command of Admiral Lucas; but the latter
                    having been caught between two fires, found it impossible to escape, and
                    therefore surrendered to the British admiral without firing a gun.</p>
                <p>But although Britain maintained her superiority by sea, yet an invasion of
                    Ireland was attempted by the French in the end of 1796; but as folly seemed to
                    have concerted the scheme, it consequently proved abortive. The command was
                    intrusted to General Hoche, without any second in command to take his place in
                    the event of accident. The disaffected party in Ireland had received no
                    information of the approach of the expedition, and the fleet was sent towards a
                    part of the country where the people were notmuch disposed to receive them. In
                    this expedition eighteen sail of the line, thirteen frigates, twelve sloops, and
                    transports with twenty-five thousand men, were employed; but it was detained for
                    some time when ready for sailing, in consequence of a mutiny. Hoche set sail on
                    the 10th of December, but in working out of Brest a ship of the line was lost,
                    and some others were considerably damaged. The frigate which had on board the
                    commander-in-chief was separated from the fleet in a gale of wind, and when the
                    latter arrived at Bantry Bay, it found itself without instructions. The officers
                    and troops desired to disembark, but Admiral Bouvet refused to comply with their
                    wishes. After remaining for some days on the coast, he sailed for France, and on
                    the 31st reached Brest with part of the fleet. General Hoche reached Bantry Bay
                    when it was too late, and consequently could not land. One ship of the line and
                    two frigates foundered at sea, a frigate was captured by the British, and a ship
                    of the line was run ashore to prevent her being taken.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the year 1797 the Archduke Charles was still employed in
                    endeavouring to reduce Kehl and the fortifications opposite to Hünningen. Moreau
                    continued his opponent. Hoche succeeded Jourdan on the Rhine, and Bonaparte was
                    still occupied with tire siege of</p>
                <p>Mantua, whilst powerful efforts were making to reinforce the army of Alvinzi. The
                    youth of Vienna were requested to lend their assistance, and six thousand of
                    them volunteered their services for Italy. By these and other means Alvinzi’s
                    army was augmented until it became fifty thousand strong; and with this force he
                    menaced the republicans in all directions, in order to conceal from them the
                    plan of his future operations. Bonaparte was at Bologna, to prevent the escape
                    of Wurmser in that direction, when, receiving information of the approach of the
                    Austrian army, he hastened to Mantua, and thence proceeded to Verona, where the
                    centre of his line had already come to blows with the Austrians; but as they
                    continued to attack on all points at once, he was as yet unable to penetrate the
                    design of Alvinzi. On the 13th of January, however, the movements of the enemy
                    became more serious upon the lower part of his line, near Porto Legnago; but
                    having been informed in the evening that the upper extremity under Joubert had
                    been attacked by greatly superior numbers, he concluded that the Austrians were
                    there in greatest force. Notwithstanding all the lessons they had already
                    received, the Austrians still persisted in dividing their army; experience had
                    not yet taught them to correct an error which was soon to entail the same
                    destruction on this as on former armies. Ten thousand troops, including the
                    Vienna volunteers, received orders to proceed to Mantua by Porto Legnago, whilst
                    Alvinzi in person advanced against Joubert, who was forced to retreat, and in
                    fact reduced to such a situation that the capture of his whole division on the
                    following day (the 14th ) seemed highly probable.</p>
                <p>Bonaparte having received information as to the real state of affairs, left
                    Verona on the 13th, having ordered Massena to follow him with the centre to
                    Rivoli as fast as possible. On the 14th, at the break of day, the division of
                    Joubert attacked the Austrians, a circumstance which much surprised them,
                    ignorant as they were that Bonaparte had arrived with reinforcements. But the
                    superior numbers of the Austrians, baffled all the endeavours of the French
                    troops to turn their divisions; and the two wings of the republican army were
                    forced back upon the centre in considerable confusion. Alvinzi encountered the
                    centre, which with difficulty maintained its ground; and the Austrian wings
                    advancing on both sides, entirely surrounded the French. The victory seemed
                    already won, and it is even reported that Alvinzi had sent a courier to Vienna
                    to announce the approaching capture of Bonaparte and his army. But the tide was
                    already at the turn. Forming his troops in three strong columns, Bonaparte led
                    them against the right wing of the Austrians, which they penetrated at various
                    points, and forced to fly in such confusion that four thousand Austrians laid
                    down their arms to a party of republicans which had not arrived in time to join
                    the army, and surrendered themselves prisoners of war. Bonaparte, perceiving
                    that this part of his line was no longer in danger, left Joubert to prosecute
                    the victory, and proceeded to oppose the march of Provera. A detachment under
                    General Murat having continued their march during the whole night of the 14th,
                    seized on Montebaldo in the rear of the position at La Corona, to which part of
                    the Austrians retreated; and on the following morning Joubert attacked them in
                    front. Thus surrounded, 'they were thrown into confusion, six thousand were
                    taken prisoners, and numbers perished in attempting to cross the Adige.</p>
                <p>During this bloody conflict on the upper part of the Adige, ł'rovera forced his
                    passage across the lower part of the river, near Porto Legnago, and obliged the
                    republican general Guieux to retreat towards Ronco. But as Provera was marching
                    rapidly to Mantua, Augereau came up with his rear, and made two thousand
                    prisoners; notwithstanding<pb break="no" facs="nls:193515332"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-5332-0105"/> which the Austrian general on the 15th reached
                    the neighbourhood of that city, which was blockaded at St George and La
                    Favourite. The Austrian general summoned the republican commander to surrender;
                    but the latter having refused to comply, Provera endeavoured, without success,
                    to carry it by assault. He next made an attack upon La Favourite, and was
                    seconded by Wurmser with the troops in the garrison, who had observed his
                    arrival; but as Bonaparte had by this time arrived with reinforcements, Wurmser
                    was defeated, and Provera being surrounded by the French, surrendered both
                    himself and his troops as prisoners of war. In consequence of these engagements
                    at Rivoli and Mantua, the Austrians lost twenty-three thousand prisoners and
                    sixty pieces of cannon. The surrender of Mantua had now become inevitable, and
                    in fact it capitulated from famine on the 2d of February. That the French
                    emigrants might escape, Bonaparte allowed Wurmser to select and take out of the
                    garrison seven hundred men, who were not to be examined nor viewed as prisoners
                    of war; and the general himself was permitted to depart unconditionally.</p>
                <p>The most active and vigorous preparations were now making both by the emperor and
                    the French to recommence the contest on the German frontiers: and it was
                    therefore of importance that Bonaparte should leave Italy in his rear in a state
                    of tranquillity. On the 1st of February he sent General Victor with the legion
                    of Lombardy to enter the papal territories; and after the surrender of Mantua,
                    he himself followed in person. The Lombard legion, after storming the position
                    occupied by the papal troops, made a thousand of them prisoners, and took all
                    their cannon. General Colli had carried away most of the treasure from the
                    chapel at Loretto; but the republicans still found articles of gold and silver
                    worth a million of livres, and the image of the virgin was sent to Paris as a
                    curiosity. At Tolentino the republican chief was met by a messenger from his
                    holiness, with overtures of peace; and on the 19th a treaty was concluded, by
                    which the pope promised to pay fifteen millions of livres, and to deliver eight
                    hundred cavalry horses, with an equal number of draught horses and oxen. He also
                    agreed to pay three hundred thousand livres to the family of the French
                    ambassador Basseville, whom the rabble had murdered at Rome, and to make an
                    apology through his minister at Paris for that outrage against the law of
                    nations and of humanity.</p>
                <p>The French having proved unfortunate in their invasion of Germany through Suabia
                    and Franconia, now determined to make their principal attempt from Italy under
                    the command of General Bonaparte. Considerable bodies of troops were therefore
                    detached by the Directory from the divisions which had served under Moreau, and
                    sent as secretly as possible towards Italy by the way of Savoy. The impending
                    danger was however perceived by the court of Vienna, which accordingly conferred
                    the command on the side of Italy on the Archduke Charles, the only Austrian
                    general who bad hitherto been successful against the republicans. The war was
                    now about to be carried into territorips where a foe had scarcely ever been seen
                    by the house of Austria. It was necessary that Bonaparte should once more force
                    his way across the Alps; that he should carry the war into that immense chain of
                    mountains which, rising in the neighbourhood of Toulon and stretching northward,
                    obtains the names of Piedmont and Savoy, and which, taking an easterly
                    direction, forms the countries of Tyrol, Carinthia, and Carniola, and on the
                    side of the Adriatic constitutes the frontier of the hereditary states of
                    Austria. As to the fertile and level tract which belonged to Venice, it is
                    situated between the mountains and the sea, and is crossed by many streams,
                    which are increased by the melting of the Alpine snows, and the peculiar
                    characteristic of which is, that they are greatest in summer and least in
                    winter. But the archduke, instead of being ordered to make a stand in the
                    defiles of the mountains, was sent into the plain to guard the passages of the
                    rivers; a blunder which entered into the whole plan of defence adopted by the
                    council of war at Vienna.</p>
                <p>Whilst Bonaparte advanced into the territories of the pope, the Austrian army was
                    assembling on the eastern bank of the Piava. The republicans were on the
                    opposite side of the river, and Bonaparte, after quitting the papal territories,
                    hastened to join them. Having effected the passage of the Piava on the 12th of
                    March, the Austrians retired, skirmishing for some days, till they crossed the
                    Tagliamento, where they halted and concentrated their whole force. On the 17th
                    the republican army reached Valvesone, on the opposite bank of the river, and
                    after some hesitation determined to force the passage. The stream had been
                    diminished by the frost, and though the banks were high, the operation seemed
                    practicable. After some sharp fighting, the French accordingly crossed the river
                    in columns at different points. Joubert, with the left wing, then received
                    orders to pass along the valley of the Drave, beyond the highest chain of the
                    Noric Alps; Massena, at the head of the centre division, entered the defiles of
                    these mountains; and the right division, commanded by Bonaparte, marched along
                    the coast of the Adriatic. On the 19th the town of Gradisea, situated on the
                    river Isonzo, surrendered to the right wing of the army; and its garrison,
                    consisting of three thousand men, were made prisoners of war. On the 21st the
                    same division entered Goritz, where it found the principal magazines and
                    hospitals belonging to the Austrians. Trieste was taken on the 23d, and
                    quicksilver, worth two millions of livres, was sent off by tiie French from the
                    mines of Idria. On the 24th a large body of Austrians was kept in check by
                    Massena and part of the right wing under General Guieux; but having procured
                    reinforcements from the archduke, they engaged the French next day, and were
                    defeated with the loss of five thousand prisoners and from three to four hundred
                    baggage waggons. Equal success attended the left wing under Joubert,
                    Baraguay-d’Hilliers, and Delmas. Four thousand prisoners were taken on the banks
                    of the Lavis, and the enemy was defeated at Clauzen with the loss of fifteen
                    hundred men. This division then directed its march eastward, along the valley of
                    the Drave towards Clagenfurt, the metropolis of Carinthia, where it was met by
                    General Massena, who had obliged the archduke to evacuate his head-quarters, and
                    to fall back in order to cover the capital of the empire, which was now
                    seriously threatened. Thus in fifteen days General Bonaparte had effected the
                    passage of the Alps, taken twenty thousand prisoners, and arrived within
                    twenty-four leagues of Vienna, which was thus completely exposed. Yet his own
                    situation was not free from danger. The rapidity of his advance had rendered it
                    impossible to take the necessary measures for protecting his line of
                    communications; a hostile population hung upon his rear; a continued success
                    could alone enable him to maintain his advanced positions, and the slightest
                    reverse might lead to ruinous consequences. Bonaparte, therefore, prudently
                    embraced the present moment of unprecedented success to make overtures of peace.
                    On the 31st of March he wrote to the archduke, deprecating the continuance of
                    the war, and entreating him to use his influence for putting a period to its
                    ravages. But the prince replied evasively, that it did not belong to him to
                    investigate the principles on which the war was carried on, and that he had no
                    power to negotiate.</p>
                <p>In the mean while the Austrians raised the peasantry of the Tyrol to harass the
                    rear of the French army, and in consequence gained some advantages under Laudoh¾
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515345" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5345-0106"/>who drove back
                    the republican troops which had been left at Botzen and Brixen. The people of
                    the Venetian states also rose against the troops which had been left amongst
                    them, and, with the assistance of ten Sclavonian regiments, murdered every
                    Frenchman they could find, not sparing even the sick in the hospitals, of whom
                    five hundred were massacred at Verona. The Austrians now attempted to surround
                    the invading army; but Bonaparte knew that the embarrassment of the court of
                    Vienna was at least equal to his own. He was at the head of a body of men
                    hitherto irresistible; and to surround his army was not to vanquish it. For
                    these reasons he continued his advance, and on the 2d of April, after a bloody
                    conflict, forced the strong defiles between Freisach and Neumarck, making six
                    hundred prisoners. On the 4th his advanced guard reached Hunsmarck, where they
                    again defeated the Austrians. The cabinet of Vienna, finding that there was now
                    no place where the army of the archduke could make a stand, till it reached the
                    mountains in the vicinity of the capital, thought it high time to treat for
                    peace. With this view, therefore, Bellegarde and Mor· veldt requested a
                    suspension of hostilities, to which the French commander consented, on condition
                    of obtaining possession of Gratz and Leoben, about fifty miles from Vienna. This
                    was on the 7th of April, but the armistice, which would have expired on the
                    13th, was afterwards renewed for a longer period. On the 19th a preliminary
                    treaty was signed, by which the French were to retain the Austrian Netherlands,
                    and the whole of Lombardy, now called the Cisalpine Republic, comprehending the
                    Milanese, Mantua, Modena, Ferrara, and Bologna. Bonaparte consented to return to
                    Italy, on condition that his army should be supplied with provisions during its
                    march; and all further disputes were to be settled by a definitive treaty of
                    peace. The overthrow of the Venetian government, which had so long been in a
                    state of helpless decrepitude, speedily followed the signature of the
                    preliminary treaty of Leoben. Bonaparte had for some time meditated the
                    dismemberment of the Venetian states, and a pretext was now afforded him for
                    carrying this design into execution by the insurrection and massacre above
                    adverted to. He saw his advantage, and promptly seized it; announced that the
                    hour of Venice was now come; declared war against the unfortunate city of the
                    sea; brought up cannon to the edge of the lagoons; and by menaces of retaliation
                    compelled the senate and the doge to pass a decree dissolving their ancient
                    constitution, and establishing a kind of municipal democracy in its stead.</p>
                <p>During the approach of Bonaparte towards Vienna, the republican armies on the
                    Rhine were pressing hard on the Austrians, to prevent their sending
                    reinforcements to the archduke. An armistice was offered by the Austrians, but
                    as the French required Ehrenbreitstein as a guarantee, both parties resolved to
                    prosecute the war. The left wing of the army of General Hoche marched from
                    Dusseldorf, whilst the centre and right wing crossed the Rhine near Coblentz. On
                    the 18th of April a fierce contest took place between the hostile armies near
                    the Lahn, in which the Austrians were beaten with the loss of four thousand
                    prisoners. General Moreau having forced the passage of the Upper Rhine near
                    Strasburg, attacked and carried the village of Diersheim; and next day the
                    conflict was renewed with such vigour on the part of the republicans, that the
                    fort of Kehl was taken, and five thousand Austrians were made prisoners. The
                    French then advanced, and the Austrians were retiring towards the Danube, when
                    all military operations were suspended, in consequence of intelligence received
                    from the archduke and Bonaparte, that peace had been concluded. On the arrival
                    of this intelligence, the army of General Hoche was making an attack upon
                    Franckfort-on-the-Maine, which General Warnecht was employing every effort to
                    defend. Both armies received the news about the same time, upon which the troops
                    threw down their arms, and congratulated each other on the happy event.</p>
                <p>A contest of a serious nature was now fast approaching between the legislative
                    and executive branches of the French government. The time had arrived when a
                    third part of the legislative body was to be changed. On the 19th of May
                    Letourneur went out of the Directory by lot; on the 20th the new third took
                    their seats; and on the 21st Barthélémy was chosen a member of the Directory in
                    the room of Letourneur. Pichegru, Jourdan, and Willot, were amongst the members
                    of the new third, so that a decided majority of both councils was of the
                    moderate party; and two members of the Directory, Carnot and Barthélémy, were
                    understood to be men of the same description. The old conventionalists,
                    therefore, employed every means which seemed calculated either to render the
                    Mountain party odious, or to embarrass the Directory. On the 14th of June
                    Gilbert Desmolières brought up a report from a committee on the state of the
                    finances, in which he inveighed against the prodigality of the Directory, and
                    censured in the strongest language the conduct of its agents. On the 18th the
                    same committee proposed a new plan of finance, which went to deprive the
                    Directory of the administration of the public money. On the preceding day
                    Camille Jourdan had presented a report of great length on the subject of
                    religion, in which he insisted on the impropriety of forbidding its ceremonies
                    to be publicly displayed, and the iniquitous nature of that persecution which
                    its ministers had suffered because they could not take the oaths prescribed by
                    the legislature. On the 15th of July the .Council of Five Hundred decreed that
                    all the laws against refractory priests should be repealed; and on the following
                    day a decree, requiring from them an oath of fidelity to the constitution, was
                    carried by a majority of no more than six members. Emery, a new member, proposed
                    the repeal of the laws by which the property of emigrants had been confiscated
                    and their relations declared incompetent to succeed them. The discussion which
                    these topics underwent made the Directory and the Councils professed enemies to
                    each other. The Councils wished the Director)' to be changed before the
                    expiration of the legal time, and the Directory desired to deprive of their
                    seats many new members who had been elected by the people. As Barras was upon
                    the whole the most obnoxious member of the Directory, an effort was made to
                    deprive him of his seat, on the pretence that he was less than the legal age of
                    forty; but his colleagues maintained that he had been born in the year 1755, and
                    no proof of the contrary could be produced. Still the Directory did not want a
                    number of adherents. The resolution of the Councils in favour of the priests had
                    the appearance of a counter revolution, which induced the royalists to resume
                    courage, and journals were rapidly published in defence of their cause. On the
                    20th of July the Councils received information that a division of the army under
                    Hoche was within a few leagues of Paris; whilst the constitution declared that
                    the Directory incurred the penalty of ten years imprisonment, if it brought
                    troops any nearer the residence of the legislative body, without its consent,
                    than twelve miles. An explanation was demanded and given; the Directory declared
                    their ignorance of the march, which they said had been undertaken without orders
                    from them, and owing to a mistake on the part of the officer by whom it was
                    conducted; but the Councils paid no regard to an allegation which they evidently
                    disbelieved. The turbulent suburb of Saint Antoine adhered to the majority of
                    the Directory; and this encouraged them so much that they lost no time in
                    proceeding to action.</p>

                <p>General Augereau had been sent from Italy, upon the pretence of delivering to the
                    Directory some standards taken from the enemy. On the morning of the 4∣th, the
                    Tuileries was surrounded by a division of the troops, under the command of this
                    officer; the guard of the Councils refused to act against them, and Ramel their
                    commander was made prisoner. On entering the hall, Augereau seized Pichegru and
                    twelve more of the chiefs of the opposite faction, whom he immediately sent
                    prisoners to the Temple. Carnot made his escape on the preceding evening; but
                    Barthélémy remained, and was put under arrest. When several members of the
                    Councils came to the hall at the usual hour, they were astonished to find that
                    seals had been put upon the doors, and that they could not obtain admittance.
                    They were ordered to go to the Surgeons’ Hall, where the Directory, it was said,
                    had appointed them to meet; but of both Councilsnot more than a hundred and
                    twenty members assembled, who, however, sent to obtain from the Directory an
                    explanation of the proceedings which had just taken place. They were given to
                    understand, that what had been done was absolutely necessary for the salvation
                    of the Republic, and the Councils were congratulated on their escape from the
                    machinations of the royalists. According to the report of Boulay de la Meurthe,
                    a great royalist conspiracy, the centre of which was in the bosom of the
                    Councils, was endeavouring to subvert the constitution; but, by the
                    indefatigable diligence and activity of the Directory, it had been defeated. It
                    was proposed to banish the conspirators without a trial, and the Councils were
                    so completely imposed upon, that they voted the deportation of fifty-three of
                    their own members, and twelve other persons, amongst whom were the directors
                    Carnot and Barthélémy. During these transactions the city of Paris remained
                    tranquil. The unfortunate issue of the struggle on the 5th of October had so
                    completely subdued the ardour of the inhabitants, that they suffered the
                    national representation to be violated with impunity, and saw liberty trampled
                    underfoot, without a single exertion in its defence. The Directory excused their
                    conduct to the nation, under pretence of the existence of a royalist conspiracy.
                    Pichegru, it was said, had offered to join the emigrants under the Prince of
                    Condé, and the Austrians under Wurmser, and, at the head of this aggregate
                    force, to march directly to Paris, and re-establish the monarchy. Moreau was
                    also implicated in this conspiracy, but, as is alleged, saved himself by
                    betraying his accomplice.</p>
                <p>The Directory were now powerful; but its members soon became giddy from the
                    elevated nature of their situation, and seemed to act under the dangerous
                    conviction that there was nothing in which they might not venture to engage,
                    however great might be their ambition or rapacity. Whilst contending with the
                    councils, they prolonged the negotiations with Lord Malmesbury; and, what is
                    more extraordinary, acted in a similar manner respecting those which had been
                    entered into between Bonaparte and the imperial ambassadors at Campo Formio. But
                    the negotiations with the emperor were at length terminated, and on the 17th of
                    October a definitive treaty was signed at Campo Formio. The Netherlands were
                    given up to the French Republic, and the Milanese to the Cisalpine Republic;
                    whilst the imperial territories in the Brisgau were surrendered to the Duke of
                    Modena, as a compensation for the loss of his duchy in Italy. It was likewise
                    agreed by the emperor that the French should possess the Venetian islands in the
                    Levant, Corfu, Zante, Cephalonia, Santa Maura, Cerigo, and others; and, on the
                    other hand, the emperor was to have the city of Venice, with its remaining
                    territory, from the extremity of Dalmatia, as far as the Adige and the Lake of
                    Garda. The Austrians accordingly withdrew from the bank of the Rhine, and the
                    republicans were thus enabled to retake Mayence and Ehrenbreitstein. Venice was
                    at the same time entered by the Austrians; and Bonaparte, when about to take his
                    departure from Italy, left twenty-five thousand men to garrison Mantua, Brescia,
                    Milan, and some other places, and to retain the Cisalpine Republic in a state of
                    dependence upon France.</p>
                <p>At this time the empire of the seas was so completely 1 possessed by Britain that
                    the republican fleets lay block-* ided in their own ports during the greater
                    part of the year. But as the expedition against Ireland had completely failed,
                    the Directory were at a loss how to dispose of the galley slaves who had formed
                    part of Hoche’s army. It would have been cruel to send them back to punishment;
                    the troops refused to serve with them in the army; and by the new laws of France
                    they could not receive a pardon, neither was it prudent to set so many criminals
                    at liberty. To get rid of the difficulty, the Directory at last determined to
                    send them over to England; and these criminals, to the number of about twelve
                    hundred, were landed from two frigates and some small vessels on the coast of
                    Wales, with muskets and ammunition, but destitute of artillery. On the evening
                    of the day on which they landed, however (the 23d of February), they were made
                    prisoners by a party of militia, yeomanry, cavalry, colliers, and others, under
                    the command of Lord Cawdor. But although the navy of France continued in port,
                    and therefore out of danger, the Spanish and Dutch allies of that country
                    sustained serious losses by sea. A Spanish fleet of twenty-seven sail of the
                    line, opposed to a British fleet of only fifteen sail under Sir John Jervis, was
                    completely defeated off Cape St Vincent on the 14th of February. The Spanish
                    fleet was on its way to Brest to effect a junction with the French fleet; but by
                    the victory of Jervis this object was rendered unattainable. The Dutch were, if
                    possible, still more unfortunate. Admiral Duncan having blockaded the Texel,
                    where their fleet lay during the summer, a resolution was at length adopted to
                    risk an engagement; and De Winter received positive orders to put to sea.
                    Admiral Duncan was at this time refitting at Yarmouth; but on receiving
                    intelligence that the Dutch fleet had sailed, he immediately put to sea in quest
                    of the enemy, and on the 11th of October came up with their fleet, consisting of
                    a force rather inferior to his own. The British admiral having carried his fleet
                    through the enemy’s line, commenced the attack between them and their own coast,
                    about nine miles from Camperdown. The conflict lasted three hours, at the end of
                    which time the greater part of the Dutch fleet had struck. Eight ships of the
                    line, two of fifty-six and one of forty-four guns, were taken, besides a
                    frigate, which was afterwards lost near the coast of Britain. See article <hi

                <p>After the ratification of the treaty with the emperor at Campo Formio, Joseph
                    Bonaparte was sent to Rome as plenipotentiary of the French Republic. The pope
                    having now no expectation of foreign assistance, submitted to the demands for
                    the reduction of his troops, and the liberation of every person confined in
                    prison on account of political opinions. But on the 26th of December 1797, three
                    men waited upon the ambassador, and requested the co-operation of France in
                    bringing about a revolution which a party a1 Rome was anxious to effect. He
                    refused to countenance ths project, and did every thing in his power to dissuade
                    them from embarking in such an enterprise; but unfortunately he neglected to
                    communicate the intelligence to the papal government. On the 28th, however, he
                    went to the cardinal secretary, and showed him a list of persons under his
                    protection who had a legal authority to wear the tricoor cockade he at the same
                    time consented that all others wearing it should be punished; and he offered to
                    give up six of the insurgent; who had taken refuge in his palace. In the evening
                    of tin <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515371" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5371-0108"/>same
                    day, a most serious tumult, in its origin not altogether unknown to his
                    holiness, happened in the courts and vicinity of the French ambassador’s palace,
                    and the governor of the city endeavoured to disperse the rioters by parties of
                    cavalry and infantry. But in attempting to induce the military to desist from
                    firing upon the people, General Du-phot, who belonged to the French mission, was
                    shot by a petty officer belonging to the troops of his holiness. As soon as the
                    Spanish ambassador received information of this event, he sent to the cardinal
                    secretary, and protested against this daring violation of the privileges of
                    plenipotentiaries. The palace of the French ambassador was still surrounded by
                    the military, when he demanded his passports, which were granted, accompanied by
                    many protestations of the innocence of government, and its sorrow that such an
                    unfortunate occurrence should have taken place. Joseph Bonaparte retired to
                    Florence, and thence proceeded to Paris. The protection of Austria, Spain,
                    Naples, and Tuscany, was earnestly solicited by the pope; but all these powers
                    seemed disinclined to interfere in behalf of the pontiff. General Berthier
                    experienced little or no opposition on his march to Rome, where he subverted the
                    dominion of the pope, proclaimed the sovereignty of the Roman people, and caused
                    the tree of liberty to be planted on the very day on which the anniversary of
                    the pope’s election was being celebrated. Whilst in the Sistine chapel receiving
                    the congratulations of the cardinals, the commissioner-general, and Cervoni, who
                    commanded the troops within the city, entered the chapel during the ceremony,
                    and announced to the sovereign pontiff that his reign was at an end.</p>
                <p>But scenes of a different and more sanguinary character were in the mean time
                    exhibited in Switzerland, a country which had preserved its neutrality during
                    the conflict between France and the combined powers. About the end of the year
                    1797, an insurrection broke out in the Pays de Vaud, a district subject to the
                    canton of Berne. This occurrence showed the government its critical situation,
                    and induced it to issue a proclamation on the 5th of January 1798, requiring the
                    people of the Pays de Vaud to appear in arms, renew their oath of allegiance,
                    and reform all abuses. A commission of the senate of Berne was also empowered to
                    examine every complaint, and redress every grievance; but their motions were
                    considered as too tardy by popular impatience, and the insurgents endeavoured to
                    make themselves masters of the strong places. Troops were sent against them by
                    the government of Berne; but General Weiss having acted with hesitation, a body
                    of republicans appeared ιmder General Menard, who sent an aid-de-camp with two
                    hussars to negotiate with Weiss. As the messengers returned, however, one of the
                    hussars was killed, most probably by accident; but this circumstance was
                    instantly magnified into a horrid breach of the law of nations. The French,
                    therefore, continued to advance, and by the end of January K∙ere masters of the
                    whole of the Pays de Vaud. The government of Berne, whilst it used every effort
                    to maintain peace, prepared for war. But a truce was entered into with General
                    Brune, the successor of Menard, and those who had killed the hussar were
                    delivered up. An army of twenty thousand men was collected, the command of which
                    was given to D’Erlach, once a field-marshal in the service of France. But
                    disaffection prevailed in this army, and the people were far from being united
                    amongst themselves. Of this the French were well aware, and therefore they
                    demanded a total change of government On the other hand, D’Erlach, apprehensive
                    of a still greater defection in his army, requested permission to put an end to
                    the armistice. The French now refused to negotiate, and on the 2d of March
                    General Schawenberg took possession of Soleure at the head of thirteen thousand
                    men; whilst Brune afterwards made himself master of Friburg, and forced the
                    Swiss army to retreat. The government of Berne, now greatly alarmed, decreed the
                    landsturm, or rising in mass, which the ancient customs of the country justified
                    in the time of necessity. The people assembled, dissolved the government, and
                    offered to dismiss the army, if the republican troops would retire. But this
                    offer was rejected, except upon the condition of admitting a French garrison
                    into Berne, and therefore the Swiss continued to advance. About six thousand of
                    the army of D’Erlach had deserted, leaving him at the head of little more than
                    fourteen thousand men; and although the rising had abundantly supplied him with
                    numbers, yet raw and undisciplined levies, however numerous, were of little
                    avail against veteran troops, and he was not allowed time to give them any
                    tiling like regular organization. He was accordingly attacked on the 5th of
                    March, and driven from Newenbeg and Favenbrun; but having rallied his troops, he
                    made a stand for some time at Uteren. The conflict was renewed at Grauholtz,
                    whence the Swiss were driven four miles nearer the capital; and being at last
                    completely defeated, they in a fit of fury and despair murdered many of their
                    officers, amongst whom was their commander-in-chief. Berne capitulated to the
                    French, and the more wealthy and populous states followed the example; but the
                    poorer cantons made a vigorous effort to preserve their small possessions, and
                    the independence of their country; they compelled Schawenberg to retire with the
                    loss of three thousand men, but were at last totally vanquished by the superior
                    skill and numbers of the republican army. The public magazines were plundered,
                    and a new constitution, modelled on that of France, was forced upon them.</p>
                <p>As the Directory had made no scruple of violating the independence of other
                    nations, it was but reasonable to expect that they would pay little regard to
                    the liberties of their own. A third of the legislature was changed in the month
                    of April; one member of the Directory also went out by ballot, and Treilhard was
                    chosen to succeed him. Nothing was left unattempted by the Directory to
                    influence the elections in favour of their friends; but their success was not
                    commensurate with their exertions. On the 2d of May, they made a complaint to
                    the Council of Five Hundred, of alleged royalist plots, by means of which it was
                    said that the elections had been made to fall on persons who were inimical to
                    the interests of the Republic; and on the 7th it was proposed by the committee
                    which reported on the message of the Directory, that many electoral assemblies
                    should be annulled. But General Jourdan opposed this plan, as incompatible with
                    the freedom of election, and as proceeding upon the supposition of conspiracies
                    the existence of which was not proved, and which most probably had no existence
                    at all.</p>
                <p>After peace had been proclaimed between France and Germany, the Directory made no
                    secret of their determination to attempt the invasion of Great Britain. Whether
                    this project originated with Bonaparte himself, or was intended by his kind
                    friends of the Directory as a snare for him and his victorious army, is a matter
                    which our readers must be left to determine for themselves. It appears, however,
                    that soon after the return of Bonaparte to the capital, where the Directory
                    received him with all imaginable splendour, an army was offered him by the
                    government, with which to invade England; and it is also certain that he
                    accepted the command. Barras, indeed, told him not to repose on his laurels, but
                    to prepare for undertaking the conquest of the bitterest and most formidable
                    enemy of the Republic; a mission, however, which it was somewhat more easy to
                    confer than to execute. This came eventually to be the opinion of the general
                    himself; after calculating all the chances, he thought it possible to gain a
                    battle on British ground, but quite hopeless to maintain a footing in that
                    country. But England, though invincible on her own soil, might be deeply wounded
                    through her commerce and her colonies; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515384"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-5384-0109"/>these he considered as the principal sinews of her
                    strength; and if he could divert in different channels the main branch of the
                    one, and seize upon the most important of the other, he doubted not that he
                    would thereby effectually humble the haughty island. Impressed with the common
                    but groundless notion that Britain derived incalculable resources from her
                    Indian dominions, and conceiving that commercial superiority must ever belong to
                    the nation which is possessed of the safest and readiest communications with the
                    East, Bonaparte thought of restoring the trade of India to its ancient channel
                    through Egypt and the Levant. With such views he contemplated the seizure and
                    conquest of the former, as the first step towards the realization of his design;
                    and this once effected, he conceived that, proceeding from Egypt as from a place
                    of arms, he might march towards the Euphrates, and in less than four months
                    reach the Indus, there to dispute with the English the possession of that
                    country whence he supposed they derived their inexhaustible resources. An
                    expedition to Egypt was therefore resolved on, with the full concurrence of the
                    Directory, who were delighted to be rid of a too fortunate soldier, and to the
                    great satisfaction of Bonaparte himself, whose imagination seems to have been
                    carried away with the idea of perhaps founding an eastern empire.</p>
                <p>This resolution, however, was kept a profound secret, and every artifice employed
                    to mislead the English as to the real destination of the intended expedition.
                    Threats of invasion were therefore studiously reiterated, and matters were so
                    contrived as to give to the necessary preparations, which could not escape
                    observation, an appearance calculated to confirm the idea that an invasion was
                    actually intended. Prodigious stories were circulated concerning large rafts of
                    timber, by means of which the Army of England was to be transported to Britain;
                    and, to give the greater probability to this report, General Bonaparte, the
                    commander-in-chief, made a journey to the coast opposite England. Meanwhile, the
                    fleet was getting ready in the harbour of Toulon, and troops were collected in
                    its vicinity; and when every thing had been prepared, Bonaparte embarked with
                    forty thousand veteran troops, and, on the 9th of June, reached Malta. Having
                    landed his troops in different places, he resolved to make himself master of
                    this island; and, after a very feeble opposition, the grand-master capitulated,
                    giving up in a few days a fortress which might have held out for months against
                    all the troops of the French Republic. Bonaparte left in the island a garrison
                    of four thousand men, and on the 21st of June sailed for Alexandria. Admiral
                    Nelson was dispatched in pursuit of the French fleet; but being wholly ignorant
                    of its destination, he sailed for Naples, where he obtained information of the
                    attack upon Malta. To that island accordingly he steered his course, and on his
                    arrival he found that Bonaparte was gone; but conjecturing that he had sailed
                    for Alexandria, he immediately prepared to follow him. The French commander,
                    however, instead of keeping a direct course towards the coast of Egypt, stood
                    along that of Greece, until he had made the easternmost point of the island of
                    Candia; then ¢teering to the southward, he protracted his voyage, so as not to
                    reach the Egyptian coast till Admiral Nelson had left it.</p>
                <p>On the 5th of July, Bonaparte landed his troops, and took by storm the city of
                    Alexandria. The republican transports were then drawn up within the inner
                    harbour of Alexandria, and the ships of war were anchored along the shore of the
                    bay of Aboukir. The republican army then marched on towards the Nile, and, in
                    proceeding along the banks of that river, suffered much from the intense heat of
                    the climate. They soon came to action with the Mamlukes; but this superb cavalry
                    found itself unequal to contend with European discipline and valour. Under Murad
                    Bey, their most distinguished chief, they made a last effort near the Pyramids;
                    but were routed with the loss of two thousand men killed, four hundred camels
                    with baggage taken, and fifty pieces of cannon. Cairo immediately
                    surrendered.</p>
                <p>Bonaparte having proceeded thus far in the conquest of Egypt, framed a
                    provisional government, and issued pro-’ clamations in Arabic, protesting that
                    the French were friendly to the religion of Mahommed, owned the authority of the
                    Grand Signior, and were only come to inflict punishment on the Mamlukes, the
                    oppressors and spoilers of Egypt. Thus far the good fortune of Bonaparte seemed
                    still to attend him. But on the 1st of August the English fleet under Admiral
                    Nelson appeared off the mouth of the Nile; and before the sun of the morrow
                    rose, that of France had been destroyed, and all communication between the
                    French army and Europe thus completely cut off. The action commenced at sunset,
                    and continued, with occasional intervals, till daybreak, when the morning
                    disclosed to the astounded invaders the extent of the calamity which had
                    befallen them. (See article <hi rend="smallcaps">Britain.)</hi> It would be
                    difficult to point out any naval engagement of modern times, productive of
                    results so important as this. The military exertions of France had by degrees
                    destroyed the combination which the princes of Europe had formed against her;
                    the victories of Bonaparte had humbled the pride of Austria; the Continent
                    looked with dismay towards the new Republic; and when the Directory seized on
                    Rome and Switzerland, no power ventured to interpose in their behalf. But in
                    consequence of the victory of the Nile the aspect of affairs suddenly underwent
                    a remarkable change, and the conqueror'of Italy was shut up in a distant
                    country, from which the fleets of Britain might prevent his return. Proposals
                    were therefore made by Britain to the northern powers, to recommence hostilities
                    against France; the states of Italy determined to make a vigorous effort for the
                    recovery of their independence; and the court of Naples, encouraged by the
                    destruction of the French fleet, threw off the mask which it had been compelled
                    to wear, and joined the new confederacy against the Republic.</p>
                <p>The French, it is well known, had long held out en-∣ couragement to the Irish
                    rebels; but as the expectations, of the latter were disappointed, .they broke
                    out into open’ rebellion without the promised assistance; and when the spirit of
                    insurrection had been almost wholly extinguished, the Directory, with its usual
                    imbecility, made a feeble attempt to revive it. On the 22d of August General
                    Humbert, with a handful of troops, amounting only to eleven hundred men, landed
                    at Killala. Yet this force, small as it was, would have proved formidable a
                    month before. On landing they were joined by a party of the more desperate
                    rebels in the vicinity, and defeated General Lake at the head of a superior
                    force, taking from him six pieces of cannon. They sent in different directions
                    to announce their arrival, advanced ashortwayinto the country, and maintained
                    their ground for three weeks. But receiving no reinforcements from France,
                    finding the rebellion in a great measure crushed, and being informed that
                    General Cornwallis was about to surround him with twenty-five men, General
                    Humbert laid down his arms to a British force four days after he had dismissed
                    his Irish associates, that they might provide for their own safety. Active
                    measures were now taken by the Directory to send troops to Ireland when it was
                    too late; the vigilance of British cruisers defeated all their endeavours. On
                    the 12th of October, La Hoche, a ship of eighty-four guns, and four frigates,
                    were captured by Sir John Borlase Warren, in attempting to reach Ireland with
                    three thousand men; on the 20th another frigate, destined for the same country,
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515397" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5397-0110"/>was also
                    taken. The Directory therefore abandoned the attempt as hopeless.</p>
                <p>The victory of the Nile, important as beyond all doubt it was in a political
                    point of view, seems nevertheless to have been over-estimated by the court of
                    Naples, which, considering the destruction of the army of Egypt as certain, now
                    rushed headlong into a new war with France. Disdaining to wait until the
                    Austrians were ready to take the field against the republicans, the king
                    prevailed on General Mack to assume the command of his army, began the war
                    without any foreign aid excepting that of the British fleet, and thus brought
                    upon himself the vengeance of the French Republic. The Directory had no
                    conception that he would adopt such an insane line of conduct; and consequently,
                    when General Mack appeared at the head of forty-five thousand men, the troops of
                    France in that quarter were not in a condition to contend with him. When General
                    Championet complained of the attack made upon his posts, he was informed that
                    his Neapolitan majesty had resolved to take possession of the Roman territory,
                    advised to retire quietly into the Cisalpine states, and further apprised that
                    his entrance into Tuscany would be considered as a declaration of war.
                    Championet having no force sufficient to contend with the Neapolitan army,
                    accordingly evacuated Rome; but he left a garrison in the castle of St Angelo,
                    and concentrated what troops he could collect in the northern parts of the Roman
                    states. In the end of November General Mack entered Rome without opposition.
                    When these transactions became known at Paris, war was immediately declared
                    against the king of Naples and the king of Sardinia. The latter had committed no
                    act of hostility against the French; but he was accused of disaffection towards
                    the Republic. This charge could scarcely fail to be true. For, ever since the
                    entrance of Bonaparte into Italy, he had been reduced to a most humiliating
                    condition; his strongest fortresses were in the possession of the French; a
                    garrison had been placed in his capital; contributions were levied from his
                    subjects at the pleasure of the conquerors; and he was reduced to such a
                    situation, that, unable to protect himself, he made a voluntary surrender of his
                    continental dominions, and agreed to retire to the island of Sardinia.</p>
                <p>But a period was soon put to the dispute with Naples. As the French retreated,
                    the people of the country gave them infinite trouble and uneasiness, and the
                    Neapolitan troops scarcely observed the rules of modem warfare towards such as
                    they made prisoners. When, by orders from General Mack, Bouchard summoned the
                    castle of St Angelo to surrender, he declared that he would view the prisoners
                    in the light of hostages for the conduct of the garrison, and that a man should
                    be put to death for every gun which was fired from the castle. It is not to be
                    imagined that the Neapolitan officers would have dared to hold such language if
                    they had not calculated on the vigorous co-operation of the Austrian forces; but
                    in this expectation they found themselves grievously disappointed, and were ere
                    long obliged to change their tone. The Neapolitan troops were defeated by one
                    fourth of their number, at Terni, Porto Fermo, Civita Castellana, Otr - coli,
                    and Calvi; and as the army of Mack was speedily reduced by defeat and desertion
                    to less than twelve thousand men, he advised the king and his family to take
                    refuge on board the British fleet which was then lying at Leghorn. This advice
                    was adopted, and the royal family reached Palermo in Sicily on the 27th of
                    December. General Mack now requested an armistice, which was refused; and being
                    driven from Capua, the only remaining post of any importance in the Neapolitan
                    territory, and in danger from the disaffection of his troope, he surrendered
                    himself and the officers of his staff as prisoners to the republican general.
                    And such was the lame and impotent conclusion of a campaign undertaken in
                    contempt of all prudence, commenced with gasconading and cruelty, and carried on
                    in such a manner as to leave it exceedingly doubtful which was more remarkable,
                    the utter incapacity of the officers, or the abject cowardice of the troops.</p>
                <p>In Naples there had long been a numerous body of men called Lazzaroni, who
                    subsisted entirely on charity. These vagabonds frequently threatened the state
                    if their wants were not immediately supplied, and their submission was often
                    purchased by liberal contributions. Having been informed that the French,
                    wherever they came, destroyed all the monasteries and other sources of charity,
                    this immense gang of sturdy beggars determined to oppose them to the utmost, and
                    to appear forsooth as the advocates of royal government In the beginning of
                    January 1799 they exhibited marks of discontent, and at last broke out into open
                    insurrection. They appointed as their commander-in-chief Prince Militomi, who,
                    however, did his utmost to restrain their violence and love of plunder. But all
                    his efforts were unavailing. They declared war against the French, forced open
                    the prisons, and murdered all who had been incarcerated for disaffection to the
                    government. Their ravages now became so dreadful and boundless, that Prince
                    Militomi abandoned them, and proceeded to Capua, where he requested Championet
                    to take possession of the city, in order to rescue it from utter destruction. It
                    was accordingly agreed that a column of French troops should advance against the
                    capital by a circuitous route, and endeavour to enter the city from the opposite
                    quarter. But before this plan could be carried into execution, a great body of
                    the Lazzaroni marched out (on the 19th and 20th of January) to attack the French
                    in the fortifications of Capua. This daring attempt failed, as might have been
                    expected, and multitudes perished by the fire of the French artillery; but in
                    order to favour the capture of Naples by the detachment sent for that purpose,
                    Championet continued on the defensive. On the 21st the Lazzaroni, informed that
                    a French column had marched for Naples, returned to the city; and although
                    Championet closely pursued them, they arrived in time to barricade the streets,
                    and prepare for the defence of different quarters. A fierce conflict now
                    commenced, and lasted from the morning of the 22d till the evening of the 23d of
                    January, when, having been driven from street to street, they finally rallied at
                    one of the gates, where they were almost totally cut off.</p>
                <p>This advantage may be considered as the last which the Directory obtained; for
                    the consequences of their past misconduct were now rapidly gathering around
                    them. They were justly unpopular at home, both from their mode of conducting
                    public affairs, and their repeated violations of the constitution. Their
                    profusion was boundless, and the demands which they made upon conquered
                    countries exorbitant. Championet was so ashamed of their proceedings, that he
                    refused to enforce their orders in Italy, and was in consequence deprived of his
                    command, and thrown into prison; whilst Scherer, the war minister, was appointed
                    his successor. Under the latter the rapacity of the government agents, and the
                    embezzlement of the public stores, were carried to an incredible extent. Still
                    France continued to be dreaded by foreign nations, to whom the true state of her
                    internal affairs was but imperfectly known. A Russian army had arrived, but the
                    cabinet of Vienna was at a loss whether to declare war or temporise a little
                    longer. Britain solicited the aid of Prussia with an offer of large subsidies;
                    but Sièyes, the French plenipotentiary at Berlin, artfully contrived to defeat
                    the negotiation, and counteract the unpopularity of his country in Germany, by
                    giving to the world the secret convention of Campo Formio, which determined the
                    greater number of the German princes to observe neutrality under the
                    guardianship of Prussia.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515410" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5410-0111"/>
                <p>On the 2d of January a note was presented to the congress at Rastadt, by the
                    French plenipotentiaries, intimating, that if the entrance of Russian troops
                    into Germany was not prevented, it would be considered as tantamount to a
                    declaration of war. To this no satisfactory answer was returned. On the 26th of
                    the same month the strong fortress of Ehrenbreitstein, which had been blockaded
                    since the treaty of Campo Formio, surrendered; and the possession of this place,
                    together with that of Mayence and Dusseldorf, rendered the French powerful on
                    the Rhine. Switzerland and all the fortified places of Italy were also in their
                    hands, so that they were fully prepared to commence active operations. At this
                    period Jourdan commanded on the Upper Rhine from Mayence to Hünningen; the
                    eastern frontier of Switzerland was occupied by Massena; Scherer commanded in
                    chief in Italy, with Moreau under him; and Macdonald was at the head of the
                    troops in the Roman and Neapolitan territories. But these armies thus
                    disseminated did not exceed a hundred and seventy thousand men, a force greatly
                    inferior to that of Austria, independently altogether of the Russian army. The
                    Directory, however, trusting to the unity of its own plans, the wavering
                    politics of the ∞urt of Vienna, and the slow movements of the imperial armies,
                    was anxious to renew the contest; and, accordingly, on the 13th of March war was
                    declared against the emperor of Germany and the Grand Duke of Tuscany. Jourdan
                    had actually crossed the Rhine at Strasburg on the first of that month, and
                    occupied strong positions in Suabia. Manheim was taken, and General Bernadotte
                    summoned Philipsburg, whilst General St Cyr entered Stutgardt. To oppose the
                    march of this army, the Archduke Charles crossed the Lech upon the 4th of March;
                    whilst, on the other side, Massena entered the territory of the Grisons,
                    surprised a strong body of Austrians, made the whole prisoners, with their
                    general and his staff.</p>
                <p>But the plan of campaign could not be carried into operation without the junction
                    of Massena’s and Jourdan’s armies; and to accomplish this it was necessary to
                    carry the important post of Feldkirch, which was occupied by General Hotze.
                    Defeated in his first attempt, Massena renewed the attack five times with fresh
                    troops; but the determined bravery of the Austrians rendered all his efforts
                    ineffectual. As the French, however, were in possession of the Grisons, this
                    facilitated the invasion of the Engadine, where the Austrians being too weak to
                    resist, retreated into the Tyrol, and were pursued by the republicans, who
                    forced some of the defiles, and pushed forward their flying parties as far as
                    Glurentz and Nauders.</p>
                <p>The vanguard of the principal Austrian army now advanced to meet the French, and
                    on the 20th of March was attacked by Jourdan, who drove in the enemy’s outposts;
                    but on the following day the centre of the French army was attacked, and forced
                    to retire to Stockach during the night. The archduke encamped before Stockach on
                    the 24th, and the republicans again attacked him on the following day. Their
                    main object of attack was his right wing under General Meerfeldt, which they
                    succeeded in driving into a wood between Liptingen and Stockach. Meerfeldt
                    renewed the conflict without success. But the left wing having maintained its
                    ground, sent reinforcements to General Meerfeldt, who in his turn obliged the
                    French to retire. The French, however, made four thousand prisoners during the
                    various movements of the day. Yet their loss was so great, and the Austrian
                    force so much superior, that Jourdan durst not hazard another engagement. He
                    therefore retreated on the following day, and, finding that he was not a match
                    for the enemy, sent part of his army to cover Kehl and Strasburg, and marched
                    with the remainder towards Switzerland. By this event General Massena, who was
                    forcing his way into the Tyrol and Engadine, was obliged to return to the
                    protection of Switzerland. He was now appointed to the chief command in this
                    quarter, and Jourdan was removed.</p>
                <p>The Austrians were not less successful in Italy, notwithstanding they had been
                    attacked by the French before the termination of the armistice. General Kray
                    obtained a complete victory at Legnago, and forced the enemy to fly for
                    protection under the walls of Mantua. On the 15th of April they were again
                    attacked by the Austrians at Memiruo)o, and forced to retreat after an obstinate
                    resistance. The loss sustained by the French in these different engagements was
                    certainly great; but the Austrians also purchased their success at a costly
                    rate. Scherer at first gained some advantages over them, but he wanted the skill
                    necessary to improve them. The Austrian posts were forced by a division of his
                    army on the 26th of March, and four thousand men made prisoners; but another
                    division being repulsed, Scherer withdrew his troops, and thus relinquished the
                    advantages he had obtained. On the 5th of April the division under Moreau was
                    again successful, and took three thousand prisoners; but, by the unskilful
                    measures of Scherer, he was not supported, and the triumph of the Austrians was
                    therefore complete.</p>
                <p>A short time previous to this, the Russians had effected! a junction with the
                    imperialists, and the command of the combined army was given to Field-marshal
                    Suwarof. The Russian commander on the 24th of April advanced towards the Adda,
                    and after carrying the outposts of Moreau, determined to attack him in his
                    intrenchments. Suwarof maintained a show of attack along the whole line of
                    Moreau, whilst he secretly threw α bridge amongst the rocks at the upper part of
                    the river, where such an operation had been considered as impossible. By this
                    bridge part of the combined army next morning turned the republican
                    fortifications, and attacked their flank and rear, whilst the remainder forced
                    the passage of the river at different points. The French fought with their usual
                    intrepidity, but were soon driven from all their positions, and forced to
                    retreat towards Pavia, with the loss of six thousand men killed, five thousand
                    prisoners including four generals, and eighty pieces of cannon.</p>
                <p>General Moreau now established the remains of his army, amounting to about twelve
                    thousand men, upon the Po, between Alessandria and Valentia, where, on the 11th
                    of May, he forced a body of Austrians to retreat, and took a number of
                    prisoners. On the 12th about seven thousand Russians crossed the Po at
                    Basignano, and marched towards Pecetto, when Moreau fell upon them with
                    incredible fury; and as they obstinately refused to lay down their arms, about
                    two thousand of their number were drowned in repassing the river, and a few
                    taken prisoners. On the advance of Suwarof, General Moreau was under the
                    necessity of retiring to occupy the Bochetta, as well as other passes leading to
                    the territory of Genoa, when the combined army commenced the sieges of the
                    fortified places in Italy then occupied by the French. Bellegarde drove the
                    French from the Engadine; Massena, pressed by the archduke, was obliged to
                    retire to the vicinity of Zurich; and nearly the whole of Piedmont had risen
                    against the republicans. The armies received no reinforcements from the interior
                    of France, and their officers were obliged to act upon the defensive. In one
                    instance only they had the power of acting on the offensive, and it was
                    certainly done with great vigour. General Macdonald had still a considerable
                    army in the territories of Naples and of Rome; and the combined powers had made
                    no effort to cut off his retreat, which, indeed, could scarcely be accomplished
                    in the mountainous countries of Tuscany and Genoa. Knowing his situation secure,
                    he was in no haste to withdraw, although nearly the whole of the country between
                    him and France was occupied by the allies. His army amounted to about thirty
                    thousand men, and he <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515423"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-5423-0112"/>had received orders from the Directory to leave
                    the territories of Rome and Naples, and unite, if possible, with the army of
                    Moreau. From the situation of the allies, however, he resolved to hazard an
                    action by himself. With Moreau he had concerted a plan for dividing the enemy,
                    and vanquishing them in detail, as Bonaparte had previously done with so much
                    success. Macdonald alone was in a situation to strike an important blow; but it
                    was nevertheless necessary that Moreau should draw upon himself as many of the
                    Austro-Russian forces as possible, in order that the remainder might be the more
                    completely exposed to the-attack of Macdonald.</p>
                <p>Moreau artfully availed himself of the circumstance of the French and Spanish
                    fleets being in the vicinity of Genoa, to spread a report that they had brought
                    him powerful reinforcements, intending thereby to withdraw the attention of
                    Suwarof from Macdonald. The Russian general was at Turin, and his advanced posts
                    were at Susa, Pignerol, and the Col d’Assiette, whilst General Hohenzollern was
                    stationed at Modena with a considerable force, and General Ott occupied Reggio
                    with ten thousand men. General Macdonald began his operations on the 12th of
                    June, when his advanced divisions attacked and defeated Hohenzollern, and made
                    two thousand prisoners. General Ott was also attacked, and compelled to retreat,
                    upon which the French made their entry into Parma on the 14 th. The Austrian
                    general was again attacked on the 17th, and forced to retire towards Giovanni;
                    but here the progress of the French was arrested by a more powerful and
                    determined antagonist.</p>
                <p>- Suwarof having received information of the approach and successes of Macdonald,
                    left Turin on the 15th of June, at the head of twenty thousand men, and came up
                    with the enemy upon the banks of the Tidone. The centre and right wing of
                    Suwaroſ’s army were commanded by Rosenberg and Förster; the Austrian general,
                    Melas, commanded the left wing; Prince Bagration was at the head of the advanced
                    guard; and Prince Lichtenstein Commanded the reserve. An action immediately
                    ensued, and was continued with desperate fury for three successive days, when
                    victory at length declared in favour of Suwarof. Driven from the Tidone to the
                    Trebbia, the French were finally defeated on the 19th, after a greater slaughter
                    on both sides than the oldest officer ever recollected to have witnessed.
                    Victory had remained doubtful until General Kray arrived with large
                    reinforcements from the army besieging Mantua, and, in direct .contempt of his
                    orders, decided the fortune of this protracted and terrible battle. The
                    republicans retreated during the night, and were next day pursued by the army of
                    Suwarof formed in two columns. Seldom could the French be overtaken in retreat;
                    but this the victorious barbarian accomplished, and, having surrounded the
                    rear-guard, obliged them to Jay down their arms. The rest of the army defended
                    themselves in the passes of the Appennines and territory of Genoa, after losing
                    nearly half their numbers in killed, wounded, and prisoners. Moreau, in the mean
                    time, gave battle to the Austrians under Bellegarde, who, though greatly
                    superior in numbers, were totally defeated. But this temporary advantage proved
                    of little avail. Suwarof rapidly returned from the pursuit of Macdonald, and
                    Moreau was compelled to retire. The fortresses of Italy now surrendered in dose
                    succession, and the combined powers regained a complete ascendency in that
                    country.</p>
                <p>The affairs of the republic became equally critical in Palestine. After having
                    defeated the Mamlukes, and made himself master of Alexandria and Cairo,
                    Bonaparte led an army into Palestine. At the head of ten thousand men, with
                    officers eminently skilled in war, he reached Acre on the sea-coast, and laid
                    siege in due form to this town, which was but indifferently fortified, and
                    defended by a small garrison. But Sir Sidney Smith received the command, and
                    detained Bonaparte sixty days before Acre, although the number of the garrison
                    by whom it was defended scarcely exceeded three thousand men. The French
                    commander made eleven successive attempts to carry the place by assault; but in
                    all these he proved unsuccessful, and was at last obliged to raise the siege,
                    after he had lost eight generals, eighty-five inferior officers, and nearly one
                    half of his army. The successful defence of this place destroyed the <hi
                    rend="italic">prestige</hi> of invincibility, and mainly contributed to decide
                    the fate of the French army in Egypt.</p>
                <p>Whilst France experienced such reverses abroad, she was much disturbed also by
                    internal commotions, and the Directory now found itself in a most critical
                    situation. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> The new elections were still
                    unfavourable to their interest, and they could no longer command a majority in
                    the Councils. When they sought money they met with reproaches for their
                    profusion; and royalist insurrections in the west and south were with difficulty
                    subdued, on account of the absence of the military. But in the midst of these
                    difficulties an event occurred which seemed to promise the Directory the return
                    of their former influence. On the 28th of April the French plenipotentiaries
                    having received orders to quit Rastadt in twenty-four hours, demanded passports
                    from Colonel Barbasey, but were informed that none could grant these excepting
                    the commander-in-chief. They accordingly set out without passports. The three
                    ministers, Bonnier, Roberjot, and Jean Débry, were in separate carriages,
                    Robeŗjot having his wife, and Jean Débry his wife and daughters along with him;
                    and they were attended by the ministers of the Cisalpine Republic. At a short
                    distance from Rastadt, however, they were met by fifty Austrian hussars, who
                    stopped the carriage of Jean Débry, and fiercely demanded his name. Débry gave
                    them the information required, adding, that he was a French minister returning
                    to his own country. He was immediately torn from his carriage, desperately
                    wounded with sabres, and thrown into a ditch for dead; whilst Bonnier and
                    Robeŗjot were murdered outright on the spot. When the ruffians departed, the
                    carriages returned to Rastadt, and Jean Débry wanderéd all night in the woods.
                    Next day he retraced his steps, and demanded the restitution of the papers which
                    the assassins had carried off when they plundered the carriages; but these were
                    refused. Rastadt and its vicinity had been occupied by French troops during the
                    sitting of the congress, and the Austrians had obtained possession of the place
                    only a few days before. In any view, therefore, this event was a severe reproach
                    to the discipline of the Austrian army; but it is probable that more than the
                    want of subordination was at the bottom of a crime so atrocious, indeed
                    unprecedented in the history of civilized nations. The archduke, it is true,
                    lost no time in declaring his utter ignorance of the matter, in a letter
                    addressed to Massena; but this was far from giving satisfaction to the Directory
                    or to France. In a message to the Councils on the 5th of May, they accordingly
                    described it as a premeditated act on the part of the Austrian government,
                    intended to insult France by the murder of her ambassadors.</p>
                <p>The introduction of a new third this year into the legislature was the
                    commencement of a violent opposition to the Directory. Sièyes, who had been
                    ambassador at Berlin, and possessed considerable influence over all parties, was
                    elected a member of the Directory. This station he refused to occupy on the
                    establishment of the constitution, and therefore his acceptance of it at such a
                    critical juncture excited surprise. Treilhard was removed upon the pretence that
                    he had held an office in the state within less than a year previously to his
                    election; and Merlin and Re-veillòre-Lepeaux were under the necessity of
                    resigning, to avoid a threatened impeachment. Barras, however, stiU <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193515436" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5436-0113"/> retained his
                    place, and Moulins, Gohier, and Ducos, men little known, were chosen members of
                    the Directory. An attempt was made to revive public spirit by the establishment
                    of clubs; a proceeding of which the Jacobins were the first to take advantage.
                    They soon proposed violent measures, and began to denounce the members as well
                    as the conduct of government. But their intemperance having alarmed the
                    Directory, permission was at length obtained from the Councils to suppress their
                    meetings.</p>
                <p>The Directory now employed every effort to reinforce the armies which had lately
                    suffered such dreadful losses. In the beginning of August the army of Italy
                    amounted to forty-five thousand men, and General Joubert was promoted to the
                    chief command. Turin, Alessandria, Milan, Peschiera, and Ferrara, were captured
                    by the allies with astonishing rapidity. Turin sustained a bombardment of only
                    three days, Alessandria held out seven, and Mantua only fourteen; the latter
                    place contained thirteen thousand men, who were dismissed on their parole. The
                    combined forces next laid siege to Tortona; but General Joubert resolved to
                    attempt its relief, which he expected to accomplish before the arrival of Kray
                    with reinforcements. On the 13th of August, the whole of the Austrian posts were
                    driven in by the republicans, who took possession of Novi. But on the 15th they
                    were attacked by Suwarof, who had by this time received reinforcements from
                    Mantua under General Kray. The right wing was commanded by Kray, the left by
                    Melas, and’ the centre by Prince Bagration and Suwarof in person. The engagement
                    commenced about five o’clock in the morning; but soon afterwards General
                    Joubert, whilst urging his troops forward to charge with the bayonet, received a
                    musket shot in his body, and falling from his horse, immediately expired. Moreau
                    now assumed the command, and after a bloody conflict the allied army gave way in
                    all directions. The Russians in particular suffered severely from the obstinate
                    manner in which they fought. The French line was attacked at three in the
                    afternoon, but remained unbroken; and the whole would have terminated in the
                    defeat of the allies if General Melas had not turned the right flank of the
                    republican line, and, following up his advantages, obtained possession of Novi,
                    when the French army began to retire under the direction of General Moreau. The
                    French now lost all hope of being able to defend Genoa, and therefore prepared
                    to evacuate that city and territory. The Directory fully expected that the south
                    of France would immediately be invaded; but in this they were happily deceived.
                    The conquered army was astonished to find itself unmolested after so signal a
                    defeat, and in a few days sent back parties to reconnoitre the movements of the
                    allies. Championet, the successor of Joubert, was amazed to discover that they
                    had rather retreated than advanced, on which account he resumed the positions
                    which the army had occupied before the battle of Novi.</p>
                <p>So far from prosecuting the advantages which he had ' obtained in Italy, Suwarof
                    was persuaded to abandon that country with the Russian troops, and to march to
                    the deliverance of Switzerland. In the month of August, the army of Massena in
                    this quarter amounted to seventy thousand men, a force which not only prevented
                    the archduke from pursuing his advantages, but even enabled the French to
                    threaten lus position; and the right wing under General Lecourbe had carried
                    Mount St Gothard, the great pass leading from the eastern parts of Switzerland
                    into Italy· Suwarofs expectations were no doubt high, as he had never yet been
                    beaten; and he felt flattered in being called upon to undertake an enterprise in
                    which the Austrians had hitherto failed, even under their most fortunate
                    general. But when he was ready to march, the Austrian commander in Italy refused
                    to furnish him with mules for transporting his baggage, and asserted that he
                    would be furnished with a competent number at Bellinzone, where, however, none
                    were to be found. Suwarof had therefore no alternative but to dismount his
                    cavalry, and make use of their horses to drag along the baggage. In spite of all
                    obstacles, however, he arrived, by forced marches, on the frontiers of
                    Switzerland, upon the very day which he hadstipulated with the archduke. But the
                    archduke, either supposing that it would demean a prince of the house of Austria
                    to serve under a Russian general, or not having courage enough to require the
                    most experienced general in Europe to receive orders from one so much his
                    junior, immediately marched into Suabia, and carried with him a large body of
                    troops. It is not easy to conceive upon what principle the council of war at
                    Vienna could imagine that so very able an officer as Massena would continue
                    inactive at the head of an army almost double that which had been sent to oppose
                    him. The archduke marched against the French in Suabia, who resisted him as long
                    as the small number of their troops would permit; but they were gradually driven
                    towards the Rhine. To carry on the deception, however, they made a serious stand
                    in the vicinity of Manheim, where they lost nearly eighteen hundred men.</p>
                <p>In the mean time Switzerland was completely exposed to the army of Massena. The
                    right wing of the combined army was commanded by General Hotze; the centre,
                    composed of the newly arrived Russians, was headed by Korsakof, and the left
                    wing by General Nauendorf. As soon as Massena understood that the archduke had
                    entered Manheim, and that Suwarof was approaching Switzerland by St Gothard, he
                    commenced his movements, and, as St Gothard was defended by Lecourbe, determined
                    to anticipate the Russian general. Having by a false attack, on the 24th of
                    September, drawn the attention of the Russians to another quarter, he suddenly
                    crossed the Limmat, three leagues from Zurich. Some French divisions now engaged
                    the Austrians, but the main body of the army marched against the Russians. Hotze
                    fell in the beginning of the action, and Petrasch, who succeeded him, saved
                    himself from a total defeat by retiring in the night with the loss of four
                    thousand men. The Russians fought with singular obstinacy, though in a
                    mountainous country to which they were strangers, and contending against the
                    ablest commanders in Europe. It was in vain to attempt to put them to flight,
                    for even when surrounded they refused to lay down their arms, and stood to be
                    slaughtered on the spot. But the Austrians having retreated on the 25th, the
                    Russians on the 28th followed their example, retiring in good order under
                    General Korsakof, but with the loss of three thousand men, which, considering
                    their perilous situation, was not very great.</p>
                <p>During these transactions General Suwarof was advan-i cing from Italy with an
                    army of from fifteen to eighteen <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> thousand men.
                    Having carried the pass of St Gothard, he <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> descended
                    into the valley of Urseren, drove Lecourbe before him with great slaughter, and
                    advanced as far as Altorf. He next day reached the canton of Glaris, and made a
                    thousand prisoners, whilst General Linken defeated another corps of thirteen
                    hundred men. Massena now turned upon Suwarof, and surrounding him on all sides,
                    expected to take both the field-marshal himself and the grand duke Constantine
                    prisoners. But Suwarof defended himself in a masterly manner, and there being
                    one pass in the mountains which the republicans had left unoccupied, the veteran
                    discovered it, and thus effected his escape, but lost his cannon and baggage
                    amongst the dreadful precipices with which the country abounds. He made his way
                    through the country of the Grisons, and arrived at Coire with only about six
                    thousand men. When Suwarof discovered in what manner affairs had been conducted,
                    when he ascertained the perilous situation in which the Russians had been left
                    by the archduke, and saw the destruction which had in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193515449" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5449-0114"/>consequence overtaken them,
                    his indignation knew no bounds; he considered himself and his men as betrayed,
                    complained bitterly of the commander of the allies in Switzerland, publicly
                    charged the council of war at Vienna with selfishness and injustice, and refused
                    any longer to co-operate with the Austrian army. He transmitted an account of
                    the whole to Petersburg, and withdrew his forces to the vicinity of Augsburg,
                    there to wait for further orders from his court.</p>
                <p>- In the mean time Great Britain made active preparation! to invade Holland, with
                    an army of forty thousand men. composed of British troops and Russian
                    auxiliaries. The first division, under General Sir Ralph Abercromby, sailed in
                    the month of August, protected by a fleet under Admiral Duncan; but bad weather
                    prevented any attempt to land the troops till the morning of the 27th, when the
                    disembarkation was effected without opposition, at the Helder Point. As the
                    invaders had not been expected to land in North Holland, there were but few
                    troops in that neighbourhood to oppose them. But before the British had
                    proceeded far they were met by a considerable body of infantry, cavalry, and
                    artillery, hastily collected from the adjacent towns. The Dutch fought with
                    great obstinacy, but, fatigued by the steady opposition of their antagonists,
                    they fell back about two leagues, and in the night evacuated the fort of Helder,
                    which was taken possession of by the British on the morning of the 28th. Admiral
                    Mitchell now entered the Zuyder-Zce with a detachment of the British fleet, in
                    order to give battle to the Dutch under Admiral Story; but the latter, instead
                    of retiring to the shallow water with which that sea abounds, surrendered his
                    whole fleet, on the 30th of August, without firing a gun, pretending that from
                    the mutinous disposition of his seamen he could not prevail upon them to fight.
                    If the expedition had terminated here it would have been fortunate. This
                    success, however, was followed up by an attempt to restore the authority of the
                    stadtholder, and to re-establish the ancient form of government. But as no more
                    than the first division had arrived, the terror of invasion began to be
                    dissipated, the enemies of the new government became disheartened, and time was
                    allowed to prepare for defence. Nor were these the only errors chargeable
                    against the expedition. The British troops were landed in the worst place which
                    could possibly have been selected, in a part of the country everywhere
                    intersected by ditches and canals, and abounding more than any other with
                    persons disaffected to the person and government of the stadtholder; and this
                    unfortunate expedition was undertaken towards the approach of the rainy season,
                    when a campaign in Holland is next to impossible. An invasion of Holland seemed
                    so natural an operation on the part of Britain, and one too which might be
                    undertaken with so many advantages by a power which had the command of the sea,
                    that when it was first talked of the French Directory hesitated to undertake the
                    defence of that country; but when the time and the place of disembarkation came
                    to be known, the prospect of an almost certain success put an end to every doubt
                    on the subject; and General Brune was accordingly sent with such troops as could
                    be hastilycollected, to co-operate with General Daendels. In the mean while, as
                    no reinforcement had arrived, General Abercromby could only act on the
                    defensive; and the enemy, encouraged by his want of activity, ventured to attack
                    him on the 10th of September. Two columns of Dutch and one of republicans
                    advanced against the invaders, but were repulsed in every direction, and forced
                    to retreat to Alkmaer. On the 13th additional troops arrived under the Duke of
                    York, who now assumed the chief command; and the Russians having also arrived,
                    the army, upon the 19th, assumed the offensive. The left wing under General
                    Abercromby advanced along the shore of the Zuyder-Zee to attack Hoome; Generals
                    Dundas and Pulteney commanded the centre columns; and the Russians were led by
                    their own general D’Herman. But, owing to some misconception, the Russians
                    advanced to attack the enemy about three o’clock in the morning, some hours
                    before the rest of the army had begιm its march. Their first efforts, however,
                    were crowned with success, and they made themselves masters of the village of
                    Bergen; but as they pressed too eagerly forward, without waiting for the <hi
                    rend="italic">cooperation of</hi> the other columns, the enemy nearly surrounded
                    them; their general was made prisoner; and notwith- <hi rend="smallcaps">į</hi>
                    standing that the British troops came up in time to cover their retreat, they
                    lost upwards of three thousand men. This defeat of the right wing induced the
                    commander-in-chief to recall his troops from their advanced positions,
                    notwithstanding Abercromby had by this time made himself . master of Hoorne and
                    its garrison, and Pulteney had carried by assault the chief position of the
                    Dutch army. The severity of the weather prevented any fresh attack being made
                    till the 2d of October. On that day, however, an action" was fought between the
                    British and the united Dutch and French troops, which was warmly contested, and
                    did not terminate till late in the evening, when the British regained possession
                    of Alkmaer and the neighbouring villages. But as this engagement had taken place
                    among the sandhills near the sea, the fatigue which the troops had undergone
                    prevented them from profiting by their victory; and the fugitives were enabled
                    to take up a position between Baverwyck and Wyck-op-Zee. Here they were again
                    attacked on the 6th by the Duke of York, who after a sanguinary contest kept
                    possession of the field. This, however, was the last success gained by the
                    invading army. The Duke of York, finding that he could make no further progress,
                    that the enemy had been rapidly reinforced, and that the difficulties presented
                    by the face of the country and the badness of the weather also conspired against
                    him, retired to Schager Brug, where he waited for fresh orders from England. But
                    being closely pressed by the enemy, the embarkation of the troops must have been
                    effected with great <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> difficulty, had he not
                    entered into a convention with the Dutch and French that his retreat should not
                    be molested, in return for which he engaged not to injure the country by
                    demolishing any of the dikes which defended it against the sea, and also to
                    restore to France and Holland eight thousand prisoners taken before the present
                    campaign.</p>
                <p>The affairs of the French Republic now began to wear a more favourable aspect.
                    Championet, it is true, had been defeated in Italy, and Ancona surrendered on
                    the 13th of November to General Frölich; but the French were still masters of
                    the Genoese territory, Switzerland, and Holland; and the new combination formed
                    against them seemed about to be dissolved. Prussia withdrew at an early period,
                    and still preserved a neutrality; and, from the fate of Suwarof’s army, it was
                    reasonable to conclude that the emperor of Russia would also desert the cause of
                    the allies.</p>
                <p>But the crisis of the directorial government was now fast approaching. Bonaparte,
                    on his retreat from Syria, had received intelligence that a Turkish army,
                    supported by a fleet, was about to invade Egypt. He hastened his return across
                    the desert, and arrived in the vicinity of the Pyramids on the 11th of July,
                    when he found that an army consisting of eighteen thousand Moslemins had landed
                    at Aboukir, carried that place by assault, and put the garrison, consisting of
                    five hundred men, to the sword. On the 15th he marched against these new
                    invaders, and ten days afterwards not only defeated, but annihilated, their
                    whole force, slaying about half their number, and driving the remainder into the
                    sea. On the 10th of October the Directory received a dispatch announcing this
                    victory; and on the" 14th of the same month the less agreeable intelligence was
                    communicated, that Bonaparte, accompanied with his principal officers, had
                    landed on the shores of Provence. The state to which France had been reduced
                    under the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515462" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5462-0115"
                    />directorial regime was truly deplorable. Not to mention the disastrous defeats
                    which had been sustained by the French army, the loss of Italy, and of all the
                    advantages secured to the Republic by the treaty of Campo Formio, the provinces
                    had fallen into a state of extreme disorganization; the roads were infested with
                    brigands; and, by the law of hostages, all persons nobly born, or related to the
                    nobility, were obliged either to skulk in concealment, or to join the insurgent
                    bands. The rich were vexed with the same exactions as in the early period of the
                    Revolution, when the country was menaced with invasion; the great mass of the
                    population had been decimated by the consumption of the armies; the fields in
                    many places remained uncultivated; disorder and misery everywhere prevailed. The
                    necessity of a change was every day becoming more and more obvious; and whatever
                    difference of opinion there might be in the capital, the provinces were prepared
                    to submit to any government which might supersede the Directory. Even the
                    members of this body itself had become convinced that the period of its demise
                    was at no great distance. Barras treated with the Bourbons; Sièyes had
                    repeatedly remarked that the chief thing wanting was a <hi rend="italic"
                    >head</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> others held similar language; and the minds
                    of all, excepting the extreme democrats, were prepared for a change.</p>
                <p>Bonaparte, on his arrival, repaired to the Luxembourg. The Directory praised and
                    feared, but dared not reproach him with the bold step he had taken in returning
                    to France. He had evidently come to watch the course of events, and with this
                    view shut himself up in a modest mansion in the Rue Chantereine. But it soon
                    appeared that he was the loadstone which drew to it all interests and all
                    ambition; ministers, generals, deputies, men in office who desired to retain
                    their places, and men out of office who desired to dispossess the actual
                    occupants, flocked in crowds to General Bonaparte. All parties in fact made
                    overtures to him; the extreme democrats, who sought in him an instrument, and
                    the moderates, who desired the re-establishment of order at almost any price.
                    Not to have picked up the fragments of sovereign power which thus crumbled and
                    fell at his feet, would have been an act of self-denial unexampled in the annals
                    of ambition. The country had despaired of obtaining at once a free and an
                    efficient government; and, tom by the violence of contending factions, it now
                    languished for repose. Bonaparte took several days to mature his plans, and
                    decide on the course which he was to adopt. The democrats and moderates were
                    equally eager in their advances. But his revolutionary connections inclined him
                    to the former; and as his brother Lucien had, in compliment to him, been chosen
                    president of the Council of Five Hundred, Bonaparte proposed, through this
                    party, to become Director in room of Sièyes. Gohier and Moulins were accordingly
                    sounded, but these pragmatical blockheads objected on the ground of the law
                    which required that a director should be forty years of age. The facility of
                    getting a dispensation voted was hinted at; but they persisted, not seeing the
                    inevitable consequences of their obstinacy; and Bonaparte instantly joined
                    Sièyes and the moderates, with whom he planned a change, not only in the
                    members, but also in the form of government. But to effect this, it was
                    necessary to commence with a <hi rend="italic">coup d’</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >état,</hi> or revolution; and the success of the latter must in a great measure
                    depend on the support of the military. Of that order Bonaparte was the natural
                    representative, and great exertions were now employed to secure its
                    co-operation. He could reckon on the inferior officers and the troops; their
                    idol is always a victorious leader. But three of the generals, Moreau,
                    Ãu-gereau, and Bernadotte, were either too high in rank to stoop to a comrade,
                    or too republican in principle to acquiesce in a project of revolution which
                    might terminate in establishing a despotism. Moreau, however, was irresolute,
                    and being discontented with the Directory, suffered himself to be neutralized,
                    if not gained over; Augereau, brave in the field of battle, wanted political
                    courage and ' conduct; and even Bernadotte, who had both, and argued stoutly
                    against Bonaparte, was stilled, awed, or duped by his address.</p>
                <p>On the 18th of Brumaire, the day fixed for this revolution, Bonaparte summoned
                    all the generals and officers in Paris to an early breakfast. It was a kind of
                    levee; some regiments were to be reviewed; and it was necessary to harangue the
                    troops. The Directors Barras, Moulins, and Gohier, were kept in ignorance of the
                    plot; they inhabited the same palace, that of the Luxembourg, and, forming a
                    majority of the Directory, might have done mischief. The first step, however,
                    had all the forms of legality. The Council of Ancients, in which the influence
                    of Sièyes predominated, met at six in the morning, and passed the preconcerted
                    decree removing the sittings of the legislative body to Saint Cloud, and
                    conferring upon Bonaparte the command of the troops in the capital. The decree
                    was brought to Bonaparte in the midst of his levee, and immediately communicated
                    to the officers present, whom he also addressed. The moment for action had now
                    arrived. Seizing Lefebvre by the arm, he presented him with a sword, and won the
                    rough soldier by a few magical words. The decree of the Legislative Assembly
                    secured the obedience of Moreau. Bernadotte alone stood firm, but he was not
                    permitted to retire, until he had given a promise not to raise agitations,
                    harangue the soldiers, or act in any way until legally summoned. Having thus
                    made himself certain of the military, Bonaparte rode to the Tuileries, reviewed
                    the troops, and watched the course of events. Talleyrand had been sent to the
                    Luxembourg to induce Barras to resign, and the latter had sent his secretary to
                    the Tuileries to collect tidings. The directorial emissary was brought to
                    Bonaparte, who instantly addressed him as if he had been the Directory itself:
                    “What have you done with France, which I left so brilliant? I left peace and I
                    find war, victories and I find reverses; I left you the millions of Italy, and I
                    find nothing but spoliation and misery. Where are the hundred thousand soldiers,
                    my companions in glory? They are dead.” This was spoken to excite the officers
                    around, and to dispose them to march against the Luxembourg, which he was now
                    prepared to do. But the prudence of Barras rendered such a step unnecessary.
                    Having received from Talleyrand a promise of oblivion for the past, wealth and
                    impunity for the future, he signed his resignation, and left the capital for his
                    house in the country, attended by an escort of dragoons. Moulins and Gohier,
                    less accommodating, were ordered to be put under a guard in the Luxembourg, and
                    Moreau was charged with this invidious duty. As Sièyes and Ducos had also
                    resigned, the Directory was now virtually dissolved; and all that remained to be
                    done was to replace it with a new executive government.</p>
                <p>On the following day, being the 19th of Brumaire, the members of the two Councils
                    met at Saint Cloud. Bonaparte had occupied the road and the environs of the
                    château with troops; but his project was still far from being accomplished. The
                    democratic majority in the Council of Five Hundred were indignant; the moderate
                    majority in the Council of Ancients wavered as the crisis approached; and whilst
                    the one prepared for extremities, the other began to repent their own act, and
                    to be apprehensive of the intentions of Bonaparte. When the Councils met, the
                    greatest agitation prevailed. In the Five Hundred the oath of fidelity to the
                    constitution was renewed; and it was feared that some similar demonstration
                    would be made by the Ancients. Informed of this dangerous spirit of resistance,
                    Bonaparte resolved to confront, and if possible put it down by his presence.
                    Surrounded by his staff, he accordingly entered the Council of the Ancients, and
                    addressed their <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515475" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5475-0116"
                    />president, but with so much confusion both of language and of manner that his
                    partisans began to despair. “Representatives,” said he, “you are on a volcano. I
                    was tranquil yesterday when your decree was brought me, and I have come with my
                    comrades to your aid. On this account I am recompensed with calumnies. I am
                    stigmatized as a Cromwell and a Caesar. If such were my character, I had no need
                    of coming here.” He then mentioned the resignation of the Directors, the
                    distress of the country, and the agitated state of the Council of Five Hundred,
                    upon which, he said, no dependence could be placed; and he besought the Ancients
                    to save the Revolution, liberty, and equality. “And the constitution,” exclaimed
                    a voice. “The constitution !” repeated Bonaparte, pausing and collecting
                    himself; “I tell you, you have no constitution. You violated it in Fructidor, in
                    Floreal, and in Frairial, when you seized by force and condemned the national
                    representatives, when you annulled the popular elections, when you compelled
                    three directors to resign. The constitution, forsooth! a name at once invoked
                    and violated by every faction in turn. What force can it possess, when it has
                    ceased to command even respect? The government, if you would have such a thing,
                    must be fixed on a new basis.” Having thus shown the necessity of the
                    revolution, he then proceeded to re-assure his partisans, by promising it
                    success; and, pointing to the glittering bayonets of the soldiers, “I am
                    accompanied,” added he, “by the god of fortune and of war.” The Ancients
                    applauded this speech, and Bonaparte, satisfied with the effect it had produced,
                    hurried to the other wing of the chateau, where, in the Orangery, the Council of
                    Five Hundred were in a state of extreme excitement. Leaving his staff behind, he
                    advanced into the hall, whilst the grenadiers who followed him remained at the
                    door. As he proceeded towards the chair, which was occupied by his brother
                    Lucien, a violent tumult ensued, and the epithets “Cromwell,” “Caesar,”
                    “Usurper,” were freely applied to him from all parts of the house. Had the
                    assembly heard him calmly, and then voted him a traitor or outlaw, his career
                    might have been speedily closed; for Jourdan and Augereau were both without, and
                    might easily have withheld or drawn off the soldiers. Instead of this, however,
                    the exasperated deputies sprang from their seats as soon as he appeared, and
                    pressing upon him, collared, hustled, and maltreated him, whilst Arena Corsican
                    endeavoured to dispatch him with a dagger. The grenadiers flew to his
                    assistance, and rescued him from their fury. “Let us outlaw him; a vote of
                    outlawry,” was the instant cry of the assembly; “let him be treated like
                    Robespierre, let him be put <hi rend="italic">hors la loi.”</hi> But Lucien
                    refused to put the decree to the vote; he resisted, gained time, and at length,
                    when about to be overpowered, was borne out of the hall by the grenadiers whom
                    Napoleon sent to his assistance. Throughout the whole of this trying scene the
                    civilian showed more courage and presence of mind than the soldier. Divesting
                    himself of his robes, Lucien mounted a horse and harangued the troops, telling
                    them that the majority <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> f the Council of Five
                    Hundred were held in terror by a few democrats armed with poniards, who menaced
                    them, and attempted to assassinate the general. 1 his declaration produced a
                    great impression; and the demand whether they might be reckoned on was answered
                    with acclamations by the troops. A company of grenadiers was instantly ordered
                    to clear the Orangery. They advanced from the one end to the other with fixed
                    bayonets, whilst the deputies escaped by the windows and through the woods,
                    leaving i <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi> their retreat fragments of their robes
                    upon almost every bush. In the evening of the same day the Council of Ancients,
                    and about fifty members of the dispersed Council of Five Hundred, passed a
                    decree abolishing the Directory, and establishing in its room three consuls,
                    Bonaparte, Sièyes, and Roger Ducos, as a provisional government, which, in
                    concert with two committees chosen from each council, was authorized to prepare
                    a constitution.</p>
                <p>The plan of a new constitution was presented to the. public by the consuls in the
                    month of December 1799. ∣ According to this plan, eighty men, who had the power
                    of nominating their own successors, and were called the Conservative Senate, had
                    likewise authority to elect the whole of the legislators and executive rulers of
                    the state, whilst none of these offices could be held by themselves. One man,
                    called the chief or first consul, was to possess the sovereign authority, to
                    hold his office for ten years, and to be competent to be re-elected; and other
                    two consuls were to assist in his deliberations, but to have no power to control
                    his will. The legislative power was divided into two assemblies; the Tribunate,
                    composed of a hundred members, and the Conservative Senate, of three hundred.
                    When the first consul thought proper to propose a law, the Tribunate might
                    debate upon it, without having authority to vote either for or against it,
                    whilst the members of the Senate might vote, but were not entitled to debate.
                    The consuls and Lite members of the legislative body, as well as of the
                    Conservative Senate, were not responsible for their conduct; but the ministers
                    of state employed by them were understood to be accountable. The committees
                    which framed the constitution nominated the persons who were to execute the
                    functions of government. Bonaparte was appointed first consul, and Cambacérès
                    and Lebrun second and third consuls. Sièyes, as formerly, declined taking any
                    active part in the administration of public affairs, and received, as a gratuity
                    for his services, an estate belonging to the nation, called Crosne, in the
                    department of the Seine and Oisne.</p>
                <p>Bonaparte had not been long in possession of the reins of government, when he
                    made overtures for negotiating 1 peace with the allied powers at war with
                    France. Separate <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> proposals were made to the
                    different belligerent powers, ' no doubt with a view to dissolve the coalition;
                    but the decrees of the Convention which had declared war against all the powers
                    of Europe still remained unrepealed. Departing from the forms sanctioned by the
                    custom of nations in carrying on diplomatic correspondence, he addressed a
                    letter directly to his Britannic majesty, the substance of which was, whether
                    the war, which had for eight years ravaged the four quarters of the globe, was
                    to be eternal? and whether there were no means by which Britain and France might
                    come to a good understanding? To these questions the British ministry made a
                    formal and elaborate reply, in which they dwelt much on the bad faith of the
                    revolutionary rulers, and the instability of the governments of France since the
                    subversion of the monarchy. The overture transmitted to Vienna was of a similar
                    description, and experienced similar treatment; but, irritated by the shameful
                    treatment of Suwarof while carrying on the war in Italy and Switzerland, the
                    emperor of Russia abandoned the coalition.</p>
                <p>On the 7th of March Bonaparte sent a message to the legislative body, containing
                    his ideas as to the conduct and designs of the British cabinet, and assuring
                    them that he would invoke peace in the midst of battles and triumphs, and fight
                    only for the happiness of France and the repose of the world. This message was
                    followed by two decrees; the one calling, in the name of honour, upon every
                    soldier absent upon leave from the armies of Italy and the Rhine, to join them
                    before the 5th of April; and the other appointing a fresh army of reserve to be
                    assembled at Dijon, under the immediate command of the first consul.</p>
                <p>About this time the belligerent powers were nearly ready. to open the campaign
                    both in Italy and on the Rhine. The Genoese Republic formed the only territory
                    of any importance in Italy, which remained in the hands of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193515488" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5488-0117"/>French; but the army by which
                    it was defended had been very much reduced since the preceding year, and might
                    be considered as in a state of mutiny, from the want of pay, clothes, and
                    provisions. The Austrians were most anxious to obtain possession of Genoa and
                    its dependencies; and in this they were seconded by the Genoese themselves, who
                    regarded the republicans as the destroyers of their commerce. Massena received
                    the command of the army in Genoa, with extraordinary powers, and by his conduct
                    proved himself a general of consummate abilities. Carrying with him a
                    reinforcement of troops from Lyons and Marseilles, and reducing to order and
                    obedience all whom he had found ready to desert their standards, he was soon at
                    the head of a force sufficient to check the progress of the Austrians, and to
                    keep the Genoese in subjection. But after a number of battles, all of them most
                    vigorously contested, he was at length obliged to retire within the city, where
                    he had soon an opportunity of distinguishing himself by one of the ablest and
                    most obstinate defences on record. The appearance of the British fleet on the
                    5th of April was the preconcerted signal for Melas to attack Genoa, the
                    communication between which and France was thus cut off. But previously to the
                    arrival of Lord Keith, a quantity of wheat and other provisions had been thrown
                    into the city, by which means the army and the inhabitants were rescued from
                    immediate famine. The surrounding country was soon occupied by the Austrians;
                    but as Massena still lived in the expectation of supplies from France, he
                    obstinately refused to surrender the city. General Melas having nothing to
                    apprehend from the army shut up in Genoa, left General Ott to ∞ntinue the
                    blockade, and with the remainder of his forces marched against Suchet, who
                    commanded another division of the French army. On the 7th of May a battle was
                    fought, between Ceva and St Lorenzo, in which the republicans were defeated with
                    the loss of twelve hundred prisoners and ten pieces of cannon. The consequences
                    of this defeat, which in the circumstances was perhaps inevitable, proved
                    eminently disastrous to the French. Suchet was obliged to abandon his strong
                    position on the Col di Tende, where he left behind him four pieces of cannon and
                    two hundred prisoners; and though he disputed every defensible point on his
                    retreat, the Austrians drove him from one post to another, till he was finally
                    obliged to take refuge behind the Var; by which means General Melas became
                    master of the whole department of the Maritime Alps.</p>
                <p>But the campaign on the Rhine did not open in so favourable a manner for the
                    Austrians as that of Italy. The court of Vienna directed the Archduke Charles to
                    resign the command of the army to General Kray, who had eminently distinguished
                    himself during the Italian campaign of 1799. Of his military talents there could
                    be only one opinion, and his integrity and zeal had been sufficiently tried; but
                    he had the misfortune not to be noble, and in the Austrian dominions the want of
                    high birth cannot be compensated by the possession of great talents. It could
                    scarcely be expected, therefore, that a divided army, commanded by an officer
                    without birth, though possessed of ability, would make head against the united
                    veterans of France, led on by a general under whom they hail been accustomed to
                    conquer; and, in fact, the Hungarian troops, finding themselves ready to be
                    sacrificed to the dissensions of their officers, refused to fight against the
                    enemy. At the opening of the campaign, the council of war at Vienna had sent
                    General Kray instructions how to dispose of his forces; and having no general
                    under him to support his views, he was under the necessity of obeying his
                    instructions whether he approved of them or not. Instructions of a similar
                    nature had been transmitted to Moreau by the chief consul, but he refused to
                    fight under restraint. Conscious that in knowledge of the military art he was
                    not inferior to Bonaparte himself, whilst he possessed the advantage of being
                    infinitely better acquainted with the country, he sent a courier to Paris to
                    inform the first consul, that if the orders sent him were to be rigidly obeyed,
                    he should feel it his duty to resign his command, and accept of an inferior
                    station. He accompanied his resignation with a plan of the campaign which he had
                    framed for himself; and as the propriety of his suggestions forcibly struck the
                    mind of the first consul, he was ordered to act according to his own
                    judgment.</p>
                <p>Being thus judiciously left to adopt and execute his own measures, General Moreau
                    crossed the Rhine, and drove the Austrians from one post to another, till
                    General Kray, finding it impracticable to adopt offensive measures with a
                    mutinous army and disaffected officers, resolved to maintain his position at
                    Ulm, and wait for reinforcements from Vienna. He had been defeated at Stockach,
                    at Engen, and at Möskirch, although on almost every occasion he gave proofs of
                    ability and determination; but no talents, however great, can counteract the
                    pernicious effects of treachery and disaffection, to say nothing of an absurd
                    and impracticable plan of operations. At one time, indeed, seven thousand men,
                    when ordered to advance, instantly threw down their arms. Convinced that it was
                    absolutely vain to attempt any offensive operation, Kray intrenched himself
                    strongly at Ulm, which, as it commands both sides of the Danube, is consequently
                    a place of great importance. But Moreau, perceiving his intentions, resolved to
                    attempt the passage of the Danube, and force Kray to a general engagement, by
                    cutting him off from his magazines at Donawert; and with this view he ordered
                    Lecourbe, with one of the wings of his army, to take possession of a bridge
                    between Donawert and Dilíingen. This was not effected without difficulty and
                    loss; but it fully disclosed the intentions of the French general. The
                    Austrians, in fact, perceived their danger in all its magnitude, and accordingly
                    disputed every inch of ground with the enemy. Kray sent reinforcements to the
                    left bank to oppose the passage, and a battle in conseouence ensued at Hochstet,
                    in the vicinity of Blenheim, where victory again declared for the French, who
                    made four thousand prisoners. Sensible that his situation had now become
                    perilous in the extreme, Kray left a strong garrison at Ulm, and marched against
                    the enemy, whom he attacked at Neuburg. The troops on both sides fought with
                    determined bravery; but, after a severe contest, the Austrians were obliged to
                    fall back on Ingolstadt. This battle may be said to nave decided the fate of
                    Germany. The electorate of Bavaria was now in the possession of the French,
                    besides other territories of less extent; and as they approached the hereditary
                    dominions of the emperor, republican sentiments were loudly expressed, whilst
                    the people in many parts evinced such a leaning towards the enemy, as to
                    convince the court that no dependence could be placed on armies composed of such
                    persons. The imperial family, and the British ambassador, were openly insulted
                    in the theatre, and the cry of “Peace, peace,” resounded from every part of the
                    house.</p>
                <p>“A new dynasty must be baptized in blood.” This was the careless remark of a
                    rhetorician, but Napoleon deeply felt its truth. His authority, which wanted the
                    sanction of time, required the support of victory. It was necessary for his own
                    sake, as well as for that of the country which had placed its destinies in his
                    hands, that he should strike a blow which would at once humble the enemy, and
                    impress the world with an idea of his irresistible power. With this view, he had
                    caused to be assembled at Dijon, and organized by Berthier, an army of reserve
                    (as it was called), which was thought to have no other destination than that of
                    defending die course of the Rhine, but which was in reality intended to perform
                    a conspicuous part on an independent theatre of action. The object of Napoleon
                    was to reconquer <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515501"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-5501-0118"/>Italy, which, with the exception of Genoa, where
                    Massena still held out, the Austrians now occupied to the foot of the Alps. And
                    every thing seemed to favour the project which had been so boldly conceived. His
                    preparations had been so skilfully masked, that when the government
                    ostentatiously announced the real strength of the army of reserve, the statement
                    was universally discredited; and Melas, who commanded the imperial forces in
                    Italy, so little dreamed of being called upon to contend for the possession of
                    that country with the most fortunate and enterprising general of his time, that
                    his whole attention was directed towards the pursuit of Suchet, who was now
                    retreating over the Alps of Savoy. In his head-quarters at Alessandria, he never
                    suspected that he would have to oppose an invading force descending into Italy
                    by the pass of the Great St Bernard. The real views of Bonaparte were too bold
                    to enter into the conception of the Austrian general. These were, to traverse
                    Switzerland by the lake of Geneva and the valley of the Rhone as far as
                    Martigny, and thence to cross the Great St Bernard, and descend into the plains
                    of Lombardy in rear of Melas; in other words, to intersect the communications of
                    the Austrian general, disarrange all his plans, oblige him to countermarch and
                    take up new positions, and, lastly, impose on him the necessity of receiving
                    battle in a situation where defeat would be total ruin. He expected to reap the
                    benefit of a complete surprise, and at all events to take the enemy <hi
                    rend="italic">in flagranti delicto.</hi></p>
                <p>On the 6th of May the first consul left Paris, and proceeded to take the command
                    of an army the strength and <hi rend="superscript"> f</hi> destination of which
                    had given rise to so many conjectures. This army, which had been reinforced from
                    the Rhine, and amounted to about forty thousand men, immediately began its march
                    into Switzerland, and on the 20th crossed the Great St Bernard. The passage of
                    this mountain is justly accounted one of the most extraordinary achievements in
                    modern warfare, and is not inferior in any of its circumstances to the
                    celebrated passage of the Alps by Hannibal. The French army now advanced by a
                    path which had hitherto been considered as practicable only for mules and foot
                    passengers; they removed their cannon from the carriages, placed the guns in the
                    hollowed trunks of trees, and thus dragged them up the steep ascent. In May
                    winter still reigns with unmitigated severity in these regions; and the rigours
                    of a northern climate, snow, ice, and whirlwinds, increased the dangers of the
                    march; but all difficulties were overcome by the enthusiasm and perseverance of
                    the troops. On reaching the summit, refreshments awaited them at the convent, to
                    the monks of which large sums had been transmitted for the purpose; and in that
                    cloud-capped habitation of peace, the soldiers as they passed received a cordial
                    welcome, and enjoyed some needful rest. The division which crossed the Simplon
                    encountered still greater difficulties than that which passed the Great St
                    Bernard, having to clear deep fissures in Indian file, and sometimes clinging to
                    a single rope. In descending from Mount St Bernard into the valley of Aoste, the
                    road passes under the fort of Bard, by which it is completely commanded. Here,
                    then, was a lion in the path. The troops might avoid it by clambering over the
                    adjoining precipices, but for the artillery this was impossible. The fort was
                    summoned and cannonaded, but in vain; the governor disregarded the menaces of
                    the invaders, and his little citadel was secure against a <hi rend="italic"
                    >cvup-demain.</hi> What was to be done? The case seemed desperate, but ingenuity
                    at length triumphed. The street of the village immediately below was covered
                    with straw and small branches, and the cannon were dragged past during a dark
                    night without attracting the attention of the garrison. Had the fort opened its
                    fire, and delayed the array longer, all the advantages of this bold march would
                    have been lost. But fortune still remained true to her favourite; and Bonaparte,
                    having cleared an obstacle which at first appeared insuperable, followed the
                    course of the Doria and the Po, entered Milan and Pavia, and thus accomplished
                    his first object, namely, that of placing himself on the communications of
                    Melas.</p>
                <p>The Austrian general had already retrograded; he could not credit the report of
                    Bonaparte being in Italy, but still he had taken the precaution to fall back.
                    What above all astonished him, was to hear that the French had cannon; how had
                    they passed the Alps? Bonaparte arrived at Milan on the 2d of June, and there
                    expected Moncey to join him with reinforcements from the army of Switzerland. In
                    the mean time he dispatched his lieutenants to seize the towns on the Po: which
                    was promptly effected. In occupying Piacenza, Murat intercepted a courier on his
                    way to the Austrian head-quarters, with tidings of the fall of Genoa. This
                    event, which disengaged and rendered disposable a large Austrian force, left
                    Napoleon no alternative but either to fall back and wait for his expected
                    reinforcements, or to march against Melas, and put all to the hazard of a
                    battle. He chose the latter course, and trusting that his own genius and fortune
                    would compensate for his deficiency in effective force, resolved to anticipate
                    the enemy. Melas had concentrated his whole force at Alessandria, on the
                    Bormida; and General Ott, having reduced Genoa, was rapidly advancing, with the
                    intention of surprising the French advanced posts on the Po, and at the same
                    time combining his operations with those of the principal army in a grand effort
                    against the enemy. But Ott was himself surprised by Lannes at Montebello, and
                    after a severe action completely defeated with the loss of five thousand men.
                    The French army now advanced to Stradella, where it took up an advantageous
                    position, and remained several days to allow Suchet to close upon the enemy’s
                    rear, and Massena, with the liberated garrison of Genoa, to join from the south.
                    The Austrians in the mean while made no movement; and Napoleon, apprehensive
                    that Melas might escape him, either by marching north towards Turin or south
                    towards Genoa, advanced into the plains of Marengo; thus giving a prodigious
                    advantage to the enemy. But although Melas was greatly superior in cavalry, and
                    might at his option either attack the French, or defend the course of the
                    Bormida, behind which his army was concentrated, Bonaparte was still so
                    apprehensive that he might file off towards Genoa, that he detached Dessaix, who
                    had just arrived from Egypt and taken the command of a division, to counteract
                    any movement in retreat, and to compel the Austrians to receive battle. But this
                    measure, which in its consequences had nearly proved fatal to the French army,
                    proceeded on a total miscalculation; for at the very moment when Napoleon was
                    thinking of preventing the flight of Melas, it was decided in a council of war
                    that the only mode of securing Genoa was to give battle to the French.</p>
                <p>On the morning of the 14th, which Melas had fixed on for the attack, the French
                    were echelloned in an oblique formation, extending from Marengo, the village
                    next the Bormida, which was occupied by their advanced guard, to San Giuliano,
                    where the head-quarters were established, with considerable intervals between
                    the divisions. The Austrians passed the Bormida in three columns, by as many
                    bridges, which they had thrown across the river. One cause of the want of
                    preparation on the part of Napoleon, was the assurance he had received that the
                    principal bridge had been broken down; and this was perfectly true; but the
                    Austrians had not lost a moment in re-establishing the bridge, and thus
                    restoring their communications with the opposite bank of the stream. The first
                    burst of the attack was directed against the French at Marengo. But instead of
                    advancing boldly to the charge, and storming the key of the position, the
                    imperialists deployed, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515514"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-5514-0119"/>planted batterie», and waited to effect tardily by
                    their fire wbat an assault might have at once accomplished. This afforded the
                    French time, which they so much wanted, and enabled Napoleon to recall Dessaix.
                    The right and left of the Austrians had scarcely an enemy to contend with; for
                    being composed chiefly of cavalry, in which arm the Austrian army was eminently
                    powerful, they swept every thing before them; and at length, turning towards the
                    centre, drove the enemy from the village of Marengo, across a swampy rivulet in
                    the rear. At mid-day, the plain presented an extraordinary spectacle. The French
                    in disordered masses were in half retreat, yet still maintaining a vigorous
                    resistance; whole columns of wounded and stragglers were pressing towards the
                    rear, and throwing into confusion the ranks which still held firm; the Austrian
                    cavalry domineered in the plain, and threatened at every moment to break in
                    among the disordered troops; the fate of the day seemed already decided. Seeing
                    himself victorious at Marengo, General Melas retired to Alessandria to write his
                    dispatches, leaving the chief of his staff, Baron Zach, to complete the victory.
                    He had already withdrawn from the field a considerable body of cavalry, which he
                    deemed it necessary to send against Suchet; a fatal error, which he had soon
                    reason to repent. But whilst Melas thus indulged in the security of an assured
                    triumph, Bonaparte was preparing to make a stand at San Giuliano, and to avenge
                    the defeat of the morning by fighting a fresh battle in the evening. Dessaix had
                    now joined, and highly applauded the resolution of the general-in-chief. The
                    artillery was at the same time placed in battery upon an eminence commanding the
                    high road, along which the Austrians shortly afterwards advanced in column. But
                    success had rendered them as imprudently confident in the evening as the French
                    were in the morning, and they came on less to dispute the victory than to gather
                    up the fruits of one which had been already gained. Bonaparte now rode leisurely
                    along his newly-formed line. “Soldiers,” said he, “we have retreated enough for
                    to-day; you know it is my custom to sleep on the field of battle.” When the
                    imperialists led on by Zach approached San Giuliano, the battery, unmasked,
                    opened its fire; Dessaix led on his fresh division of infantry to the attack;
                    Kellerman, with a brigade of light horse, watching the favourable moment,
                    charged and broke through the advancing column, then wheeling round, charged
                    back and again penetrated it. Thus surprised and enveloped, the bead of the
                    column laid down its arms, and the remainder scarcely attempted to make a stand;
                    being speedily routed and put to flight, it communicated its panic to the troops
                    in the rear, which, had they come up with suitable determination, might have
                    repeated at San Giuliano the success of Marengo. All was now lost. The
                    imperialists fled across the plain of Marengo towards the bridges, pursued by
                    the French, who slaughtered the fugitives in all directions. The carnage was
                    dreadful, and continued until nightfall, when the victors, weary of slaying and
                    oppressed by fatigue, slowly withdrew. Thus the battle of Marengo, which a
                    vigorous charge of cavalry would for ever have decided, was restored and gained
                    by six o’clock in the evening. Dessaix fell early in the second battle, to which
                    the brilliant charge so opportunely executed by young Kellerman gave the
                    decisive turn.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    partisans of Napoleon assert that the order for thia charge issued from him. But
                    Kellerman, supported by almost all the officers who were present, claimed it as
                    his own spontaneous act; and a strong feeling of resentment was excited in his
                    mind by the omission of all notice of this achievement in the official account
                    of the battle. The service thus rendered was perhaps too great to be
                    acknowledged. “That charge of yours was opportune," observed Napoleon, after the
                    battle, in a tone of lukewaiaι praise. " Opportune indeed,” replied Kellerman;
                    “it has placed the crown on τour head.”</p></note></p>
                <p>Italy was thus conquered at Marengo; and France by one battle regained her
                    superiority in the field. An armistice was now agreed to, the terms of which
                    were, that</p>
                <p>Piedmont and Genoa were to be given up to the French, and that the Austrians
                    should retire behind the Mincio; thus abandoning at once all the conquests of
                    Suwarof. The convention with Melas was considered as preparatory to a treaty;
                    and, in fact, Bonaparte offered to Austria the terms of Campo Formio; but the
                    cabinet of Vienna, more resolute in adversity than in prosperity, pleaded her
                    engagements with Britain, as precluding her from treating excepting in
                    conjunction with that power, her ally. Hohenlinden was destined to add its
                    glories to that of Marengo, before peace could be conquered.</p>
                <p>General Kray was anxious to avail himself of the armistice concluded in Italy in
                    order to arrest the progress of Moreau; butthat able general refused to listen
                    to any overtures upon the subject, until he should have received instructions
                    from Paris. Count St Julien, however, arrived with proposals of peace from the
                    imperial cabinet, in consequence of which the armistice was extended to Germany;
                    and the posts then occupied by the respective armies were considered as
                    constituting the line of demarcation. But, in opposition to the spirit of the
                    stipulations with General Melas, the French reinforced their army in Italy,
                    levied immense contributions, and raised troops in different states which they
                    themselves had declared independent</p>
                <p>Whilst France was thus victorious in Europe, her troops in Egypt were subjected
                    to the greatest hardships. The circumstance of their being abandoned by their
                    chief gave rise to bitter complaints; and Kleber is said to have declared that
                    the same universe should not contain him and Bonaparte. Under the auspices of
                    the latter, a convention for the evacuation of Egypt by the French was concluded
                    at El Arisch on the 24th of January 1800, between the Grand Vizier on the part
                    of Turkey, and Sir Sidney Smith on that of Great Britain. By virtue of this
                    convention, the republican army, with its baggage and effects, were to be
                    coliected at Alexandria, Rosetta, and Aboukir, and to be conveyed to France in
                    vessels belonging the Republic, or such as might be furnished for that purpose
                    by the Sublime Porte.</p>
                <p>Towards the close of the year 1799 the British ministry had reason to believe
                    that an arrangement would be entered into between the Grand Vizier and General
                    Kléber for the evacuation of Egypt by the French; and as such an event was much
                    to be desired, Lord Keith received orders to accede to it, but only on condition
                    that Kléber and his army should be detained as prisoners of war. The convention
                    of El Arisch accordingly fell to the ground; and, but for the honourable conduct
                    of Sir Sidney Smith, Kleber would have been treacherously attacked by the Grand
                    Vizier whilst resting upon his arms, in reliance that the treaty would be
                    ratified. But the Turks paid dear for their meditated perfidy. On the 20th of
                    March, Kléber attacked and totally routed them at Heliopolis, near Cairo, with
                    the loss of more than eight thousand men killed and wounded on the field of
                    battle. This victory restored to the French Cairo, which in terms of the
                    convention of El Arisch they had abandoned. Kleber again proposed to evacuate
                    Egypt, upon the terms agreed to by the Grand Vizier and Sir Sidney Smith; and
                    Lord Keith being now empowered to agree to them, a suspension of hostilities
                    took place, and the Turks were about to be delivered from an enemy whom they
                    were not able to expel, when General Kléber was suddenly assassinated. Both
                    parties had reason to regret this event, as Kléber was not only one ol <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193515527" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5527-0120"/>the most able, but
                    also one of the most upright and honourable men ever intrusted with the command
                    of an army.</p>
                <p>Menou succeeded Kleber in the command of the French army in Egypt, but refused to
                    quit that country by capitulation; in consequence of which the British
                    government formed the resolution of expelling him by force. Sir James Pulteney
                    had received the command of twelve thousand men in the Mediterranean, with
                    orders to act in such a manner as might most effectually annoy the enemy; but as
                    this plan had been disconcerted by the result of the battle of Marengo, he was
                    superseded by Sir Ralph Abercromby, who carried out with him reinforcements,
                    together with a train of artillery from Gibraltar. Having touched at Minorca and
                    Malta, Sir Ralph steered his course thence for the coast of Egypt, which he
                    reached on the first of March 1801, and next day anchored in the Bay of Aboukir.
                    But the weather prevented him from attempting to land till the 8th, when the
                    first division effected a landing in the face of the French, to the amount of
                    four thousand men, and the disembarkation was continued during that and the
                    following day. The army moved forward on the 12th, and coming in sight of the
                    enemy, gave them battle on the 13th. The conflict was obstinate on both sides,
                    and the loss very considerable; but victory in the end declared for the British.
                    This advantage was followed up with vigour, and on the 21st a more decisive
                    battle was fought about four miles from Alexandria, where, after various turns
                    of fortune, the British were finally victorious. In the heat of the action,
                    General Abercromby received a mortal wound, and died on the 28th. The loss on
                    both sides was severe.</p>
                <p>As the fate of Egypt was in a great measure decided by these two battles, we
                    shall now advert to affairs of great importance which about this time took place
                    in Europe. The northern powers, jealous of the maritime superiority of Britain,
                    and acting under the influence of the Emperor Paul, resolved to revive the armed
                    neutrality of Catharine II. established during the American war, and to claim
                    the right of trading to the ports of France without being subjected to what they
                    conceived the intolerable evil of having their vessels searched. The ministry of
                    Great Britain had determined to break up this confederacy; but, to the
                    astonishment of the nation, which was not prepared for such an occurrence, they
                    suddenly resigned.</p>
                <p>Various causes have been assigned for an event so un- ' expected; but the
                    ostensible reason was a difference in the cabinet relative to Catholic
                    emancipation. After the union of Ireland with Britain, the minister appears to
                    have proposed this subject in the cabinet; but his majesty, from some
                    conscientious scruples founded on his coronation oath, gave it his direct
                    negative, and in consequence Mr Pitt and his friends tendered their resignation.
                    They were succeeded by men, however, who had generally supported Mr Pitt’s
                    administration during the war, and who were entirely of the same school in
                    politics. Mr Addington was appointed first lord of the treasury and chancellor
                    of the exchequer; Lord Eldon, lord high chancellor; the Earl of St Vincent,
                    first lord of the admiralty; Lords Hawkesbury and Pelham, secretaries of state;
                    and the Honourable Colonel Yorke, secretary at war. The former ministry was
                    dissolved on the 11th of February; but owing to the indisposition of the king,
                    the new ministry did not enter upon office until the middle of March, during
                    which interval Mr Pitt and his associates had the chief management of public
                    affairs. The new ministry commenced their career by solemnly pledging themselves
                    to the nation that they would employ their united efforts in procuring a safe
                    and honourable peace with France, which in fact was loudly demanded by the
                    nation.</p>
                <p>About this time measures the most hostile were adopted ’ towards Britain, by the
                    powers composing the northern confederacy. The city of Hamburg was taken by a
                    Danish ' force under the Prince of Hesse; and the king of Prussia likewise sent
                    a numerous army into the electorate of Hanover, all with the view of injuring
                    British commerce. To punish this audacious conduct, and dissolve the northern
                    confederacy, a fleet of seventeen sail of the line, four frigates, four sloops,
                    and some bomb vessels, was fitted out in the ports of Britain, and sailed from
                    Yarmouth on the 12th of March, under the command of Admiral Sir Hyde Parker,
                    Lord Nelson, and Rear-admiral Graves; and having passed the Sound, appeared
                    before Copenhagen on the 30th of the same month. The Danes did not appear in the
                    smallest degree moved by this display of force, thinking it impossible to molest
                    either their fleet or their city without passing through a channel so extremely
                    intricate that it was once believed hardly safe to attempt it even with a single
                    ship unopposed by an enemy. But this channel was sounded by Lord Nelson, who
                    undertook to conduct through it a large division of the fleet; and having
                    requested from Sir Hyde Parker the command of the squadron, it was accordingly
                    given him, and Rear-admiral Graves was appointed his second in command. As the
                    largest ships drew too much water for being employed in so hazardous an attempt,
                    his lordship selected twelve of from seventy-four to fifty guns, together with
                    four frigates, four sloops, two fire-ships, and seven bombs. To this a
                    prodigious force was opposed, consisting of six sail of the line, eleven
                    floating batteries, each mounting from eighteen to twenty-eight heavy guns, one
                    bomb-ship, and a number of schooners; and these were supported by the Crown
                    Batteries, mounting eighty-eight pieces of cannon, by four sail of the line,
                    moored in the mouth of the harbour, and by a few batteries on the island of
                    Amak. On the 2d of April, Lord Nelson attacked this tremendous force, and after
                    an obstinate and bloody action, which lasted four hours, silenced the fire of
                    the batteries, taking, burning, and sinking about seventeen sail, including
                    seven ships of the line. A suspension of hostilities was the immediate
                    consequence of this brilliant victory, and the armed neutrality was in fact
                    dissolved.</p>
                <p>When the armistice was signed between die Austrian I and French generals in the
                    year 1800, the troops of the lat- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ter were in
                    possession of Germany almost to the banks of <hi rend="superscript"> d</hi> the
                    Inn, and of Italy to the frontiers of Venice; but the spirit of the emperor was
                    yet unsubdued, and he declined abandoning his allies by ratifying the
                    preliminaries of peace which Count St Julien had agreed to at Paris, more
                    especially as the latter was alleged to have exceeded his powers. Kray having
                    retired from the army, the Archduke John succeeded him in the command, and with
                    the emperor in person repaired to the army; but they soon found it impracticable
                    to undertake any offensive operation against Moreau, and therefore another
                    armistice, comprehending Italy, was agreed to. The emperor wished to include
                    Britain in any treaty which might be entered into with France; but as Bonaparte
                    refused to admit any plenipotentiary from that power until a naval armistice had
                    been agreed to, Moreau received orders to resume his military operations. The
                    command of the Austrian divisions was now given to generals whose very names
                    were unknown beyond the confines of their own country, and who had shown
                    themselves but little acquainted with the military art. Moreau was on the banks
                    of the Iser, with his troops considerably disseminated; the Austrians were on
                    those of the Inn, occupying a good line of defence if they had understood its
                    importance, or had the prudence to maintain it. But whilst the French
                    general-in-chief was meditating the plan of his winter campaign, the right wing
                    of his army was attacked add driven back by the Austrians; and had they known
                    how to make a judicious use of their advantage, the French commander would in
                    all probability have been reduced to act on the defensive. Elated with success,
                    however, they unaccountably abandoned their position on the Inn, and marched to
                    attack the French along wretched <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515540"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-5540-0121"/>made, rendered nearly impassable by November
                    weather. Moreau was with his army at Hohenlinden, behind the forest of
                    Ebersberg, where he awaited the approach of the enemy. The archduke ordered his
                    army to advance in separate columns by the roads and paths leading through the
                    forest, on the exterior edge of which he intended to deploy and give battle. His
                    centre, under Kollowrath, took the principal road, but was encountered as it
                    debouched from the forest by the divisions of Ney and Grouchy; whilst another
                    division of the French under Itichepanse turned the flank of the Austrians, and
                    fell with great fury upon its rear at the other side of the forest. This double
                    attack was attended with complete success. The centre was entirely routed, with
                    the loss of no less than eight thousand prisoners, besides killed and wounded;
                    and the defeat of the rest of the army followed as an inevitable consequence.
                    Had the Archduke Charles commanded on this occasion, a defeat caused by such a
                    blunder would have been impossible; but this prince was now in disgrace for
                    having counselled peace. At Hohenlinden the Austrians lost in all eighty pieces
                    of cannon, two hundred caissons, and ten thousand prisoners.</p>
                <p>Moreau allowed the enemy no time to rally, but marching directly towards the Inn,
                    crossed that river on the 9th of December, drove the enemy before him, and
                    struck the court of Vienna with consternation and dismay. Prince Charles was
                    recalled and invested with the command of the army; but after many fruitless
                    efforts to retrieve its honour, he on the 27th of December proposed an
                    armistice, which was acceded to by the French commander, upon condition that it
                    should be immediately followed by a definitive treaty. If the archduke could
                    have placed any dependence upon his army, this armistice would not in all
                    probability have taken place. The position of Moreau was, in fact, perilous in
                    the extreme. Having advanced into the very heart of the Austrian states, he had
                    behind him on his right about thirty thousand men in the Tyrol, and upwards of
                    fifty thousand on his left. But Austrian valour was now well nigh extinguished
                    by so many reverses of fortune; the officers were discontented; and the army was
                    not in a condition to make head for a single day against so able and
                    enterprising an enemy. Accordingly, the armistice was followed by a treaty of
                    peace, which was signed at Luneville on the 9th of February 1801, between the
                    emperor for himself and the Germanic body on the one hand, and the first consul
                    of the French Republic, in name of the people of France, on the other. By this
                    treaty the emperor ceded the Brisgau to the Duke of Modena, in lieu of the
                    territories lost by that prince in Italy, and bound himself to find indemnities
                    in the Germanic empire to all those princes whom the fate of war had deprived of
                    their dominions. The Grand Duke of Tuscany renounced his dukedom, with its
                    dependencies in the isle of Elba, in favour of the Duke of Parma, who assumed
                    the title of king of Etruria; and for this the empire was to provide him with an
                    adequate indemnification. Italy resumed its republican forms and divisions of
                    governments under French influence and protection; and the Rhine still continued
                    the boundary of France on the side of Germany. On the 28th of March, peace was
                    also concluded between the French Republic and the king of the Two Sicilies. By
                    this treaty his majesty obliged himself to shut the ports of Naples and Sicily
                    against ships of every description belonging either to the British or the Turks;
                    and he renounced for ever Porto Longano in the island of Elba, his states in
                    Tuscany, and the principality of Piombino, to be disposed of in such manner as
                    the French Republic might think proper.</p>
                <p>Great Britain had now no ally left to aid her in the contest with France,
                    excepting the Turks in Egypt and the Portuguese in Europe, powers which rather
                    diminished than increased her strength. At the desire of France the Spaniards
                    had made an attack upon Portugal, and conquered some of its provinces; but a
                    treaty of peace was concluded on the 6th of June, by which the king of Spain
                    restored all his conquests excepting the fortress of Olivenza; and the prince
                    regent of Portugal and the Algarves promised to shut the ports of his
                    territories against the ships of Great Britain, and to make indemnification to
                    his Catholic majesty for all losses and damages sustained by his subjects during
                    the war. When the first consul had made peace with all his other enemies, he
                    threatened Great Britain with an immediate invasion; a circumstance which at
                    first gave great uneasiness to a considerable part of the nation. But in order
                    to assuage this alarm, Lord Nelson was sent to destroy the shipping in the
                    harbour of Boulogne; and though his success fell short of what had been expected
                    by many, he nevertheless made such an impression on the enemy as showed that
                    Britain could annoy the coast of France with greater facility than France could
                    molest that of Britain.</p>
                <p>During the summer of 1801, attempts were again made by Britain to negotiate with
                    France. From the total dissolution of the northern confederacy, the first consul
                    could not fail to perceive that it was impossible for him to ruin British
                    commerce, and consequently that all the treaties which he might make for
                    excluding our ships from neutral ports would signify nothing. He seemed
                    determined, however, to keep possession of Egypt; and Britain, on the other
                    hand, was as fully resolved to wrest it from him. On this account the
                    negotiations were protracted till the conquest of that country became known both
                    at London and Paris. On the death of Rir Ralph Abercromby, General Hutchinson
                    succeeded to the command of the British forces in Egypt, and as he was
                    acquainted with the designs of his predecessor, one spirit seemed to actuate
                    both. Rosetta surrendered, and this was soon followed by the capitulation of
                    Cairo; and Menou having accepted of similar terms for Alexandria, the whole of
                    Egypt fell into the hands of the allies, and the republican troops with their
                    baggage were conveyed to the nearest French ports in the Mediterranean, in ships
                    furnished by the allies. After these events, the negotiations between Britain
                    and France proceeded more agreeably; and, on the 1st of October, the preliminary
                    treaty was signed at London by Lord Hawkesbury on the part of his Britannic
                    majesty, and by Μ. Otto on that of the French Republic. By this treaty Great
                    Britain engaged to give up all the conquests made by her during the continuance
                    of the war, excepting the islands of Ceylon and Trinidad, whilst France was in
                    fact to restore nothing. The Cape of Good Hope was to be free to all the
                    contracting parties; the island of Malta was to be given up to the knights of
                    the order of St John of Jerusalem; Egypt was to be restored to the Ottoman
                    Porte; Portugal was to be maintained in its integrity, excepting what had been
                    ceded to the king of Spain by the prince regent; Naples and the Roman States
                    were to be evacuated by the French, and Porto Ferrajo by the British, together
                    with all the ports and islands occupied by them in the Mediterranean.
                    Plenij&gt;o-tentiaries were also appointed to meet at Amiens, for the purpose of
                    drawing up and concluding a definitive treaty. This accordingly took place on
                    the 22d of March 1802, and the French Republic was thus acknowledged by the
                    whole of Europe.</p>
                <p>Having thus arrived at the period when the dogs of war were during a brief
                    interval chained up, and the nations of Europe allowed to respire a little after
                    the fierce contest' in which they had been engaged, it may not be uninstructive
                    or uninteresting to pause for a moment and pass in review that extraordinary
                    series of revolutions in France which overthrew the monarchy to make way for the
                    Republic, and in turn destroyed the Republic to make way for the Consulate and
                    the Empire.</p>
                <p>Popular insurrections, and an army, have hitherto been <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193515553" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5553-0122"/>the usual means, or chief
                    instruments, of every revolution ∙, but insurrections of this description have
                    generally been fomented by a certain number of factious men, devoted to and
                    dependent upon some ambitious chief, daring, brave, possessed of military
                    talents, the absolute conductor of every step of the revolt, and the master of
                    all the means of the insurrection. In the hands of such a chief, the soldiers,
                    or people armed, are mere machines, set in motion or restrained according to his
                    pleasure, and are always employed to put an end to revolutionary disorders and
                    crimes, as soon as the object of the revolution has been attained. Thus Caesar
                    and Cromwell, after they had usurped the supreme power, lost no time in securing
                    it, by placing it upon the basis of a wise and well-regulated government; and
                    they employed in quelling the troubles which had favoured their usurpation,
                    those very legions which they had used to excite them.</p>
                <p>But this was not the case in France. In that country the revolution, or rather
                    the first of those revolutions it experienced, and of which the others were the
                    inevitable consequence, does not seem to have been the result of a conspiracy or
                    preconcerted plan to overturn the monarchy and to establish a republic in its
                    place. It was unexpectedly engendered by a mixture of weakness, ignorance,
                    negligence, and numberless errors in the government. The States General, however
                    imprudent their convocation may have been, would have produced only useful
                    reforms, if they had found the limits of their power marked out by a hand
                    sufficiently firm to keep them within their natural boundaries. It was but too
                    evident, however, that even before their opening they were dreaded, and that
                    consequently they might attempt almost any thing they pleased. From that time,
                    under the name of Clubs, various associations and factions sprang up; some more
                    violent than others, but all tending to the subversion of the existing
                    government, without agreeing upon the form of that which was to be substituted
                    in its stead: and at this period also the projects of the faction whose views
                    were to get the Duke of Orleans appointed lieutenant-general of the kingdom
                    began to manifest themselves.</p>
                <p>This faction, or, as some call it, this conspiracy, was, in truth, of the same
                    nature with those which had produced all former revolutions, and might have been
                    attended with the same consequences had the Duke of Orleans been possessed of
                    the energy and courage requisite in the leader of a party. The people had
                    already declared in his favour, and he might easily have corrupted and brought
                    over a great part of the army had he been equal to the command of it; but, on
                    the very first occasion of personal risk, he discovered such cowardice and
                    meanness that he defeated his own conspiracy, and convinced all those who had
                    entered into it that it was impossible to continue the Revolution, either in his
                    favour or in conjunction with him. The enthusiasm which the people had felt for
                    him ended with the efforts of those who had excited it.</p>
                <p>Neckar, whom the multitude had associated with this prince in their homage, still
                    preserved for some time his worshippers, and that little cabal was for ever
                    exalting him to the skies. But inferior even to Orleans in the talents and
                    dispositions necessary to influence the army in his favour, he was as little
                    calculated to be the leader of a revolution; and for this reason his panegyrists
                    confined themselves, in the pamphlets and placards with which they inundated the
                    capital, to insinuating that the only means of saving the state was to declare
                    Neckar dictator, or at least to confer upon him, under some title more
                    consistent with the monarchy, the authority and powers attached to that
                    republican office. In fact, if after his dismission in the month of July 1789,
                    he had dared to make this a condition of his return to the ministry, it is more
                    than probable that the king would have been under the necessity of agree ing to
                    it, and perhaps of re-establishing in his person the office of mayor of the
                    palace. At that moment he might have demanded any thing; eight days later he
                    might have been refused every thing; and soon afterwards he was reduced to the
                    humiliating necessity of sneaking out of the kingdom like an outlaw, to escape
                    the effects ol the general contempt and censure which he had brought upon
                    himself.</p>
                <p>General Lafayette, who then commanded the Parisian national guard, gathered the
                    wrecks of all this popularity, and might have turned them to the greatest
                    advantage, if he had possessed that resolute character and heroic judgment of
                    which Cardinal de Retz speaks, and which serves to distinguish what is truly
                    honourable and useful from that which is only extraordinary, and what is
                    extraordinary from that which is impossible. With the genius, the talents, and
                    the ambition of Cromwell, he might have gone as great a length; with a less
                    crimina· ambition, he might at least have made himself master of the Revolution,
                    and directed it at his pleasure; in a word, he might have secured the triumph of
                    whatever party he chose to declare himself the leader. But, as unfit for
                    supporting the character of Monk as that of Cromwell, he soon betrayed the
                    secret of his incapacity to all the world, and was distinguished amongst the
                    crowd of constitutional leaders only by his tri-coloured plume, his epaulettes,
                    his white horse, and his saying that insurrection is the most sacred of duties
                    when oppression is at its height.</p>
                <p>The Revolution, at the period when the faction which had begun it for the Duke of
                    Orleans became sensible that he was too much a coward to become a leader, and
                    when Lafayette discovered his inability to conduct it, was too far advanced
                    either to recede or to stop; and hence it continued its progress, but in a line
                    which no other revolution had ever taken, namely, without a military chief, or
                    the intervention of the army; and it gained triumphs, not for any ambitious
                    conspirator, but for political and moral innovations of the most extraordinary
                    kind, innovations the most suited to mislead the multitude, who were incapable
                    of comprehending them, and to let loose those passions which are most dangerous
                    to the repose and happiness of nations. The more violent combined to destroy
                    every thing; and their fatal coalition gave birth to Jacobinism, a revolutionary
                    product till then unknown, and till now not sufliciently unmasked. This new
                    creation took upon itself alone to carry on the Revolution; it directed and
                    executed all its operations, all the explosions and the outrages which occurred;
                    it everywhere appointed the most active leaders, and employed as instruments the
                    profligates of every country. Its power far surpassed that which has been
                    attributed to the inquisition, and other similar tribunals, by those who have
                    spoken of them with the greatest exaggeration. Its centre was at Paris; and its
                    ramifications, formed by means of clubs in every town and little borough,
                    overspread the whole surface of the kingdom. The constant correspondence kept up
                    between those clubs and that of the capital, or, to use their own expressions,
                    between the affiliated popular societies and the parent society, was as secret
                    and as speedy as that of free-masons. In a word, the Jacobin clubs had succeeded
                    in causing themselves to be looked up to as the real national representation.
                    Under that assumed character they censured all the authorities in the most
                    imperious manner; and whenever their denunciations, petitions, or addresses
                    failed to produce an immediate effect, they gained their point by having
                    recourse to insurrection and assassination. Whilst Jacobinism thus subjected all
                    France to its control, an immense number of emissaries propagated its doctrines
                    amongst foreign nations, and prepared for it new conquests in distant
                    countries.</p>
                <p>The National Assembly, the capital, indeed all France, was divided into three
                    distinct parties. The most considerable in number, but unhappily, through a
                    deficiency <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515566" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5566-0123"/>of
                    plan and resolution, the weakest, was the party purely royal; it was adverse to
                    every kind of revolution, and was solely desirous of some improvements, with the
                    reform of abuses and pecuniary privileges. The most able and most intriguing was
                    the constitutional party, or that which was desirous of giving France a new
                    monarchical constitution, but modified after the manner of the English, or even
                    the American, by a house of representatives. The third party was the most
                    dangerous of all, by its daring spirit, by its power, and by the number of
                    proselytes it daily acquired in all quarters of the kingdom; it comprehended the
                    democrats of every description, from the Jacobin clubs, calling themselves
                    Friends of the Constitution, to the anarchists and plunderers of the school of
                    Hebert and Chaumette.</p>
                <p>The democratic party, which at first was only auxiliary to the constitutional
                    one, in the end annihilated it, and became itself subdivided into several
                    parties, whose fatal struggles produced all the subsequent revolutions. But in
                    principle the constitutionalists and the democrats formed two distinct though
                    confederate factions; both were desirous of a revolution, and employed all the
                    usual means of accomplishing it, except troops, which could be of no use to
                    them, for neither of them had a leader to put at the head of the army. But as it
                    was of equal importance to both that the king should be deprived of the power of
                    making use of it against them, they laboured in concert to disorganize it; and
                    the complete success of that manoeuvre was but too fully proved by the fatal
                    issue of the departure of the royal family for Montmédy. The revolution then
                    took a more daring and rapid stride, which was concluded by the constitutional
                    act of 1791. But the incoherence of its principles, and the defects of its
                    institutions, present a faithful picture of the disunion of its authors, and of
                    the opposite interests by which they were swayed. It was, properly speaking, a
                    compact or compromise between the party of the constitutionalists and that of
                    the democrats, in which, to secure co-operation, mutual concessions and
                    sacrifices were made. But this absurd constitution, the everlasting source of
                    sorrow and remorse to all who had a part in framing it, might have been got over
                    without a shock, and led back to the old principles of monarchical government,
                    if the assembly who framed it had not separated before they witnessed its
                    execution; if, in imposing on the king the obligation to maintain it, they had
                    not deprived him of the power and the means; and if the certain consequence of
                    the new mode of proceeding at the elections had not been to secure, in the
                    second assembly, a considerable majority of the democratic against the
                    constitutional party.</p>
                <p>The second assembly was likewise divided into three factions, the weakest of
                    which was the one that desired to maintain the constitution. The two others were
                    for a new revolution and a republic; but they differed in this, that the former,
                    composed of the Brissotines or Girondists, was for effecting it gradually, by
                    beginning with divesting the king of popularity, and allowing the public mind
                    time to wean itself from its natural attachment to monarchy; and the latter,
                    which was the least numerous, was eager to have the republic established as
                    speedily as possible. These two factions, having the same object in view, though
                    taking different roads, were necessarily auxiliaries to each other; and the
                    pamphlets, excitations to commotion, and revolutionary measures of both, equally
                    tended to overthrow the constitution of 1791.</p>
                <p>Those different factions, composed of advocates, attorneys, apostate priests,
                    doctors, and a few literary men, having no military chief capable of taking the
                    command of the army, dreaded the troops who had sworn allegiance to the
                    constitution and obedience to the king, and who moreover might be influenced by
                    their officers, amongst whom there still remained some royalists. The surest way
                    to get rid of all uneasiness on the subject, was to employ the army in defending
                    the frontiers. For this purpose a foreign war was necessary, to which it was
                    known that the king and his council were eaually averse. Nothing more was
                    wanting to determine the attack which was directed, almost at the same time,
                    against all the ministers, in order to compel them to retire, and to put the
                    king under the necessity of appointing others more disposed to second the views
                    of the parties. Unhappily this attempt was attended with all the success which
                    its authors had promised themselves; and one of the first acts of the new
                    ministry was to declare war against the emperor. At the same time, the
                    emigration which had been provoked, and which was almost everywhere applauded,
                    even by the lowest class of people, drained off the flower of the royalist
                    party, and left the king, deprived of his best defenders, exposed to the
                    suspicions and insults which sprung from innumerable calumnies, for which the
                    disasters at the beginning of the war furnished but too many opportunities.</p>
                <p>In this manner was prepared and accelerated the new revolution, which was
                    accomplished on the tenth of August 1792, by the deposition and imprisonment of
                    the king, and by the most flagrant violation of the constitution of 1791. The
                    latter, however, was not entirely abandoned on that day; for the project of the
                    Girondists, who had laid the plot of that fatal conspiracy, was then only to
                    declare the king’s deposition, in order to place the prince royal upon the
                    throne, under the guidance of a regency composed of their own creatures; but
                    they were hurried on much further than they meant to go, by the violence with
                    which the Jacobins, who took the lead in the insurrection, conducted all their
                    enterprises. The prince royal, instead of being crowned, was shut up in the
                    Temple; and if France at that moment was not declared a republic, this was less
                    owing to any remaining respect for the constitution, than to the fear the
                    legislative body entertained of raising up against it the majority of the
                    nation, who could scarcely fail to be astonished and exasperated at finding a
                    constitution fenced by so many oaths thus precipitately overthrown. It was on
                    these grounds that the opinion was adopted, that a National Convention should be
                    convoked, in order to determine the fate of royalty.</p>
                <p>From this moment the Girondists daily lost ground, and the most furious members
                    of the democratic party, supported as they were by the Jacobin club, by the new
                    commune of Paris, and by the tribunes, made themselves masters of every debate.
                    It was of the utmost importance to them to control the ensuing elections; and
                    this was effected by the horrible consternation which the massacres of September
                    excited throughout the kingdom. The terror of being assassinated, or at least
                    maltreated, drove from all the primary assemblies not only the royalists and
                    constitutionalists, but moderate men of all parties; those assemblies became
                    entirely composed of the weakest men and most desperate characters to be found
                    in France; and from amongst the most frantic of these a large proportion of the
                    members of the Convention was chosen. Accordingly, this third assembly, in the
                    first quarter of an hour of its first sitting, was heard shouting for the
                    abolition of royalty, and proclaiming the Republic, upon the motion of a member
                    who had formerly been a player.</p>
                <p>Such an opening but too plainly showed what was to be expected from that horde of
                    plunderers who composed the majority of the National Convention, and of whom
                    Robespierre, Danton, Marat, and the other leaders, formed their party. That of
                    the Girondists still existed, and was the only one really republican. Glutted
                    with the horrors already committed, they seemed desirous of arresting the
                    torrent, and laboured to introduce into the assembly the moderation necessary to
                    give to the new Republic a wise and solid organization. But the superiority of
                    their knowledge, talents, and eloquence, which their opponents could not <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193515579" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5579-0124"/> dispute, had no
                    power over men thirsting for blood, and determined to rule by the
                    instrumentality of terror alone. They had no doubt occasion for atrocities, to
                    prepare the terror-stricken nation to suffer them to commit, in its name, the
                    murder of the unfortunate Louis XVI.; and that sacrifice was necessary to commit
                    the Revolution beyond all possibility of retreat, and bring about a third
                    revolution, which Robespierre and his associates were already preparing. Fear
                    had greatly contributed to the two former; but this was effected by terror
                    alone, without popular tumults, or the intervention of the armies, which, being
                    now drawn by their conquests beyond the frontiers, never heard any thing of the
                    revolutions at home till they were accomplished, and always obeyed the
                    prevailing faction, by whom they were either paid or allowed to pay
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>By the degree of ferocity discovered by the members of the Convention in passing
                    sentence upon the king, and in the debates relative to the constitution of 1793,
                    Robespierre was enabled to mark which of the deputies were most likely to second
                    his views, and which of them it was necessary to sacrifice. As to the people,
                    they could not but receive with transport a constitution which seemed to realise
                    the chimera of their sovereignty, but which would only have given a kind of
                    construction to anarchy, if the execution of this new code had not been
                    suspended, on the pretence common to all acts of despotism and tyranny, that the
                    safety of the state is the supreme law. This suspension was effected by
                    establishing the provisional government, which, under the title of revolutionary
                    government, concentrated all the powers in the National Convention until there
                    should be an end to the war, and to all intestine troubles.</p>
                <p>Although the faction which acknowledged Robespierre as its head possessed a
                    decided majority in the assembly, and might consequently have considered
                    themselves as exclusively exercising the sovereign power, he was a demagogue of
                    too despotic a nature to endure even the appearance of sharing the empire with
                    his associates. Hence he greatly reduced their number, by causing all the powers
                    invested in the National Assembly by the decrees which had established the
                    revolutionary government, to be transferred to a committee, of which he got
                    himself appointed a member, and in which he was certain to rule, by obtaining as
                    colleagues men less daring, but if possible even more wicked, than himself; such
                    as Couthon, Saint-Just, Barrère, and others of the same stamp. This committee,
                    styled the Committee of Public Safety, soon seized upon both the legislative and
                    executive powers, and exercised them with the most sanguinary tyranny ever heard
                    of amongst men. The ministers were merely their clerks; and the subjugated
                    assembly, without murmur or objection, passed all the revolutionary laws which
                    were proposed, or rather dictated, by them. One of their most decisive
                    proceedings was the establishment of those revolutionary tribunals which covered
                    France with scaffolds, on which victims of every rank, age, and sex, were daily
                    sacrificed; so that no class of men should be beyond the influence of that
                    stupifying and general terror which Robespierre found it necessary to spread in
                    order to establish his power. Nor was this all. He soon dragged some members of
                    his own party, such as Danton, Camille Desmoulins, and others, whose energy and
                    popularity had offended him, before one of those tribunals, where he had them
                    condemned to death. By the same means he had got nd of the leaders of the
                    Girondists; and had caused all die moderate republican party, who were still
                    members of the assembly, except those who had time and address to escape, to be
                    sent to prison, in order to be sentenced and executed on the first
                    opportunity.</p>
                <p>In this manner ended the third revolution, in which die people, frozen with
                    terror, dared not take a part. Instead of an army of soldiers, Robespierre
                    employed an army of executioners and assassins, set up as revolutionary judges;
                    and the guillotine, striking or menacing all indiscriminately, rendered France
                    submissive from one end to the other. A nation, formerly proud, even to
                    idolatry, of its kings, was thus seen to expiate, by rivers of blood, the crime
                    of having suffered the most virtuous of all their monarchs to be murdered on a
                    scaffold. In the room of the famous Bastille, whose capture and demolition had
                    set only seven prisoners at liberty, two of whom had long been in a state of
                    lunacy, the colleges, the seminaries, and all the religious houses of the
                    kingdom, were converted into so many state prisons, into which were incessantly
                    crowded the victims devoted to feed the ever-working guillotines, at once the
                    chief resource of supplies for the government, and the instrument of its
                    ferocity. “The guillotine coins money for the republic,” said Barrère. In fact,
                    according to the jurisprudence of the revolutionary tribunals, the rich of every
                    class were declared suspected persons, and received sentence of death for no
                    other reason but that of giving to the confiscation of their property a show of
                    judicial form.</p>
                <p>But still blood flowed too slowly to satisfy Robespierre; his aim was but partly
                    attained by the proscription of the nobles, the priests, and the wealthy. He
                    fancied not only an aristocracy of talents and knowledge, but of the virtues,
                    none of which however his orators and journalists would admit, save that horrid
                    “patriotism” which was estimated according to the enormity of the crimes
                    committed in favour of the Revolution. His plan was to reduce the French people
                    to a mere plantation of slaves, too ignorant, too stupid, or too pusillanimous,
                    to conceive the idea of breaking the chains with which he would have loaded them
                    in the name of liberty; and he might perhaps have succeeded, had not his
                    ambition, as impatient as it was jealous, too soon unveiled his intention of
                    resorting to the guillotine to strike off the shackles with which an assembly of
                    national representatives fettered or might fetter his power. He was about to
                    give the decisive blow, which he had concerted with the Commune of Paris, the
                    Revolutionary Tribunal, the Jacobin Club, and the principal officers of the
                    national guard, when the members of the Convention, who were marked out to be
                    the first sacrificed, anticipated him at a moment when he least expected it, by
                    attacking himself in the assembly, with energy sufiicient to rouse against him
                    and the Jacobins all the sections of the capital. The parties came to blows, and
                    for several hours victory remained uncertain, but at length it declared in
                    favour of the Convention. In the space of a day that execrable monster was
                    dragged from the highest pitch of power ever attained by any tyrant, to the very
                    scaffold which was still reeking with the blood of his last victims. His
                    principal accomplices in the Committee of Public Safety, in the Commune, in the
                    national guard, in the Revolutionary Tribunal, and many of his agents in the
                    provinces, met the same fate. The revolutionary tribunals were suppressed, the
                    prisons thrown open, and the terrorists hunted down wherever they could be
                    found.</p>
                <p>This fourth revolution, in which the faction which was then esteemed the moderate
                    party overthrew the terrorists, and seized the supreme power, was no less
                    complete than those which had preceded it, and produced the constitution of
                    1795. All France received as a great blessing a constitution which delivered
                    them from the revolutionary government and its infernal policy. Besides, in
                    spite of great defects, it had the merit of coming nearer than the two preceding
                    ones to the principles of order, justice, and read liberty, the violation of
                    which had, during the five preceding years, been the source of so many crimes
                    and disasters. The royalists, considering it as a step towards monarchy, were
                    imprudent enough to triumph in it; and their joy, as premature as it was
                    indiscreet, so alarmed the assembly, that they passed the famous law, ordaining
                    the primary assemblies to return two thirds of the members of the Convention<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193515592" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5592-0125"/> to the
                    legislative body destined to succeed that assembly. It was thus that the spirit
                    of the Convention continued, for the first year, to be displayed in the two
                    councils. In the year following, the bias of the public mind, too hastily turn«!
                    towards royalty, showed itself, in the elections of the members for the new
                    third, so clearly as to alarm the regicides who composed the Directory, and the
                    conventionalists who still formed a third of the legislative body; nor did they
                    lose a moment in devising means for their defence. That which appeared to them
                    the surest, was to publish notices of plots amongst the royalists, and annex one
                    or more denunciations, in terms so vague as to leave room for implicating, when
                    necessary, all their adversaries; whilst by the help of this imposture they
                    procured some secret information, ever easily obtained by those who have at
                    command the guillotine and the exchequer. This masked battery was ready to be
                    opened before the members of the new third took their seats. These at first
                    confined themselves to the object of securing a constant majority in the two
                    councils in favour of moderate opinions; but in a little time every sitting was
                    marked by the repeal of some revolutionary law, or by some decree tending to
                    restrain the executive authority within the limits fixed by the
                    constitution.</p>
                <p>Alarmed at the abridgment of their power, and dreading still more serious
                    attacks, the Directory came to the resolution of no longer postponing the blow
                    which they had been meditating against the Legislative Assembly; and in the
                    manner already related they accomplished a fifth revolution, as complete as any
                    of those by which it was preceded. It differed indeed from them essentially in
                    the facility and promptness with which it was effected; although the party which
                    prevailed, that is to say, the majority of the Directory, and the minority of
                    the legislative body, had to combat, not only against the constitution, but
                    against the opinion, and even against the indignation, of the public. That moral
                    force, on which the majority of the two councils had unluckily placed all their
                    reliance, vanished in an instant before the physical force of a detachment of
                    troops consisting of six or seven hundred men. The Directory, compelled to
                    withdraw the larger body of troops which they had thought necessary to ensure
                    the revolution they were meditating, discovered great ability in securing the
                    two councils, by appearing to dread them; but it was chiefly to the energy of
                    their measures, and to the concentration and promptness with which they were
                    executed, that they owed their success. Two days before, the legislative body
                    might without obstruction have impeached, arrested, and even outlawed, the
                    majority of the Directory, who were execrated by the public under the title of
                    the triumvirate; and, if requisite, they would have been supported by more than
                    thirty thousand armed citizens, who, with Pichegru and Willot at their head,
                    would soon have dispersed, and perhaps brought over, the feeble detachments of
                    troops of the ’ line which the Directory had at their command. But the
                    legislative body, relying too much upon its popularity, did not sufficiently
                    consider that the people, whose impetuosity is commonly decisive when allowed to
                    take advantage in attack, are always feeble when acting on the defensive, and
                    totally unable to withstand any assault made previously to an insurrection,
                    seeing it is always easy to prevent their assembling. It was on this principle
                    that the Directory founded their operations, and the 5th of September too well
                    proves how justly. That day reduced the legislative body to the most degrading
                    subjugation, a mere caricature of national representation; it invested the
                    Directory with the most arbitrary and tyrannical power, and restored the system
                    of Robespierre, under a form less bloody, but not less pernicious; for the
                    revolutionary tribunals which that monster had established were scarcely more
                    expeditious than the military commissions of the Directory. The power of
                    arbitrary and unlimited transportation is, in time, as destructive as the
                    guillotine, without possessing, like that, the advantage of exciting a salutary
                    horror, which, by recovering the people from the state of stupor and apathy, the
                    first effects of terror, gives them both recollection and force to break their
                    chains. Though, in violating the most essential regulations of the constitution,
                    the Directory obtained a temporary confirmation of their power, ^lιeir example
                    pointed out to Bonaparte and Sièyes the path which they pursued with infinite
                    address, and in which they accomplished a sixth revolution, by the establishment
                    of the consulate, the character of which will be sufficiently unfolded in the
                    sequel.</p>
                <p>The truce of Amiens having been concluded (it had none 1 of the characteristics
                    of a solid peace), Bonaparte pursued <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> his plans of
                    internal organization with an evident view to the re-establishment of monarchy
                    in France. A church had already been reared up, and the Catholic religion, with
                    a suitable hierarchy, re-constituted by the state. With this view the pope had
                    been spared when the course of events placed him at the mercy of the conqueror;
                    and the year 1801 was spent in negotiating a “concordat” with Rome, by which, in
                    return for a decree declaring the Catholic religion that of the great majority
                    of the French, and undertaking to grant salaries to the clergy, the pontiff
                    agreed to consecrate such bishops as should be nominated by the French
                    government, to give up all claim to the lands which had belonged to the church,
                    and to order a public form of prayer for the consuls. At the desire of
                    Bonaparte, the court of Rome further consented to secularize Talleyrand, and to
                    make certain other concessions, all indicating an accommodating, if not an
                    obsequious spirit towards the ruler of France.<note anchored="true"

                    Bonaparte encountered much opposition from the prejudiced incredulity of those
                    around him. “Hearken,” said he to one of his councillors during a promenade at
                    Malmaison; “I was here last Sunday, walking in this solitude amidst the silence
                    of nature. The sound of the church bells of Ruel suddenly struck upon my ears. I
                    was moved, and said, if I am thus affected, what must be the influence of those
                    ideas on the simple and credulous mass. The people must have a religion, and
                    that religion must be in the hands of the government.” The councillor, thus
                    addressed, waiving the broad question of religion or no religion, objected to
                    Catholicism. “It is intolerant; its clergy are counter-revolutionary; the spirit
                    of the present time is entirely opposed to it. And, after all, we, in our
                    thoughts and principles, are nearer to the true spirit of the gospel than the
                    Catholics, who affect to reverence it.” Bonaparte urged, that by his leaning to
                    Protestantism the government would be weakened, not strengthened; one half of
                    France might embrace it, but the other half would remain Catholic. “Let them
                    call me papist if they will. I am no such thing. I was a Mahommedan in Egypt,
                    and I will be a Catholic here for the good of the people.” This was certainly
                    very accommodating; but, notwithstanding, considerable resistance was
                    experienced. The theophilanthropists raised the cry of no popery. The soldiers,
                    too, were excessively indignant. In commemoration of the re-establishment of the
                    church, Cardinal Caprara celebrated <hi rend="italic">TeDeum</hi> in Nôtre Dame
                    on Easter sunday 1802, when the first consul attended, surrounded by his
                    officers. On his return he asked several of them their opinion, and, in
                    particular, addressing General Delmas, said, “well, general, we have just
                    witnessed a very imposing ceremony; I hope you are satisfied.” “Yes,” replied
                    Delmas, “a pretty capucinade; there was only wanting the million of men who have
                    perished in overthrowing all you have built up. we must now, I presume, fasten
                    beads to our swords." I∙annes expressed his resentment in still stronger term’s.
                    Perceiving in the hall of the Tuileries Cardinal Caprara and several bishops, he
                    accosted them in the rudest manner; then entering without ceremony the cabinet
                    of Bonaparte, he exclaimed, “Eh! que fais-tu de ce tas de prêtres dans tes
                    antichambres; chasse-moi toute cette canaille t est-ce avec des soldats de cette
                    es∣ιece que tu as gagné la bataille de Marengo? A quoi diable songes-tu done? Tu
                    verras qu'un beau jour ils to jetteront bas.” Delmas received orders <pb
                    corresp="kp-eb0710-5605-0126" xml:id="pbn7126"/> to quit Paris immediately;
                    Lannes, more favoured, was only admonished to show a little more patience, and
                    less vivacity. “I shall know,” said Napoleon, “how to govern these men, and
                    prevent them from exciting any disturbance, what I do is necessary; I pray you
                    in future to be more reserved.” Moreau, Bernadotte, Oudinot, Colaud, victor, and
                    others, entertained the same sentiments as Lannes and Delmas; and the army,
                    generally, was decidedly opposed to the concordat, and the re-establishment of
                    the clergy. (Montgaillard, <hi rend="italic">Hùtoire de France,</hi> tome v. p.
                    445.)</p></note> The next desideratum was an aristocracy, which, <pb
                    corresp="pbn7126" facs="nls:193515605" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5605-0126"/> after the
                    concluison of the peace, every effort was used to supply. The ancient nobihty
                    were allowed, nay even encouraged, to return to France; Napoleon seemed anxious
                    to gather around him the fragments of a monarchy sanctioned by time, though at
                    last overthrown by the force of opinion and circumstances; but, stripped of
                    their properties, and alike disinclined to the Revolution and its
                    representatives, they refused to abandon the cause of legitimacy for an
                    equivocal or anomalous place in the consular court. In one sense they judged
                    rightly; for, even if they had availed themselves of the permission granted by
                    the French government, it would still have been necessary to counterbalance the
                    old nobility by elevating to the same rank those who had attained to distinction
                    during the wars and struggles of the Revolution, in short, warriors and
                    civilians, who had earned their honours in the school of democracy. Accordingly
                    Napoleon, obliged for a time to abandon this idea, formed a scheme eminently
                    calculated to attach to him a nation which, with all its professed
                    republicanism, still retained a strong predilection for the trappings of
                    monarchy. This was the institution of the Legion of Honour, by which, at the
                    expense of red ribbons and very moderate pensions, an order of merit was
                    created, into which every man of ambition or enterprise might hope one day to
                    gain admission, and which was calculated to ensure the attachment of all the men
                    of courage and ability in the country. But when the project was communicated to
                    the council and the legislative body, an instant outcry was raised against it.
                    “It destroys equality, it contradicts the principles of the Revolution. The
                    legion of honour contains all the elements of hereditary nobility; privileges,
                    powers, honours, titles and pensions. It is sowing the seeds of an aristocracy.”
                    Bonaparte combated these objections, of which he must nevertheless have felt the
                    force. “You cite the Roman republicans against me; the Romans, amongst whom
                    distinctions were perhaps more marked than amongst any other people. Observe the
                    consequence when the noble class of patricians was destroyed at Rome; the
                    Republic, left at the mercy of the populace and its leaders, ran straight
                    through anarchy and proscription to despotism.” And was not this also the case
                    in France? Did not the re-action which followed the reign of terror prepare the
                    way for that despotism which Napoleon himself was so soon to establish over
                    France? In one respect, however, the first consul acted with equal firmness and
                    justice. When Mathieu Dumas proposed to confine the decorations of the legion of
                    honour to the military, he peremptorily refused to admit any such exclusive
                    limitations, and persisted in his determination to render the new order equally
                    accessible to the soldier and the civilian.</p>
                <p>But whilst Napoleon was thus reconstructing the supports and providing the
                    ornaments of monarchical power, he did not neglect the necessary means for
                    raising the edifice itself; that is, the establishment of a permanent
                    sovereignty in his own person and family, on a basis involving a full
                    recognition of the rights and interests created by the Revolution. In this,
                    accordingly, he laboured with equal skill and perseverance, advancing step by
                    step towards his object. It was at first hoped indeed that he would be contented
                    with the second place, and restore the crown to the Bourbons; and, on this
                    supposition, Louis XVIII. twice addressed him in terms which might perhaps have
                    conciliated ordinary ambition. But although Josephine exhorted him to imitate
                    the conduct of Monk, and there were not wanting others to insinuate the same
                    advice, Bonaparte, satisfied that there were more difficulties in the way of
                    restoring the Bourbons than of founding a new dynasty, and that the men of the
                    Revolution would more readily tolerate as sovereign one who had risen from its
                    ranks, than receive back any member of a family who had so many wrongs to
                    avenge, resolved to put on his head the crown which genius and fortune had
                    enabled him to win. Accordingly, he began by feeling the pulse of the nation in
                    a pamphlet, which, it is said, was written by his brother Lucien, and corrected
                    by himself. But as the public mind was not yet prepared for so violent a
                    transition, the experiment failed; ridicule was provoked at the idea of an
                    Emperor of the Gauls; and the first consul, throwing the blame of this alleged
                    imprudence on his brother, deprived him of his office of minister of the
                    interior, and sent him as envoy into Spain. Meanwhile, the Tribunate, or
                    representative body, had been remodelled, and the most froward patriots
                    excluded; an “épuration” which materially facilitated the development of his
                    plans. In May 1802, Bonaparte was declared first consul for another ten years;
                    and, after a short interval, this was amended into a vote by which he was
                    appointed first consul for life. Under a republican designation, he thus became
                    the acknowledged sovereign of France; and it is not less remarkable than
                    instructive that this surrender of the liberties of the country encountered much
                    less opposition in the council than the institution of the legion of honour had
                    done. The history of the Revolution shows, indeed, that it is not liberty which
                    the French prize, but equality and military glory.</p>
                <p>The views of the consular government in concluding the peace of Amiens were now
                    sufficiently indicated by the course which Napoleon pursued in extending his
                    influence over the neighbouring states. The Cisalpine Republic had been
                    remodelled to suit his views, and the first consul elected as president of its
                    legislature. The Batavian and Ligurian Republics were obliged to submit to
                    similar modifications; Piedmont was formally annexed to France, and divided into
                    departments; and the stipulations of the treaty of Luneville, which guaranteed
                    the independence of the republics of Italy and Holland, thus became void.
                    Britain began to show alarm and distrust, though the grounds for such a feeling
                    were scarcely stronger now than at the time when the treaty of Amiens had been
                    concluded. Bonaparte was merely following out the system which he had previously
                    adopted. Remonstrances were made against these encroachments and usurpations;
                    but the answer was ready and conclusive. You must have foreseen all this. The
                    Cisalpine Republic chose the first consul as its president in January 1802, two
                    months before the signature of the preliminary treaty of Amiens; you could not
                    be ignorant of the fact. And why should England complain of the infraction of
                    the treaty of Luneville, when Austria, with whom it was concluded, remains
                    silent ?” This seems wholly unanswerable. Great Britain was neither a party to
                    nor the guarantee of the treaty of Luneville, and no stipulation had been
                    included in that of Amiens, that the articles of the treaty of Lunerille should
                    be observed. She had obviously, therefore, no right whatever to interfere.
                    According to the admission of Lord Castlereagh, she had made “a peace to try
                    France;” but then this trial should in justice and fairness have been confined
                    to the treaty which she had actually concluded, and not extended to a different
                    one in which she could not even pretend to have any concern, excepting upon the
                    assumption that she held Aus-trio<pb break="no" facs="nls:193515618"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-5618-0127"/> in tutelage. On the other hand, it was equally
                    futile to complain of interference with the Helvetian Republic, because, in
                    concluding a peace with France, it must have been foreseen that Napoleon would
                    inevitably act by it as he had already done by the Cisalpine Republic. In
                    treating, the object of both powers was most probably the same, namely, to
                    display to Europe a readiness to make peace, and thus cast on each other the
                    blame of the inevitable and speedy rupture. But in playing this difficult and
                    not very creditable game, English diplomacy was completely at fault. The French
                    observed the treaty to the letter; by the English it was decidedly violated. The
                    former continually appealed to the compact which had been entered into between
                    the two countties; the latter were obliged to travel out of the bond in quest of
                    reasons or pretexts to justify the nonfulfilment of its stipulations. The
                    British ministry may have had rational grounds for their mistrust; indeed it is
                    certain that they had such; but in withholding Malta and the Cape of Good Hope,
                    merely because France had increased her territories and encroachments in Europe,
                    they took up an indefensible position, and consequently were under the necessity
                    of supporting their cause with vague and unstatesmanlike recrimination.</p>
                <p>But whilst the peace which had so recently been concluded was thus endangered by
                    the hesitation of the British government to surrender Malta, and the
                    transmission of counter orders not to deliver up the Cape of Good Hope to the
                    Batavian Republic, other sources of division and alienation were unhappily
                    opened up. Sensitive at all times to public opinion, and peculiarly so at this
                    time when employed in rearing the fabric of his power, the first consul felt
                    deeply the unsparing attacks which were now made upon him by the English press,
                    and re-echoed by the papers of the French royalists in England. To him this was
                    a species of warfare at once more dangerous and more galling than any other. A
                    formal demand was therefore made by the French ambassador in London that this
                    torrent of abuse should be checked; and further, that the press should be
                    prohibited from indulging, in future, in strictures offensive to the head of the
                    French government. The ministry replied that the press in this country was free;
                    that so far from having any control over its conduct, they were themselves daily
                    exposed to the utmost severity of remark; and that all persons aggrieved by it
                    must seek redress in the ordinary courts of law. Nevertheless, to avoid the
                    appearance of conniving at or encouraging such attacks, they consented to
                    gratify him as far as might be done in a constitutional way, by sending one of
                    the libels complained of to a jury. But this made matters ten times worse.
                    Peltier was acquitted, and an obscure libel received consequence from the
                    prosecution, and notoriety, if not fame, from the incomparable splendour of the
                    defence. Another demand, that the Bourbons and their partisans should be
                    expelled from England, met with a firm and generous refusal. Chagrined and
                    exasperated, Bonaparte now condescended to enter into a personal quarrel with
                    the English press, and employed his time in dictating articles for the <hi
                    rend="italic">Moniteur,</hi> filled with acrimony and insult. About the same
                    time also appeared a report by Sebastiani (who had been employed in a mission to
                    the Levant), in which, amongst other things, it was stated that six thousand
                    French soldiers could reconquer Egypt, and that England durst not renew the war
                    against France. Ίο say that intemperate paragraphs in newspapers, and silly
                    vaunting in reports, could ever become a reasonable ground of war, is
                    preposterous. But the English government, by its want <hi rend="subscript">
                    of</hi> ’ f <hi rend="subscript"> ore</hi> sight and precaution, if not also by
                    its want of faith, was reduced to the humiliating necessity of appealing <hi
                    rend="subscript"> to</hi> such authorities in vindication of its conduct. The
                    first consul now demanded why Malta had not been evacuated according to
                    stipulation. The Enghsh mmistry replied by a claim to retain it, on the ground
                    that France had increased her territory in Europe, and that Egypt was
                    threatened. But the first objection was irrelevant, and the second ridiculous.
                    Bonaparte, whose throne was being erected on the basis of national glory, could
                    never consent to the retention of Malta by the English; to demand it of him was
                    in fact to declare war. “England,” said the French minister, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,i</hi> shall have the treaty of Amiens, and nothing more
                    than the treaty of Amiens.”</p>
                <p>A rupture was now inevitable, as indeed it had from the first been, and
                    accordingly both countries made preparations for war. Napoleon assembled troops
                    in the fortresses of Holland and the north of France, and dispatched envoys to
                    Austria and Prussia. Britain was not less active; in all her ports and harbours
                    the deep note of preparation was heard. Still Bonaparte was unwilling to
                    commence war, and, unavoidable as it now seemed, made a last effort to ward it
                    off. In an interview with the British ambassador, Lord Whitworth, he expressed
                    himself with a degree of frankness and sincerity unusual in diplomacy, but which
                    unhappily led to no amicable result. “Why should I wish for war ř” said he. “A
                    descent upon England is the only mode I have of combating her; and this, if
                    compelled, I am resolved to undertake. But why suppose that, arrived at my
                    present height of power, I should risk my reputation and life, unless
                    constrained thereto by necessity, in an expedition in which myself and the
                    greater part of my army would most probably go to the bottom of the sea; for
                    there are a hundred chances to one against me.” But all this candour proved
                    unavailing. Napoleon was exceedingly averse to war at this time, when he had
                    good cause to apprehend that the basis on which his power was fixed had not yet
                    become sufficiently consolidated to withstand the rude shock of a fresh contest.
                    For the same reason England was inexorably bent upon trying again the fortune of
                    arms. A warlike message from the king to parliament in March 1803 formed the
                    prelude to the storm which was now ready to burst. Bonaparte replied in a
                    diplomatic note of singular ability and unanswerable cogency of reasoning. It
                    was important to him to cast upon England the whole blame of the rupture; he had
                    at once to satisfy the people of France, and to conciliate the other powers of
                    Europe; and, besides, his pride was mortified to find England assume the
                    language of cold and haughty defiance, if not insult, at the very moment when he
                    had almost humbled himself before the minister of that country. Hence his keen
                    and quick resentment prompted him to break through the rules of courtly decorum,
                    and, at a public levee held on the 13th of March, to give vent to the bitterness
                    of spirit which this conduct had excited. “You are decided on war, it seems you
                    wish it,” said he, addressing the British ambassador. “After fifteen years of
                    combats, we must yet recommence and fight for fifteen years to come. You force
                    me to it.” Then turning to the ambassadors of Spain and Russia, he said, “The
                    English will have war. They are the first to draw the sword; I will be the last
                    to put it in the scabbard. They do not respect treaties, which we must
                    henceforth cover with black crape. You may destroy France, but you shall not
                    intimidate her.” “We do not wish to do either the one or the other,” replied
                    Lord Whitworth. “Respect treaties, then. Wo be to those who do not respect them;
                    they shall be responsible to Europe for the consequences.” At the conclusion of
                    the levee, he again addressed the British ambassador when near the door: <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,,</hi> The Duchess of Dorset has passed the unpleasant
                    season at Paris; I sincerely wish she may pass the pleasant one also; but if it
                    be true that we are to have war, the responsibility, in the sight of both God
                    and man, will rest on those who shall refuse to execute the treaty.” It has been
                    said by some that this burst of anger was calculated. Why might it not be
                    natural and sincere? War at this time was not for the interest of Napoleon, or
                    of the country which had placed him <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515631"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-5631-0128"/>at its head; he required time to mature his plans
                    of government; France languished for repose. But the die was now cast, and all
                    that remained was to abide the hazard of the throw.</p>
                <p>Lord Whitworth was now instructed to demand that the French forces should
                    evacuate the Batavian and Swiss territories; that a suitable provision should be
                    made for the king of Sardinia, and that Britain should be permitted to retain
                    possession of Malta for ten years. This was called an ultimatum, and a week was
                    insultingly fixed as the term beyond which no reply would be received. Yet even
                    now the French government did not assume a peremptory tone. Talleyrand was
                    sincerely averse to war, and up to the last moment used every effort to prevent
                    it; foreseeing, probably, the pernicious consequences which would result even
                    from fresh victories. But the English ministry resisted every advance towards an
                    accommodation of the points in dispute, gave wretched and shuffling reasons for
                    a mistrust which in the main was perhaps not altogether groundless, and sought
                    to cover the blunders of their diplomacy by means of sullen pride and defiance.
                    Outwitted, out-argued, and outdone, both in talents and in good faith, they had
                    no voice for, no resource in, any thing but war. Orders had already been issued
                    for seizing the ships of France, and those of the states dependent on or in
                    close alliance with that country; a measure entirely in the spirit of that
                    usurpation which they at once denounced and imitated; and the first consul
                    retaliated by detaining all the British subjects whom curiosity or business had
                    induced to visit France. And thus recommenced between the nations a quarrel
                    unrivalled for the inveteracy of its spirit and the variety of its fortunes.
                    “The rupture was to the first consul,” says Bignon, “the decisive point of his
                    destiny. Henceforth he saw England rise before him like a cape of storms, which
                    he was for ever forbidden to pass.”</p>
                <p>The first step of Napoleon, on the renewal of hostilities, was to put his armies
                    in motion; that of Holland to occupy Hanover, and that of Lombardy to invade
                    Naples, and garrison Tarentum. Britain, secure from direct attack in her insular
                    fortress, could only be combated by establishing the power of France in the
                    sea-ports, and excluding British commerce from the Continent. To bestride Europe
                    like a huge colossus, having one foot on the Mediterranean and the other on the
                    Baltic, was therefore the grand object of Napoleon; and this menacing attitude
                    he lost no time in preparing to assume towards England. That power now reigned
                    supreme as empress of the seas; but “her control stopped with the shore,” which
                    was now about to be closed against the enterprise of her people. Towards the end
                    of May 1803, General Mortier marched against Hanover with an army from Holland,
                    and speedily made himself master of the country. 'The troops of the electorate,
                    incapable of offering any serious resistance, retreated before the enemy, and at
                    length capitulated, when they were discharged on condition of not serving
                    against France during the war. About the same time the kingdom of Naples was
                    re-occupied with equal facility by a French force. These sudden conquests,
                    however, excited uneasiness and suspicion on the part of the northern powers.
                    Russia, which had taken the Sicilian court under its protection, was offended by
                    the re-occupation of the Neapolitan territory, and still more seriously
                    displeased to observe the French flag waving on the shores of the Baltic.
                    Prussia had still greater cause for alarm at the presence of so formidable a
                    neighbour; more especially as the French, not satisfied with Hanover, already
                    threatened to occupy Hamburg and Bremen, the possession of which was necessary
                    to enable them to give the law to the north of Germany. The blow aimed at
                    England thus recoiled on a power whose selfish and temporising policy had
                    induced her to withdraw from the contest with republican France, and leave her
                    allies to defeat and humiliation. But as these proceedings placed the courts of
                    Berlin and St Petersburg under the necessity of either humbling themselves
                    before France, or throwing themselves once more into the arms of Britain,
                    Napoleon sought by every means to conciliate these powers, and even to bribe
                    them to join him in his attempts to destroy the commercial and maritime
                    superiority of this country. “The germ of what was subsequently called the
                    Continental System,” says Bignon, “already existed in the mind of the first
                    consul, and this system reposed upon the support of Prussia. One of the objects
                    of the usurpation of Hanover was to make that court feel the inconvenience of a
                    state of indecision towards France, and the advantages of a close alliance with
                    her. To render Prussia powerful, in order that by its union with France it might
                    awe the Continent to quiet, was the aim of Napoleon. If it be asked why, towards
                    the close of his reign, Napoleon showed himself inexorable towards Prussia, the
                    reason is, that Prussia was the power which wished him most ill, in forcing him
                    to combat and destroy her, instead of extending and strengthening her monarchy,
                    in order that she and France united might keep Austria and Russia immoveable,
                    and at the same time give that development to the continental system which would
                    force England to make peace.” Prussia, in short, was to be fattened and enriched
                    at the expense of acting in subservience to the views of France, and Hanover was
                    offered to her as the price of her submission. The bribe was tempting, and there
                    was considerable hesitation in refusing it. All the old ministers were disposed
                    to accept the electorate with the French alliance; Hardenberg alone was of a
                    contrary opinion, and his view ultimately prevailed. But the influence which
                    decided the Prussian court to reject the insidious proposals of Bonaparte was
                    that of the Emperor Alexander, whose opinions, arguments, and weight overcame
                    all the representations of Duroc and the other French envoys, even when on the
                    point of accomplishing their object.</p>
                <p>By a singular turn of opinion and events, every act of Bonaparte now told in
                    favour of Britain, the ministry of which, had he remained on the defensive,
                    could scarcely have persisted in a war which had been undertaken without any
                    adequate object, and in the prosecution of which there was no reasonable
                    prospect of success. But the occupation of Hanover and the south of Italy
                    excited the apprehensions of Europe; whilst the army collected on the northern
                    coasts of France, and destined to invade England, had the effect of exciting the
                    patriotic energies of that country, silencing the arguments of the friends of
                    peace, firing the national pride, and uniting all by the tie of a supposed
                    common danger. The voice of reason, prudence, and humanity, was drowned in the
                    tumult of contending passions; and the most unjustifiable war in which Britain
                    had ever engaged, suddenly became, in the broadest sense of the term, a national
                    one. Meanwhile, as a field of battle was denied to Napoleon, he turned his
                    activity towards military organization, forming the armies and preparing the
                    resources with which his most brilliant conquests were afterwards achieved.
                    Alessandria was fortified upon the most approved principles, at an enormous
                    expense, and rendered the bulwark of Italy. From Otranto to the Texel every
                    coast and sea-port was put in a state of defence; and the British fleet, whilst
                    blockading every harbour, and menacing every accessible point, might observe the
                    gigantic attempt made by the enemy to surround Europe, as it were, with a wall
                    of iron. The few remaining colonies or foreign possessions of France now fell
                    into the hands of Britain; and Louisiana, which had been wrested from Spain, was
                    sold to the United States, as the only mode left of deriving advantage from the
                    acquisition, and at the same time defeating the views which England might
                    entertain in regard to the occupation of the province.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515644" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5644-0129"/>
                <p>Whilst public attention was mainly directed to the army and flotilla assembled at
                    Boulogne, Ambleteuse, and other places adjoining, for the professed purpose of
                    invading Britain, it was suddenly diverted from military projects by the
                    discovery of a conspiracy against the first consul. The hopes which the royalist
                    party had entertained upon his first accession to power have already been
                    noticed. They fancied that, satisfied with military glory, he might be prevailed
                    on to favour a restoration, if not directly to assist in bringing it about; and,
                    in two letters, Louis XVIII. demanded of him this act of disinterestedness,
                    which, however, he calmly but firmly declined. His subsequent measures for
                    strengthening and perpetuating his power left no doubt that, occupying the first
                    place in the state, he would never voluntarily descend to the second, and that
                    the hopes which they had so hastily formed were entirely fallacious.
                    Disappointment now gave place to intrigue, and intrigue became envenomed by the
                    spirit of revenge. The decree which conferred upon Napoleon the consulship for
                    life had encountered very considerable opposition. Lafayette protested against
                    it; Camille Jourdan published a reclamation in favour of the liberty of the
                    press; and Madame de Staël opened her brilliant saloon to the most distinguished
                    opponents of the consular government. Of all this the royalists now took
                    advantage; and a correspondence was entered into with Louis XVIII., who
                    promised, in the event of his restoration, to respect the principles of liberty,
                    and further to grant a charter in which these should be fully recognised. The
                    hopes of the royalists were thus kept alive; the activity and confidence of
                    their adherents were augmented; whilst the watchfulness and jealousy of the
                    government were proportionally increased. But although the opinions and
                    predilections of speculative persons seldom lead those who entertain them to
                    embark in the perilous adventure of conspiracy, the Bourbons counted amongst
                    their more zealous and active partisans men eager to strike a blow at the head
                    of the new government, and to anticipate events rather than to wait for their
                    tardy development. Of these, General Pichegru was one. His fortunes were now
                    desperate; and he had many wrongs, or at least misfortunes, to avenge. Having
                    escaped from Sinamary, to which he had been banished by the faction of the 18th
                    of Fructidor (4th September 1797), the expatriated general returned to Europe;
                    openly espoused the cause of the Bourbons; and, as Bonaparte had now become
                    master in France, wished to attempt by a <hi rend="italic">coup-d¢-main</hi> to
                    overturn the principal author of his misfortunes. A plan of conspiracy, having
                    for its object to overthrow the consular government and to restore the Bourbons,
                    was accordingly arranged at London, in conjunction with Georges Cadoudal, son of
                    a miller at Morbihan, a determined Chouan, and other persons well fitted to
                    engage in such an enterprise. The views of the conspirators can only be gathered
                    from circumstances, and from the admissions afterwards made by themselves when
                    arrested by the French police; but it seems tolerably certain that the
                    assassination of the first consul was regarded by them as a preliminary measure,
                    indispensable to the success of the counter revolution which it was their main
                    object to bring about, . The whole fabric of Bonaparte’s power rested on the
                    basis of his character and reputation; he was not part of a system established
                    on a wide and solid foundation, but the system itself; the existence of the
                    consular government depended entirely on him; and hence the surest as well as
                    speediest mode of overturning his authority was to begin by destroying himself.
                    But be this as it may, the ultimate success of the enterprise depended on
                    providing beforehand the means of giving it a determinate character, and at the
                    same time acting powerfully on public opinion.</p>
                <p>What the conspirators most wanted, therefore, was a name to oppose to that of
                    Bonaparte; a leader of eminence, whose reputation might conciliate public
                    opinion, and bear to be put in competition with that of the first consul. Moreau
                    was precisely such a personage, indeed the very man they required. Possessing
                    great talents for war, his success had been commensurate with his ability as a
                    commander, and the renown of Hohenlinden had equalled, if not eclipsed, the
                    glory of Marengo. Besides, he was discontented, living in affected obscurity,
                    and full of resentment on account of the unmerited neglect with which he had
                    been treated since the 18th of Brumaire. But though a brave soldier, Moreau was
                    deficient in moral courage. He could not persuade himself either to yield or
                    resist; he wanted the strength of mind or the dissimulation necessary to
                    restrain the expression of his resentment; nature had denied him that
                    promptitude of volition as well as energy of action which are so indispensable
                    in the chief of a party; and, on the 19th of Brumaire, he had not dared to
                    convert that revolution to his own advantage or that of the nation, and had even
                    served, though with a bad grace, as aide-de-camp to his more audacious rival.
                    His wife also had great influence over him, and having been slighted at the
                    consular court, now exerted it to induce him to listen to propositions for
                    overthrowing the tyranny of Bonaparte. The royalist agents, ever on the watch,
                    took advantage of these dispositions, effected a reconciliation between him and
                    Pichegru, and thus entangled him in a scheme destined to prove his ruin.
                    Pichegru arrived from England in January 1804; Georges Cadoudal had preceded him
                    by several months. They both saw Moreau, who was disgusted with the ferocity of
                    the Chouan; but their scheme, whatever it was, made little progress towards
                    maturity. From the first, indeed, Fouche had spread his toils around them;
                    numbers of their accomplices were already arrested; and if Pichegru and Cadoudal
                    were still allowed to remain at large, it was only that they might gain over
                    Moreau, and effectually implicate him in their schemes. Meanwhile the
                    conspirators were unable to come to any decision. At their last interview
                    Pichegru showed much hesitation; Moreau possessed ambition which he could not
                    conceal, but was totally wanting in character; Georges, and especially Pichegru,
                    perceived that he had personal views. Cadoudal, endowed with great energy, and
                    devoted to the cause of the Bourbons, pressed, conjured, threatened Moreau, but
                    could not decide him to act; and Pichegru ended by proposing to adjourn the
                    execution of the plot for four days. But in the night fixed for action, the
                    conspirators, whilst impatiently waiting the signal agreed on, received counter
                    orders, and dispersed; some indulging in the most violent proposals, others
                    resolved to mix no longer in such intrigues. The police was on the alert; the
                    most inquisitorial means were employed; all kinds of seduction were had recourse
                    to; Moreau, Pichegru, and Georges were successively arrested. When interrogated
                    as to the project of assassination, the Chouan answered frankly, “I came to
                    Paris to attack the first consul openly by force; by the same means, in short,
                    which he takes to protect himself. We waited to act until a French prince
                    arrived in Paris.” This prince was, it seems, the Duke d’Enghien; and the
                    voluntary confession of the Chouan sealed his fate.</p>
                <p>But in the interval between the arrest and trial of Pichegru and his associates,
                    Bonaparte struck a blow which stunned all Europe, and was no doubt intended to
                    strike <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> terror into the hearts of those who had so
                    often plotted his destruction. We allude to the seizure and military execution
                    of the Duke d’Enghien. This young prince, a son of the Duke de Bourbon, and
                    grandson of the last Prince of Condé, inhabited the chateau of Ettenheim,
                    belonging to the elector of Baden, and only four leagues distant from Strasbure,
                    where he had lived for some time in perfect <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515657"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-5657-0130"/>security. The proximity of his residence to the
                    French frontier, the fact of which the consular government had received
                    information that Dumouriez was at Ettenheim,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This proved to be a complete mistake. The person whom the
                    spies of the French police represented as General Dumouriez, was in reality the
                    Marquis de Thumery, the German pronunciation of whose name had led them to
                    confound him with Générai Dumouriez. (Montgailiard, <hi rend="italic">Hittaire
                    de France,</hi> tom. vi. p. 47.) It moreover appears that, among the persons
                    present at Ettenheim, was a Count Demoustier of Franche-Comté, the consonance of
                    whose name approaches still more nearly to that of Dumouriez. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ibid.)</hi></p></note> and, above all, the confession of Cadoudal that he and
                    his brother conspirators only waited for the arrival of a French prince in order
                    to commence operations, satisfied the first consul that the duke was not only
                    aware of, but deeply implicated in, the counter-revolutionary movement which had
                    been concerted in Paris; and this conviction was much strengthened by the
                    reports of the police, all of which represented the conspiracy as having
                    assassination for its principal object. “The air,” said Fouché, “is full of
                    poniards.” The life of the first consul had already been attempted by means of
                    the infernal machine; and although, on that occasion, he had escaped as it were
                    by miracle, he could not always hope that the hand of the assassin would miss
                    its aim, or that his machinations would fail of success. The law of
                    self-preservation, which gives to every man, when his life is in jeopardy, the
                    right of defending it by all the means in his power, seemed therefore to
                    sanction the adoption of measures calculated not merely to ward off the present
                    danger, but also to strike a salutary terror, which might in future prevent the
                    renewal of such attempts. Accordingly a detachment of French gensdarmes, under
                    the order of Captain Chariot, was directed by General Ordener to surprise the
                    castle of Ettenheim, and carry off the Duke d’Énghien; whilst another
                    expedition, under General Caulincourt, moved upon Kehl and Offemburg to seize
                    some emigrants at those places.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The minister of exterior relations, Talleyrand, in a letter
                    dated the 11th of March, sent to the minister of the elector a notification of
                    the intended arrest of the Duke d’Énghien, but it is uncertain whether this
                    letter reached Carlsruhe before the seizure of the prince, which was so rapidly
                    effected by the gensdarmes under Chariot. Talleyrand evidently desired to
                    prevent the commission of a crime which, he foresaw, would arm public opinion
                    against the new order of things established in France.</p></note> But the
                    gensdarmes advanced so rapidly, that on the night of the 15th of March the
                    prince was seized in his bed, and hurried off to Strasburg. The tidings of his
                    capture were immediately conveyed to Paris by the telegraph, and through the
                    same channel orders were received on the morning of the 18tb, in consequence of
                    which the prisoner was rapidly transported to the castle of Vincennes, but
                    without traversing the capital. He reached Vincennes at nine o’clock in the
                    evening, much fatigued with his journey, and the same night was brought before a
                    military commission, specially appointed to try, or rather to condemn him.</p>
                <p>The charges brought against him were six in number; first, having borne arms
                    against the Republic; secondly, having offered his services to England, the
                    eternal enemy of France; thirdly, having received accredited agents of that
                    country, facilitated their correspondence in France, and conspired against the
                    internal and external safety of the state; fourthly, having placed himself at
                    the head of a corps of French emigrants in the pay of England, which had been
                    formed in the Brisgau and in Baden; fifthly, having maintained a correspondence
                    in Strasburg, with the intention of raising the adjoining departments, and
                    operating a diversion in favour of England; and, lastly, having entered into the
                    conspiracy formed by that power for the assassination of the first consul, and
                    held himself in readiness, in the event of success, to enter France with arms in
                    his hands. Interrogated on each of these heads, the prince made the best defence
                    which circumstances admitted of, oppressed as he was with fatigue, and exhausted
                    from want of food and rest; but, after a sham trial, which'lasted about three
                    hours, he was found guilty upon all the counts, and condemned, although not a
                    single document had been produced, nor a witness examined in evidence against
                    him. It is said that the commission which so summarily tried and convicted the
                    young prince, did so under the impression that the punishment of death would not
                    be inflicted; but if they entertained any such belief, the event speedily showed
                    that it was entirely groundless. The prince requested to see and speak with
                    Bonaparte, and begged that this request might be communicated to the first
                    consul. Savary, however, who had positive orders to see the judgment carried
                    into execution, refused to grant any indulgence; and at daybreak the prince was
                    conducted to the fosse of the château, where, beside a new-made grave, destined
                    to receive his remains, he was shot by a party of gensdarmes, and died with a
                    courage worthy of his race.</p>
                <p>Whatever excuse Napoleon may have had for seizing and detaining the Duke
                    d’Énghien as a hostage, he had none whatever for putting him to death; whilst
                    the circumstances attending this tragedy, the rapid journey, the nocturnal
                    trial, the shameful conviction without evidence, and the immediate execution of
                    the sentence, gave to it the character of a premeditated assassination. In this
                    light, accordingly, it was regarded throughout Europe, men of all parties
                    uniting in execrating the deed as a foul midnight murder, only rendered more
                    revolting by the mockery of justice with which it was accompanied. It has indeed
                    been said, that in accelerating the catastrophe, and condemning the prince
                    clandestinely by night, the fermentation which might have arisen had the
                    procedure been prolonged was avoided; and that the circumstances which had
                    created the necessity for a great example, also required that it should be
                    promptly made. But is die policy of him who seeks to profit by a crime, any
                    justification of the crime itself? or can mere expediency ever sanction a
                    proceeding by which justice is trampled on, and the door shut against mercy? It
                    is no doubt true that the life of the first consul was aimed at, and that the
                    principle of self-preservation warranted him to take some measures for his own
                    protection; but the law of self-defence requires of him who resorts to such a
                    plea, proof that he has not exceeded the <hi rend="italic">moderamen inculpata:
                    tutela,</hi> or, in other words, that the measures he had recourse to did not go
                    beyond the necessity of the occasion. Had Napoleon confined himself to the
                    seizure and detention of the prince as a hostage for his own safety, all Europe
                    would probably have thought that he was justifiable in taking such a precaution;
                    by acting as he did, he outraged the sentiments of justice and humanity, armed
                    public opinion against him, and exhibited himself to the world in the light of a
                    man capable of committing any crime, however dark and atrocious. Fouché was
                    right, therefore, in pronouncing the murder of the Duke d’Énghien, a great
                    political fault, which, in his estimation, was worse than a crime. Napoleon, in
                    a laboured defence of his own conduct, dictated many years afterwards,
                    endeavours to inculpate Savary, by charging him with precipitation; and affirms
                    that if die request of the prince for an interview had been communicated to him,
                    it would have been granted, and might have been followed by a remission of the
                    capital punishment. But is it to be believed that in a matter of so much
                    importance, a subaltern would have ventured to act as Savary did without
                    positive orders? or that having such, he would dare to disobey them? On this
                    point, indeed, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515670" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5670-0131"
                    />the vindication of Savary is complete; for, whatever may be thought generally
                    of the part which he acted in the affair, he has at least established this
                    point, that he merely obeyed his orders.</p>
                <p>The French government had early intimation of the sentiments with which this
                    crime was regarded in other countries. The emperor of Russia lost no time in
                    instructing his chargé d’affaires at Paris to notify that he had learned with
                    equal surprise and grief the event which had taken place at Ettenheim, the
                    circumstances which followed it, and its deplorable result; and that the
                    interest felt by his imperial majesty was the stronger, because he could in no
                    way reconcile the violation of the territory of Baden with those principles of
                    justice and humanity regarded as sacred by nations, and which alone protect
                    their mutual relations. The Russian minister, at the diet of Ratisbon, also
                    presented a note, in which he forcibly represented this violation of the Baden
                    territory as endangering the peace and security of every state in Germany.<note

                <p>Some time after this tragedy, Pichegru, who had been confined in the Temple since
                    the 28th February, was found strangled in his prison. The operation had been
                    performed by means of a faggot-stick inserted between the neck and the cravat,
                    so as to act like a tourniquet, or rather like what is commonly called a Spanish
                    windlass. Wright, an English captain, who had landed Cadoudal upon the coast of
                    Normandy, and had afterwards been taken prisoner, was also found with his throat
                    cut. The French government published all the details relative to both suicides;
                    but the recent catastrophe of the Duke d’Enghien had produced in all minds an
                    impression so unfavourable to Bonaparte, that, without proof, and even without
                    examination, the death of Pichegru, in particular, was at the first moment
                    imputed to him. But time has demonstrated the injustice of this imputation. The
                    circumstances of real evidence connected with the deed itself, the clear
                    interest of Napoleon to bring Pichegru to a public trial, as he afterwards did
                    Moreau, the situation of that unfortunate man himself, and, above all, the fact
                    that, even after the fall of Bonaparte, not a particle of evidence was
                    discovered to contradict the statement originally published by the government,
                    or to warrant so much as a suspicion of foul plav, all unite to prove that
                    Pichegru died by his own hand. What possible motive could the first consul have
                    to order this unhappy man to be privately assassinated? The evidence against him
                    was complete. His negotiations with the Bourbons could not be disavowed; the
                    agents of Louis XVIΠ. and of the English ministers, with whom he had
                    corresponded, were detained as prisoners in the Temple; and that correspondence
                    was about to be judicially authenticated by their respective depositions. Was it
                    not for the interest of the first consul, and of the government of which he was
                    the head, that all this should be clearly established in a court of justice, and
                    that the man who had associated himself with assassins should also be proved to
                    have been a traitor to his country? Buc Pichegru appears to have judged more
                    correctly of his position in the Temple, than those who preposterously attempted
                    to invest him with the honours of martyrdom. He saw himself undone without
                    resource, and being unable to endure the ignominy of ascending the scaffold with
                    brigands, chiefly known by their exploits on the highway, he put an end to his
                    existence. Georges Cadoudal, and several of his more guilty associates, were
                    soon afterwards brought to trial, condemned, and executed, without the slightest
                    manifestation of public feeling in their favour.</p>
                <p>The prosecution of Moreau commenced on the 10th of June. He was arraigned on a
                    law which declared the concealment of proclaimed conspirators an offence
                    punishable with six years’ imprisonment in fetters; and the specific fact
                    charged against him was the harbouring of Georges Cadoudal and his accomplices.
                    His conduct on this occasion fully justified the opinion which we have
                    previously pronounced as to his character. The public declared loudly in his
                    favour; but he did nothing corresponding to the great interest excited in his
                    behalf. Brave and decided on the field of battle, he constantly showed himself
                    timid, and sometimes pusillanimous, on the political arena; nature, in giving
                    him the bravery of the soldier, had denied him the courage of the citizen. He
                    must indeed have been conscious that he was deeply compromised; but, on the
                    other hand, never did a person accused find so many defenders in almost every
                    class of society. The enemies of Bonaparte, and they were numerous, loudly
                    expressed the interest with which Moreau had inspired them; a crowd of military
                    men, who had served under his orders, prepared to defend him by open force, nay,
                    even to rescue him from the tribunal; and the very gensdarmes appointed to guard
                    him turned towards him the hilts of their sabres in token of their readiness to
                    assist in his deliverance. But always feeble, and incapable of taking a decided
                    part, Moreau had recourse to supplications addressed to the first consul, to
                    whom, in a letter from his prison in the Temple, he presented the most humble
                    excuses, at the same time imploring the “bienveillance” of the head of the
                    government. Nor was his conduct less humiliating when brought before his judges.
                    The exigencies of his defence imposed upon him the dire necessity of denying the
                    statement which he had written to the Directory, and signed with his own hand,
                    that “the proofs of the treason of Pichegru were as clear as day, but that he
                    doubted whether they could be exhibited in a judicial form.” Accordingly, after
                    having repeatedly affirmed that “it was but too true that Pichegru had betrayed
                    the confidence of the whole nation,” he had now recourse to the most miserable
                    shifts in order to invalidate all the accusations which he had presented against
                    Pichegru, when the latter commanded the army of the Rhine and Moselle in 1795
                    and the beginning of 1796, as guilty of maintaining a correspondence with the
                    Prince of Condé and the enemies of the Republic. But the force of public opinion
                    had made itself felt even on the bench; and the recollection that he had gained
                    thirty battles for the Republic, and saved two armies, created an interest in
                    his favour which all his weakness and folly could not destroy. The culpability
                    of Moreau was evident, and Bonaparte required that he should be condemned to
                    death, or to some degrading punishment, intending, as is said, to have remitted
                    the sentence, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515683" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5683-0132"
                    />which would have effectually destroyed Moreau in public opinion. But in vain
                    did he attempt to seduce or intimidate the judges. Out of twelve, seven feared
                    not to resist ;* and by a sort of transaction between the government and public
                    opinion, Moreau was declared culpable, but excusable, and condemned to suffer
                    two years’ imprisonment, which was afterwards commuted into exile. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> Of forty-six others who were at the same time
                    arraigned, twenty were condemned to death, five to two years’ imprisonment, and
                    the rest acquitted, but not released. The Polignacs were spared at the
                    intercession of Josephine, and Madame Murat, afterwards queen of Naples.</p>
                <p>In the early part of this year a law was passed which decreed the re-union of the
                    civil laws in a single code, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Code
                    Civil</hi><hi rend="italic">des Français.</hi> The advantage which a country
                    derives from the establishment of uniform laws does not need to be proved; but,
                    to appreciate the full importance of this benefit to France, it is only
                    necessary to cast a glance at the state of the law under the old regime. It was
                    divided into two principal systems; that of written law, and that of the
                    countries governed by customs or common law. Both systems were subdivided into
                    an infinite number of branches. There were about three hundred general customs,
                    varying in the extent to which they prevailed; and these, again, were modified
                    by a multitude of local usages. The number of commentators was immense. France
                    was also governed by many other written institutions, such as ordonnances,
                    edicts, declarations of the sovereign, and arrêts of the parliaments; each
                    province, each diocese, each bailliage, each town, each corporation, had in fact
                    its own usages and its own jurisprudence. “Besides the forty thousand Roman
                    laws, of which some one is always cited at random,” says Voltaire, “we have five
                    hundred different customs, reckoning the small towns and burghs, which derogate
                    from the usages of the principal jurisdiction; so that a person travelling post
                    in France changes laws oftener than he changes horses, and an advocate who is
                    very learned in one city is no better than an ignoramus in that next adjoining.”
                    This description is notin any respect overcharged. Never in any other country
                    had chicanery and oppression so wide a field to expatiate in; never was there so
                    urgent a necessity for substituting, in the room of conflicting usages and
                    accumulated anomalies, a comprehensive and uniform system of laws.</p>
                <p>The failure of the royalist plot to overthrow the consular government, together
                    with the exposure of the follies committed by Drake and Smith, the English
                    residents at the courts of Munich and Stutgardt <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi>
                    materially contributed to advance the project which Napoleon had for some time
                    cherished of assuming the imperial purple. A despotism for life is an absurdity;
                    and besides it holds out a sort of premium for assassination. That the first
                    consul’s life had been aimed at, the infernal machine, and the conspiracy of
                    Pichegru and Georges, placed beyond all doubt; that similar attempts would be
                    repeated, as long as the hope remained that, by taking off a single individual,
                    a counter revolution would be effected, was indeed most probable. According to
                    the logic of the time, a necessity had arisen, not for abating the despotism,
                    but for placing it on a more solid and permanent foundation; or, in other words,
                    for declaring it hereditary in the person and family of the man who was already
                    invested with absolute power. Thus reasoned the partisans of Napoleon, and, in
                    their view of the question, correctly; because any thing was preferable to a
                    government which might at any given instant of time be overthrown. Measures were
                    therefore taken to effect the object which was now declared to be so necessary
                    to the safety and happiness of France. On the 30th of April a motion was made in
                    the Tribunate to confide the government of the Republic to an emperor, and to
                    declare the empire hereditary in the family of the first consul Napoleon
                    Bonaparte. This motion was made by an obscure member of the legislative chamber,
                    named Curée, who concluded his speech on the occasion by declaring that the
                    nation desired a chief as illustrious as its destiny. Ever since the 2d of
                    August 1802, when, by an organic senatus-consultum, the members of the Tribunate
                    were reduced to a hundred and fifty, Bonaparte had completely controlled the
                    deliberations of that body; indeed almost all the tribunes were either sold or
                    intimidated, and scarcely a shadow of representation remained. The proposition
                    to confer upon Bonaparte the title of emperor was therefore adopted by the
                    Tribunate; but the unanimity of that body was greatly troubled by the heroic
                    opposition of Carnot, who on this occasion expressed the most noble and generous
                    sentiments. “I voted," said he, “at the time against the consulate for life; I
                    shall in like manner vote now against the re-establishment of the monarchy in
                    France.” He contended that the government of a single individual was any thing
                    rather than a guarantee of stability and tranquillity. “The duration of the
                    Roman empire,” said he, “was not longer than that of the Republic would have
                    been; the intestine disorders were still greater, and crimes more multiplied;
                    republican high-mindedness, heroism, and all the masculine virtues, were
                    displaced to make room for the most ridiculous pride, the vilest adulation, the
                    most insatiable cupidity, and the most complete disregard of national
                    prosperity. What evil, pray, was remedied or obviated by declaring the
                    succession to the throne hereditary? Was not this in fact regarded as the
                    legitimate inheritance of the house of Augustus? Was not Domitian the son of
                    Vespasian, Caligula the son of Germanicus, Commodus the son of Marcus Aurelius
                    ?” He concluded a powerful address in the following words, the beauty and force
                    of which we shall not impair or enfeeble by any attempt at translation. “La
                    liberté fut-elle done montrée à Thomme pour qu'il ne pût jamais en jouir?
                    Fut-elle sans cesse offerte à ses voeux comme un fruit auquel il ne peut porter
                    la main sans être frappé de mort? Ainsi la nature, qui nous fait de cette
                    liberté un besoin si pressant, aurait voulu nous traiter en marâtre? Non, je ne
                    puis consentir à regarder ce bien si universellement préféré à tous les autres,
                    sans lequel tous les autres ne sont rien, comme one simple illusion; mon coeur
                    me dit que la liberté est possible, que le régime en est facile et plus, stable
                    qu'aucun gouvernement arbitraire, qu’aucune oligarchie.”</p>
                <p>The vote of the Tribunate was communicated to the Conservative Senate, which, on
                    the 4∙th of May, decreed, <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> These were, Clavier,

                    desired the condemnation of Moreau in order to pardon him, Clavier replied, “Et
                    qui nous la fera, à nous ř” who will pardon us?</p>
                <p>'&lt; After the sentence had been pronounced, every facility of escape was
                    afforded to Moreau; but, discovering the snare laid for him, he avoided it by
                    returning alone to the prison of the Temple. At length a compromise was entered
                    into, and, after having paid the whole expense of the prosecution, he retired
                    through 8pain to America. “En montrant un caractère moins indécis, moins
                    pusillanime,” says the Abbé de Montgaillard, “Moreau aurait trouvé de l’appui
                    dans le sénat, dans l’armée, dans la population de Paris, et même dans la
                    nation; mais son infirmité politique se montre ici tout entière. Il ne s'était
                    fait une idée positive de la part qu’il pouvait et devait prendre dans ces
                    grandes crises de Fructidor et de Brumaire; il ne sut se déterminer ni dans
                    l’une ni dans l’autre de ces circonstances; patriote sincère, ami de l’ordre, de
                    la justice, et de la liberté, il ne sent jamais que des velléités incohérentes

                    senators was also the minister of justice who, on the 20lh January, announced to
                    Louis XVI. the sentence of death. “Jamais empéreur de Rome,” says Montgaillard,
                    “ne dut le diadème à de plus vils affranchis; posé par de telles mains, il eût

                    shown themselves so eager to hasten the death of Louis XVI., were not iess so,
                    in 1804, to accelerate the enthronement of Napoleon Bonaparte.</p></note> “that
                    it is for the decided interest of the French people to confide the government of
                    the Republic to Napoleon Bonaparte as hereditary emperor and fourteen days
                    afterwards the same body, without waiting until the vain formality of obtaining
                    the sanction of the people had been gone through, passed another decree, in
                    which the first consul is styled “ £mperor of the French,” a title which,
                    according to the mover, “is only the expression of an authentic wish already
                    manifested by the nation.” It appears, however, that the people were not in any
                    shape consulted or referred to in the matter. For form’s sake, they had been
                    admitted to vote respecting the question of the consulate for life; but on the
                    present occasion the experiment was not repeated, however advantageous it might
                    have been to obtain at least a semblance of popular assent; and, what is not a
                    little remarkable, this fact is established by the conclusion of the very
                    discourse in which it is unblushingly affirmed that the assumption of the
                    imperial dignity by Napoleon is only the expression of an authentic wish <hi

                    4,</hi> If it is in the principles of our constitution," says Cambacérès, in
                    presenting the decree of the senate, “and already several examples have been
                    given, to submit to the sanction of the people the part of the decree which
                    concerns the establishment of an hereditary government, the senate nevertheless
                    conceives that it ought to supplicate your imperial majesty to consent that the
                    organic dispositions should immediately receive their execution; and, for the
                    glory as well as for the happiness of the Republic, it proclaims, <hi
                    rend="italic">on the instant even,</hi> Napoleon emperor of the French.” What,
                    then, becomes of the assertion, so often advanced, as if it could not be
                    contradicted, that “the wish of thirty millions of men had crowned the Emperor
                    Napoleon ?” By evidence the most conclusive it is here established that
                    Bonaparte was created emperor by the senate, consisting entirely of his own
                    creatures, and that the nation was not consulted or appealed to in the matter.
                    An organic senatus-consultum next declared the imperial dignity hereditary in
                    the direct, natural, and legitimate descendants of Napoleon, from male to male,
                    in the order of primogeniture, to the perpetual exclusion of women and their
                    descendants. It provided, however, that the emperor might adopt the children or
                    grandchildren of his brothers, if he had no male offspring himself at the moment
                    of adoption, and that the children who might thus be adopted should enter into
                    the direct line of descent, but could only be called to the succession after
                    legitimate and natural descendants. In default of an heir of Napoleon, the
                    imperial dignity was to devolve upon Joseph-Napoleon and his descendants, and,
                    failing the latter, upon Louis Bonaparte and his descendants. And thus expired
                    the French Republic, surnamed indivisible and imperishable by so many orators
                    and rhetoricians; and thus was monarchy re-established in France, with even
                    greater facility than it had been overthrown eleven years before. Having passed
                    through a course of representative government, they now hastened to submit to
                    the government of one man invested with despotic power; like the ancient slaves,
                    they voluntarily replaced themselves under the yoke which for a day they had
                    entertained the design of for ever shaking off.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Having assumed the title of emperor, which the obsequious senate had, by a sort
                    of improvisation, bestowed on him, Bonaparte lost no time in exercising the
                    powers belonging to his new dignity. On the 19th of May he created eighteen of
                    his generals marshals of the empire. This was an act of homage to the army, the
                    real basis of his power, and it was performed without even waiting until the
                    senate had taken the oath of allegiance, which it did on the 27th. Addresses now
                    flowed in from all parts of the hundred and eight departments into which the
                    territory of the imperial republic was divided. The authorities, the
                    functionaries, the magistracy, and the army, all brought to the foot of the
                    throne assurances of the most profound devotion. Harassed with the convulsions
                    of a long anarchy, the people now invoked the repose of servitude. The despotism
                    of one man seemed to them a small evil compared with the tyranny of the
                    factions. Of this disposition Napoleon took full advantage, and, accordingly,
                    spent the remainder of the year in employing every means to get his new dignity
                    confirmed and sanctioned both at home and abroad. The fact of his assumption of
                    the imperial dignity was formally announced to all the states of Europe, Britain
                    alone excepted, and negotiations were at the same time opened with a view to
                    obtain its recognition. Austria was the first to acknowledge the new emperor of
                    the Gauls; and the opportunity was even chosen by her sovereign for modifying
                    his own title, to which he now added that of hereditary emperor of Austria. But
                    the other powers either hesitated or delayed. The army, however, formed the true
                    basis of Napoleon’s power, and their sanction was essential to its stability. To
                    obtain this with suitable eclat, he visited Boulogne in the course of the
                    summer, and, soon after his arrival in the camp, ordered a grand review, during
                    which he distributed to the military crosses of the Legion of Honour, which,
                    created by the law of the 19th May 1802, had been solemnly inaugurated at Paris
                    a short time before (14th July). Here, on the I6th of August, seated on a
                    temporary throne in the midst of his numerous hosts, with the shores of England
                    and its fleets before him, he received, as it were in presence of the enemy, the
                    exulting acclamations with which the troops answered his claim to empire, and
                    seemed, like another Clovis, raised on their bucklers, to be the founder of a
                    new dynasty in France. From Boulogne Napoleon hurried to Aix-la-Chapelle, the
                    ancient capital of Charlemagne, where the acknowledgment of his new dignity by
                    the Emperor Francis II. awaited his arrival. Lastly, on the 1st of December, the
                    Conservative Senate presented to him the plebiscitum, as it was called, which
                    recognised the imperial dignity as hereditary in his family.</p>
                <p>That nothing might be wanting, the church was required to give her formal
                    sanction to the new dynasty. The Gallican clergy had already signalised their
                    zeal by proclaiming Napoleon emperor, and in their discourses styling him <pb

                    indulged on the occasion referred to reflects eternal disgrace, if not on their

                    with which they endeavoured to regale the nostrils of Napoleon: “Le Dieu des
                    dieux,” said Cardinal Cambacérès, “et des rois, avait donné, et il avait repris;
                    il n’a pas rendu, mais il a donné de nouveau, comme il avait donné le trône de
                    Clovis à Charlemagne, et le trône de celui-ci à Saint-Louis...L’homme de la
                    religion trouvera nos maximes dans l’Evangile.” “Un dieu et un monarque,” said
                    the Archbishop of Turin, “comme le Dieu des Chrétiens est le seul digne d’être
                    adoré et obéi; vous f Napoleon) êtes le seul homme digne de commander aux
                    Français. Par-là cesseront toutes abstractions philosophiques, tout dépècement
                    du pouvoir.” “Qu’elle est grande,” cried another dignitary, “qu’elle est
                    admirable, cette divine sagesse qui établit les empires. Napoléon, que Dieu
                    appella des deserts d’Egypte, comme un autre Moise...Donnons pour garant de
                    notre fidélité à César, notre fidélité à Dieu...Ne cessons de le dire, le doigt

                    par lui pour protéger le bien et punir le mal, parce que tel est l’ordre de la
                    Providence.” It would be at once curious and instructive to compare this with
                    the language held after the events of 1814, by some of the very men who thus
                    profaned holy writ in order to offer incense to the Jacobin emperor.</p></note>
                    In success they discovered divine right as well as legitimacy, and proclaimed
                    the finger of God as the agent of his elevation. Nor was the successor of St
                    Peter, and the vicar of God upon earth, less accommodating than the members of
                    the Gallican church. At the command of Napoleon, his holiness made a journey to
                    Paris, in order to place the crown on the head of the new Charlemagne, who had
                    despoiled the church of the very possessions which had been bestowed on her by
                    the pious emperor of the Franks. The sovereign pontiff who thus obsequiously
                    consented to consecrate military usurpation, was no other than that Bishop of
                    Imola who, in December 1797, exhorted his flock to follow the traces of the
                    democratic revolution of France; but if the hearts of men are in the hand of the
                    Most High, infallibility is of course an attribute of the papal tiara. The
                    ceremony of the coronation took place in the church of Nôtre Dame on the second
                    of December; and no labour or expense had been spared to give splendour and
                    magnificence to the spectacle. But notwithstanding all the pomp and luxury
                    displayed, few acclamations greeted the emperor on his way to Nôtre Dame, and
                    still fewer awaited him on his return. No man said God bless him. The people
                    generally remained passive and silent. During the ceremonial, Napoleon,
                    impatient of its slow march, seized the crown, which he placed on his own head,
                    and next he also crowned the Empress Josephine. The holy father then performed
                    the triple unction on the head and the two hands, after which he recited the
                    following strange formula of consecration: “Almighty and eternal God, who hast
                    established Ĳazaël to govern Syria, and Jehu king of the Jews, in manifesting to
                    them thy will by the organ of the prophet Elias; who hast equally shed the holy
                    unction of the kings on the head of Saul and of David by the ministry of the
                    prophet Samuel; shed, by my hands, the treasures of thy grace and of thy
                    benediction on thy servant Napoleon, whom, notwithstanding our personal
                    unworthiness, we do this day consecrate emperor in thy name.” This formula
                    explicitly announces the doctrine of divine right, a doctrine borrowed from the
                    constitution of the Hebrews, and introduced into Europe at a period of the
                    grossest ignorance, under the feeble Carlovingians, when the priesthood
                    established the absolute power of kings over their people, and the absolute
                    power of the pope over kings.</p>
                <p>The man who had thus gathered up out of the wrecks of the Revolution the
                    fragments of the sovereignty which it had broken to pieces, and with these
                    materials, aided by his own genius, constructed a new empire in France, was,
                    considering his character in its various aspects, the most extraordinary
                    personage that any age or country has ever produced. Gifted by nature with all
                    the general and efficient elements of greatness, but possessing few or none of
                    those peculiarities which sometimes mar and sometimes adorn it, his powers
                    differed from those of ordinary men not so much in kind, perhaps, as in degree.
                    Great good sense, intuitive quickness, unquenchable energy, severe judgment,
                    untiring perseverance; such were the general attributes of his mind, to which
                    circumstances afforded full opportunities of development. He was not one of
                    those men born to struggle against events, or to create occasions for the
                    display of his own powers, and for the gratification of an aspiring ambition. He
                    never anticipated the course of events, nor ventured forward until every
                    accessory had been prepared, until all was ripe for consummation. His mind was
                    essentially practical, and his supreme excellence consisted in a just
                    appreciation of the true character of evente, united with unexampled promptitude
                    in availing himself of the favours of fortune, and in turning every propitious
                    circumstance to the utmost possible advantage. But his energy was active, not
                    passive; with the current of events in his favour, his audacity was boundless;
                    when the tide turned against him, he evinced but little fortitude; in prosperity
                    he seemed like a god, governing all things at his pleasure; in adversity he
                    pined like a southern exotic under a northern sky. He was not fitted by nature
                    to play the part either of Caesar or of Cromwell, and he would never have
                    descended to that of Catiline. He was in truth but a bad conspirator; for, as we
                    have already seen, the revolution of the 18th and 19th of Brumaire was effected,
                    in spite of his blunders and hesitation, by the firmness and intrepidity of his
                    brother Lucien. Further, Napoleon was endowed with great and commanding
                    intellect, but not with strong passions; he neither loved nor sympathised with
                    freedom; and even his ambition seems to have been after-thought begotten of
                    events. A little before the 13th of Vendémiaire, when accident first brought him
                    into notice, his views were limited to the purchase of a country-house and farm,
                    but not of confiscated property, so unstable did he then consider the
                    Revolution. But he had that restless spirit, that craving activity, and that
                    innate consciousness of intellectual power, out of which ambition springs. He
                    was not without enthusiasm of a certain kind; but it never approached the
                    generous warmth of inspiration, or betrayed him into any sallies which his
                    judgment condemned; and hence his compositions and addressee, though full of
                    force and vigour, are deformed by exaggeration, and devoid of natural feeling,
                    the essential element of true eloquence. But the absence of passion and
                    enthusiasm implies selfishness in the highest degree; and this again naturally
                    produces the most depreciatory judgments of mankind. The character of Napoleon
                    was deformed by both these vices in an eminent degree. Himself, his greatness,
                    and that of France through him, became, if not a passion, at least the
                    substitute for one; and, mistrustful of all pretensions to public virtue or
                    disinterestedness, he regarded mankind as all governed by their immediate
                    interests, and as ready to serve any cause by which these might be advanced.
                    From this nullity of feeling, and strength of intellect, flowed the virtues and
                    vices of the man. He was neither im. posed on by the cant of the Revolution, nor
                    in the slightest<pb break="no" facs="nls:193515722" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5722-0135"
                    /> degree tinged with its fanaticism. Indebted for his promotion to the
                    democracy, he adopted that side which threw command open to talents; he espoused
                    the cause of the Revolution, and rendered it triumphant; but he imbibed none of
                    its passions or prejudices against either the aristocracy or the clergy, both of
                    whom he spared and even protected. He was not by nature cruel or implacable; but
                    the supreme command of armies, and the habitual spectacle of fields of battle,
                    had inspired him with a contempt of human life, and a disregard for destroying
                    it. Ĳe had no immoral tendencies; but as he had derived from education no
                    principle of religion, or, at least, as the Revolution annihilated any he might
                    have originally imbibed, he was left free to adopt those untempered maxims of
                    expediency, according to which prudence becomes the only regulating principle of
                    human actions. Nor does he seem to have cherished any nice sentiment of honour,
                    or in general to have possessed those habits and manners which are
                    characteristic of a gentleman. The one would have inspired him with a respect
                    for truth, and prevented an imperial bulletin from becoming synonymous with
                    falsehood; and the other would have preserved him from that habitual rudeness,
                    which at length left around him, not devoted servants, but servile instruments,
                    alike incapable of delaying aguilty order or of hastening a generous one. As to
                    war, Napoleon always found it made to his hand; if his system provoked it, which
                    it unquestionably did, this never entered into his calculation, and he could not
                    imagine why Austria, Britain, or any other power, should affect to feel any
                    alarm at his aggrandisement. He had come in place of the Revolution; he was at
                    once the representative and the guardian of all the interests and changes which
                    it had created or effected; and yet, though but a Jacobin enthroned, he resented
                    as an indignity and an insult the mistrust evinced by those very powers which
                    had previously combined to crush the Revolution of which he was the
                    representative. This was no doubt the grand misfortune of his position. He could
                    not stand still, much less recede. His system was essentially of a progressive
                    and an encroaching character; his policy was from necessity arbitrary and
                    menacing. Wars followed; coalition after coalition was formed and destroyed; and
                    whilstFrance only assumed the offensive in order to anticipate enemies which
                    were preparing to strike her, victory attended her standards. But the very
                    fruits of success, which no man knew so well as Napoleon how to gather up, soon
                    accumulated to such a degree, that a further extension of his authority became
                    inevitable. The obstinate hostility of England, which he endeavoured to overcome
                    by means of what he chose to denominate the continental system, involved him in
                    the Russian expedition, in which he assumed a directly aggressive character; and
                    the consequences were unheard-of disasters and defeats. The elements warred
                    against him, and in the snows of Russia were buried those formidable legions
                    which had so often marched to victory. The tide of events now turned; and in the
                    violence of the reflux Napoleon was, after a brief struggle, overthrown. When he
                    crossed the Niemen to invade Russia, he had reached the culminating point of his
                    destiny; when he recrossed that stream, the nations of Europe were already freed
                    from his grasp. But though unable to control events, Napoleon was eminently
                    calculated to rule over masses of men. If he deprived them of liberty, he at
                    least secured to them equality; in all departments a boundless field was opened
                    by him to talent and enterprise; and in pursuing his own schemes of greatness,
                    he conferred the most substantial and enduring benefits on the nation which he
                    governed. His was essentially a popular despotism; one which rested not on the
                    narrow basis of castes, but leaned on the general mass. Yet his power, though it
                    extended widely over the land, did not strike downwards, but, spreading its
                    roots horizontally and superficially through the soil, wanted that firm hold
                    which alone could have enabled it to resist the fury of the adverse blasts to
                    which it was exposed.</p>
                <p>The events of 1804 prepared the way for a new coalition against France. The
                    breach with Russia, resulting' ostensibly from the seizure and execution of the
                    Duke d’Enghien, had accomplished the first wish of Great Bri-∣ tain, which was
                    to find a continental ally. Menaced with invasion, the mere threat of which,
                    independently of any danger to be apprehended, was an evil, because an insult,
                    that power, acting upon the most obvious principles of policy, naturally sought
                    to find employment on the Continent for the legions which frowned defiance on
                    the opposite shores of the Channel; and a prospect of accomplishing this object
                    was unexpectedly opened in consequence of the event to which we have alluded.
                    But this prospect was for a time overclouded by an unjustifiable aggression on
                    the part of Britain. Spain had for several years been in close alliance with
                    France, which she secretly aided with subsidies; yet the English government,
                    though fully aware of the circumstance, pretended not to observe it, and had
                    hitherto respected Spain as a neutral power. This policy, however, which, in the
                    circumstances, was not less wise than cautious, the English ministry suddenly
                    abandoned, and, by a most unjustifiable act of aggression, threw Spain into the
                    arms of France. Without any declaration of war, or the least indication of a
                    change in the system which had hitherto been pursued by England, several Spanish
                    vessels, returning laden with treasure, were attacked by a superior force, and
                    after a sharp action captured. This proceeding, stamped with all the characters
                    of violence and treachery, was immediately followed by a declaration of war on
                    the part of the Spanish government; and from this time Britain had not only to
                    contend with the fleets of France and Spain united, but, in consequence of the
                    gigantic schemes of Napoleon, became seriously exposed to all the perils and
                    miseries of an invasion.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, as the clouds of hostility were gathering around him, Napoleon
                    addressed a letter directly to the king of Great Britain ( 14th January),
                    containing overtures of a peace. “1 attach no dishonour,” said he, “to making
                    the first advance. I have, I think, sufficiently proved to the world that I do
                    not dread any of the chances of war. Peace is the wish of my heart. I conjure
                    your majesty not to deny yourself the satisfaction of giving it to the world. A
                    coalition will never have any effect but to increase the continental
                    preponderance and grandeur of France.” In any view, this was a politic
                    proceeding. It served to conciliate public opinion in France, to throw upon
                    England the odium of persisting in embroiling the Continent, to mask his real
                    designs, and at the same time to parade his dignity by treating on a footing of
                    equality with the proudest and most powerful monarch in the world. The reply of
                    the English ministry was cold and repulsive. “His majesty is persuaded,” said
                    they in their reply addressed to Μ. Talleyrand, “that the object of peace can
                    only be obtained by engagements calculated to provide for the future safety and
                    tranquillity of Europe, and to prevent the recurrence of the dangers and
                    misfortunes in which it has been involved. His majesty, therefore, feels that it
                    is impossible for him to reply more particularly to the overture which has been
                    made to him, until he has had time to communicate with the powers of the
                    Continent.” Both parties were equally insincere. Britain desired to abide by the
                    fortunes of a third coalition; Napoleon pursued his schemes of aggrandisement,
                    and on the 18th of March announced to the senate that be had accepted the crown
                    of Italy, in conformity, as he said, with the wishes manifested by the Italian
                    Republic. At Milan, where be was <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515735"

                    title of president of the Cisalpine Republic for that of king oſltaly, and
                    placed upon his head the iron crown<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This crown is called iron, from a nail of the true cross,

                    acclamations of a people charmed with the idea of a kingdom of Italy. This was
                    followed by an act of a still more unequivocal character, namely, the
                    incorporation of Genoa, lately the Ligurian Republic, with the French empire; a
                    measure certain to alarm Austria, and to furnish Great Britain and Russia with a
                    new and powerful argument for inducing that power to join the coalition against
                    France.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Napoieon’s
                    object in seizing Genoa is announced in one of his letters to Lebrun, who had
                    been appointed governor, and endeavoured, as far as possible, to mitigate the
                    rigour of his stem orders. “In uniting Genoa to the empire, I was induced
                    neither by the revenue, nor by the land forces she might contribute. I had but
                    one object in view, viz. fifteen thousand seamen. It is, then, going against the
                    very spirit of my orders to be lenient or backward in levying and raising this
                    force. You are too mild, too merciful. How can you govern people without
                    discontenting them? what would you do if you were charged with forcing the
                    conscripts of a couple of French departments to march to the army? I tell you
                    that, in matters of government, justice means force as well as virtue. <hi

                    seamen. Govern hut to collect seamen; dream but of them. Say what you will from
                    me, but say that I will have seamen.” The reason of this extreme urgency will
                    immediately appear. As to the detestable maxim, that justice means force, it
                    might with truth be converted into a general motto for the history of Napoleon’s
                    reign, with him the amount of force was ever the measure of justice and
                    virtue.</p></note> i Many persons have thought, and some gravely maintained,
                    that Napoleon was not serious in his menace of invading England. But the
                    contrary has been proved by the most incontrovertible evidence. He was well
                    aware, however, that without obtaining at least a temporary superiority of naval
                    force, such a project would be impracticable; and accordingly all his efforts
                    had, for some time past, been directed towards the accomplishment of this
                    preliminary object. His plan was to distract the attention of England, by
                    sending a powerful fleet to the West Indies, which, after threatening her
                    possessions in that quarter, should suddenly return to Europe, effect a junction
                    with the Spanish fleet, then disengage the squadron blockaded in Brest, and
                    having rallied under its flag ships from other ports, enter the Channel with an
                    overwhelming force of nearly sixty sail of the line. This project was admirably
                    conceived, and most skilfully combined; and if the execution had at all
                    corresponded with the design, or if Villeneuve had obeyed his orders, or if,
                    even after his indecisive action with Sir Robert Calder, he had made sail for
                    Brest, instead of going into Cadiz in the face of reiterated instructions,
                    enforced even with menaces, it would beyond all doubt have succeeded. In this
                    splendid conception, almost every contingency had been taken into the
                    calculation, except the obstinate and infatuated disobedience of the admiral,
                    which allowed England time to collect ner means, and enabled Nelson to
                    annihilate, by one decisive blow, the navies of both France and Spain. On this
                    occasion fortune was on the side of England, which was saved from imminent
                    peril, perhaps from a great national calamity, by a degree of infatuation in the
                    commander of the combined fleets, far beyond all ordinary experience or
                    reasonable calculation. If, after his action with Sir Robert Calder, Villeneuve
                    had proceeded to Brest, according to his peremptory instructions, his force
                    would have at once been increased to forty-five sail of the line, which, with
                    the Rochefort squadron, the junction of which he could then calculate on, would
                    have enabled him to enter the Channel with at least fifty sail of the line; a
                    force amply sufficient to secure to France for the time the naval superiority
                    required. And, in such an event, what would most probably have followed? The
                    troops were in hand, almost on the very beach; the flotilla was kept in
                    readiness to put to sea at a moment’s notice; and in ten hours a hundred and
                    fifty thousand men, with material and ammunition, might have been on their way
                    to the opposite coast.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Bourrienne reports a conversation which he had with Napoleon on this subject,
                    and in which the latter is made to say, “Those who believe in the seriousness of
                    my menace of invasion are fools. They do not see the thing in its true light. I
                    can without doubt disembark in England with a hundred thousand men, fight a
                    great battle, win it; but I must reckon on thirty thousand killed, wounded, or
                    prisoners. If I march upon London, a second battle awaits me; suppose me again
                    successful, what am I to do in London, with an army diminished by three fourths,
                    without hope of reinforcements? It would be madness, without naval superiority,
                    such a project is impracticable.” This merely shows either that Bourrienne did
                    not understand the nature of the communication made to him, or that it suited
                    the views of Napoleon to conceal his real intentions from the inquisitive
                    secretary. That the menace was “serious” as long as a hope remained of
                    obtaining, by the means already described, a superiority of naval force in the
                    Channel, is proved beyond all doubt by the documents which General Dumas has
                    inserted in the Appendix to his seventeenth volume, above referred to; and it
                    seems equally certain that, if villeneuve had obeyed his orders, the experiment,
                    with all its attendant hazards, would have been tried.</p></note> But providence
                    willed it otherwise.</p>
                <p>Whilst Napoleon was thus menacing England with invasion from the heights of
                    Boulogne, his looks were at the same time anxiously directed towards the east
                    and north of Europe. He was by no means ignorant of the coalition which was
                    forming against him; but as the position which he at present occupied enabled
                    him at once to threaten England and observe Austria, he waited for the
                    development of events in order to judge whether he should attack the former upon
                    her own soil, or strike a blow at her in Germany. Prepared for instant
                    operations, his principal object was to suffer the continental powers to
                    anticipate him in declaring war, and then in turn to anticipate them, by
                    promptly assuming the offensive, dashing into the very heart of Germany,
                    overpowering Austria before she had time to concentrate her means of resistance,
                    and thus destroying the coalition by, as it were, cutting off its head. And this
                    plan, based on the most accurate prescience of events, was that which he
                    ultimately carried into execution with the most astounding success. On the 8th
                    of April a treaty of alliance was concluded at St Petersburg, between Great
                    Britain and Russia, in which the contracting powers engaged to employ the most
                    prompt and effectual means to form in Europe a general league, capable of
                    constraining the government of France to consent to the reestablishment of
                    peace, and of the equilibrium of power: and to attain this object, the force to
                    be employed was fixed at five hundred thousand effective men, exclusively of the
                    succours to be furnished by England. The special objects of the league were, the
                    evacuation of Hanover and of Germany; the independence of Holland and of
                    Switzerland; the re-establishment of the king of Sardinia in Piedmont, with a
                    considerable extension of territory; the security of the kingdom of Naples; and
                    the entire evacuation of Italy by the French. Sweden, having already de∙ cided
                    against France, acceded to these stipulations. Prussia approved of their spirit,
                    but temporised; and finally resolved to persevere in that neutrality by which
                    she had already profited so much. Austria, anxious to redeem her defeats, and
                    regain her ascendency in Italy, formally <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515748"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-5748-0137"/>acceded to the treaty of St Petersburg (on the 9th
                    of August), notwithstanding the strenuous opposition of the Archduke Charles,
                    who, foreseeing the peril, earnestly counselled peace. She engaged not to lay
                    down arms except with the consent of her allies, and was to receive from England
                    a subsidy of three millions sterling during the current year, 1805, and of four
                    millions during each of the following years. These negotiations did not long
                    remain a secret from Napoleon, who had anxiously watched the gathering storm;
                    and scarcely had Austria acceded to the third continental coalition, when the
                    French army, assembled upon the shores of the Channel, was in full march towards
                    the Rhine. Bavaria had previously been secured by a promise of territorial
                    aggrandisement; the Russians were still in Gallicia; and Austria, as the
                    Archduke Charles had foreseen, was thus left to contend single-handed with the
                    whole power of France. In these circumstances Austria pushed forward her troops,
                    and peremptorily demanded that the elector of Bavaria should abandon the
                    alliance of France, and unite with her in maintaining the independence of
                    Germany. The elector temporised, pleaded his engagements, gained time, and
                    succeeded in drawing off his army. The Austrians then occupied Munich, thereby
                    committing the very act of aggression which Napoleon expected and required.</p>
                <p>The great object which the English ministry had in view in forming a new
                    coalition against France cannot be mistaken. But in thus precipitating Austria
                    into hostilities before her allies had time to come to her assistance, in order
                    to remove the French army from Boulogne, Pitt played into the hands of the very
                    enemy whom he was so desirous to humble. From the cause already stated, namely,
                    the failure of Napoleon’s maritime combinations, through the incapacity of his
                    naval commanders, a descent upon England had become impossible, and the danger,
                    before so imminent, had by this time entirely ceased. It was already certain
                    that France could not obtain even a temporary superiority of naval force in the
                    Channel, without which such an attempt would have been worse than madness. To
                    obviate a danger, therefore, which no longer existed, Pitt recklessly sacrificed
                    the principal ally of England, contributed to extend and consolidate the
                    colossal power of Napoleon, and enabled him to impose on Germany those fetters
                    which it afterwards cost so much blood and treasure to shake off. The blunder of
                    the English minister was indeed gigantic, and no wonder it cost him his life. He
                    fell into the very snare which had been so skilfully laid for him; and by this
                    fatal error placed Europe at the feet of the man for whom he may with truth be
                    said to have paved the way to victory. Nor was the conduct of the campaign
                    itself in any respect unworthy of the blind and infatuated policy which had
                    hurried on the contest.</p>
                <p>The Archduke Charles, finding his pacific counsels disregarded, had resigned the
                    presidency of the war department, and refused to assume the general direction of
                    a war which, he foresaw, would be attended with ruin to his house. The command
                    of the Austrian army, therefore, was in an evil hour intrusted to General Mack,
                    who, it is said, had been recommended by the English government; a mere pedantic
                    tactician, without genius or energy, who, a few years previous to this, had
                    failed to defend Rome with a numerous army, against General Championnet with
                    only a few thousand troops; and who, though a tolerable staff-officer, was
                    wholly unequal to the difficult and responsible situation in which he had been
                    placed. Of this total incapacity he gave early and lamentable proofs. Conceiving
                    that Napoleon must necessarily advance by the same road which had formerly been
                    made choice of by Moreau, he took post at Ulm, and there awaited the approach of
                    the enemy. The French emperor, however, had very different views. His
                    preparations had been made with such rare ability, and the plan of the campaign
                    so well digested beforehand, that towards the end of September the French grand
                    army had arrived on the right bank of the Rhine. It was divided into seven
                    corps, with a grand reserve of cavalry. The first corps was commanded by
                    Bernadotte, the second by Marmont, the third by Davoust, the fourth by Soult,
                    the fifth by Lannes, the sixth by Ney, the seventh by Augereau, and the cavalry
                    by Murat, who had under his orders Nansouty, D'Hautpoul, Klein, Beaumont, and
                    Welcher. Napoleon entered Germany at the head of about a hundred and sixty
                    thousand men, including his guard.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Massena, at the same time, assumed the command of sixty
                    thousand men assembled in the north of Italy, and advanced towards the Adige,
                    where, being reinforced by twenty thousand troops, who, under the conduct of
                    Gouvion-Saint-Cyr, had evacuated the king, dom of Naples, he found himself in a
                    condition to contend with the Archduke Charles, and prevent him from operating,
                    through the debouches of the Tyrol, on the flank of the grand army. Three corps
                    d’armée, intended as a reserve, were also assembled al Bou. logne, Mayence, and
                    btrasburg, and three tlvim.' camps of grenadiers were marked out at Hennes, in
                    La Vendée, and at Marengo.</p></note> By the 6th of October Bernadotte and the
                    Bavarians occupied Weissemburg, twelve leagues south of Nuremberg; Marmont was
                    in the vicinity of Neuburg; Davoust was at Oettingen, eight leagues north of
                    Donawerth; Soult was at Donawerth; Ney was at Kenssingen, three leagues west of
                    Donawerth; Lannes was at Neeresheim, two leagues northnorth-west of Donawerth;
                    and Murat with his cavalry was on the borders of the Danube. In thus placing
                    himself in rear of the enemy, Napoleon accomplished two grand objects; he
                    avoided exposing his flank to the debouches of the Tyrol; and by the rapidity of
                    his march he had completely disconcerted the plans of the Austrians, whilst, by
                    turning towards the north, he might cutoff the Russians who were advancing from
                    Gallicia towards the Danube. But in order td operate a prompt re-union of all
                    his columns, it was necessary that Bernadotte, setting out from Hanover, and
                    Marmont from Holland, should traverse the country of Anspach, belonging to
                    Prussia. Napoleon had secured the neutrality of that power by the corruption of
                    the Prussian ministry. But this violation of its territory wounded the self-love
                    of the sovereign, as well as the pride of several distinguished military men,
                    who, desiring to see an end put to the humiliation of their country, loudly
                    demanded war against France. The indignation inspired by this insult had more
                    effect on the cabinet of Berlin than all the efforts of England and Russia; and
                    Prussia, when it was too late, renounced the neutrality which she had observed
                    ever since the peace of Bale, 5th April 1795, to engage single-handed in a
                    contest with France.</p>
                <p>The contest in Germany now advanced, with singular rapidity, towards a crisis. On
                    the 8th of October a combat took place at Wertengen, four leagues south-west of
                    Donawerth, in which Murat, supported by Lannes, enveloped an Austrian division,
                    making a great number of prisoners. On the 9th the Archduke Ferdinand was
                    defeated by Ney at Guntburg, six leagues east of Ulm, with considerable loss;
                    and the same day Soult occupied Augsburg. On the 12th Bernadotte occupied
                    Munich; and on the 14th Memmingen, a considerable place on the Iller,
                    surrendered by capitulation to Soult, when four thousand Austrians were made
                    prisoners. The same day a combat took place at Elchingen, two leagues north-east
                    of Ulm, in which Ney signalized himself by the most chivalrous<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193515761" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5761-0138"/> bravery. Three thousand
                    Austrians were made prisoners. It had become necessary to obtain possession of
                    the bridge and position at Elchingen, in order to isolate on the left bank of
                    the Danube the mass of the Austrian army confined in Ulm. The bridge and the
                    position, defended by six thousand men with four pieces of artillery, were twice
                    carried by the bayonet, and as often recovered; but a third onset, made with the
                    greatest impetuosity under Ney in person, proved successful. On the 15th the
                    head of the first Russian column arrived on the Inn. The corps of Bernadotte was
                    then in position between that river and Munich. At the combat of Langenau, three
                    leagues north-east from Ulm, Murat, on the 16tb, came up with the division of
                    Werneck, which had escaped from Ulm, and made three thousand prisoners.</p>
                <p>Thus, by the direction given to his army after the passage of the Rhine, and by
                    the rapidity of his marches, Napoleon had, as it were, overwhelmed the
                    Austrians, and reduced all their offensive plans to a defensive without method.
                    Mack at Ulm was placed in nearly the same situation in which Melas had found
                    himself before the battle of Marengo. Both had their retreat cut off; but Melas
                    tried to break through the enemy in his rear, and had succeeded in his object,
                    when an accident deprived him of the reward of his resolution; whilst Mack,
                    closely invested in Ulm and its immediate vicinity, made no effort to force his
                    way with his masses united, although continual rains favoured such an attempt,
                    but preferred risking the escape of his divisions separately. Thus the Archduke
                    Ferdinand, nominally general-in-chief, but placed under the tutelage of Mack,
                    had left Ulm with part of the cavalry; whilst Mack, who had the title of
                    quarter-master-general, still remained there. As already stated, he was the same
                    person who, in the campaign of Naples, had lost his reputation as a tactician,
                    without displaying any talents for execution; and who, on the 23d January 1799,
                    had surrendered himself prisoner to General Championnet. His situation had now
                    become desperate. The French occupied all the surrounding heights, and he had
                    nothing left but to capitulate. General Segur, sent to demand his submission,
                    found every thing in disorder, and the brain of Mack in a state entirely
                    corresponding. This poor man had no clear idea of the state of things until the
                    French themselves informed him; and he did not even know that Napoleon was his
                    antagonist. He began by demanding eight days’ truce, or death, and concluded by
                    immediately capitulating. Ulm, with all its magazines and artillery, was
                    surrendered to the French; and thirty thousand combatants became prisoners of
                    war. The officers, including sixteen generals, were discharged on their parole;
                    the sub-officers and soldiers were conducted into France. In less than fifteen
                    days, the Austrians had lost above fifty thousand prisoners, two hundred pieces
                    of cannon, many thousand horses, with about eighty colours and other trophies,
                    and were now forced to shelter themselves behind the Inn. Never was triumph more
                    rapid or more complete. The surrender of Ulm took place on the 20th October, and
                    on the 21st was fought the battle of Trafalgar, in which Lord Nelson annihilated
                    the combined fleets of France and Spain, and by the results of that glorious day
                    counterbalanced to England the advantages which Napoleon had just reaped in
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>But the disasters which Austria had sustained at Ulm ≡ might have been repaired,
                    and the fortune of the war changed, if Prussia, otherwise so well disposed
                    towards the coalition, had even now struck in. By her hesitating and (as the
                    result proved) ruinous policy, a heavy blow had fallen on Austria; but there was
                    still time to check the advance of the French, and even to reduce them to the
                    necessity of acting on the defensive. On the 25th of October an interview took
                    place at Berlin, between the Emperor Alexander and Frederick-William III., and,
                    at the tomb of Frederick II., these two sovereigns promised to unite their
                    efforts to restrain the ambition of Napoleon. But this political and sentimental
                    farce ended in nothing. The favourable moment thus allowed to escape could not
                    be recalled; the king of Prussia was ere long at the feet of Napoleon; and the
                    emperor of all the Russias became the friend of the man who had granted him his
                    life upon the field of battle. Very different indeed was the course pursued by
                    the French emperor. After reconducting his ally, the elector of Bavaria, to his
                    capital, Napoleon advanced into the heart of the Austrian states, whilst his
                    lieutenants continued to drive all before them. On the 1st of October he had
                    crossed the Rhine; on the 20th Mack and his army were prisoners; and on the 15th
                    of November he made his public entry into Vienna, which had capitulated on the
                    13th. The Austrian court and army had retired into Moravia; but in evacuating
                    the capital they had neglected to break down the great bridge on the Danube, of
                    which Lannes, by an act of unexampled audacity, now made himself master. The
                    Emperor Francis had hoped that the Russians would arrive in time to act on the
                    right bank of the Danube, and thus save his capital from occupation; but in this
                    he was disappointed. The first Russian army under Kutusof having advanced higher
                    up the Danube than Vienna, immediately fell back towards Brunn on receiving
                    intelligence of the occupation of the capital. Justly apprehensive of having his
                    communications with the second army intercepted, which in fact was the aim of
                    Napoleon, the Russian commander felt himself compelled to execute this
                    retrograde movement, which he did with all possible celerity. But being warmly
                    pursued beyond Vienna, and attacked in the midst of his movement by Murat with
                    the French cavalry, he proposed an armistice, with the sole view of gaining time
                    to receive the reinforcements which were advancing from Upper Moravia, and to
                    secure his retreat. Murat, who was already at Hollabrunn, fell into the snare,
                    and accepted the artful propositions of the Russian commander, which, however,
                    were immediately rejected by Napoleon. By means of this stratagem Kutusof saved
                    his army from the imminent perils to which it was exposed, and on the 18th
                    November effected a junction with the second Russian army under Buxhowden, at
                    Wischau, six leagues from Brunn, the capital of Moravia, where he assumed the
                    command in chief of the allied army. Kutusof’s retreat was covered by Prince
                    Bagration, who, with a corps of six thousand men, made a desperate stand at
                    Juntersdorf against a greatly superior force under Murat, Soult, and Lannes,
                    and, in spite of every effort that could be made to dislodge him, maintained his
                    ground till night, when he withdrew with the remains of his corps. This
                    encounter, which saved the army of Kutusof, raised the courage of the Russians;
                    they were still the soldiers of Suwarof, and longed to measure swords, in an
                    ampler field of battle, with an enemy whom that victorious chief had so often
                    overthrown.</p>
                <p>The French now occupied Brunn, a strong place, well! armed and supplied with
                    munitions of war, which the ' Austrians had precipitately evacuated on the
                    evening of the 18th November, and on the 19th Napoleon establish- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ed his head-quarters at Wischau. Still the situation
                    of the French army was one of imminent hazard. Hurried on by the ardour of
                    success, it had arrived in the centre of Moravia, more than two hundred leagues
                    from the frontiers of France; it had in its rear neither magazines nor strong
                    places to serve as <hi rend="italic">points d’</hi><hi rend="italic">appui;</hi>
                    its line of operations was disproportionately long; and it was exposed in a
                    space of about ninety leagues of hostile country. Bohemia was in a state of
                    insurrection, and threatened the communications by the left. The warlike <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193515774" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5774-0139"/> Hungarians had
                    risen in mass upon the right. The Archduke Charles, having escaped from Massena,
                    whom the appearance of an Anglo-Russian fleet had retained in Italy, was within
                    fifty leagues of Vienna, the numerous population of which was in a state of
                    extreme fermentation. Prussia had secretly acceded to the coalition, and her
                    minister Haugwitz brought to Napoleon an ultimatum, the rejection of which was
                    to be immediately followed by an official declaration of war. In a word, all the
                    probabilities were against the French army, which had no resource but in a
                    prompt and decisive victory, and, without immediate prodigies of bravery and
                    military science, could not hope to escape from the numerous enemies by whom it
                    was about to be enveloped. What Napoleon most wanted, therefore, was a great
                    battle; but, in proportion as this had become necessary to him, the clear
                    interest of the allies recommended for the present a Fabian system of tactics,
                    and at any sacrifice avoiding a decisive action, by the result of which alone
                    could the French army be saved from destruction. But, in spite of the strong and
                    urgent reasons for acting upon the defensive, it was nevertheless resolved at
                    the head-quarters of the allied emperors to deliver battle.</p>
                <p>On the 2d of December the three emperors with their troops were near Austerlitz,
                    a village about two leagues south of Brunn. The Russian army, reinforced by a
                    second corps (18th November), reckoned about eighty thousand effective
                    combatants; and that of Austria amounted to about twenty-five thousand. The
                    French army did not exceed eighty thousand men on the field of battle. The
                    artillery on both sides was formidable, but the allies had the advantage in the
                    number of cavalry. The allies no doubt desired to gain time, in order to await
                    the arrival of a third Russian corps, now only eight marches distant; but the
                    manoeuvres of Napoleon, and, we may add, his artifices, induced, if not
                    compelled them to accept battle. The immense accumulation of troops around
                    01mutz, resulting from the extraordinary rapidity of events, occasioned such a
                    scarcity of provisions, that the general-inchief, Kutusof, felt himself
                    constrained to precipitate offensive operations. This determination had, without
                    his knowledge, entered into the plan of Napoleon, who, three days before, had
                    withdrawn his advanced guard, in order to fight upon ground which he had
                    reconnoitred, and all the accidents of which were consequently known to him. The
                    hesitation of Kutusof allowed a precious opportunity, and circumstances
                    extremely favourable, to escape him. But not having attacked when the French
                    forces were scattered, he ought to have continued his retreat, in order to
                    engage them still more in advance, either by moving upon Hungary to operate a
                    junction with the Archduke Charles, or upon Bohemia to communicate with Prussia,
                    whose army was assembled and in a condition to act; in short, he ought to have
                    temporised until the simultaneous co-operation, now close at hand, of all the
                    members of the coalition had been obtained, in which case the retreat of the
                    French army towards the Rhine would have been rendered impossible. But instead
                    of acting in this manner, by which eventual success would have been placed
                    almost beyond the reach of accident or fortune, he decided to risk the chances
                    of a general battle, when the respective forces of the combatants were nearly
                    equal.</p>
                <p>Marsha! Lannes, having under him General Suchet, commanded the left; Marshal
                    Soult directed the right; Marshal Bernadotte commanded the centre; Marshal
                    Davoust kept himself in observation before the left of the allies; Marshal
                    Murat, w <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> th his cavalry, and twenty-four pieces of
                    light artillery, supported the right under Marshal Lannes; and the reserve
                    consisted of ten battalions of grenadiers under Genera^ Oudinot, flanked by ten
                    battalions of the guard under General Junot, the whole being provided with forty
                    pieces of cannon. The action commenced at sun-rise, and continued until night.
                    The sun rose with unclouded brilliancy, and was long remembered as the sun of
                    Austerlitz. Its first rays discovered the Austrians and Russians disseminated
                    on, around, and behind the village of Austerlitz, where the allied emperors had
                    taken post to observe the first efforts of the attack. This was directed against
                    the French right, and sustained by Soult and Davoust with their wonted activity
                    and skill, aided greatly by their positions, which were amongst flooded and
                    marshy ground, where the ice was still too weak to support the weight of men or
                    horses. All that Napoleon required of these officers was to maintain their
                    ground for a certain number of hours, whilst with his left and centre he
                    simultaneously attacked that portion of the enemy’s force in front, which he
                    proposed to cut off from the wing engaged. This was the decisive movement; but
                    he delayed long in giving the signal for the premeditated attack, so little
                    anticipated by the enemy, fearing lest they might recall their troops from their
                    left, by which they proposed to assail the French. But as soon as he heard the
                    sound of battle fully engaged in that direction, he gave the word; his generals
                    hurried to their respective posts; and Lannes, Bernadotte, Legrand, St Hilaire,
                    each at the head of a division, advanced. At this moment the allied columns were
                    descending from the heights, and filing off in the direction of their left,
                    where they expected to find the main strength of the battle. But it was nearer
                    them than they imagined, even in their front, where, owing to their ignorance of
                    the true position of the French army, they had not looked for any serious
                    opposition. Surprised, and attacked during an oblique movement, by columns of
                    equal or superior force to their own, the Russian line was intersected; and the
                    French having gained the heights, drove their adversaries down into the defiles
                    behind. But between the village of Austerlitz and the heights thus carried were
                    the Russian reserve, consisting of chosen troops, including the imperial guard,
                    commanded by the Grand Duke Constantine. These, too, were marching towards the
                    left, when, to their astonishment, the French light troops, supported by
                    cavalry, broke in amongst them. A scene of surprise and confusion ensued. But
                    the emperor, aided by Kutusof, rallied the troops; the Russian guards, assisted
                    by some other regiments, charged with great fury; the French, victorious a few
                    moments before, were now driven back; and some regiments which had formed
                    squares were broken by the impetuosity of the Russians. Napoleon did not observe
                    what was taking place, Austerlitz being hidden from his view by the intervening
                    heights; but his ear having caught sounds betokening any thing but victory, he
                    instantly ordered General Rapp, one of his aides-de-camp, to advance at the head
                    of the grenadiers à <hi rend="italic">cheval</hi> of the French imperial guard.
                    Rapp galloped off at the head of these superb squadrons, rallied the stragglers
                    as he advanced, and on approaching the immediate scene of conflict, found the
                    victorious Russians sabring the French as they were driven from the broken
                    squares. Without hesitating a moment, he sounded the charge, broke through a
                    superb regiment of the Russian imperial guard, and made Prince Repnin, one of
                    its colonels, prisoner. This afforded the French time to rally; and, with their
                    usual promptitude and intelligence, they quickly regained their order. Rapp
                    returned to the charge, and overpowered the regiment of the Grand Duke
                    Constantine, who was indebted for his safety to the swiftness of his horse;
                    whilst General Gardanne, charging with a division of dragoons, completed the
                    discomfiture of the enemy. F rom the heights of Austerlitz, the Emperors
                    Alexander and F rancis witnessed the defeat of the Russian guard. The Emperor
                    Napoleon then directed his efforts to the right, where the enemy still continued
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515787" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5787-0140"/>to oppose a
                    vigorous resistance; and the Russian corps, being at length surrounded and
                    driven from all the heights, were forced back to the margin of a lake, where the
                    French artillery made a terrible carnage. From fifteen to eighteen thousand
                    Russians, attempting to escape over the ice, were drowned; two columns, each
                    four thousand strong, laid down their arms; the whole Russian artillery was
                    taken, whilst forty standards, including those of the imperial guard, also fell
                    into the hands of the French; and the remains of the Russian army, without
                    artillery, without baggage, in a state of the most frightful disorganization,
                    and surrounded on all sides, must have surrendered at discretion had they been
                    vigorously pressed. Even the life of Alexander was at the mercy of Napoleon, who
                    ordered his artillerymen not to fire on the emperor of all the Russias, and,
                    from motives of generosity or policy, allowed him to escape.<note

                    Abbé de Montgaillard, “doit être considérée, politiquement, comme one
                    très-grande feute; Alexandre tué sur le champ de bataille, et l’armée Russe
                    anéantie ou prisonnière de guerre, un grand soulèvement devait avoir lieu à
                    Saint-Pétersbourg; il est difficile de présumer l’étendue des consequences d’un
                    tel ordre de choses; mais elles ne pouvaient qu’être favorables au système et
                    aux intérêts Français. Napoléon, chargé de fers à Sainte-Hélène, et proic à
                    toutes les barbaries qu’ordonnent les cabinets de Saint-Petersbourg, de vienne,
                    et de Berlin, barbaries dont le cabinet de saint-James s’est rendu l’exécuteur,
                    Napoléon aura dû vivement regretter la magnanimité dont il use envers les deux
                    empéreurs vaincus à Austerlitz. Cette magnanimité, il n’est pas permis d’en
                    douter, est produite par le brûlant désir qu’a Napoleon d’être reconnu empéreur
                    et roi; d’entrer dans le catalogue officiel des monarques d’Europe, et de
                    s’entendre appéler mon frère par les deux plus puissans de ces monarques. Mais
                    une bonne et sage politique demandait que les deux empéreurs, Alexandre et
                    François, fussent faits prisonniers et amènes en France; la Faix, one véritable
                    paix, et non one trêve de quelques mois, eût été, selon toute apparence, le prix
                    de la rançon des deux captifs, et Angleterre n’eût pas refusé d’y adhérer, pour
                    peu que Napoleon eût borné son ambition à maintenir, pour la France, l’état
                    actuel de possession. Que ne peut done l’amour d’une vaine gloire, que ne peut
                    l’orgueil impérial et royal sur l’esprit d’un parvenu de la Révolution
                    Française? (Montgaillard, <hi rend="italic">H'ut. de France,</hi> tome vi. p.
                    179, 180.)</p></note> Such was Austerlitz, one of the most remarkable battles
                    fought in modem times. It consisted of a series of manoeuvres, every one of them
                    successful, by which the Russian army, surprised in an oblique march, was cut
                    into as many portions as there were columns directed against it. The loss
                    sustained by the Russians, in killed, drowned in attempting to cross the lake on
                    the ice, wounded, and prisoners, has been estimated at thirty-five thousand men;
                    fifteen generals were either killed or taken; the general-in-chief, Kutusof,
                    received several wounds; and a hundred and fifty pieces of cannon were
                    abandoned. The French appear to have lost about ten thousand men, including a
                    general of division and two colonels, who died on the field of battle. At
                    Austerlitz, masses of the French cuirassiers charged, for the first time, the
                    enemy’s batteries; a bold manoeuvre, which, being rapidly executed and
                    courageously sustained, during nine hours, by the corps of Marshal Soult,
                    contributed powerfully to the success of the battle. Marshal Bernadotte also
                    took an active part in this mighty conflict. At the moment when the Russian
                    guard was defeated, he advanced at the head of the centre of the army, dnd by
                    means of his cavalry vigorously charged the enemy; whilst Marshal Lannes, who
                    commanded the left, charged at the same instant, with rare intrepidity, and thus
                    threw them into the most frightful disorder.</p>
                <p>On the evening of the battle the emperor of Germany sent to demand an interview
                    with Napoleon. It was arranged for the 4th of December, and took place within a
                    few leagues of Austerlitz, by the fire of a bivouac. “I receive you,” said
                    Napoleon, “in the only palace which I have inhabited for two months. “You made
                    so good use of this kind of habitation,” replied the emperor of Germany,
                    smiling, “that it ought to content you.” Francis took Napoleon by the hand, and
                    saluted him by tire name of brother. From this moment the judgment of Napoleon,
                    usually so clear, seemed to be bewildered; he changed, so to speak, his nature;
                    and, in his desire to become at any price a monarch allied to an old dynasty, he
                    ceased in future to be any thing but an emperor. The sovereigns remained two
                    hours in conversation, during which the terms of an agreement appear to have
                    been arranged.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>whilst
                    the proceeding adopted by the emperor of Germany shows the deep impression made
                    upon his mind by the battle of Austerlitz, following as it did so rapidly after
                    the disaster of Ulm, it is at the same time clear, that the check which he bad
                    just experienced, though infinitely grave, was not so decisive and irremediable
                    as to destroy all hope, or to be incapable of being repaired in the course of
                    another campaign. The Archdukes Charles and John were advancing at the head of
                    eighty thousand fresh troops, and had already put themselves in communication
                    with Hungary, where the insurrection was becoming general; the losses sustained
                    by the Russians were on the eve of being effaced by a considerable corps (the
                    third army) which had arrived in Silesia; the inhabitants of Bohemia had
                    commenced their levy in mass; a hundred and sixty thousand Prussians. Saxons,
                    and Hessians, were under arms, waiting the order to advance; numerous corps of
                    Prussians and Swedes menaced the northern frontier of Holland; a formidable
                    diversion was on the point of being operated in the seuth of Italy; and, lastly,
                    the army of Napoleon, sensibly weakened by its rapid marches and successes, was
                    more than three hundred leagues from its reinforcements, and in fact only
                    occupied the long narrow line which it had followed in its advance from the
                    Rhine to Olmutz. A little more tenacity on the part of Austria would therefore
                    in aU probability have brought about the ruin of Napoleon and his army. But the
                    Emperor Francis, dejected by his last disaster, threw away a thousand chances
                    which had become favourable to him; he wanted the courage necessary to support
                    the struggle when the tide was about to turn, or to prolong hostilities on the
                    eve of ageneral change of circumstances, which could scarcely have failed to
                    produce a great amelioration in his position, political as well as military;
                    and, without waiting to calculate or deliberate, he came humbly to solicit an
                    armistice, as Darius would have done after a defeat, and as sapor would not. By
                    a strange and inconceivable destiny, the emperor of Austria, without intending
                    it, twice saved Napoleon, in the heart of his states, namely, at Austerlitz and
                    at wagram; on both occasions, the French emperor, having committed great
                    military faults, found himself, after gaining two battles, exposed to have his
                    communications with France intercepted, and was saved from this danger by an
                    almost immediate suspension of hostilities.</p></note> Napoleon showed great
                    forbearance and moderation. The emperor of Russia, to whom he afterwards
                    restored the portion of his guard who had been made prisoners, was permitted to
                    retire unmolested to his dominions, under the protection of an armistice; but
                    although the czar professed great admiration of the man who had so generously
                    spared both himself and the wrecks of his army, he declined to enter into any
                    treaty, or even to acknowledge Napoleon as emperor of the French. The king of
                    Prussia had a more difficult part to perform. He had been ready openly to join
                    the coalition, to which he had secretly acceded; and his minister, Count
                    Haugwitz, had arrived, prepared to employ the language of menace. But fortune
                    hail embarrassed all the calculations of Prussian policy; and Haugwitz, finding
                    Napoleon successful, changed his tone, and complimented him on the victory which
                    he had just gained. “This is a congratulation,” said Napoleon, in reply, “of
                    which fortune has changed the address.” In proportion as he had shown
                    forbearance to Austria, he gave way to his indignation against the duplicity and
                    perfidy of Prussia, and so terrified Count Haugwitz that the latter concluded a
                    treaty, accepting Hanover in lieu of Anspach and Bareuth, which were to be given
                    up to France. The object of Napoleon, no doubt, was to embroil Prussia with
                    Britain, and he thought this would be most effectually accomplished by an
                    arrangement which imposed on the former power the odious task of seizing upon
                    Hanover. Nor was this all. At the very moment when <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193515800" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5800-0141"/>the transfer in question was
                    concluded by Haugwitz, Hardenberg had required the assistance of Britain,
                    conjunctly with Russia, in case Prussia should be attacked; and these
                    incompatible agreements were, to its no small embarrassment, won laid before the
                    cabinet of Berlin. The difficulties thus created were no doubt great; but it
                    endeavoured to escape from them in the best way it could, by accepting Hanover
                    as a deposit, and by yielding up Anspach, together with Cleves, Berg, and
                    Neufchâtel, as had been agreed to by Haugwitz. On the 26th of December, a treaty
                    of peace was concluded at Presburg, between France and Austria. The ancient
                    states of Venice, including Dalmatia and Albania, were ceded to the kingdom of
                    Italy. The principality of Eichstett, part of the archbishopric of Passau, the
                    city of Augsburg, the Tyrol, and all the possessions of Austria in Suabia, the
                    Brisgau, and the Ortenau, were transferred to the elector of Bavaria, the Duke
                    of Wirtemberg, and the Duke of Baden; and the independence of the Helvetic
                    Republic was also stipulated. The Germanic constitution, so much damaged by the
                    treaty of Lunéville, was now virtually dissolved by two of its members, the
                    elector of Bavaria and the Duke of Wirtemberg assuming the title of kings, under
                    the auspices of France, without the consent either of that body or of its chief.
                    By this treaty, Austria likewise sanctioned all the partitions previously
                    effected both in Germany and Italy, and lost a territory of eleven hundred
                    thousand square miles, with a population of two millions six hundred thousand
                    souls.</p>
                <p>Napoleon declared to the French senate, as he had previously done to the emperor
                    of Austria, that he had sought no aggrandizement for France. But this
                    declaration was made in the true spirit of the Italian school of politics, which
                    enjoins the observance of the letter of an obligation, but permits an
                    infringement of its principle. If France was not aggrandized, all the states in
                    dependence on her were so. Venice and Dalmatia were added to the kingdom of
                    Italy. Naples, which an Anglo-Russian force had invaded, was occupied, and the
                    reigning house expelled, as if by the mere word of command. Berthier and Murat
                    were created German princes. The newly acquired provinces of Venice, Dalmatia,
                    Istria, Friuli, Belluno, Feltre, Bas-βano, Vicenza, and Rovigo, were declared
                    duchies, and assigned to the generals and civilians of the imperial court.
                    Bavaria and Wirtemberg had already been aggrandized out of the spoils of
                    Austria, and their rulers raised to the rank of royalty. This was Napoleon’s
                    first performance as king-maker. But his elder brother Joseph was now declared
                    king of Naples, and his younger brother Louis, a man of mild and amiable
                    character, king of Holland; whilst various matches were made, all having for
                    their object at once to aggrandize and unite the new imperial family. Lastly,
                    having done so much for those of his own house, Napoleon consented to receive
                    the homage of his subservient legislature, which, after lavishing on him the
                    most fulsome expressions of adulation, ordered to be erected, in one of the
                    principal places of the capital, a column surmounted with a statue of the
                    emperor, and bearing the inscription, “A Napoleon le Grand, la patrie
                    reconnoissante.”</p>
                <p>The commencement of the year 1806 was brightened with a momentary prospect of
                    peace. On the 23d of January, not two months after the battle of Austerlitz,
                    where all his schemes had been overthrown, Pitt breathed his last. With the
                    bitter exclamation, “Oh, my country,” on his lips, he expired, leaving Europe in
                    confusion, and England beset with difficulties. On the accession to power of Mr
                    Fox and his friends, hopes of peace were entertained; and that statesman having
                    opened a correspondence with the French emperor, by apprising him of an offer
                    which had been made to assassinate him, negotiations followed. But serious
                    obstacles unexpectedly arose, one of them relating to Sicily, which the French
                    insisted should be conjoined with Naples. Talleyrand, however, pushed the
                    conferences with great activity, and evinced the utmost anxiety to conclude a
                    peace. With prophetic sagacity, he foresaw, that without a peace with England,
                    every thing was problematical with the French emperor; that nothing short of a
                    sequence of fortunate battles would consolidate his power; that this was a
                    series of which the last term might perhaps be zero; that nothing could be safe
                    where all was continually put to hazard; that one great reverse would overthrow
                    the fabric which it had required many victories to rear up and establish; that,
                    in short, the time had arrived to secure what had already been gained, and to
                    realise, as it were, the glory which no disaster had as yet overclouded.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This proof of the profound
                    sagacity of Talleyrand, whose political foresight has been so often exemplified
                    in the course of the events of the last thirty years, is taken from the memoirs
                    of his enemy the Duke of Kovigo. The words of Savary are, “Μ. de Talleyrand
                    ∣M&gt;ussait les conférences avec activité; rien ne lui eût coûté pour faire
                    conclure la paix avec Angleterre. Il disait, à qui voulait l’entendre, que, sans
                    elle, tout était problème pour 1’empéreur, qu’il n’y aurait qu'une suite de
                    batailles heureuses qui le conso-lidérait, et que cela se réduisait à one série,
                    dont le premier terme était A, et done la dernier pouvait être Y ou
                    zero.”</p></note> But all these efforts proved, unhappily, vain; nor in fact
                    would any peace that might now have been concluded have proved lasting. Napoleon
                    could not descend from the position to which victory had raised him; and England
                    could not acquiesce in the continued exercise of an ascendant influence
                    subversive of the general balance of power and the independence of states in
                    Europe. Austria and southern Germany were under the dictation of the French
                    emperor; Italy, from the Alps to the Gulf of Tarentum, was subject to his
                    immediate sway; Spain had degenerated into a mere province of the French empire.
                    The only independent power bordering on France was Prussia, and she was already
                    marked out as the next object of attack. In such circumstances peace was
                    unattainable, or, if nominally attained, would nave only been a renewal of the
                    truce of Amiens. Bonaparte was still in his ascending movement; and although
                    wisdom would have counselled him to stop, and even to descend to a lower and
                    safer level, ambition held different language, and urged him to go on.</p>
                <p>Prussia, however, had acted a part equally imprudent and unworthy. We have
                    already adverted to the two treaties, one concluded by Haugwitz with Napoleon,
                    and the other by Hardenberg with England, in December 1805. Perplexed by the
                    results of her own perfidy and double dealing, she derived advantage from
                    neither. She naturally hesitated to accept of Hanover, and to shut her ports
                    against England; but, on the other hand, as Anspach, Cleves, and Berg, ceded by
                    Haugwitz, were already seized by the French, the desire of an equivalent
                    prevailed over all sense of justice or regard even to decency, and this
                    hesitation was overcome. On the 1st of April Hanover was annexed to the Prussian
                    territory, in virtue of a proclamation which set forth that, since Hanover
                    belonged to France by right of conquest, its legitimate possession had been
                    transmitted to Prussia as an equivalent: for the cession of three of her
                    provinces to France. A more impudent and unblushing declaration was never made
                    by any government, nor one more subversive of every principle of public law,
                    justice, and morality. But</p>
                <p>1 the same cabinets which stigmatized Bonaparte as a usurp- . er, recognised him
                    as legitimate sovereign of France i whenever they could profit by his political
                    crimes, and , when his spoliations suited their own interests and political ,
                    arrangements. The conduct of Prussia, in this particular, met with loud and
                    indignant reprobation in England. Mr: Fox publicly denounced it as “every thing
                    that was contemptible<pb break="no" facs="nls:193515813"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-5813-0142"/> in servility, and all that was odious in
                    rapacity.” Nor was this all. Whilst Prussia had thus dishonoured herself for the
                    sake of Hanover and the French alliance, she had the incredible mortification to
                    learn, through the English papers, that Napoleon had offered to restore Hanover
                    to Britain as the price of peace. She had sacrificed her character to obtain
                    Hanover, and she had even dismissed her minister, Hardenberg, to please the
                    French emperor; she had rendered herself an object of scorn to the government of
                    England, and France now rewarded her abasement and humiliation with contempt.
                    Never indeed was perfidy more severely and at the same time more justly
                    punished. But Prussia had yet other and more severe mortifications to
                    endure.</p>
                <p>A compact still more alarming to Prussia than any which had yet been formed was
                    now entered into. This was the confederation of the states of the Rhine, which
                    was concluded on the 12th of July, between the emperor Napoleon, and several
                    princes of the south and west of Germany. These princes separated themselves, in
                    perpetuity, from the territory of the Germanic empire, and united together in a
                    new federation, of which the emperor of the French was declared the protector.
                    The contingent to be furnished by each of the allies was determined; a great
                    number of secularisations and annexations of territory in their favour were
                    recognised and sanctioned; the old constitution of the Germanic body was
                    dissolved; and Napoleon became, in fact, lord suzerain of a large portion of
                    Germany. His object, indeed, seems to have been to make the confederation of the
                    Rhine the centre and pivot of his future power. The notification of the treaty
                    of the 12th July was made to the diet at Ratisbon on the 1st of August, when
                    fourteen German princes declared their separation from the Germanic body, and
                    their new confederation under the protectorate of Napoleon. The common interests
                    of the confederate states were to be discussed in a diet which was to sit at
                    Franckfort-on-the-Maine; and this diet was to be divided into two colleges. In
                    the college of kings were to sit the representatives of the elector of Bavaria
                    and the Duke of Wirtemberg, who had each assumed the title of king, together
                    with those of the Grand Dukes of Baden, Berg, Darmstadt, and the prince primate;
                    and in the college of princes were eight petty princes bearing inferior titles.
                    The contingents were, for France two hundred thousand men; for Bavaria, thirty
                    thousand; for Wirtemberg, twelve thousand; for Baden, eight thousand, &amp;c.;
                    making in all two hundred and sixty-three thousand men. Such was the
                    confederation of the Rhine, which, in the course of six years, was augmented by
                    all the sovereigns of Germany, old or new, with the exception of the emperor of
                    Austria, the king of Prussia, the Dukes of Brunswick and Oldenburg, the king of
                    Sweden as Duke of Pomerania, and the king of Denmark as Duke of Holstein.</p>
                <p>On the 20th July preliminaries of peace between France and Russia were signed at
                    Paris. This was before the treaty of the confederation of the Rhine had
                    transpired. When that organic compact had become known, the cabinet of St
                    Petersburg refused (15th August) to ratify the stipulations which had been
                    agreed to with France, upon the pretence usual in such cases, that its envoy had
                    exceeded his instructions. The negotiations on both sides had, in fact, been
                    entered upon with equal duplicity, with the same perfidy. The ambitious designs
                    of Napoleon against the north of Europe had already become sufficiently manifest
                    not to leave any room for doubt as to his real intentions; whilst the czar,
                    anxious to obliterate the humiliation of Austerlitz, and to re-establish his
                    preponderance in the west of Europe, had recourse to those artifices which have
                    at all times been familiar to Russian diplomacy. The object of the French
                    emperor was to ma ture his schemes, and augment his means of future aggression;
                    what the Russian autocrat desired, was to gain the time necessary to prepare for
                    another struggle. Meanwhile the situation of Prussia was every day becoming more
                    and more critical. If she had cause for mistrust on discovering that Napoleon
                    had offered to restore Hanover to England, this was not lessened by the
                    organization of a powerful, and, from its very constitution, hostile confederacy
                    on her most defenceless frontier. Napoleon, however, attempted to assuage her
                    just suspicions by inviting Frederick-William to form in the north of Germany a
                    confederation similar to that which he had established in the south and west,
                    and also to assume the imperial dignity. But, in the circumstances, these
                    propositions were no better than sheer mockery. The court of Berlin had received
                    too many proofs of the slighting conduct, if not hostile intentions, of France,
                    to repose any confidence in her offers. Injury had been exasperated and
                    envenomed by insult, and the cry of the nation was now for war. Still the most
                    obvious maxims of prudence should have induced Prussia to temporize until her
                    allies were in a condition to take the field. Russia having refused to ratify
                    the stipulations of the 20th July, was preparing to renew the struggle; all
                    hopes of an accommodation between Britain and France were completely at an end;
                    and Prussia, single handed, was not in a situation to contend with a power which
                    had so recently overthrown Austria, even when assisted by Russia. But,
                    neglectful of all this, the court of Berlin, passing from the extreme of caution
                    to the extreme of temerity, gave full intimation of its intentions as early as
                    the month of August, by increasing the army and calling out its reserves.
                    Prussia was now destined to reap the bitter fruits of her selfish and
                    equivocating policy. Had she, during the last coalition, united cordially with
                    Austria before that power had received a stunning blow, Napoleon might have been
                    compelled to receive instead of dictating the law; Austria would at least have
                    been saved; and the confederation of the Rhine would never have been heard of.
                    But selfish timidity kept her arms tied when every motive urged, nay when the
                    strongest obligations bound, her to strike in; and now, when Austria was humbled
                    and France aggrandised, when all the favourable chances had disappeared, and
                    when a mighty army, trained to combats and flushed with victory, was ready to
                    pour its veteran legions across her frontier, Prussia stepped forth alone, in
                    her own strength, to encounter the gigantic force before which her more powerful
                    neighbour had fallen. Her councils became smitten with that infatuation which is
                    the sure forerunner of calamity.</p>
                <p>If it was the height of imprudence in Prussia to decide upon a war in which
                    Austria was no longer in a condition ’ to take part, it was sheer madness not to
                    have both secured and waited for the co-operation of Great Britain and Russia.
                    Instead of this, however, when Lord Morpeth, the British envoy, spoke of
                    Hanover, he was answered that its fate depended on a battle; plainly intimating
                    that, if victorious, Prussia meant to retain it. The same indifference was
                    manifested as to the aid of Russia; and the army, which, indeed, it was
                    difficult to restrain, pushed forward into Saxony to compel the elector to join
                    his forces to those of Prussia, and to induce Hesse to espouse the cause of the
                    north of Germany against France. For the sake of these secondary objects, the
                    blunder of Mack at Ulm was repeated. The French troops were already assembled.
                    Napoleon left Paris in the end of September, and proceeded by Mayence and
                    Würtzburg to Bamberg, the rendezvous of his army, where he arrived on the 6th of
                    October. Proclamations, the usual preludes of war, now followed. The king of
                    Prussia required the French to quit Germany, the soil of which they had no right
                    to tread. Napoleon returned the bravado by some sarcastic remarks on <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193515826" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5826-0143"/> the Prussian
                    queen and court. “The queen of Prussia,” says a French bulletin, “is with the
                    army clothed as an Amazon, wearing the uniform of her regiment of dragoons, and
                    penning twenty letters a day, in order to kindle flames on every side. One might
                    believe her to be Armida out of her senses, setting fire to her own palace. Near
                    her is the young Prince Louis, overflowing with valour, and expecting vast
                    renown from the vicissitudes of war. Echoing these two illustrious personages,
                    the entire court cries out for war. But when war shall have come, with all its
                    horrors, it is then that each will vainly endeavour to excuse himself of the
                    guilt of having drawn down its thunders upon the peaceful countries of the
                    north."</p>
                <p>The Prussian army, commanded by the king in person, and the old Duke of
                    Brunswick, whom his campaigns against the French had not instructed in their new
                    system of tactics, was scattered along the high road from Eisenach and Weimar.
                    Having advanced so far, it should have assumed the initiative, and, by a great
                    offensive effort, endeavoured to break through the enemy’s line before his corps
                    were in a condition to afford mutual support. But Brunswick was alike incapable
                    of conceiving or executing such a plan of operation; he hesitated when he should
                    have decided; marched and countermarched without object; and, worst of all,
                    committed the fatal error of dividing his army when almost in presence of the
                    enemy. The road by which the Prussians had advanced, and along which their
                    magazines were established, from Weimar, in a north-easterly direction, to
                    Leipsic, run obliquely to the line on which the French were now approaching from
                    the south. Instead of attacking Weimar, where their main force was concentrated,
                    Napoleon therefore resolved to throw himself on their communications, intersect
                    their line of retreat, and cut them off from their principal magazines. And this
                    he effected by one of those rapid and masterly movements which, executed by him,
                    had so often decided the fate of armies. The only resistance which the French
                    met with was at Saalfield, where, on the 10lh of October, the division of
                    Suchet, belonging to the corps of Lannes, was opposed by Prince Louis of
                    Prussia, commanding the advanced guard of the corps of Hohenlohe. A fierce
                    combat ensued; but the Prussians, being unsupported, were overpowered, the brave
                    prince lost his life, and thirty pieces of cannon, with a thousand prisoners,
                    fell into the hands of the French. The French now occupied the line of the
                    Saale, with their backs towards Germany; whilst the Prussians, in order to face
                    them, were obliged to turn theirs to France. The belligerents having thus, as it
                    were, changed places, the main body of the French under Napoleon crossed the
                    Saale at Ĵena; the interval between lena and Naumberg was occupied by
                    Bernadotte, who had orders to observe the Saale as for as Doernberg, by which he
                    was to debouch, in order to cut off the enemy’s masses from their reserves, and
                    to fall upon their rear, in case they should move in force upon Naumberg or
                    Iena; and Davoust, with three fine divisions of infantry thirty thousand strong,
                    but weak in cavalry, was posted between Naumbergand Doernberg, on the right of
                    the Saale, to guard the defiles of Koesen. To drive the French from these
                    positions, and to restore the communications, was now the great object of the
                    Prussians. Accordingly the king and the Duke of Brunswick, at the head of the
                    main body of the Prussian army, marched to dislodge Davoust; whilst the
                    remainder, under Prince Hohenlohe, advanced against the main body of the French
                    army, commanded by Napoleon. In this way Davoust found himself in the presence
                    of an enemy more than sixty thousand strong, one-fifth of whose force consisted
                    of cavalry, in which arm he was disproportionately weak; whilst, on the other
                    hand, Hohenlohe advanced to attack a force which outnumbered him in a still
                    higher ratio, and was supported by the main body of the cavalry under Murat.
                    Both parties appear to have had false notions of each other’s movements; but
                    Napoleon was evidently misled by the extraordinary proceeding of the Duke of
                    Brunswick, in dividing his army on the eve of a great battle, an error which
                    exceeded all ordinary calculation or experience.</p>
                <p>The battles of Iena and Auerstadt were fought on the same day, the 14th of
                    October, at the distance of six leagues, without contact or communication. That
                    of Iena does not present any masterly or decisive manoeuvre. It was decided by
                    charges of the cavalry under Murat, who, supported by Augereau, completely
                    routed the half of the Prussian force, and pursued the remains of it five
                    leagues from the field of battle, indeed as far as Weimar. The action at
                    Auerstadt was long and bravely disputed. Marshal Kalkreuth and General Blucher
                    combated with vigour under the eye of their sovereign. But the invincible
                    firmness of Davoust, supported by Generals Gudin, Friant, and Morand, triumphed
                    over numbers, and this portion of the Prussian army was, notwithstanding -its
                    great superiority in numbers and in cavalry, also thrown into disorder, and
                    driven from the field. The battle of Auerβtadt, which was in fact the grand and
                    decisive cordbat, reflects infinite honour upon Davoust. Surprised by the sudden
                    apparition of the main body of the Prussian army, and denied all assistance by
                    his colleague Bernadotte, who, from a narrow construction of his orders, and
                    still more perhaps from an unwillingness to act a secondary part, withdrew his
                    corps to continue a movement which had no longer an object, he was thrown upon
                    his own resources, and, but for his great experience and inflexible tenacity,
                    his corps, thus compromised, might have been overthrown and destroyed. Forming
                    his battalions into squares, he received and repulsed the repeated charges of
                    the Prussian cavalry led on by Blucher; and when the latter, disordered by the
                    failure of their own efforts, were obliged to retreat, he attacked and broke
                    through the centre of the enemy. The Duke of Brunswick and Prince William of
                    Prussia again led the cavalry back to the charge; but in vain; nothing could
                    shake the firmness of the French. A last effort to retrieve the fortune of the
                    day was made by the king in person, with no better success. The centre being
                    broken, the retreat of the wings became inevitable; and, as almost all the
                    Prussian generals had been severely wounded, the troops, left in a great measure
                    to themselves, fell into a state of the most frightful disorder. No rallying
                    point bad been fixed in the rear; no provision made for the contingency of a
                    defeat. In fact, the idea of an eccentric retreat, that is, withdrawing on
                    diverging lines, at this time possessed the Prussian tacti tians; and the
                    destruction which so rapidly overtook the remains of the Prussian army may in a
                    great measure be ascribed to the circumstance of this absurdity being now
                    reduced to practice. The extent of the disaster which had befallen the Prussian
                    arms was only known when the troops defeated at Iena and Auerstadt mingled in
                    their flight towards Weimar. In killed, wounded, and prisoners, the Prussians,
                    including their Saxon auxiliaries, lost more than forty-five thousand men;
                    whilst a hundred and sixty pieces of cannon, with immense magazines of
                    provisions, fell into the hands of the conquerors. At lens and Auerstedt the
                    French had about twelve thousand men put <hi rend="italic">hors de

                <p>Frederick-William, in his flight, sent to demand an armistice, which was refused;
                    and the following day, Er-ſurth, containinga hundred pieces of cannon, fourteen
                    thousand men, and numerous magazines, was surrendered to Murat. The French now
                    pushed on without intermission for Berlin, which Napoleon entered at the head of
                    his guard on the 27th of October, amidst the silence and tears of the people. He
                    had spent the 25th at Potsdam, in the apart-merits<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193515839" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5839-0144"/> of Frederick II. for whose
                    character and memory, both as a warrior and a sovereign, he professed the
                    greatest veneration; but this feeling did not prevent him from taking away the
                    sword and the order of the black eagle worn by Frederick, and sending them, with
                    the colours of his guard, to the Hôtel des Invalides at Paris. Meanwhile the
                    king of Prussia retired behind the Oder, in the hope of collecting the scattered
                    remains of his army, and making a stand under cover of the strong places by
                    which that line was defended. But fortress after fortress, though powerfully
                    garrisoned and well supplied with ammunition and provisions, surrendered with a
                    rapidity inexplicable on any supposition except that of treachery or
                    infatuation. Spandau yielded almost without resistance; Magdeburg, the bulwark
                    of the kingdom, capitulated after a short and irregular siege; Glogau, the
                    strongest place on the Oder, likewise surrendered; and other places imitated
                    their example. Blucher alone supported the national character amidst all these
                    calamities. Ĳe executed a daring and masterly retreat amongst the French
                    divisions, which pursued and frequently crossed his line of march; and, when at
                    length obliged to take shelter in the free town of Lubeck, the desperate
                    resistance which he opposed to the overwhelming masses of the enemy made them
                    pay dear for the advantage they gained in storming the place. Thus, by two
                    simultaneous battles, in which both parties fought on wrong principles and
                    erroneous information, was the Prussian monarchy not only shaken, but destroyed.
                    Napoleon had not only avenged the defeat of the French at Hosbach, but also the
                    perd in which he had himself been placed by Prussia during the campaign of
                    Austerlitz, and he now wreaked his vengeance with unsparing severity.</p>
                <p>At Berlin Napoleon had once more to enter upon the task of organizing a new
                    empire. The smaller states of Germany were compelled to join the confederation
                    of the Rhine; Saxony was treated with politic leniency; Hesse-Cassel and
                    Brunswick were doomed to expiate their loyalty by rigorous contributions; and
                    the electorate of Hanover was seized in the name of France. The occupation of
                    the free city of Hamburg, against which the emperor Napoleon had no assignable
                    cause of war, immediately followed. On the 19th of November, Mortier took
                    possession of the town in name of the French government, and the same day issued
                    an order, enjoining the inhabitants to make known all funds and merchandise
                    belonging to the English. This was part of his system. To strike a free
                    commercial port with nullity, and thus to ruin a great city, gave him no
                    concern, provided it was closed against England. A measure of a still more
                    extraordinary character followed. On the 21st of November was issued an imperial
                    decree, dated at Berlin, in which the British islands were declared in a state
                    of blockade. By this decree all commerce and correspondence were interdicted;
                    every subject of England, of whatever state or condition, who should be found in
                    the countries occupied by the French or their allies, was to be made prisoner of
                    war; the commerce in English merchandise was prohibited, and all merchandise, of
                    whatsoever kind, proceeding from England, was declared lawful prize; lastly, all
                    vessels coming directly from England or from English colonies, or having been
                    there since the publication of the decree, were not to be received into any
                    port. Such was the decree by which Bonaparte endeavoured to exclude England from
                    the Continent at the expense of neutral and independent nations, and which he
                    intended to enforce in all the harbours of Europe, from St Petersburg to
                    Constantinople. But this scheme, although it no doubt occasioned, in the first
                    instance, much mischief to British commerce, and tended to throw the principal
                    carrying trade of Europe into the hands of the Americans, yet, like all
                    prohibitory systems, it eventually recoiled on its author. For, in the first
                    place, nothing tended so much as the severities of the continental system to
                    alienate from Bonaparte the affections both of his subjecta and his allies. Even
                    the exhausting demands of the conscription were borne with less impatience than
                    the rigours of a code which crippled one great branch of industry, and deprived
                    all persons possessing only moderate fortunes of the customary luxuries of life.
                    But, on the other hand, whilst the price of sugar, coffee, and other articles,
                    rose to an exorbitant height, the contraband trade flourished; and whilst the
                    vexations of the excise excited that state of chronic war between the government
                    and the people which is the fruitful sources of disaffection, the object aimed
                    at was in a great measure defeated. In spite of all restrictions, enforced by
                    armies of douaniers, English merchandise found its way into the Continent; the
                    smugglers were enriched, the regular traders ruined, and the people forced to
                    pay many prices for articles which habit had rendered indispensable.</p>
                <p>Towards the close of November, Russia declared war against France. About the same
                    time the king of Prussia, who had retired to Königsberg, made an attempt to·
                    negotiate; but as Napoleon demanded the cession of the whole country between the
                    Rhine and the Elbe, Frederick-William, hoping that the power of Russia might yet
                    give a check to that of France, refused to accept terms less severe than those
                    which he was afterwards under the necessity of submitting to. But, unfortunately
                    for this hope, war broke out at the same moment between Russia and Turkey. In a
                    few days of successful intrigue, Sebastian!, whom Napoleon had sent to
                    Constantinople, succeeded in putting an end to the amicable relations subsisting
                    not only between Russia and Turkey, but also between England and the Porte; the
                    invasion of Egypt by France, and its deliverance by England, were forgotten;
                    French officers were seen directing works for strengthening the batteries of the
                    Dardanelles, as well as training the Turks to serve the guns with which they
                    were armed; and a war followed on the Danube, which occasioned a powerful
                    diversion in favour of Napoleon, and crippled the exertions of Russia in the
                    approaching struggle.</p>
                <p>Napoleon now advanced in pursuit of the Prussian mo-1 narch, and at Posen, the
                    capital of that part of Poland acquired by Prussia, he, on the ∏th of December,
                    concluded a treaty of peace and alliance with the elector of Saxony, who acceded
                    to the confederation of the Rhine, and assumed the title of king. From Posen he
                    proceeded to Warsaw, which was evacuated on his approach. At the sight of the
                    Russian and Prussian eagles retiring from the capital of their country, the
                    Poles were in exultation. Their patriotism and national spirit revived; the
                    youth crowded into the Polish regiments which were now formed to act in concert
                    with the French; and the throne of Sobieski seemed already re-established. But
                    Napoleon, though resolved to make use of their zeal, had no intention to reward
                    it with that independence which they so ardently desired. “Quoique Napoleon, que
                    sa méfiance et les dispositions de l’Autriche rendraient très circonspect, ne
                    leur eût fait aucune promesse,” says General Dumas; “il les avait pourtant
                    excités à s'avancer pour reconquérer leur liberté et leur indépendance. 11 leur
                    avait donné un gouvernement provisoire créé des autorités civiles et militaires
                    prises dans leur sein. Les Polonnais se flattaient avec raison que la
                    restauration de la nation serait le juste prix du sang qu’elle avait versé pour
                    la cause de la France, depuis les premières campagnes d’Italie jusqu'aux
                    dernières batailles, dans lesquelles ils avaient vaillamment combattu.
                    Devaient-ils croire que maitre de reparer le scandale des démembremens de leur
                    patrie, de venger la plus manifeste violation du droit des gens, le vainqueur

                    In his view all interest» and all wills were to yield to his, as all resistance
                    had yielded to his arms; but he lived to repent of his injustice to Poland, and
                    discovered in adversity the extent of the error as well as of the wrong he had
                    committed.</p>
                <p>By the first of December all northern Germany, excepting Königsberg, with the
                    fortresses of Stralsund and Colberg, was either under the direct domination or
                    under the immediate influence of Napoleon. Hesse, Brunswick, Hanover, the
                    duchies of Oldenburg and Mecklenburg, and the Hanseatic Towns, were in his
                    power. Prussia, which for half a century had been gradually rising to the
                    highest rank amongst military powers, was overturned at the first shock.
                    Hostilities commenced on the 9th of October, and on the 14th she received a
                    mortal blow. In seventeen days, the French soldiers, having traversed the
                    forests and defiles of Franconia, the Saale, and the Elbe, reached Berlin; and
                    by the end of November they were beyond the Vistula. The overthrow of the
                    Prussian monarchy in a campaign of six weeks, is one of those events the reality
                    of which will hardly be credited by posterity. But the season of combats having
                    reached its term, an able and prudent general, Frederick II. for example, would
                    have stopped on the Oder, at least until spring, and employed the winter in
                    establishing himself in a solid manner in Germany; in securing the immobility of
                    Austria? in making himself master of the strong places in Silesia; in taking
                    possession of Dantzick and Colberg before the arrival of the Russians; in
                    reducing Stralsund, and recruiting, clothing, and re-arming his troops at the
                    expense of the conquered countries; in forming a German army, which would have
                    been an useful auxiliary; in negotiating with his enemies, in order to divide,
                    deceive, or intimidate them; and, above all, in masking his ulterior projects.
                    The history of the following years shows that the independence of Europe would
                    have been destroyed, if Napoleon, yielding to the most obvious suggestions of
                    prudence, had retarded a little his precipitate advance, in order to attain his
                    grand object, the subjugation of Europe. But he did nothing which he could and
                    ought to have done in order to consolidate his power, and he was ultimately
                    ruined even by his own successes.</p>
                <p>Hostilities recommenced at Czamovo, near the confluence of the Bug and the Wrka,
                    on the 23d of December; but the Russians, though numerous and advantageously
                    posted, were dislodged by the division of Morand of the corps of Marshal
                    Davoust. A more important combat took place at Mohrungen, sixteen leagues south
                    of Elbing, on the 25th. The Russian generals, observing that the French army had
                    suspended its march, and was preparing to go into cantonments on the Vistula,
                    came to the determination of attempting to cut off the left w ing; and their
                    design would probably have succeeded if Bernadotte had servilely executed the
                    orders he had received the evening before to retire to Little Strasburg, seven
                    or eight miles from Thorn. But having received information of the movement of
                    the Russian columns, and foreseeing the disasters which would result from the
                    execution of the orders he had received, he suspended his march; assembled his
                    corps on the plains of Mehrungen, where the Russian column of attack arrived
                    about noon; checked its advance, and, after a severe action, forced it to retire
                    with considerable loss behind the Passarge. The determination of Bernadotte
                    saved the head-quarters of Napoleon and the division of Ney, perhaps the French
                    army itself, which, if the Russians had succeeded in their attack, would have
                    been completely compromised. Alarmed at th⅛ bold movement, Napoleon, who
                    intended to pass the winter on the Vistula, pressing the siege of Dantzick, and
                    awaiting the arrival of eighty thousand conscripts of the year 1807, judged it
                    necessary to clear his front, and, if possible, so to intimidate the Russians as
                    to prevent a repetition of such enterprises. With this view Lannes, reinforced
                    by a division of the corps of Davoust, attacked Beningsen at Pultusk, near the
                    confluence of the Narew and the Orzye, on the 26th of December. A murderous
                    conflict ensued, but the action remained undecided. The slaughter of the French
                    was great, Beningsen having manoeuvred so as to expose them throughout the day
                    to a destructive fire of artillery. The Russians retired unmolested during the
                    night. On the same day another action took place at Golymin, eight leagues north
                    of Warsaw, between the corps of Augereau, supported by part of that of Davoust,
                    with the cavalry of Murat, and a strong Russian division under General
                    Buxhowden. This combat was maintained with equal tenacity; but the French,
                    though dreadfully maltreated, ultimately succeeded in forcing their adversaries
                    to retire. The extreme rigour of the season now determined the belligerent
                    armies on the Vistula to take some repose, which both so much required. But this
                    was destined to be of short duration.</p>
                <p>Beningsen having leisurely retired from the field of battle at Pultusk, followed
                    but not harassed by the French, moved northward, determined, after a short
                    interval of rest, and concentrating all his disposable means, to resume
                    offensive operations. Accordingly, having mustered his forces, and rallied the
                    remains of the Prussian army under Lestocq, he formed the project of penetrating
                    between the main body of the French and their left wing, which bordered on the
                    Baltic, raising the siege of Dantzick, and thus turning all the positions of the
                    enemy. In the end of January, Napoleon, having become aware of this design,
                    assembled his army and marched northward, in the hope of anticipating Beningsen,
                    and attacking him in the midst of his movement. But an intercepted letter
                    addressed to Bernadotte apprised Beningsen of his danger, and he immediately
                    fell back. Both projects thus failed; but nevertheless the French had the
                    advantage of obtaining the lead. Napoleon, therefore, continuing his movement
                    northward, came up with Beningsen at Willenberg, whence the two armies, the one
                    retiring and the other advancing, traversed rapidly the country between the Alle
                    and the Passarge. Irritated by the close pursuit, and the privations to which
                    his soldiers were exposed, Beningsen resolved to turn on the enemy, and make a
                    stand at the little town of Preus-sisch-Eylau, twelve leagues south of
                    Königsberg. He first endeavoured to defend the place, and, during the evening of
                    the 7th of February, Prince Bagration and General Barclay de Tolly made the most
                    gallant efforts to keep back the enemy; nor were they dislodged from a cemetery
                    in which they had intrenched themselves until late at night, and after a most
                    sanguinary combat. On the morning of the 8th, the Russians, under cover of a
                    tremendous fire of artillery, attacked with the greatest fury the French in
                    Eylau and its vicinity. Divisions belonging to the corps of Davoust, Soult, and
                    Ney, and the entire corps of Augereau, withstood the efforts, equally impetuous
                    and unexpected, of the Russians, whose force was estimated at between sixty and
                    seventy thousand men. The approaches to and the interior of the village of Eylau
                    exhibited a terrible scene of carnage. The aim of each general was the same,
                    namely, to overthrow his adversary’s left. But Bonaparte having, in addition,
                    sent strong columns against the Russian centre, these, during a heavy fall of
                    snow, missed the proper direction, and penetrating between the centre and right
                    of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515865" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5865-0146"/>enemy,
                    were attacked on both -flanks, whilst the Russian reserve charged them with
                    great impetuosity in front. A dreadful scene of confusion and slaughter ensued;
                    several generals were killed or wounded; and the twenty-fourth regiment of the
                    line, three thousand six hundred strong, was annihilated. To extricate the
                    troops thus compromised, Napoleon was obliged to order the cavalry, supported by
                    his reserves, to charge; which increased the fury and indecision of the battle.
                    Davoust having made a considerable detour, now arrived on the left flank of the
                    Russians, which was refused as he advanced, and about to fall back in good
                    order, when the Prussians under Lestocq came up, and this terrible battle was
                    renewed. Davoust retreated in his turn; but Ney having by this time arrived with
                    his division at the other extremity of the Russian line, the fury of the
                    conflict was transported thither, where mutual charges were executed with
                    headlong impetuosity. Order there was no longer any; masses alone, impelled by
                    the instinct of combat, continued the desperate struggle. The Russians, though
                    huddled together in a small space, determinedly maintained their ground; whilst
                    the French, in equal confusion, were unable to bring up a force sufficient to
                    decide the fate of the battle. The loss on both sides was enormous. That of the
                    Russians was, by their own -account, seven thousand nine hundred men killed and
                    twelve thousand wounded; but Napoleon only acknowledged a loss of one thousand
                    nine hundred men killed on the field of battle, and five thousand seven hundred
                    wounded; an admission evidently as far below the truth as that of Ruschel, who
                    stated the French loss at thirty thousand killed and twelve thousand wounded,
                    was above it. The Russians remained on the field of battle; but as they had been
                    dreadfully cut up, and as Bernadotte was advancing with his corps to reinforce
                    Napoleon, Beningsen withdrew next morning, and retired behind the Pregel. Had he
                    remained a little longer, the French would have left him indisputed master of
                    the field. Napoleon had also contemplated a retreat; but, on the disappearance
                    of the Russians, he kept his ground, remained an entire week at Eylau, and then
                    retired to occupy the line of the Passarge, establishing his head-quarters at
                    Osterode. This was the only circumstance which gave him a pretence for claiming
                    a victory which most certainly he had not won.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This horrible massacre, represented by
                    Napoleon as a victory won by Murat, whose cavalry did not appear until towards
                    the close of the engagement, produced great discontentment amongst some of the
                    marshals, particularly Augereau and Lannes, who were disgraced for denying to
                    Murat the credit which Napoleon had chosen to give him on this occasion. They
                    disputed not Napoleon’s title to order matters as he pleased on the field of
                    battle, but they contended that he had no right to treat truth with the same
                    con. tempt which he showed for mankind, or to dictate his sovereign orders to
                    fame. Besides, they were sick of prosecuting war in such distant and
                    inhospitable regions. Lannes, when asked by his chief if, with such soldiers as
                    those who fought at Eylau, the conquest of Poland could be doubtful, replied.
                    “All this country is not worth the loss of the humblest corporal in the army."
                    In the sixty-fourth bulletin Napoleon thus describes the scene presented by the
                    field of battle: “Qu’on se figure, sur un espace d’une lieue carrée, neuf ou dix
                    mille cadavres, quatre ou cinq mille chevaux tués. <hi rend="italic">Tout cela

                    certainly, however hypocritical and disgusting, as emanating from one who
                    “commanded the bloody fray to rise,” and who seems even to have contemplated,
                    with something approaching to pleasure, the horribly picturesque spectacle
                    presented by the blood-stained snow of this field of carnage. Napoleon’s tactics
                    made no account of human life. If the battle was gained, however dearly
                    purchased, he felt no regret, provided enough of men remained for future
                    consumption. He was, to use Kleber’s expression, “a general of six thousand men
                    a day.”</p></note></p>
                <p>The tidings of a drawn battle, fought at the northern • extremity of Prussia,
                    filled the Parisians with apprehension and alarm. The good fortune of Napoleon
                    had hitherto been so constant that people looked on the battle of Eylau as the
                    breaking of the spell, and began to consider reverses as probable. Nor was this
                    feeling confined to Paris, where it occasioned a considerable fall in the funds,
                    and even shook public confidence. It prevailed also in the army, where more than
                    one general officer counselled a retreat behind the Vistula. But Napoleon
                    persisted in remaining on the Passarge, where he continued until the month of
                    May, when Dantzick surrendered after a gallant defence.</p>
                <p>Reinforcements had in the meanwhile reached both armies, which were consequently
                    soon in a condition to take the field. Napoleon, however, determined to leave as
                    little as possible to chance, had opened negotiations, evidently with no other
                    object than to gain time, and retard the commencement of operations until his
                    utmost available means were collected for the decisive struggle. Accordingly,
                    when all was ready, the negotiations were broken off; and, on the 5th of June,
                    two Russian columns attempted to force the passage of the Passarge at Spanden,
                    three leagues north-east of Guttstadt; but, after an obstinate combat, in which
                    Bernadotte was severely wounded, they were repulsed. Another encounter took
                    place at Heilsberg on the 10th, between the principal mass of the Russian army
                    and the corps of Soult and Lannes, supported by the cavalry under Murat. The
                    Russians disputed the ground inch by inch, whilst their artillery tore up the
                    ranks of the French, who had several generals killed or wounded, and maintained
                    themselves in close columns in their intrenchments, which they did not evacuate
                    until the 12th. Both armies now moved northward, the Russians on the east, and
                    the French on the west, of the Alle. But as Beningsen’s object was to cover
                    Königsberg, it became necessary to pass the river by the bridge at Friedland, on
                    the road leading to the ancient capital of Prussia, and sixteen leagues distant
                    therefrom.</p>
                <p>As the French had but one division (that of Ney) im√ mediately opposite
                    Friedland, Beningsen brought up forces 1 to attack it. Bonaparte was at Eylau,
                    eight leagues distant, whence he hurried with the rest of his army to Friedland,
                    where he found Ney making what resistance he could. It was the 14th of June, the
                    anniversary of the battle of Marengo, and welcomed by the French emperor as
                    betokening good fortune. Forming his columns in the woods, he allowed Beningsen
                    to cross the bridge with the greater part of his army. When the Russian general
                    thus heedlessly advanced, he little suspected that the whole French army were
                    lying in wait for him; but dense columns issuing from the woods, and getting
                    their cannon into position for the attack, soon convinced him that he would have
                    to fight at a disadvantage, and without even the possibility of retreating in
                    the event of sustaining a reverse. He drew out his line, however, with his left
                    resting on the bridge, and prepared to receive the shock which was now
                    inevitable. A considerable time passed in manoeuvres, skirmishes, and partial
                    combats; and it was not until five in the evening that the battle became general
                    along the whole line. The principal attack, led by Ney, was of course directed
                    against the bridge of Friedland, by which alone the Russians could retreat; but
                    in his ardour to carry it he was repulsed, and the head of his column was
                    broken. Supported by Dupont, however, he rallied his troops, and was preparing
                    to renew the attack, when Napoleon, who had acquired some experience of Russian
                    firmness and tenacity, judged it best to achieve the victory by means of his
                    artillery. A battery of thirty pieces, commanded by General Senarmont,
                    advancing<pb break="no" facs="nls:193515878" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5878-0147"/> four
                    hundred yards a head of the columns, opened a destructive fire of grape on the
                    Russian masses, huddled up as it were in a corner; heavy charges of cavalry
                    filled up the intervals of the cannonade, breaking many of their squares; and
                    towards evening the French infantry again advanced to complete the victory. The
                    Russians had suffered much; retreat was inevitable; and as the bridge was swept
                    by the enfilading fire of the enemy’s artillery, they threw themselves into the
                    river, where thousands perished in addition to those who had fallen in the field
                    of battle. Such was the decisive victory of Friedland, which re-established the
                    superiority of the French arms, which the battle of Eylau had brought into
                    question, and which Napoleon had long desired, as the means of disposing
                    Alexander to an accommodation. In this battle the Russians lost seventeen
                    thousand men killed, drowned, or wounded, nearly as many prisoners, and seventy
                    pieces of cannon. The loss sustained by the French was also great, and included
                    a number of generals killed as well as wounded.</p>
                <p>But the results were eminently decisive. Königsberg surrendered to Soult. The
                    last hope of Prussia was annihilated. Beningsen retired beyond the Niemen,<note

                    there is nothing in the annals of modem tactics that can be compared in point of
                    ignominy. Beningsen was no mean adept in his art; and if he had been cordially
                    seconded, instead of being thwarted, as he often was, by the native Russian
                    generals (be was a Hanoverian), the result of the campaign might have been
                    different. At all events, Napoleon had yet met with no antagonist who made him
                    pay so terrible a price for victory.</p></note> on the banks of which the French
                    soon afterwards arrived. At Friedland was terminated the series of operations
                    commenced at Spenden on the 5th; and in this campaign of ten days the Russian
                    army had experienced enormous losses, and been forced to retreat within its own
                    frontiers. The Emperor Alexander having now joined the army, an armistice was
                    demanded and agreed to on the 21st of June; and, on the 25th, an interview took
                    place between the emperors, in a tent raised on a raft in the Niemen, at
                    Tilsitt, an open place of small importance on the left bank of the river. The
                    meeting had as much apparent cordiality as if not a drop of blood had been shed
                    or a life lost in their quarrel. One of the first words of Alexander expressed
                    his resentment against England. This was politic, and eminently calculated to
                    conciliate the conqueror, who in fact is said to have replied that, such being
                    his sentiments, the terms of accommodation would be easily arranged. Besides,
                    England had departed from the Pitt system of subsidizing largely, and the
                    autocrat no doubt thought it hard that he should not be liberally paid for
                    defending himself. At the second interview, which took place the following day,
                    the king of Prussia was admitted, on the urgent entreaty of Alexander; and the
                    half of the town of Tilsitt being neutralized, the two emperors established
                    themselves there, and were soon upon terms of the greatest familiarity, if not
                    friendship. Not so the unfortunate king of Prussia, who, having arrived as a
                    suppliant, was treated with disrespect and severity. Even the czar, won by the
                    attentions of Napoleon, or overawed by the ascendency of his genius and fortune,
                    soon evinced a diminished sympathy for his unfortunate ally; nor could the
                    presence of the beautiful queen of Prussia, with all her fascinations, overcome
                    this influence, or soften the premeditated rigour of the French emperor. The
                    latter had many grounds of resentment against Prussia. At Austerlitz she had
                    held his destiny in her hands, and acted with perfidy, without, however, reaping
                    the reward of her bad faith. She had besides deranged his favourite system of
                    policy, which required the alliance of one of the three great powers of the
                    north and east, especially of Prussia, whose central position gave to her
                    peculiar advantages in this respect. He felt it as a great political evil that
                    he had been reduced to the necessity of destroying a power which it was his
                    interest to support, nay even to aggrandize; and as he knew that reconcilement
                    could never grow up where wounds of deadly hate had pierced so deep, he resolved
                    to avail himself to the fullest extent of the advantages which victory had given
                    him, and to prevent Prussia from ever having the power to decide the fate of any
                    future coalition.</p>
                <p>The terms granted to the king of Prussia were equally severe and humiliating, and
                    were made to appear as concessions to Alexander rather than stipulations with
                    Frederick-William. He was deprived of all his territories between the Rhine and
                    the Elbe, and forced to abandon to Saxony almost the whole of Prussian Poland,
                    which was erected into the duchy of Warsaw, as well as the circle of Cotbus, in
                    Lusatia. Several military roads were also to be opened through the Prussian
                    state, to form communications between the kingdom of Saxony and the duchy of
                    Warsaw; all the countries which remained to Prussia were to be shut against the
                    navigation and commerce of England; and these provinces were to be evacuated
                    before the first of October 1807, provided the war contributions were
                    discharged, which they were to be held to be whenever the intendant of the
                    French army should have certified the validity of the securities offered. Under
                    cover of this last provision, the fortresses of Custrin, Stettin, and Ulo-gau
                    were retained by the French long after the period stipulated for their
                    restoration. The totality of the contributions imposed upon Prussia was fixed at
                    513,744,410 francs, or L.20,551,776, and of this enormous amount there had been
                    collected, by the end of 1808, “tant en espèces qu'en fournitures,” the sum of
                    474,352,650 francs, or L.19,174,106, leaving to be recovered even then a balance
                    of rather more than L.l,500,000. These numbers show the frightful severity with
                    which the law of the conqueror was applied to Prussia.<note anchored="true"

                    territory, and nearly the half of her population; instead of ten millions and a
                    half, which she possessed before the disastrous day of Iena, only six millions
                    remained to her; whilst her territory, dismantled and laid open on all its
                    frontiers, formed a long parallelogram,extending abouta hundred and eighty
                    leagues from west to east, but reduced to a breadth not exceeding forty. Modern
                    history presents no other example of a power descending to such a degree of
                    abasement and humiliation by means of a conquest so rapidly executed.<note

                    with Magdeburg." Madame,” said Napoleon, assuming a look of great severity, “it
                    is for me to give; you have only the trouble of accepting.” Nor even when the
                    sacrifice was consummated did he relax in his sarcasms and severities against
                    the Prussian court; and whenever a deputation of Prussians presented themselves,
                    he recurred to the painful theme of their monarch’s imbecility and ingratitude.

                <p>But the primary stipulations at Tilsitt were between Napoleon and Alexander,
                    lords of the old world, the one from the Atlantic to the Niemen, the other from
                    the Niémen to the Pacific. If the half of his dominions was restored to the king
                    of Prussia, it was from regard to the Emperor Alexander; and the latter, equally
                    complaisant, consented that the greater part of the ancient Polish territories
                    should pass under the sovereignty of Saxony, and that Dantzick, with a radius of
                    two leagues, should be declared independent, but with a garrison of French
                    troops. Napoleon accepted, for form’s sake, the mediation of Alexander with
                    England; whilst Alexander, in return,recognised the confederation of the Rhine,
                    and the three brothers of his conqueror, Joseph, Louis, and Jerome, as the kings
                    of Naples, Holland, and Westphalia. The Russian troops were also to evacuate the
                    principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia. The old barriers of Europe were thus
                    broken down, and all the other powers plunged into a state of humiliating
                    vassalage and uncertainty. In the policy of Napoleon we always find something
                    gigantic, hazardous, incoherent, and unfinished; vast but ill-defined
                    conceptions, bold experiments, and wildly capricious assortments. On this
                    occasion, for instance, the Polish nation was most ungenerously sacrificed;
                    whereas, by re-establishing the throne of Sobieski, with a better system of
                    monarchy, he would have formed a stronger barrier against the ambition of
                    Russia, and more effectually preserved Germany from the influence of Austria and
                    Prussia, than by creating two feebles states under the denominations of the
                    kingdoms of Westphalia and Saxony. But the grand object at present was
                    spoliation. In the treaty of Tilsitt continental Europe was sacrificed to the
                    ambition of the two emperors, who parcelled it out at their pleasure; the one
                    adjudging to himself the south and the west, the other the east and the north.
                    It appears, also, that, by a secret article, the expulsion of the Turks beyond
                    the Bosphorus had been determined on. But if such a convention was actually
                    agreed to, the Emperor Napoleon could not have seen far before him in politics,
                    whatever may have been the extent of his genius in military and administrative
                    affairs. For, to permit Russia to dismember the Ottoman empire, that is, to
                    establish herself in a given time at Constantinople, was, in effect, to deliver
                    up to her in a given time Italy and the Mediterranean, and, by a necessary
                    consequence, to abandon Europe, before the lapse of a century, to the barbarians
                    of the north. But the two emperors were mutually endeavouring to deceive each
                    other; and although soon after the peace of Tilsitt Alexander prided himself on
                    the friendship of Napoleon, as a gift of the gods, the latter repaid the
                    compliment by observing of his imperial brother, “He is as fair and false as a
                    Greek,” thereby showing that he understood his man.</p>
                <p>Be this as it may, however, the stipulations, whether avowed or secret, of the
                    treaty of Tilsitt, were nothing less than a league to enchain the world. Prussia
                    was annihilated; Spain and Sweden were directly menaced; Austria and Turkey were
                    prospectively endangered; England was of course devoted to ruin. Denmark
                    preserved a nominal neutrality; but, irritated by the violent and arbitrary
                    nautical maxims of Britain, particularly in regard to the right of search
                    claimed by her, and, moreover, placed in nearly the same relative situation to
                    France as Holland had formerly been, that northern power was, by the force of
                    circumstances, induced to adopt a line of policy adverse to the interests of
                    England. But latterly her position had changed for the worse. The exigencies of
                    Napoleon’s continental system required that Denmark should be obliged to shut
                    her ports against the commerce of Britain, and Holstein was already menaced by
                    the French troops which occupied Hamburg and Lubeck; whilst, on the other hand,
                    information received by the British government of what had secretly passed at
                    Tilsitt gave them reason to suspect that an attempt would be made on the part of
                    the French to occupy Denmark, and to appropri ate its fleet. To prevent such a
                    contingency, an expedition which had been fitted out for a different purpose was
                    dispatched to the Sound, and, on the refusal of the Danish government to
                    discontinue its relations with France, Copenhagen was attacked on the 7th of
                    September. After a bombardment of three days, and the burning of six hundred
                    houses, a capitulation was entered into, and the Danish fleet seized as a
                    deposit, to be restored at the conclusion of the war. This proceeding upon the
                    part of England was strongly censured at the time, and still merits severe
                    reprobation. In point of injustice, it equalled the worst deeds with which
                    Napoleon was reproached; and, in point of impolicy, it was not surpassed by the
                    most stupid act of violence ever before committed. Denmark immediately closed
                    her ports against England, declared war against that country, and soon
                    afterwards ( 16th October) concluded a treaty of alliance with France. Russia,
                    also, availed herself of the favourable opportunity thus afforded to announce
                    publicly her adoption of the continental system, to which she had already
                    secretly acceded, to break off all intercourse with England, to annul the
                    convention of the 17th June, and to proclaim of new the principles of the armed
                    neutrality.</p>
                <p>Napoleon was now in the zenith of his glory, victorious on every side, and
                    possessed of a power by land which' nothing seemed capable of withstanding.
                    Against Britain, on the other hand, the whole civilized world was now arrayed in
                    hostility. Russia, Austria, Prussia, France, Italy, Spain, were all in arms
                    against her; even Turkey, her ancient ally, had proved ungrateful; and,
                    excepting Sweden, which was misruled by a madman, and Portugal, which was
                    governed by a fool, all Europe was forbidden ground. Even the new world was
                    hostile from north to south; and, what was worst of all, a deep shade had been
                    cast on the justice of her cause by the ill-timed attack on Copenhagen. At this
                    time, too, the character of Napoleon stood fair; he had not misused victory
                    beyond what the morality of the world indulges to a conqueror; and if he had
                    abstained from aggression on the Peninsula, his power might, in a very few
                    years, have acquired a stability which would at length have compelled England,
                    however reluctantly, to sue for peace. His decline may be dated from the moment
                    when he intermeddled with the affairs of Spain and Portugal, and endeavoured to
                    convert these ancient and independent kingdoms into dependencies of France. The
                    unjustifiable nature of the aggression, and the unexampled perfidy and
                    profligacy with which it was prefaced and accompanied, destroyed him in the
                    opinion of Europe; whilst the contest in which he soon became involved in the
                    Peninsula preyed like an inveterate and daily spreading gangrene on the very
                    vitals of his power.</p>
                <p>The first object of attack was Portugal. On the 17th October, an army of about
                    twenty-seven thousand men, under the orders of Junot, marched from Bayonne for
                    Portugal. The professed object of this invasion was to enforce in that country
                    the adoption of the continental system. But, on the 27th of the same month, a
                    secret treaty was concluded at Fontainebleau, between the Emperor Napoleon and
                    the minister of Spain, by which Portugal was to be conquered, and the province
                    of Entre-Minho-e-Douro given to the king of Etruria in exchange for Tuscany;
                    whilst the Algarves and the Alemtejo were to be bestowed in sovereignty upon
                    Godoy, prince of the Peace, and favourite of the queen of Spain, and the
                    remainder, including Lisbon, was to be retained in reserve until a general
                    peace. This rapacious and unprincipled scheme, however, formed but a small part
                    of Napoleon’s design, which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515904"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-5904-0149"/>was to seize and occupy the entire Peninsula.
                    Accordingly, another corps of forty thousand men was ordered to assemble at
                    Bayonne, at latest by the 30th of November, to be in readiness to support Junot
                    in case the English should send assistance to Portugal, or even menace an
                    attack. Meanwhile that general continued his march to Lisbon, which he entered
                    with his advanced guard on the 30th of November. After much irresolution, the
                    court had at length determined to shut its ports against the English, in the
                    hope that this concession would stop the march of Junot; but, as might have been
                    expected, it proved wholly unavailing. Conquest, not concession, was the object
                    aimed at; the <hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi> announced that the house of
                    Braganza had ceased to reign; and the royal family hastened to fulfil the
                    declaration, by abandoning the country which they were incapable of defending.
                    The invaders had advanced with such rapidity along difficult roads, and were in
                    consequence so greatly harassed and disorganized, that a few thousand resolute
                    troops would have knocked them all on the head; but the court thought only of
                    flight, not resistance, and the country was meanly surrendered to a parcel of
                    toil-worn conscripts, without a single blow being struck in its defence. The
                    escape of the family of Braganza, however, may nevertheless be considered as the
                    first check which the fortune of Napoleon received on the Continent. The odious
                    nature of this enterprise exceeded even the iniquity of the invasions of
                    Switzerland and Egypt; two acts of aggression executed without any previous
                    declaration, and directly contrary to the faith of treaties.</p>
                <p>We have already noticed Napoleon’s Berlin decree. Another dated from Milan, the
                    17th of December, contained new measures against the commerce and maritime
                    system of Great Britain. After reference to certain orders in council, issued by
                    the British government, in virtue of which the vessels of neutral powers were
                    not only subjected to search by the English cruisers, but also made liable to
                    detention and to an arbitrary impost, it decreed, first, that every vessel, of
                    whatsoever nation, which should have undergone search by any English cruiser, or
                    performed a voyage to England, or paid a duty to the English government, became
                    thereby denationalised, in other words, lost the protection of its flag, and
                    became English property; secondly, that all such vessels were good and lawful
                    prize of war; and, thirdly, that the British islands were in a state of blockade
                    by sea as well as by land, and that every vessel, of whatsoever nation, which
                    had cleared out from ports in England, or entered into any of these, might be
                    lawfully captured. It was added, that the dispositions contained in this decree
                    would become null whenever England adopted as the rule of her conduct the
                    principles of the law of nations, which were also those of justice and humanity.
                    It must be confessed that this decree embodied a measure of retaliation which,
                    in the circumstances, was allowable. In discarding the maxim that neutral
                    bottoms make neutral goods, England could appeal to no other sanction but that
                    of force. In the law of nations, the maritime sovereignty, which she seems to
                    have considered as an acquired and incontestible right, found no support; and
                    the code which she adopted was viewed by other countries as a system of
                    organized piracy, differing but little in principle from that exercised by the
                    buccaneers and the Algerines. It was never before maintained that the law of
                    war, and the right of conquest thence derived, extended to peaceable and unarmed
                    citizens, to private habitations and properties, to merchandise of commerce and
                    the warehouses which contained or the vehicles which transported it, to unarmed
                    vessels which plied upon the rivers or navigated the seas; in a word, to the
                    persons and properties of private individuals. But in giving it this
                    unprecedented and unjust extension, Great Britain necessarilyexposed herself to
                    retaliation, and the avowed principles óſ her maritime policy left her without
                    the smallest right to complain of such measures as those embodied in the Berlin
                    and Milan decrees.</p>
                <p>Napoleon had now realised one part of his scheme respecting the Peninsula.
                    Portugal was occupied by his troops, and it now remained to complete his design
                    by seizing on Spain. With this view a second army, under Dupont, crossed the
                    Pyrenees about the same time that Junot entered Portugal, and a third followed
                    on the first days of 1808. In fact, all the disposable troops of France were
                    secretly pouring into Spain. In a short time San Sebastian, Pampeluna, Figueras,
                    and even the forts ol Barcelona, were in the hands of the French; who, by a
                    mixture of artifice and audacity, easily contrived to dispossess the imbecile
                    governors and invalid garrisons to whom these fortresses had been confided. As
                    if by magic, the whole line of defence which covered the Pyrenean frontier fell
                    into the hands of the French. The imbecility, not to say profligacy, of the
                    rulers of Spain, bad afforded not only a pretext, but an occasion for this
                    unexampled aggression. The prince of Asturias, indignant at the influence
                    possessed by Godoy, had secretly addressed himself to Napoleon, and, as a pledge
                    of his sincerity, solicited a wife of the Bonaparte family; whilst, on the other
                    hand, Charles IV., on discovering the machinations of his son, complained to the
                    French imperial court of his undutiful conduct. Napoleon, thus constituted a
                    sort of umpire in the quarrel, gave promises to both parties, sent a splendid
                    present to the king, and at the same time issued orders to his generals to seize
                    the principal fortresses in the north of Spain. This last proceeding opened the
                    eyes of Charles, and even of Godoy; but it was already too late. The keys of the
                    kingdom were in the hands of the French; and those worthless personages who,
                    only a few months before, had plotted with Napoleon the dethronement of the
                    house of Braganxa, were now, by a righteous retribution, reduced to seek safety
                    in flight. Preparations were accordingly made for retiring to Cadiz, and the
                    royal party were ready to commence the journey to that port, when the population
                    of Aranjuez, raised by the partisans of Ferdinand, stopped the carriages, and
                    prevented the flight. But matters did not rest here. The tumult thus excited
                    swelled into an insurrection; Godoy’s house was attacked, in the hope of
                    sacrificing the hated favourite as a victim to popular vengeance; and Charles
                    was compelled to abdicate in favour of his son, who was proclaimed king by the
                    style and title of Ferdinand VII. Charles, however, protested against the act as
                    void, because compulsory, and sent his protest to Napoleon, accompanied by a
                    letter from the queen; but as this letter passed through the hands of Murat,
                    who, with a body of troops, had advanced as far as Burgos, that officer
                    immediately marched upon Madrid. The aìłair now became complicated. Ferdinand
                    reckoned on the support of the French; the abdicated monarch did the same;
                    whilst the people, delighted with the fall of Godoy, hailed the new king as the
                    deliverer of his country, and as a sovereign destined to revive its ancient
                    splendour. Raised to the throne by an insurrection, the popularity of Ferdinand
                    was unbounded. Nothing, in fact, could exceed the favour and enthusiasm with
                    which he was regarded by the nation, except the innate worthlessness of the
                    object on which it was lavished. But, in every view, Ferdinand was not a monarch
                    suited to the purposes of Napoleon, or calculated, even as a tributary, to
                    advance his views. It became necessary, therefore, to remove him from Madrid,
                    where the loyal frenzy of the population gave him force, and then to decide
                    according to circumstances in what way he and the other members of <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193515917" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5917-0150"/> his family should
                    be disposed of. With this view Savary was sent to entice him to Bayonne; and
                    Ferdinand, more willing to rely on the French emperor than on the Spanish
                    nation, resolved to propitiate Napoleon by giving him the meeting, which, he was
                    led to believe, would take place within the Spanish territory. In this, however,
                    he was deceived. Filled with hopes of meeting Napoleon at every post, he was
                    enticed on until he had crossed the Bidassoa, when his eyes were at last opened.
                    Napoleon did not receive him as king of Spain. But he was now in the snare, and
                    escape impossible. Charles and his queen also arrived at Bayonne, where Napoleon
                    was about to decide the quarrel of the Spanish royal family in his own favour.
                    Their mutual recriminations were alike disgusting and disgraceful; the queen
                    impeached the legitimacy of her son in the presence of her husband; and
                    Ferdinand retorted by applying to his mother epithets which her unblushing
                    immoralities but too well merited. All this had probably been foreseen and
                    calculated on. At all events, Íjretending to identify the nation with its
                    rulers, Napo-eon, taking advantage of the degrading exhibition made by the
                    latter, resolved to set aside the reigning house, and to substitute a new one of
                    his own in its stead. But in the mean while the news of the insurrection of
                    Madrid, on the 2d of May, had reached Bayonne, and the French emperor saw that
                    no time was to be lost. Through the influence of Godoy, Charles was induced to
                    resign his crown in favour of Napoleon; threats overcame the stubbornness of
                    Ferdinand; and the Spanish royal family having played the part required of them,
                    were sent off, the old king and queen to Fontainebleau, and the princes to
                    Valençay. A hundred and fifty Spanish nobles, who had been mostly gained over to
                    the French interest, were then summoned to assemble at Bayonne, where they met
                    in June, assumed the name of the Spanish Cortes, and submissively received
                    Joseph Bonaparte as king of Spain and the Indies. The events which followed the
                    consummation of this detestable juggle belong partly to the history of Spain and
                    partly to that of Britain, to which heads, accordingly, the reader is referred.
                    The nation had been no party to these infamous transactions, by which its honour
                    was insulted, and its independence assailed, if not destroyed. A patriotic
                    spirit burst forth; the insurrection of Madrid produced similar movements all
                    over the country; the nation roused itself from the lethargy in which it had
                    been long sunk; the aid of Britain was solicited and obtained; and in a little
                    time that contest commenced, which was destined to terminate in the deliverance
                    of the Peninsula, and the overthrow of Napoleon himself. See the articles <hi

                    often shown in their pasquils. Soon after the affair of the 2d of May, the
                    following epigram was attached to a proclamation affixed by the French to the
                    waUs of Madrid, and addressed to the Spaniards:</p><p>En la plaza hai un cartel,

                    necessary to subjoin any translation of this national epigram; but, to give our
                    readers some idea of the means employed to stimulate and perpetuate a hatred of
                    the French, we shaU give in English an excerpt from a catechism generally
                    circulated in 8pain about this time, and which parents were enjoined to teach
                    their children. “Tell me, my dear child, who are you? A spaniard, by the grace
                    of God. what do you mean by that? A person of respectability, who is the enemy
                    of our happiness? The emperor of the French, who is he? A wicked man, the source
                    of all that is evil, the destroyer of all that is good, and the centre of every
                    vice. How many natures has he? Two, the human and the diabolical. How many
                    emperors of the French are there? One veritable, in three deceitful persons,
                    what are the names of these persons? Napoleon, Murat, and Manuel Godoy, which of
                    the three is the most wicked? They are all equally so. Of whom is Napoleon
                    derived? Of Sin. Murat? Of Napoleon. And Godoy? Of the fornication of the other
                    two. What is the spirit of the first? Pride and despotism, of the second? Rapine
                    and cruelty. Of the third? Cupidity, treachery, and ignorance. Who are the
                    French? Men once Christians, who have become heretics. What punishment does the
                    Spaniard deserve who fails in performing his duty? The death and infamy of
                    traitors. How ought the Spaniards to conduct themselves? According to the maxims
                    of our Lord Jesus Christ. Who will deliver us from our enemies? Mutual
                    confidence and arms. Is it a sin to put a Frenchman to death? No, father; he
                    will gain heaven who shaU kill one of these dogs of heretics.” A people who
                    would teach their children such a manual of doctrine as this might easily be
                    expected to begin by exemplifying in their own actions the precepts which are
                    here inculcated.</p></note> soon assumed a shape which left no doubt that it
                    would operate as a serious drain upon France. The proclamation of the intrusive
                    King Joseph was the signal for the general outbreaking of the spirit of
                    resistance, which, as in almost all popular commotions, displayed itself in acts
                    of sanguinary vengeance. The French were assailed and massacred in most of the
                    towns; the soldiers made common cause with the people; and those commanders who
                    sought to resist the general will were mercilessly sacrificed. The flower of the
                    Spanish army had been marched to the north of Europe; but the void was soon
                    filled up, and in a few weeks insurgent armies made their appearance in all
                    parts of the Peninsula. In the first encounters, indeed in most general actions,
                    the French, as might have been expected, were successful; and the defeat of
                    Blake and Cuesta at Rio Seco seemed the battle of Almanza to the new dynasty.
                    But Lefebvre, though successful in the field, was repulsed from Zaragoza; and
                    Dupont, after an unsuccessful attempt to reach Cadiz, was intercepted in his
                    retreat across the Sierra Morena, and obliged to surrender at Baylen. These
                    successes kept alive the national spirit, and encouraged the Spaniards to hope
                    that their efforts would ultimately be crowned with success. Meanwhile the flame
                    of insurrection had spread to Portugal, where the inhabitants rose against
                    Junotŷ and united with the Spaniards in asserting their independence. The
                    British government availed themselves of the opportunity thus offered. In the
                    end of July 1808, Sir Arthur Wellesley landed at the mouth of the Mondego, to
                    the north of Lisbon, with about fifteen thousand men; and, after a short but
                    brilliant campaign, terminating in the battle and victory of Vimicro (21st
                    August), Portugal was, in virtue of the convention of Cintra, cleared of the
                    enemy.</p>
                <p>The court of Vienna now began to show signs of returning spirit, and, encouraged
                    by the events in Spain and Portugal, armed, increased the regular force, and
                    organized a landwehr. At a public levee held in August, Napoleon took the
                    opportunity to reproach Metternich, the Austrian envoy, with these preparations;
                    but the intelligence received from the Peninsula, together with certain <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193515930" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5930-0151"/> appearances of
                    the commencement of a re-action, gave hardihood to German independence. Resolved
                    openly to insult, if not to menace Austria, Napoleon, in September, held a
                    meeting with the emperor of Russia at Erfurth, where, as at Tilsitt, great
                    European interests were discussed, and Austria was again excluded as a secondary
                    power. On the part of the French emperor this was the consummation of that
                    foolish insolence which is begotten of success. Being thus insulted, trampled
                    on, and despised, Austria determined, though alone, and opposed instead of being
                    supported by Russia, to renew the struggle with France; but her effort was
                    reserved for the year 1809. Napoleon foresaw the storm which was gathering, and,
                    that he might be prepared to meet it with undivided means, made preparations to
                    extinguish by one grand effort the insurrection in Spain, and to settle the
                    government of that country. From Erľurth he issued orders to his veterans to
                    march to the Pyrenees, and by the beginning of November he had himself crossed
                    these mountains, and established himself at Vittoria. Napoleon was now in the
                    midst of the Spanish armies, with a greatly superior force; and as they were
                    disseminated on a lengthened and irregular line, so as to be incapable of acting
                    in concert or affording mutual support, his plan was to crush them one after
                    another, by means of rapid movements executed with overwhelming masses.
                    Accordingly, from the central position of Vittoria, he attacked and defeated
                    Blake at Espinosa, overthrew Belvedere near Burgos, and totally routed Castanos
                    at Tudela; so that whilst the English were slowly advancing into Spain, one
                    column by a circuitous route, the armies with which they had expected to
                    co-operate were completely swept from the field. Napoleon now pushed forward to
                    Madrid, which, after a vain stand made in the passes of the Somosierra, and a
                    show of resistance when he approached the walls, he entered in the beginning of
                    December. Here, however, he remained but a short time. Having passed some
                    decrees intended to conciliate the liberal Spaniards, having abolished the
                    Inquisition, suppressed the convents, and made a variety of judicious and
                    salutary regulations, he turned his arms against the English, whose principal
                    force was assembled in the neighbourhood of Salamanca; crossed the Guadarama
                    range in the depth of winter at the head of eighty thousand men; and advanced
                    with incredible velocity upon Astorga, the strategic point, in order to cut off
                    their retreat. But his skilful combinations and rapid execution were defeated by
                    the masterly retreat of the English general Sir John Moore; and Napoleon,
                    finding that the enemy had escaped him, left Soult to continue the pursuit,
                    galloped back to Burgos, and thence hurried to Paris. The preparations of
                    Austria, of which he had received fresh intelligence whilst proceeding against
                    the British, required his immediate presence in the capital to watch the
                    movements of that power.</p>
                <p>A fifth continental coalition had already been formed. Availing herself of the
                    diversion occasioned by the events in the Peninsula, Austria had armed; whilst
                    in France new conscriptions were ordered, and the imperial guard, hastily
                    recalled from the pursuit of the British, marched against the Austrians on the
                    Danube. The war seemed interminable; and Talleyrand’s prediction was in course
                    of being realised. The court of Vienna had made incredible exertions, and an
                    army of nearly two hundred thousand men, commanded by the Archduke Charles,
                    menaced France and Italy; whilst another, in Gallicia, was intended to oppose
                    whatever forces Russia might bring into the field to support her new ally. On
                    the 9th of April the Austrians crossed the Inn at Brunnau and at Scharding, and
                    the Salza at Burghausen; the Archduke .Charles declaring to the commandant of
                    the French troops stationed in Bavaria that he was about to advance, and would
                    treat as enemies all who should resist him. On the 15th hostilities also
                    commenced in Italy, and the following day the French under Eugene Beauharnais
                    were completely defeated at Pordenone, on the Tagliamento. Napoleon, on
                    receiving the first tidings of the advance of the Austrians, hurried from Paris,
                    and at Dillingen met the king of Bavaria, who had been forced to abandon his
                    capital. The French, in fact, were quite unprepared for the adoption of such a
                    vigorous offensive on the part of the Austrians; and the corps of Davoμst, which
                    Berthier had stationed at Ratisbon, was so much in advance as to be seriously
                    compromised. But Davoust took upon himself the responsibility of executing a
                    flank march from that city upon Abensberg; checked the advance of the Austrian
                    army at Tann; gave his hand (as the military phrase is) to the Bavarians; and
                    thus prepared for Napoleon, who was on the point of arriving, the means of
                    penetrating the enemy’s line, and beating in succession the two great Austrian
                    corps under the Archdukes Louis and Charles. Upon the 20th Napoleon defeated, at
                    Abensberg, the corps under the orders of the Archduke Louis and General Hiller,
                    after an engagement of only an hour and a half. Great advantages resulted from
                    this success, which, upon the following day, forced the Austrians to abandon
                    nine thousand prisoners, thirty pieces of cannon, six hundred ammunition
                    waggons, three thousand vehicles of various sorts, and three pontoon trains. On
                    the 22d, the archduke directed his efforts against Davoust, who was in position
                    at Eckmuhl; but the portion of the army under Napoleon, which had followed to
                    Landshut the corps defeated at Abensberg, rapidly countermarched, and having
                    appeared on the left flank of the Austrians, compelled the archduke to abandon
                    his position and cross the Danube. Thus, after a campaign of a week, on almost
                    every day of which a victory had been gained, the French emperor was enabled to
                    send forth one of his astounding proclamations, announcing the capture of a
                    hundred pieces of cannon, fifty thousand prisoners, and forty stand of colours.
                    Davoust, to whom the last success had been mainly owing, was created Prince of
                    Eckmuhl on the field of battle.</p>
                <p>The archduke having crossed the Danube at Ratisbon, retreated into Bohemia, no
                    doubt in the hope of drawing the French after him in pursuit; but Napoleon
                    preferred marching along the right bank towards Vienna. This, however, was not
                    effected without opposition. At Ebersberg, a large town situated upon the right
                    bank of the Traun, three leagues from Lintz, there occurred, on the 4th of May,
                    one of the most sanguinary combats on record. The French generals, acting under
                    the eye of their chief, attempted to carry this strong position at the first
                    onset, and without hesitation sacrificed five thousand men, who were either
                    drowned in the torrent, destroyed by the musketry, overwhelmed amidst the
                    rubbish, or consumed by the flames of the houses, to which the enemy set fire on
                    beating a retreat;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    these dead, baked by the fire, trodden under the feet of the cavalry and the
                    wheels of the artillery, all forming a mass of mud, which, as it was removed by
                    shovels, emitted an undescribable odour of burned human flesh, and caused a
                    sensation horrible even amongst the every-dav horrors of war." In passing
                    cobom’s Corsican regiment, which bad headed the attack, Napoleon inquired
                    respecting its loss.’ "’we have just one more charge left,” replied the officer,
                    pointing to the surviving half of the regiment. « A ce jour," says the Abbé

                    />seeing that Marshal Lannes had already turned the position, and rendered the
                    retreat of the enemy inevitable. On the 13th of May, exactly a month after the
                    Austrians had commenced the war, Vienna was occupied for the second time by the
                    French army, though not until it had stood a bombardment of thirty-six hours.
                    The resources in munitions of war found in the Austrian capital were sufficient
                    for a campaign. The imperial family and the court had, as before, abandoned the
                    city to its fate. Meanwhile the Archduke Charles had, by a circuitous march
                    through Bohemia, reached· the left bank of the Danube opposite Vienna. More
                    prudent than in 1805, the Austrians had destroyed every bridge on the river;
                    and, on the other hand, it became necessary to the French to cross the stream
                    and put an end to the war by victory, ere insurrections could be organized in
                    their rear, or the want of subsistence should compel them to retreat. But how
                    was this to be effected in presence of an active and vigilant enemy?</p>
                <p>The river Danube, which now separated the hostile armies, is divided below Vienna
                    into three unequal arms or branches. From the right bank to the first island,
                    which is about a mile in circumference, the distance is two hundred and forty
                    toises; and from this to the great island, where is the principal current, the
                    canal is in width about eighty toises. The great island, called In-der-Lobau, is
                    about seven miles in circumference, and the canal which separates it from the
                    left bank is nearly eighty toises in breadth. Napoleon having thrown bridges, by
                    means of which his troops were enabled to pass from the right bank into the
                    islands, and thence to the left bank, attacked the Archduke Charles in position
                    behind the villages of Gross-Aspern and Essling, about three leagues north of
                    Vienna. After several murderous attempts in a confined space, where the French
                    maintained an obstinate struggle against superior forces and a formidable
                    artillery, the assailants were repulsed; and about the same moment the bridges
                    were carried away by a sudden rise of the river, thus leaving them without
                    ammunition, or the means of sheltering themselves from the fire of the enemy,
                    which now plunged incessantly into their disordered ranks. But the tenacity of
                    Massena saved the wrecks of the French army, which in the night operated its
                    retreat into the island of Lobau, the bridge between which and the left bank had
                    been temporarily repaired. This terrible battle, which lasted during the greater
                    part of two days, was fought on the 21st and 22d of May. The loss of the French
                    was enormous. Lannes was mortally wounded; three generals fell, a hundred and
                    twenty-eight officers and six thousand soldiers were killed; thirteen generals,
                    seven hundred officers, and eighteen thousand soldiers, were wounded; fourteen
                    officers and three thousand soldiers were made prisoners. The loss sustained by
                    the Austrians was by no means so great.</p>
                <p>After the battle of Essling the reputation of Napoleon as a general and a man of
                    resolution was much diminished; for he had not taken any adequate precaution
                    against the contingency of retreat, and at the moment when the danger was most
                    imminent he quitted the left bank of the Danube in a miserable barque,
                    accompanied by Berthier, and Czernicheff, aide-de-camp to the emperor of Russia,
                    in order to get under cover on the right bank. The news of his defeat also
                    spread the flames of insurrection, and gave the first impulse to that spirit of
                    resistance by which he was a few years afterwards overthrown. The Tyrolese rose
                    against the Bavarians; associations, under the denomination of the Tugenbund,
                    were formed for working out the independence of Germany; and the adventurous
                    enterprises of the young Duke of Brunswick and of Major Schill afforded abundant
                    evidence of the hostile disposition by which the people of the north and east
                    were ani mated towards their oppressors; although the climate of Germany, and
                    the character of its inhabitants, as well as the force and centralization of
                    government, rendered the Spanish System of resistance impracticable in that
                    country.</p>
                <p>The French, forced back to the right bank of the Danube by their defeat at
                    Essling, established themselves in the great island of Lobau; and both armies,
                    separated only by the northern branch of the Danube, sixty yards wide, remained
                    in observation during six weeks, carefully retrenching their respective
                    positions. At length, on the night between the 4th and 5th of July, the French
                    having constructed bridges lower down the stream, crossed to the left bank,
                    where a warm combat ensued with the left wing of the Austrian army, posted near
                    the small town of Enzersdorff, which was reduced to ashes. The archduke had
                    fortified his position and made preparations to oppose the French, on the
                    supposition that they would attempt to cross by the original bridge opposite
                    Essling, which Napoleon had ordered to be repaired. But these repairs had only
                    been made by Napoleon to deceive his antagonist; and by crossing lower down the
                    river he rendered all the preparations and batteries of the archduke unavailing;
                    for, instead of fronting the Danube, the latter was now obliged to extend his
                    line perpendicularly to the river, from Aspern to Wagram, a village situated
                    five leagues north-north-east of Vienna, and thence to a small river on his
                    extreme left. The 5th was spent in manoeuvring, and in fruitless attempts to
                    dislodge the French from the village of Enzersdorff. Both armies slept on the
                    field, and on the 6th at day-break commenced the famous battle of Wagram. The
                    Austrian centre was posted on the high ground near the village, which the
                    archduke believed to be too strong to be forced; and accordingly he threw the
                    greater part of his force into his wings. This error lost him the battle. The
                    Austrian right attacked and overthrew Massena, who commanded the French left,
                    driving him back with such fury that his four divisions were crowded into one.
                    Davoust opposed a firmer resistance to the Austrian left; but still he had great
                    difficulty in maintaining his ground. In this situation Napoleon resolved to
                    allow his wings to resist as they might, and to bring the whole of his
                    disposable force to bear upon the Austrian centre at Wagram. Lauriston
                    accordingly advanced against it with a hundred pieces of cannon; Macdonald
                    followed Lauriston with the infantry; and Bessières supported the attack with
                    the cavalry of the imperial guard. This combined effort succeeded. The artillery
                    made breaches in the Austrian line; the French, aided by a diversion on the
                    extreme right, rushed into the openings; the centre was forced; and the corps
                    victorious over Massena, being now taken in flank, was also obliged to retire.
                    The different portions of the Austrian army being thus separated from one
                    another, the archduke withdrew from the field; but the French had suffered far
                    too much to follow him. In fact, the battle of Essling had damped the courage of
                    the French; and at Wagram they fought faintly, except when urged on by some bold
                    and determined leader. The loss on both sides was enormous; that of the French
                    exceeding thirty-five thousand men killed and wounded. Wagram was therefore a
                    victory, but not such a victory as that of Marengo or Austerlitz. The hostile
                    army was defeated, but neither destroyed nor intercepted; and the Archduke
                    Charles, still formidable in force, withdrew into Moravia to await the arrival
                    of his brother’s army, repair his losses, and prolong the campaign.</p>
                <p>Napoleon therefore deemed it prudent to make peace. ] His power was in fact
                    shaken. Most of the veterans of the Italian wars had perished; the army of
                    Essling and Wagram was no longer that of Austerlitz; and this alarming truth had
                    been spoken out even at the imperial head-quarters<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193515956" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5956-0153"/>. Accordingly an armistice
                    was concluded about the middle of July, and conferences with a view to peace
                    having soon afterwards commenced at the palace of Schonbrunn, near Vienna, were
                    continued until the 14th of October, when a treaty was signed, by which Austria
                    ceded, in favour of the sovereigns of the confederation of the Rhine, Saltzburg,
                    Bergtolsgaden, and part of Upper Austria; to the French, Gorice, Monteſalcone,
                    Trieste, the circle of Villach in Carinthia, and all the countries situated on
                    the right of the Saave, as far as the frontier of Turkish Croatia; to the grand
                    duchy of Warsaw, all western Ga)licia, with Cracow, as well as the circle of
                    Zamose in eastern Gallicia; and to Russia, a small territory in the most eastern
                    part of Gallicia, containing a population of four hundred souls. The emperor of
                    Austria also recognised all the changes which had already been made or might
                    subsequently take place in Spain and Portugal; he adhered to the prohibitive
                    system adopted by France and Russia against England; and he engaged to
                    discontinue all commercial relations with “the enemy of the Continent.” The
                    memoir writers of the day are pleased to imagine that Napoleon was terrified
                    into making peace by the discovery of a design upon the part of a fanatical
                    young German to assassinate him. But his views were at once more manly and more
                    profound. Even in his proudest day of power he had acknowledged the necessity of
                    having one great ally attached to his interests; and this was what he now sought
                    to obtain. Prussia had played him false, and forced him to destroy her; Russia
                    was evidently not to be depended upon; Austria yet remained to be tried, and
                    this trial was now made. Napoleon had no heir of his body; an adopted son of his
                    brother Louis had died; and his proposal to a Russian princess had been received
                    with a coldness amounting to disdain, which proved to him the insincerity of
                    Russian alliance. At Schonbrunn the same idea was now suggested with respect to
                    Austria; and the Emperor Francis, appreciating the advantage of such a
                    connection, acceded to the proposal. Accordingly Josephine was divorced to make
                    way for a bride of the house of Hapsburg, and, on the 10th of March 1810, the
                    Archduchess Maria Louisa became the new empress of the French.</p>
                <p>In what remains of tħe history of France we must confine ourselves to a mere
                    abridgment of events which are not of very great importance, this branch of the
                    general article having already exceeded its due proportion; but what is omitted
                    here will be found under the other heads to which reference is made. The
                    occurrences of 1810 and 1811 are chiefly important with reference to an
                    approaching struggle with Russia. On the 6th of January 1810 a treaty of peace
                    between France and Sweden was signed at Paris. On the 7th of February the
                    convention of marriage between the Emperor Napoleon and the Archduchess Maria
                    Louisa, daughter of Francis L, emperor of Austria, was concluded. On the 17th
                    the Roman states were, by a decree of the senate, incorporated with the French
                    empire. On the 19th April the provinces of Caraccas, Cumana, Barinas, Margarita,
                    Barcelona, Merida, and Truxillo, in Spanish South America, formed a federative
                    government under the name of the American Confederation of Venezuela, but
                    without separating themselves from the mother country, although this first step
                    necessarily led eventually to such a result. Early in July, Napoleon, having
                    made a declaration against the government of Holland, which he accused of having
                    converted the Dutch ports into entrepôts of English commerce, recalled his
                    brother Louis, and, by an imperial decree, ordained the incorporation of Holland
                    with France. On the 21st of August, Bernadotte, prince of Ponte Corvo, was named
                    hereditary prince royal of Sweden, by the states-general of the kingdom,
                    convoked in an extraordinary diet for the election of a'successor to the throne,
                    to which, upon the abdication or rather expulsion of Gustavus IV. the Duke of
                    Sudermania had been raised by the title of Charles XIII. Towards the latter end
                    of September Sicily was threatened with invasion by a force under the orders of
                    Murat, the new king of Naples; but the threat ended in a mere demonstration,
                    having for its alleged object to draw English troops into the island. On the
                    13th of December a hundred and sixty thousand men of the conscription of 1811
                    were placed at the disposal of the government. The relations of France with
                    Russia had, in the opinion of Napoleon, rendered this measure necessary. On the
                    29th of December the state renounced the successions of the emigrants which had
                    devolved to it during so many years; and thus the revolutionary laws of the 28th
                    March 1793 and the 28th April 1795 were abrogated. For the events which occurred
                    in Spain during the years 1809,1810,1811, and the following years, the reader is
                    referred to the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Britain</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Spain</hi></p>
                <p>Napoleon, when in St Helena, asserted that the origin of his quarrel with
                    Alexander, which led to the invasion of Russia in 1812, was his opposition to
                    the czar’s views upon Turkey; views, it may be added, which the autocrat of all
                    the Russias had been led to entertain at Tilsitt; and Bignon confirms the
                    statement of Napoleon. “From the conferences of 1807,” says that historian,
                    “sprung the germ that was to be fatal to Napoleon. To force England to make
                    peace conformably to the alliance of Tilsitt, Russia was to act against Sweden,
                    and France against Portugal; or, to translate more freely the ideas of the two
                    emperors, Russia left to Napoleon full liberty of action over the south of
                    Europe, France abandoning to Alexander similar liberty in the north with respect
                    to Sweden, and moreover allowing him a certain measure of tolerance on the side
                    of Turkey. In consequence of these reciprocal concessions, France found herself
                    engaged in the horrible Spanish war; Russia in one of which the dangers were
                    insignificant, the acquisition being Finland. Napoleon then imagined that
                    Finland might content Alexander; but he was deceived. For a moment Napoleon had
                    admitted the possibility of partitioning the Ottoman empire. This contingency
                    Alexander assumed as a certainty; and his constant demands were on the subject
                    of this partition. But Napoleon constantly refused, and from a double motive;
                    the first political, because the lot of France, magnificent as it appeared, was
                    but a source of peril and embarrassment, whilst that of Russia had proved all
                    substantial and positive value; the second miiitary, because he looked on the
                    Turkish empire as a morass which prevented Russia attacking him on his right.”
                    And hence, it is said, arose the gradual coolness between the two emperors. But
                    there were other sources of grievance. In the campaign of Wagram, Napoleon had
                    perceived the lukewarmness of Russia; whilst the aggrandisement of the duchy of
                    Warsaw, which might swell out into an independent kingdom of Poland, made
                    Alexander tremble for Lithuania. The occupation of the duchy of Oldenburg,
                    belonging to a prince nearly allied to the emperor of Russia, formed another
                    cause of complaint and recrimination. On the other hand, Alexander, who had
                    already relaxed in his observance of the continental system, which had destroyed
                    the trade of his subjects, abrogated it in part towards the close of 1810, and
                    thereby snapt asunder the last remaining tie between France and Russia.</p>
                <p>The seeds of war being thus freely sown, preparations were made on both sides for
                    the struggle which had now-become inevitable. Those of Napoleon were immense.
                    From France he drew every soldier the utmost rigour of the conscription laws
                    would supply; Italy on the one side, and Holland on the other, were required to
                    contribute their legions; the contingents of the confederated states <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193515969" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5969-0154"/> of the Rhine were
                    ordered to be in readiness; Austria consented to furnish forty thousand men; and
                    Prussia, however willing to throw her remaining strength into the scale of
                    Russia, was forced by dire necessity to yield up the remains of her army, her
                    fortresses, and even her very capital, to the French forces. All continental
                    Europe in arms seemed about to pour upon Russia; whilst Poland, expecting her
                    independence, was calling upon Lithuania, the spoil of Catharine, to welcome the
                    host of invaders. On the other hand, by the mismanagement of Napoleon, Sweden,
                    though smarting under the loss of her fairest province, Finland, was thrown into
                    the arms of Russia; and, through his neglect, British influence so far prevailed
                    at Constantinople, that the sultan was induced to abandon the tempting
                    opportunity, of which he might have taken advantage, when Russia was hard
                    pressed by a powerful antagonist, and even to conclude a peace with the ancient
                    and inveterate foe of the Ottoman name. The fact is, that about this time
                    Napoleon began to be very ill served in the civil and diplomatic branches of
                    affairs. Talleyrand and Fouché were both in disgrace, and he in vain endeavoured
                    to supply their places with statesmen of his own creation. Men of their approved
                    talents and experience, with clear heads, penetrating discernment, and cool
                    sagacity, were not every-day productions. In diplomacy, where the essential
                    requisites are knowledge of mankind and of courts, together with superiority of
                    address, and an almost intuitive insight into affairs, Napoleon felt and
                    lamented this deficiency; and he himself owned, that had he retained Talleyrand
                    in his service, the Russian (he might have also added the Spanish) war would
                    have been avoided. In high views of policy, and conceptions worthy the head of a
                    great state, Napoleon was alike eminent; he also foresaw the perils of an
                    insurrection in the Peninsula, should it become general, and the
                    unseasonableness as well as necessity, circumstanced as he was, of a war with
                    Russia; but want of tact in his subordinate agents hurried on both these
                    calamities. The rashness and precipitation of Murat, whilst at Madrid, embroiled
                    Spain; and negotiations carried on through generals and aides-de-camp marred all
                    hopes of reconciliation with Russia. Sensible of this, Napoleon made choice of
                    the Count de Narbonne, a noble and a liberal emigrant, to proceed on a mission
                    to Russia; and with the same feeling, probably, he selected and sent to Warsaw
                    the Abbé de Pradt, archbishop of Malines. But men qualified for such high and
                    responsible diplomatic situations cannot be produced even by an imperial
                    improvisation; and it would be difficult to say which proved the more
                    unsatisfactory envoy, the archbishop or the aide-de-camp.</p>
                <p>After two years of preparation, the rupture became imminent. On the 24th of March
                    1812, a treaty of alliance was concluded between Russia and Sweden, by which
                    Norway was promised to the latter, and the prince-royal, Bernadotte, agreed to
                    take the field with a Russian corps under his orders; and to this treaty Great
                    Britain acceded in the beginning of May. On the 24th of April the emperor of
                    Russia left St Petersburg to join his army, then in position upon the western
                    frontier of Lithuania; and on the 9th of May Napoleon set out from Paris for
                    Dresden, which had been fixed upon as tþe rendezvous of his allies. Professions
                    of peace, as usual, preceded the commencement of hostilities; and at the same
                    time that Napoleon quitted Paris for Germany, the Count de Narbonne was sent to
                    the head-quarters of the Emperor Alexander. Meanwhile, the court assembled at
                    Dresden was such as Europe had never before witnessed. The emperor of Austria
                    and the king of Prussia were amongst those who, on this occasion, waited upon
                    Napoleon; whilst kings and princes of inferior rank crowded the antechambers,
                    and jostled one another in the saloons of the conqueror. Here the represen
                    tative of the French Revolution found in attendance at his levees those
                    sovereigns who had combined to crush it; and the new Charlemagne, whose title to
                    the imperial purple had been consecrated by victory, seemed in a fair way of
                    realizing his own prediction, that his family would soon be the oldest of
                    Europe. It appears as if fortune, before abandoning him, had indulged her
                    spoiled favourite with this parting pageant. Napoleon awaited at Dresden the
                    return of the Count de Narbonne, who arrived on the 28th of May. The latter had
                    seen the Emperor Alexander, and had found him inflexible, but neither elated nor
                    despondent. The czar considered the cause as that of the independence of his
                    nation, and conceived that in maintaining it defeat would not be inglorious. On
                    receiving these tidings, Napoleon quitted Dresden, proceeded to join the army,
                    and, on the 22d of June, declared war against Russia, from his head-quarters at
                    Wilkowiski, near Gumbinen, in Eastern Prussia. “Soldiers,” said he, “the second
                    war of Poland has commenced. The first terminated at Tilsitt. AtTilsitt Russia
                    swore eternal alliance with France, and eternal war against England. She has now
                    violated her oaths-Russia is hurried on by a fatality; her destiny must be
                    accomplished. Does she suppose us degenerated? Let us advance, cross the
                    Nietnen, and carry the war into her own territory. The second war of Poland will
                    be as glorious to the French arms as the first.”</p>
                <p>The army of Napoleon, at once the finest and most for-1 midable which France had
                    ever sent beyond her own ter-1 ritory, amounted to nearly five hundred thousand
                    comba-^ tants, with about twelve hundred pieces of artillery. This* army was
                    divided into ten corps. The first corps, composed of five fine divisions of
                    infantry and one of cavalry, was under Marshal Davoust; the second was commanded
                    by Marshal Oudinot; the third was under the orders of Marshal Ney; the fourth,
                    known under the name of the army of Italy, was commanded by Eugene Beauharnais;
                    the fifth consisted of the Poles, under Prince Poniatowski; the sixth was
                    composed of the Bavarians, under General Gouvion-Saint-Cyr; the Saxons formed
                    the seventh, under General Reynier; the eight consisted of the Westphalians,
                    effectively commanded by Junot, who had been placed as the Mentor of Jerome
                    Bonaparte, a young man without talents and consideration; the ninth, not yet
                    completed, but with a division twenty thousand strong, was allotted to Marshal
                    Victor; and the tenth, composed of the auxiliary contingent Prussians, with a
                    reserve of a division and some companies of artillery, was under the orders of
                    Marshal Macdonald. The old guard was commanded by Marshal Lefebvre, and the
                    young guard by Marshal Mortier. The reserve of cavalry, under the orders of the
                    king of Naples, Murat, formed four corps under Generals Nansouty, Montbrun,
                    Grouchy, and Latour-Maubourg. The cavalry of the guard acted apart, and an
                    Austrian corps under Schwartzenberg marched separately. The grand total did not
                    therefore fall short of four hundred and fifty thousand combatants, of whom
                    twenty thousand were Italians, eighty thousand belonged to the confederation of
                    the Rhine, thirty thousand were Poles, thirty thousand Austrians, and twenty
                    thousand Prussians; so that the French alone formed an effective force of about
                    two hundred and seventy thousand bayonets or sabres. On the other hand, the
                    Russian troops were divided into the first and second armies of the West, under
                    Generals Barclay de Tolly and Bagration, and the army of reserve under
                    Tormasot’; making altogether, including different detached corps of irregular
                    cavalry, about three hundred and sixty thousand combatants. But two other corps
                    were formed; one in Lithuania, from Mozyr to Bobenisk on the Berezina; and the
                    other at Riga and at Dwinaburg; whilst reserves were established on the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193515982" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5982-0155"/>Willis, and
                    between Wilna and Swentziany; and a vast intrenched camp was formed before
                    Drissa, in a sinuosity of the Dwina.</p>
                <p>On the 24th of June the French army crossed the Niémen, and on the 25th the
                    emperor of Russia issued a proclamation announcing the commencement of
                    hostilities, invoking the name of God, the protector of the Greek faith, in whom
                    dwells truth, and calling upon his serfs to defend liberty and their country. In
                    crossing the Niémen, the French met with no opposition; a solitary officer of
                    Cossacks being the only enemy who appeared to challenge them. The plan of the
                    Russians was to retreat within their own territory, to avoid a decisive battle,
                    to draw on the French as far as possible from their resources, and at last to
                    fall on them when famine, fatigue, and the rigours of a northern climate, had
                    abated their enthusiasm and exhausted their strength; a plan devised by Barclay
                    de Tolly, the commander-in-chief, and executed with an ability and determination
                    which eventually proved the salvation of the Russian empire. On the 28th of June
                    the French troops made their entry into Wilna, the ancient capital of Lithuania.
                    The Russians fell back at all points. After having exchanged some cannon shots,
                    they repassed the Williá, burned the wooden bridge at Wilna, and set fire to the
                    immense magazines of provision, clothing, arms, and munitions of war, which had
                    been collected at that place. On the same day the diet which had assembled at
                    Warsaw proclaimed the re-establishment of the kingdom of Poland. This generous
                    nation ardently desired and invoked the recomposition of its dismembered
                    provinces; it implored the assistance of France; and, for twenty years, its
                    warriors had shed their blood for the interests of that country in Italy, in
                    Germany, in Spain, wherever, in short, their services were needed or required.
                    Since the peace of Tilsitt, which had consummated the humiliation of Prussia,
                    the policy of France required the reconstitution of the monarchy of Sigisinond
                    and Sobieski; and powerful considerations should have determined Napoleon to
                    sanction a measure which, independently altogether of its political justice,
                    would have raised up a formidable barrier between Russia and Germany, attached
                    to his interests a brave and generous nation, strengthened his hands in the
                    actual contest with Russia, and, in the event of reverses, rallied a whole
                    people to cover his retreat. But, either from an apprehension of exciting the
                    jealousy of Austria, who would no doubt have readily accepted an indemnity for
                    Gallicia on the side of Italy, or, which is more probable, from a desire to keep
                    the door open for an accommodation with Russia, Napoleon evaded the recognition
                    which was so earnestly solicited of him by a deputation from the diet, and thus
                    lost an opportunity of strengthening his power which could never be
                    recalled.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>' The
                    deputation, which appeared at the head-quarters of Napoleon at wilna, said to
                    him, “the general diet has constituted it. self into a confederation of Poland.
                    Say, sire, that the kingdom of Poland exists, and this decree will to the world
                    be equivalent to the reality.” But, persisting in the idea of not sacrificing
                    Austrian Gallicia, in order not to be under the necessity of giving up Illyria,
                    which the cabinet of vienna anxiously desired to recover, Napoleon replied,
                    “Poles, I would have thought like you in the assembly of war saw; the love of
                    one’s country is the first duty of civilized man. In my situation I have many
                    interests to conciliate, many duties to fulfil. If I had reigned during the
                    first, the second, and the third dismemberment of Poland, I would have armed my
                    people to defend that country. I love your nation. I authorize the efforts which
                    you desire to make. It is only in the unanimity of the population that you can
                    hope for success. I ought to add, that I have guaranteed to the emperor of
                    Austria the integrity of his dominions.” This language was not misunderstood.
                    But if the hopes of the Poles were blasted, their disappointment was speedily
                    avenged.</p></note></p>
                <p>When Napoleon advanced upon Wilna with the main body of the army, Macdonald with
                    a strong corps moved along the Baltic, and formed the left; whilst the
                    Austrians, under Schwartzenberg, entered Volhynia, and protected the right flank
                    of the French. Immediately before Napoleon, the Russians, as already stated,
                    composed two armies; the principal of which, under General Barclay de Tolly, had
                    retired from Wilna, to Drissa on the Dwina, where an intrenched camp defended
                    the road leading to St Petersburg; whilst the other, under Prince Bagration,
                    remained at Grodno, and was consequently separated, by the advance of the
                    French, from the main army under Barclay. This was a great, and might have
                    proved a fatal blunder. But, happily for the Russians, Napoleon, who saw the
                    full extent of the error, and did every thing in his power to take advantage of
                    it, was, on the present occasion, ill served by his lieutenants. Some were
                    tardy, others inapt; Junot was incapacitated for command by the effects of
                    former wounds; Davoust was paralysed by the obstinacy and stupidity of King
                    Jerome; jealousies and misunderstandings prevailed among others. Precious time
                    was thus lost; Bagration made good his retreat; and Barclay, warned by the peril
                    which he had just escaped, took good care to afford the enemy no second
                    opportunity of beating him in detail. From Wilna Napoleon advanced to Witepsk,
                    which he entered on the 28th of July, being still in hopes of preventing the
                    junction of the two Russian armies, which, by a masterly movement, he had
                    disunited. Lithuania was now conquered, and the end of the war seemed already
                    attained; but in the estimation of Napoleon, whom ordinary advantages did not
                    satisfy, it had scarcely commenced. His eye was fixed upon Moscow, and,
                    calculating on-the faults of the Russians, he was eager to strike a blow
                    commensurate in magnitude with the enterprise in which he had embarked. In vain,
                    therefore, did Berthier, Lobau, Caulaincourt, Duroc, and Daru, demonstrate the
                    necessity of stopping at Witepsk, more especially as henceforward the favourable
                    dispositions of the inhabitants could not be reckoned on. Murat and Davoust gave
                    opposite counsel, and Napoleon resolved to advance.</p>
                <p>Whilst Napoleon remained at Witepsk, where he spent! the first two weeks of
                    August, the Russian armies had united at Smolensk, a large town situated on the
                    Dnieper, surrounded with ancient and massive constructions, to which had
                    recently been added works fortified with extreme care, and forming the bulwark
                    of Russia upon the frontier of Poland. In this strong position Barclay resolved
                    to make a stand. It had formed part of the plan of Napoleon to get to Smolensk
                    before the enemy, intercept their retreat, and thus force them to accept battle
                    at a disadvantage; but, owing to innumerable faults of execution, and the
                    unaccountable though perhaps necessary delay at Witepsk, this project had
                    failed. It now only remained, therefore, to carry the place by main force; and
                    for this purpose the French, with Napoleon himself at their head, advanced to
                    the attack, which was made at all pointsand with unimaginable fury. The
                    Russians, protected by the ramparts, held out during the day; but on the
                    approach of night they abandoned all their positions, after having set fire to
                    the town, which contained immense magazines. They retired in solid squares, with
                    such admirable steadiness and order, that the utmost efforts of Murat, at the
                    head of his fine cavalry, proved unavailing against the stability of their
                    formation; in fact, each square seemed a blazing ball of fire. The Russians lost
                    about twelve thousand men in killed, wounded, and prisoners; the French somewhat
                    less than half that number. But the system of defence adopted by the Russians
                    had <pb break="no" facs="nls:193515995" xml:id="kp-eb0710-5995-0156"/>deprived
                    the French of nearly all the advantages which they might otherwise have derived
                    from their victory; and where they expected to meet with good quarters and the
                    sight of human habitations, they found only a heap of smoking ruins. Still, even
                    amidst these ruins Napoleon might have halted, brought up provisions and
                    reinforcements, reorganized his army, and waited to complete the subjugation of
                    Hussia in another campaign. This was what almost all his generals counselled,
                    including even Murat; and the results of the campaign completely vindicated the
                    prudence of this advice. But to stop short in the month of August within eighty
                    leagues of Moscow, the term of his enterprise, and without having achieved any
                    thing calculated to maintain the illusion in favour of his invincible and
                    overwhelming power, was too much for Napoleon. The principles of his strategy
                    were fully developed in this campaign. He was not insensible to the difficulties
                    and even dangers attending an advance, or of the advantages which would result
                    from placing his army in cantonments at Smolensk, and there preparing for
                    another and decisive campaign; with him every thing, even audacity itself, was
                    matter of calculation; but, having estimated all the chances, he concluded that
                    as the Russians would certainly risk a battle to save the ancient capital of
                    their empire, he would gain the battle, penetrate to Moscow, and thus conclude
                    the war in Russia as he had twice before done in Germany. For these, and other
                    reasons which appeared to him equally cogent, Napoleon determined to
                    advance.</p>
                <p>Nor was he wrong in two main points of his calculation. Although the Fabian
                    tactics of Barclay had unquestionably saved the Russian army, and with it the
                    empire, all voices, amongst which that of Prince Bagration was loudest,
                    clamoured for battle; and, in obedience to this cry, the able tactician was
                    superseded by the old Muscovite general Kutusof, the same who lost the battle of
                    Austerlitz. Before quitting the command, however, Barclay signalized himself by
                    a brilliant feat of arms. Resolving to leave no trophies to the enemy, he made a
                    stand at Valoutina, to preserve some baggage and cannon; and as Junot, who
                    should have taken the Russians in flank, hesitated at the critical moment, he
                    succeeded in repulsing Ney with considerable loss. It was not thus that Napoleon
                    had been served in Italy and Germany; but, mindful of former times, and
                    unwilling to disgrace his earliest protege in the face of the army, he still
                    continued Junot in the command of his division. The vanguard, commanded by Murat
                    and Davoust, was continually in contact with the enemy; but as the overboiling
                    and impetuous valour of the former assorted ill with the stern methodical genius
                    of Davoust, who blamed his colleague severely for sacrificing the cavalry in
                    encounters which led to no result, these officers were at open variance, and
                    their quarrel contributed in no slight degree to increase the difficulties and
                    embarrassments of Napoleon. The accession of Kutusof to the command of the
                    Russian army, in the room of Barclay, was equivalent to an announcement of a
                    determination to fight. This was known to the French, who, accordingly, on the
                    6th of September, came in sight of the Russian army posted upon a series of
                    eminences extending southward from the village of Borodino, on the Moskwa; the
                    position selected by Kutusof whereon to fight a battle in defence of the
                    capital, which he had solemnly promised to cover, and at the same time to
                    annihilate the French army. This position was covered by redoubts and
                    intrenchments, announced in the official reports as inexpugnable; and the
                    Russians were animated by the predictions of their priests, and by the sight of
                    a miraculous image of the Virgin, which was carried through their ranks. Kutusof
                    also prophecied victory. “God,” said he, “is about to combat the enemy with the
                    sword of St Michael, and before the sun of to-morrow shall have descended below
                    the horizon, you will have written your faith and your fidelity, in the fields
                    of your country, with the blood of the aggressor and his legions." On reaching
                    the ground, Napoleon drove the Russians from an advanced redoubt, established
                    his line opposite to theirs, and made the necessary preparations for the
                    conflict of the morrow. But he refused to manoeuvre on the enemy’s flank, or
                    make any movement to intercept them, lest such an operation should induce them
                    to withdraw, and thus put off the long-wished-for battle.</p>
                <p>The sun of the 7th September rose in peaceful splendour on the mighty hosts
                    arrayed for conflict, and was hailed by the French as the sun of Austerlitz, an
                    omen of victory. Before daybreak Napoleon was on horseback, and with the first
                    light of day the following address was read at the head of each regiment in the
                    French army. “Soldiers, here is the battle you have so much desired. Victory
                    must now depend upon you. It will secure you abundance, good quarters, and a
                    speedy return to your native country. Conduct yourselves as at Austerlitz, at
                    Friedland, and at Smolensk. Let people say of each of you with pride, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 4</hi> He was at the great battle fought on the plains of
                    Moscow.’” The corps present were, besides the old and new guard, those of
                    Marshals Davoust and Ney, of the viceroy of Italy, Eugene Beauharnais, and of
                    Prince Poniatowski; and the four large corps of cavalry, commanded respectively
                    by Generals Nansouty, Montbrun, Grouchy, and Latour-Maubourg, were all under the
                    superior direction of the king of Naples. In the Russian army, Barclay de Tolly,
                    dispossessed of his functions as general-in-chief, commanded the right,
                    Beningsen held the centre, and Bagration commanded the left. Redoubts strongly
                    armed, and numerous batteries, covered the front and the wings. The respective
                    numerical force of the hostile armies has not been satisfactorily ascertained.
                    It appears, however, that the French army exceeded one hundred and thirty
                    thousand combatants of all arms, and that the Russians were even more numerous.
                    The latter had also the advantage of position, and were animated both by
                    religious and patriotic feelings; but they were about to contend with soldiers
                    equally intelligent and brave, led on by consummate generals, and all under the
                    direction of the greatest master in the art of war whom modern times had
                    produced. At six in the morning the fire of a French battery gave the signal of
                    battle; and General Compans, belonging to the corps of Marshal Davoust,
                    commenced the attack. The intention of Napoleon was to carry the first batteries
                    on the Russian left, and then to take in flank and reverse a great redoubt in
                    the centre. Hence, although the action commenced along the whole line, the
                    weight of the attack was directed against the batteries just mentioned. But, as
                    might have been anticipated, the assailants were met by a gallant and determined
                    resistance. Compans, who commanded the leading division, was wounded; Rapp, who
                    succeeded him, was also wounded; and Davoust himself received a hurt from the
                    fall of his horse, which was killed under him. For a moment the attack faltered;
                    but victory came from a quarter where it was least expected. Instead of holding
                    back, according to his orders, the viceroy of Italy, perceiving the relaxation
                    in the attack, pushed forward to the village of Borodino, which he carried in
                    the most gallant manner; and improving his advantage, he dashed across the river
                    to attack the great redoubt. The corps of Davoust now redoubled its efforts,
                    drove Bagration from his batteries, and before midday, after more than four
                    hours close combat maintained with extraordinary tenacity, three redoubts had
                    been carried by Prince Eugene and Marshals Davoust and Ney, whose corps formed
                    the right wing, and were prolonged towards the centre. The road to victory being
                    thus opened, it was necessary to follow it up; but Murat, Ney, and Davoust<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193516008" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6008-0157"/>, exhausted by
                    their exertions, stopped, rallied their troops, and sent to Napoleon to demand
                    reinforcements. Segur, who describes this celebrated battle in a pompous and
                    affected style, gives long details respecting the alleged hesitation and
                    uncertainty of Napoleon, as well as the orders and counter orders which he is
                    said to have issued to his generals. It is certain, however, that he retained
                    the young guard in a state of inaction, not thinking it necessary to order it to
                    advance, notwithstanding the urgent solicitations of Murat to that effect. To
                    those who pressed him to accede to the instances of the king of Naples, he
                    replied, that he wished to see better how matters stood; that his battle was not
                    yet commenced; that it was necessary to wait; that time entered into every
                    thing; that it was the element of which all things were composed; that nothing
                    had as yet been sufficiently cleared up. Then he asked the hour, and being told
                    it, added, “That of the battle has not yet come. In two hours hence it will
                    commence.” The event proved that Napoleon judged more wisely than his impetuous
                    lieutenant. To have ordered up his guard and brought forward his reserves whilst
                    the state of the battle remained uncertain, would have been to risk all upon one
                    throw of the die. Accordingly, in the afternoon, a second, or, as Baron Fain
                    calls it, a third battle commenced; all the Russian batteries were successively
                    attacked and taken; the most formidable of their redoubts, that in the centre,
                    was carried by a charge of cuirassiers; and the Russians, defeated at all
                    points, were forced to abandon the field. The result of this day was such as
                    might have been expected from an army like that commanded by Napoleon.
                    Notwithstanding the boasting of the Russian generals, their army, with all its
                    advantages of position, had been totally defeated; and the shades of night,
                    which descended too late for the vanquished, but too soon for the victors, in
                    this bloody field, concealed the retrograde movements of Kutusof, who now took
                    the direction of Moscow.</p>
                <p>At the same time this battle was, without contradiction, P one of the most
                    obstinate and bloody recorded in military annals. The loss of the Russians
                    exceeded thirty thousand men killed, wounded, or prisoners; that of the French
                    was considerably above twenty thousand. On the side of the Russians, Prince
                    Bagration fell in the battle, and fifty general officers were either killed or
                    wounded; on that of the French, two generals of division and six generals of
                    brigade were killed, whilst Compans, Nansouty, Grouchy, Latour-Maubourg, Rapp,
                    Morand, Friand, and La Houssaye, were more or less severely wounded. But
                    although the victory remained with Napoleon, his prospects were still
                    sufficiently gloomy; and in the bivouacs of the army discouragement prevailed.
                    Seven or eight hundred prisoners, and about a score of broken cannon, were all
                    the trophies he had won. Subsistence also began to fail, and to the torments of
                    hunger were joined the rigours of a cold and rainy night. But with the return of
                    day the natural vivacity of the French revived; preparations were made for
                    pursuing the enemy, who had been suffered to retire unmolested from the field of
                    battle; and on the 14th the inhabitants of Moscow, whom Kutusof had taught to
                    believe that he had just gained a great victory, beheld the Russian columns in
                    full retreat, and the French advancing to occupy their city. But the governor,
                    Rostopschin, had taken measures for rendering the possession of Moscow useless
                    to the French. When the letter entered, on the 14th of September, the ancient
                    capital of Russia remained in all its original splendour; and Napoleon took up
                    his abode in the Kremlin, anciently the residence of the czars. But a new and
                    unlooked-for enemy suddenly appeared. On the very day of occupation fires
                    appeared in different quarters of the city; but, in the bustle and confusion
                    incident to the arrival of a great army, they were neglected. On the 15th and
                    16th vigorous measures were taken to arrest the progress of the flames, which,
                    however, were incessantly renewed; on the 17th the conflagration, fanned by a
                    high wind, spread rapidly; on the 18th the city presented the sublime and
                    appalling spectacle of a vast ocean of flame; and by the evening of the 20th
                    nine tenths of Moscow had been reduced to ashes. The Russians, with their
                    habitual duplicity, endeavoured to cast on the French the odium of an act
                    unexampled in history, and one too which the latter had every imaginable
                    interest, if possible, to prevent; but there no longer remains a vestige of
                    doubt that the burning of Moscow was the result of a premeditated plan, and that
                    it was effected by incendiaries, employed for the purpose by the Russian
                    authorities, acting, no doubt, under the sanction of the Emperor Alexander
                    himself. Of this the proof is abundant and conclusive. Inflammable materials,
                    deposited in a great number of deserted houses, were fired at the same instant;
                    to all the public establishments, nay even to the hospitals, the torch of the
                    incendiary was likewise applied; the flames broke out in many different places
                    at once; and, independently of all testimony to the fact, every circumstance
                    connected with the conflagration showed design and premeditation. On the other
                    hand, it must be equally evident that no officer in the empire, however elevated
                    in rank, would, without positive orders, have taken on himself the
                    responsibility of such an act; that, in short, the terrible resolution to
                    destroy the ancient capital of the empire must have formed part of the defensive
                    policy of the philanthropic autocrat of all the Russias, and that Rostopschin
                    was merely an executive instrument in carrying this resolution into effect. We
                    may add, as illustrative of this desperate and unwarrantable sacrifice, that no
                    provision whatever had been made for sheltering the miserable population, who
                    were driven to seek an asylum in the neighbouring woods, and that more than
                    twenty thousand sick and wounded perished in the flames.</p>
                <p>Thegrand object of the mighty expedition against Russia had been attained; the
                    country had been overrun; a great' battle had been fought and gained; and
                    Moscow, or ra- ] ther its ashes, had been occupied by the French. But yet <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> no messenger of peace came to the head-quarters of
                    Napoleon; no sign of submission appeared; no sinking of confidence showed
                    itself. The Russians were evidently prepared to sacrifice all that is most
                    esteemed or valued by a nation; and when the campaign was considered as
                    terminated, peace had yet to be conquered. By the destruction of Moscow,
                    Napoleon had been deprived of the fruits of the victory which he had so dearly
                    purchased, namely, winter quarters for his army, and a position where he might
                    at once collect means for further aggression, and assume the language of a
                    conqueror. His situation had become eminently critical. What course ought he to
                    have followed? His instant conception was to march to St Petersburg, cut off
                    Wittgenstein, and then effect a junction with Macdonald. The project was a
                    magnificent one; and though it would have required gigantic efforts to carry it
                    into execution, success would, in all probability, have crowned the daring
                    enterprise. There was, in reality, no time for hesitation. Prudence counselled
                    immediate retreat, which, however, had many disadvantages, particularly from the
                    influence it would exert upon public opinion. Genius suggested a bolder scheme,
                    which, if successful, would have ensured, not only safety, but victory; and, in
                    extreme peril, the excess of audacity often becomes a dictate of wisdom. But
                    without the concurrence of the chiefs such an enterprise was impossible; what
                    Napoleon might plan, they alone could execute. These men, however, were no
                    longer the devoted and enthusiastic soldiers of the Republic. War had enriched
                    them; and from the enjoyment of riches they had become tired of campaigns.
                    Throughout the whole of the expedition they had been churlish, discontented, and
                    quarrelsome; and hence, instead of seconding the bold proposition of the
                    emperor, they counselled retreat by a new and circuitous route to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193516021" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6021-0158"/>the south. Napoleon could not
                    persist in a project which his officers refused to execute; their plan was
                    equally obnoxious to him; and between these conflicting opinions precious time
                    was irrecoverably lost. This was the fatality which ruined all. Instead of
                    deciding either on immediate retreat, or on following out the emperor’s splendid
                    project, they loitered in a state of indecision at Moscow, as if waiting to be
                    devoured by a Russian winter. In these circumstances, Napoleon had recourse to
                    the only expedient left him; he sent Lauriston with proposals of peace, and
                    vainly waited in the Kremlin, which the conflagration had spared, an answer
                    never to return. The course of events hadso far changed as to justify Alexander
                    in declining to negotiate with an enemy in the heart of his dominions. The
                    destruction of Moscow, and the inactivity of the French, had rendered their
                    retreat-matter of absolute certainty; whilst the re-establishment of peace with
                    the Ottoman Porte having enabled the army of the Danube to quit Moldavia, and
                    effect a junction at Lutsk in Volhynia with the army of reserve under General
                    Tormasof, a powerful force was thus accumulated upon their only line of retreat.
                    In consequence of the treaty with Sweden, the troops employed in Finland had
                    also been withdrawn, and disembarked at Riga to join the force destined to act
                    against Macdonald. In a word, every day was improving the situation of the
                    Russians; every hour was adding to the embarrassments which beset the invaders.
                    At length the affair of Winkowo decided Napoleon. On the 18th October, Kutusof,
                    desirous to prevent the junction of Marshal Victor, who had set out from
                    Smolensk, attacked the king of Naples, who covered Moscow with the advanced
                    guard of the army, and completely defeated him.</p>
                <p>On the 19th of October, after an occupation of forty days, Napoleon evacuated
                    Moscow with the main body of his army, leaving Marshal Mortier, with the
                    rear-guard, to blow up the arsenal, the magazines, and the Kremlin. In ordinary
                    seasons the frost did not set in until after the middle of November, and hence a
                    month of open weather might still be reckoned on. Sufficient time, therefore,
                    remained to enable the French army to arrive at Smolensk, and there establish
                    itself in winter-quarters; further retreat was not contemplated. But instead of
                    choosing the direct road, Napoleon now adopted the plan originally proposed by
                    his officers, and retired by the southern or old Kalouga road. His reasons were,
                    that a retrograde movement along this route had not the appearance of retreat;
                    that it led through provinces which had been wasted neither by the Russian
                    system of defence nor by the actual presence of war; and that this circuit would
                    afford time to the rearguard to evacuate Moscow. He therefore manoeuvred, in the
                    hope of concealing his design from Kutusof, and then suddenly advanced in order
                    to anticipate the enemy, and occupy the important town of Kalouga. But the
                    Russians somehow received information of his intention, and reached
                    Malojaroslawitz, thirty leagues south of Moscow and fourteen north of Kalouga,
                    in time to oppose the march of the French. A sanguinary engagement now ensued
                    (20th October) between the advanced guard, seventeen thousand strong, under
                    Prince Eugene Beauharnais, and the Russians, about four times that number, under
                    Kutusof; but the success of the French was decided and confirmed by the arrival
                    of Generals Gérard and Compans, belonging to the corps of Marshal Davoust. The
                    Russian general, in his official report of the battle, admits that he was
                    repulsed, but states that the town was taken and retaken eight times. The
                    action, which lasted from five o’clock in the morning until ten at night, cost
                    the Russians from eight to ten thousand, and the French more than five thousand
                    men <hi rend="italic">hors</hi><hi rend="italic">de combat.</hi> This unexpected
                    rencontre, and the violent efforts made by the enemy, convinced Napoleon that
                    his enemies were far from being enfeebled or discouraged; he therefore abandoned
                    his project of retiring on Smolensk by the old Kalouga road, and fell back on
                    the ' direct route leading through a ravaged and deserted country. It is not a
                    little singular that Kutusoſ, afraid of a renewed attack, had also at nearly the
                    same moment issued orders for a retreat. At Wiasma, fifty-six leagues west of
                    Moscow, the French rear-guard, on the 3d of November, repulsed the enemy after
                    an obstinate and bloody action, supported by Prince Eugene, Marshals Davoust and
                    Ney, and General Compans. The French ranks were thinned to the extent of four
                    thousand killed and wounded, and, in continuing their retreat, they were obliged
                    to abandon several broken cannon, and nearly all their baggage. On the 7th of
                    November the French army, which had been fifteen days in full retreat, and
                    continually harassed on its flanks by parties of Russians, reached Smolensk.</p>
                <p>The cold had already set in with excessive severity. The fluid in the thermometer
                    of Reaumur, which during; the first days of November had stood at eight or ten
                    de- ’ grees below zero, now descended to eighteen; sombre vapours obscured the
                    sun; and violent tempests of wind drifted the snow which, covering the soil,
                    filled up all the inequalities of its surface, and thus added new dangers to the
                    horrors of this dreadful winter. The horses, perishing by thousands in the
                    bivouacs, were no longer sufficient to drag the artillery. Nor was the condition
                    of the troops in any respect less disastrous. After the affair of
                    Malojaroslawitz, the strength of the men utterly failed. Their privations,
                    painful at Moscow, became every day more cruel. Destitute of biscuit, and
                    provisions of every kind, the army had traversed about a hundred leagues of
                    country entirely ruined, in which it had never fought except by the light of
                    conflagrations; the horrors of devastation extended six leagues on either side;
                    and it was incessantly assailed by clouds of Cossacks. Its disasters augmented
                    at each step, and in frightful progression; and all were attributable to its
                    head, who, by an inconceivable blindness, had foreseen nothing, calculated
                    nothing, employed none of the most ordinary precautions which a general is bound
                    to take for the support of his troops, and whose improvidence devoted them to
                    still more deplorable calamities. The magazines nearest Moscow were at Smolensk;
                    but these afforded only a momentary relief, and all transport had become
                    impossible. Nor was this all. Wittgenstein, reinforced by new levies, had
                    defeated Saint-Cyr on the Dwina, and taken Witepsk, thus cutting off the retreat
                    to Wilna; whilst Tschitchagof, commanding the army of the Danube, had orders to
                    advance from the south, seize upon Minsk, and thus bar the only other
                    practicable road to the westward. To remain at Smolensk was therefore out of the
                    question. The least retardation of the retreat would inevitably have led to a
                    general battle, which the army was not in a condition to risk, owing to the
                    impossibility of connecting the centre with the wings. The excessive cold which
                    set in on the 6th had disabled and destroyed a great number of men and horses.
                    The army could neither procure information nor defend itself; its only resource,
                    therefore, consisted in marching without intermission in order to reach Minsk
                    (the great depot of munitions and provisions), or at least the Berezina, before
                    the enemy, who, being master of the country, was now advancing in the opposite
                    direction, and extending his corps on the flanks. Yet in these frightful
                    circumstances, when the French were simultaneously assailed by famine, disease,
                    winter, and hostile armies, Napoleon tarried seven days at Smolensk, which was
                    only evacuated on the 14th November. Nevertheless he took one good measure, in
                    rallying under a single officer the wrecks of the cavalry. Of thirty-seven
                    thousand horsemen present at the passage of the Niemen, there now remained
                    little more than eight hundred mounted, the command of whom was given to
                    Latour<pb break="no" facs="nls:193516034" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6034-0159"
                    />-Maubourg. The old and young guard had no more than ten thousand bayonets,
                    with two thousand horses mounted; Davoust had under his orders nine thousand
                    men, Ney five thousand, Prince Eugene five hundred, Poniatowski from eight to
                    nine hundred, Junot seven hundred, Latour-Maubourg (including the remains of the
                    cavalry) fifteen hundred, with about a thousand light horse, and five hundred
                    dismounted dragoons; in all thirty-six thousand men, the miserable remnant of
                    about four hundred thousand combatants, French, Poles, Italians, and Germans,
                    who had crossed the Niemen at Kowno.</p>
                <p>With the retreat from Smolensk commenced a new series of disasters. On the I6th
                    November, Minsk, with all its magazines, having been uncovered by
                    Schwartzenberg, who suddenly retired behind the Bug, fell into the hands of
                    General Lambert, commanding the advanced guard of the army from Moldavia; and
                    the only refuge of the French was thus cut off. Upon the same day Kutusof
                    attempted at Krasnoi, ten leagues west of Smolensk, to intersect the French
                    columns on the great road leading from Smolensk to the Berezina. He advanced
                    with seventy thousand infantry and thirty thousand cavalry; the French mustered
                    only twenty-five thousand effective combatants, who-had lost many of their
                    cannon, and three-fourths of their horses. But Prince Eugene and Marshal Davoust
                    stood their ground with admirable firmness; whilst General Roguet, commanding a
                    division of the young guard, charged the Russians with such fury that he drove
                    them back at the point of the bayonet into their camp, which he entered
                    pell-mell along with them, scarcely allowing them time to throw their arms into
                    a neighbouring lake, and set fire to their huts. This shock suspended the
                    movement of the Russian army for twenty-four hours. On the 19th, Marshal Ney,
                    left in command of the extreme rear-guard, with six thousand combatants, found
                    himself attacked by enormous masses of the enemy, which intercepted his march.
                    Finding himself unable to break through, he retired before them, surprised the
                    passage of the Dnieper, forced his way amidst clouds of Cossacks, and rejoined
                    the main body of the army, from which he had been two days separated. On the
                    21st the Russian generals Lambert and Langeren took possession of Borisow on the
                    Berezina, and by the occupation of this point cut off the body of the French
                    army, which was still five or six marches to the eastward. But on the 23d
                    Marshal Oudinot, who, since the abandonment of the positions upon the Dwina,
                    immediately preceded the army in retreat, retook this important post, and
                    maintained it in spite of every effort that could be made to dislodge him.</p>
                <p>At Borisow, which had thus been regained by Otidinot, the passage of the
                    Berezina, the principal difficulty in the march of the French towards the
                    Niemen, could alone be effected. But their situation was perilous, not to say
                    desperate. The line of the Dwina had been forced; Schwartzenberg, whose
                    defection was no longer disguised, had retired behind the Bug; no difficulty of
                    position arrested the enemy in his decisive operations; the whole country was in
                    his hands, whilst the French had only the narrow line upon which they retreated.
                    The former lived in abundance, the latter suffered almost every privation. The
                    teams of the Russian artillery were in good condition; the horses of the French
                    were dying of cold and hunger, or, from being unfřosted, could not support
                    themselves on a soil entirely congealed. In a word, the remains of the French
                    army seemed about to find a grave in the marshes of the Berezina, the ice of
                    which had suddenly thawed, as if to swallow them up. Kutusof pursued them with a
                    fury augmented by each humiliation inflicted on his unskilful pursuit. Pressed
                    on their right flank by Wittgenstein, and on their left by Tschitchagof, who
                    also took them in reverse; with an artillery and a cavalry greatly reduced;
                    extenuated by hunger and fatigue, as well as benumbed by cold; they held out
                    only in the hope of at length reaching the term of so much evil and suffering. A
                    last effort of their courage was therefore their last resource. The different
                    corps of the French army which assembled at Borisow from the 26th to the 28th of
                    November still presented a mass of about eighty thousand men, with a tolerably
                    numerous artillery. They were not yet disorganized. The sol-dery, at least that
                    part which came from Moscow, though exhausted by the fatigues of forty days’
                    march over a devastated country, assailed by swarms of Cossacks, overwhelmed
                    with privations, and suffering half-naked the excessive rigours of the climate,
                    recovered their ardour at the sight of the enemy, who now awaited them in the
                    presumption of victory. The corps coming from Moscow also saw themselves
                    supported by those of Marshals Victor and Oudi-not, and by the Polish division,
                    which had suffered but little from want of provisions and the rigour of the
                    cold. But it was necessary, first of all, to overthrow sixteen thousand Russians
                    advantageously posted in the débouché of Borisow, on the right bank, and
                    belonging to the army of Tschitchagof, before the junction of Wittgenstein, who
                    closely followed the rear-guard of Victor upon the left bank above Borisow; and
                    also before Kutusof, who marched with the main body of the Russians upon the
                    left flank of the French head-quarters, had time to recover three marches which
                    had been gained on him. Two bridges were accordingly thrown at Weselowo, a
                    village four leagues and a half above Borisow, whilst dispositions were made
                    which seemed to indicate that the passage was to be effected by the bridge of
                    Borisow. The rapid construction of these two bridges, in such terrible
                    circumstances, presents a marvellous instance of what may be effected by the
                    union of bravery and science. At Weselowo, the Berezina, at this time covered
                    with ice, is two hundred and fifty toises broad, and the opposite side extends
                    into marshes, which are traversed by a long and narrow jetty; but, on the other
                    hand, the Weselowo bank is elevated; and hence the difficulty of throwing
                    bridges across such a river would, under any circumstances, have been very
                    great.</p>
                <p>On the 28th the intrepid Oudinot, who commanded the rear-guard, having been
                    wounded in repulsing Tschitchagof, whose forces were grouped on the right bank,
                    Marshal Ney assumed the command in the midst of the action, and, at the head of
                    the second, third, and fifth corps, compelled Tschitchagof to renounce the
                    combat. On this occasion, so important for the general safety, Ney, already
                    surnamed the bravest of the brave, displayed a courage which astonished even the
                    most valiant soldiers; and all acknowledged that their safety was due to his
                    invincible tenacity, as well as to the extreme promptitude of his dispositions.
                    Upon the same day, Marshal Victor, who had been left with the rear-guard on the
                    left bank, supported with great firmness the attack of the army of Wittgenstein,
                    and maintained a prolonged resistance, notwithstanding the extreme disproportion
                    of numbers; for, after the capture of the division of Parthouneaux, which on the
                    preceding day had been surrounded and taken, the French had only twelve thousand
                    men, whilst the Russians had upwards of forty thousand. The ninth corps was then
                    obliged to repass the bridges, which were immediately blown up; the artillery,
                    the baggage, and a great number of unfortunates, almost all non-combatants, who
                    had not been able to pass, being abandoned on the other bank. The plain before
                    Weselowo, which is one of considerable extent, presented in the evening a
                    spectacle the horrors of which exceed all description. It was covered with
                    carriages, the greater part overturned and broken, and thickly strewed with the
                    dead bodies of non-military individuals, amongst which were those of many women
                    and children, who hav-.</p>

                <p>ing followed the army to Moscow, had also accompanied it in its retreat, and now
                    met with death in different ways. The fate of these unfortunate creatures, in
                    the midst of the mêlée of the two armies, was either to be crushed under the
                    wheels of the carriages or the feet of the horses; struck by the balls and
                    bullets of both parties; drowned in attempting to pass the bridges with the
                    troops; or stripped by the Russian soldiers, and thrown naked on the snow, where
                    the cold soon terminated their sufferings. Besides, the Russians made nearly
                    twenty thousand prisoners, took a hundred and fifty pieces of cannon, being all
                    the artillery that remained except a few pieces, and captured the baggage,
                    amongst which were found the riches and the trophies carried away from
                    Moscow.</p>
                <p>From the Berezina the country is a wooded plateau, converted by the waters into a
                    vast marsh, which the army now traversed on three consecutive bridges three
                    hundred toises in length, astonished that the enemy had not destroyed them,
                    constructed as they were of resinous pines. By accelerated marches the troops
                    reached Malodetchno on the 3d of December, and on the 5th arrived at Smorgoni,
                    twelve leagues west of Willika, where Napoleon conferred on the king of Naples
                    the command of the remains of the army, and set out furtively for Paris,
                    accompanied by Caulaincourt, duke of Vicenza. II is apparition at Warsaw is
                    related in lively terms by the Abbe de Pradt. In this capital his conversation
                    was a sort of lengthened discourse, in which he represented his reverses as
                    still capable of being repaired; but by often repeating the maxim, “From the
                    sublime to the ridiculous there is only a step,” he showed how deeply sensible
                    he was of the magnitude of his fall. On the 18th of December Napoleon arrived in
                    Paris, where, for many reasons, his presence had become indispensably
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>Immediately after his departure from the army the disorder became general; the
                    flight of the chief proved the signal for dispersion; and the greater part of
                    the corps, which had hitherto maintained an appearance of organization, now
                    altogether disbanded themselves. Meanwhile, as the cold continued about
                    twenty-five degrees below the zero of Reaumur’s thermometer, a great number of
                    soldiers had their hands and feet frost-bitten; and the horses of the artillery
                    having perished in their harness, the pieces were abandoned. Sixty thousand men
                    had crossed the Berezina, and twenty thousand recruits had since joined; but of
                    these eighty thousand men, nearly the half perished in the four days between
                    Malodetchno and Wilna. The immense magazines collected at Wilna were abandoned
                    for want of means of transport, and the deplorable situation to which the cold
                    had reduced the army prevented it from there taking up a position. The retreat
                    was therefore continued on the 16th, Marshal Ney as usual being the last to
                    retire; indeed, his conduct throughout, in the command of the rear-guard, where
                    he continually exposed himself to protect the life and cover the retreat of the
                    last soldier in a condition to march, displayed an heroic fortitude and generous
                    self-devotion, which, considering all the circumstances, has no parallel either
                    in ancient or modern times. We shall not, however, prolong these painful
                    details, but content ourselves with simply observing, what indeed must be
                    sufficiently obvious, that the disasters sustained by the French in this retreat
                    were mainly caused by the climate, not by the Russians, who have nevertheless
                    taken credit for results in producing which their talents and bravery had no
                    share. The elements did almost everything; and, as is vulgarly said, even in
                    Russia, “It was not General Kutusof who killed or dispersed the French; it was
                    General Morosow (Frost).”</p>
                <p>The aspect which affairs presented to Napoleon on his return to Paris was not
                    altogether discouraging. Wellington, victorious at Salamanca, had failed before
                    Burgos, and</p>
                <p>Madrid remained in the hands of the French. The army, which he had left at
                    Smorgoni, might rally on the Niemen, ' and, supplied from the unexhausted
                    resources of East Prussia, check the advance of its pursuers. At home a daring
                    conspiracy, which had nearly succeeded when the emperor was believed to have
                    perished in Russia, fell to the ground of itself as soon as the falsehood of the
                    report was discovered. The senate, the court, and the capital, though dismayed
                    by the reverses sustained in the Russian campaign, still appeared loyal and
                    obsequious. The conscription of 1813 had been called out; the powerful artillery
                    of the marine was placed at his disposal; and he calculated on speedily taking
                    the field at the head of a formidable army, sufficient at least to check the
                    advance of the Russians. But this was only a momentary and delusive brightening;
                    a faint gleam of sunshine in winter, which was quickly absorbed in the dark
                    clouds that suddenly collected in all parts of the political horizon. Tidings of
                    evil came crowding in thick and fast. Macdonald having been deserted in presence
                    of the enemy by the Prussian auxiliary corps under Yorck, which constituted his
                    principal force, had with great difficulty, and after a most painful retreat,
                    reached Dantzic, where his troops were left with the governor General Rapp. To
                    think of maintaining the line of the Niemen was therefore out of the question;
                    and even the position upon the Vistula, occupied by the corps composing the
                    grand army, or rather the wrecks of these, confusedly distributed, was menaced
                    by the defection of the Prussians, and also by the conduct, so perfidiously
                    equivocal, of the Austrians under Schwartzenberg, who, having retreated as soon
                    as he received intelligence that the French army had reached the Berezina, had
                    re-entered Gallicia, where his doubtful attitude excited the distrust and
                    apprehensions of the French. Murat, commanding in chief, was little capable of
                    remedying so great disasters, or of warding off so imminent dangers; his
                    military merit consisted in a chivalrous bravery worthy the ages of romance; in
                    the talents and moral tenacity of purpose requisite in situations of extreme
                    difficulty he was entirely deficient. Poland was evacuated, and Germany destined
                    to become the theatre of war. Abandoning the line of the Vistula, as they had
                    previously done that of the Niemen, the French now fell back as far as the Warta
                    and the Oder. Instantly the tocsin of insurrection resounded from the Oder to
                    the Rhine, and from the Baltic to the Julian Alps; and the whole tribe of
                    secondary sovereigns, awakened from their lethargy by the patriotism of their
                    subjects, and dispossessed of the royal delirium generated by their own cupidity
                    and the poisoned gifts of Napoleon, now crowded to join its standards, and to
                    have each a bite at the sick lion. By a proclamation dated from Warsaw, 10th
                    February 1813, the Emperor Alexander invited the Germans, particularly the
                    members of the confederation of the Rhine, to throw off the yoke of France; and,
                    by another dated the 22d February, he called upon the people of Germany to rise
                    <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">masse</hi> against Napoleon. In the
                    uncalculating enthusiasm of the hour, when despotism had the art or the good
                    fortune to rally on its side the feelings of nationality and patriotism, the
                    call was obeyed, and the defection became universal. Austria, indeed, still
                    preserved an equivocal and suspicious neutrality, waiting merely until events
                    had more fully declared themselves. But Prussia, taking a more decided part,
                    signalized her defection by the flight of Frederick-William from Potts-darn to
                    meet the Emperor Alexander at Breslau, and still more by concluding at Kalisch
                    (on the 1st of March) a treaty of alliance with Russia, the initial act of a
                    sixth continental coalition against France. The line of the Oder having thus
                    become indefensible, was abandoned by the French for that of the Elbe, where, by
                    great exertions, they still hoped to maintain themselves against all their <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193516060" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6060-0161"/> enemies. Amongst
                    these must now be included Bernadotte, who, by a treaty concluded with England
                    at Stockholm, on the 3d of March, engaged to raise his banner against the
                    country of his birth, and to take the field against his former chief with a
                    corps of national troops at least thirty thousand strong.</p>
                <p>The efforts of Napoleon were commensurate to the crisis which had arrived. A
                    decree of the senate, dated the 3d of April, placed at the disposal of the
                    government a hundred and eighty thousand combatants, viz. ten thousand
                    horse-guards of honour, equipped and mounted at their own expense; eighty
                    thousand men, called from the first ban of the national guards of the years
                    1807, 1808, 1809, 1810, 1811, and 1812, and destined to reinforce the hundred
                    cohorts levied in execution of the decree of the senate of 13th March 1812; and
                    eighty thousand conscripts of 1814, exclusive of the hundred and fifty thousand
                    granted to government by the decree of the 11th of January, and destined for the
                    defence of the frontiers and the coasts. An imperial decree of the 5th April
                    also instituted thirty-seven urban cohorts for the particular defence of
                    maritime places. Decrees, however, though they called forth men, could not
                    create soldiers, who are only formed by discipline and experience.</p>
                <p>On the 15th of April Napoleon left the capital to join the army in Germany, and
                    on the 28th removed his headquarters from Erfurth to Ekhartsberg. His army, more
                    formidable from the mass than the quality of troops composing it, exhibited an
                    incomplete organization. On the 29th the two French armies formed a junction
                    between Naumburg and Merseburg; that under Napoleon amounting to a hundred and
                    twenty thousand men, including the imperial guard; whilst Prince Eugene
                    Beauharnais had under his orders about forty thousand combatants. It was on the
                    banks of the Saale, where the French eagles had triumphed in 1806, that the
                    veterans of Moscow gave their hands to the young conscripts who had been sent to
                    defend their country in Germany; and on the very day when the junction was
                    effected, Napoleon assumed the offensive. At Weissenfels, five leagues
                    south-west of Leipsic, some Prussian corps were attacked by the divisions of
                    Souham, Gérard, and Marchand, under the orders of Marshal Ney, supported by the
                    emperor in person. Twelve pieces of the guard were placed in line, and, under
                    the orders of General Drouot, opened a close fire of grape, which soon thinned
                    the ranks of the enemy, and forced them to retire; thus rendering unnecessary
                    the reinforcements detached from the army of Prince Eugene as soon as the noise
                    of the cannonade was heard. To prevent Napoleon following up this advantage, and
                    occupying Leipsic, the allies advanced, on the 1st of May, with the intention of
                    giving him battle, and on the 2d the hostile armies met at Gross-Goerschen, near
                    Lutzen, the scene of the last victory and of the death of Gustavus Adolphus.</p>
                <p>Napoleon did not wait to be attacked in the position which he occupied, but
                    advanced from Lutzen to Gross-Goerschen, where the conflict actually took place.
                    The general dispositions made at the commencement of the action were bad; but
                    their defects were speedily repaired by the promptitude, intrepidity, and
                    experience of Prince Eugene, Marshals Ney, Mortier, Macdonald, Marmont, and
                    Generals Compans, Ricard, Souham, Drouot, and Latour-Maubourg. In checking the
                    impetuosity of the Prussians, and, as it were, compelling fortune to declare in
                    his favour, Napoleon performed prodigies. His unexpected appearance on the field
                    of battle produced an effect equally rapid and extraordinary upon the troops. In
                    an instant the enthusiasm of glory animated the features of the young
                    conscripts, who had been somewhat astonished by their first interview with the
                    enemy; the action recommenced with the greatest fury; and for more than four
                    hours the troops on both sides fought under the eyes of their respective
                    sovereigns. Marshal Macdonald and General Bertrand now arrived with their corps,
                    which, having formed a junction, entered into line. Perceiving that the crisis
                    of the battle had arrived, Napoleon advanced sixteen battalions of the young
                    guard, ranged in a second line six battalions of the old guard, and established
                    a battery of eighty pieces of cannon. The infantry immediately attacked; the
                    artillery thundered on the formidable position of Kaya, on which depended the
                    fortune of the day; and victory, which had long hovered with doubtful pinions
                    over this field of carnage, at length settled on the standards of her ancient
                    favourite. The battle of Lutzen was gained principally by artillery, in which
                    arm the French had a great superiority; but success was dearly purchased, the
                    victors having, by their own account, lost in killed and wounded about ten
                    thousand men. Nor was the victory productive of any brilliant or important
                    results. The want of cavalry prevented Napoleon from pursuing the enemy while in
                    disorder, and the fruits of success were therefore confined to the possession of
                    that part of Saxony which is situated on the left of the Elbe. Still the battle
                    of Lutzen deserves to be considered as one of the greatest achievements of
                    Napoleon. With a mass of raw and scarcely half-disciplined conscripts, the
                    greater part of them mere boys, aided by a few thousand experienced troops, he
                    had defeated the whole Prussian army, assisted by a corps of Russians, and
                    protected by a numerous and greatly superior cavalry.</p>
                <p>Instead of confining his views to Leipsic, Napoleon now: occupied Dresden, and
                    prepared to pursue the allies across: the Elbe. Having thrown a bridge across
                    that river, he accordingly marched to attack the Austrians and Prussians at
                    Bautzen, where they were drawn up in a position of great strength, upon the
                    range of hills forming the natural boundary of Silesia. Napoleon forced the
                    passage of the Spree in their front, and occupied Bautzen. The whole of the 20th
                    May was spent in manoeuvres and partial combats, the object of which was to
                    enable him to get within reach of the enemy. On the 21st the battle was fought.
                    It commenced by simultaneous attacks directed against both flanks of the enemy;
                    but, owing to the great development of their line, which extended along many
                    leagues, and was intersected by hills, Napoleon found it alike impossible to
                    watch these movements, or, until assured of their success, to order the troops
                    under his own immediate command to advance. He therefore held back the centre,
                    in the midst of which he remained during the cannonade, and being overcome by
                    fatigue, fell fast asleep. At length, upon hearing fresh sounds of artillery in
                    the distance, his attendants awoke him. By the direction of the sound he knew
                    that his wings were victorious, and instantly ordered forward his centre,
                    supported by the imperial guard. This attack proved decisive of the fate of the
                    battle. The allies were beaten, and obliged to abandon their line of defence,
                    which covered Silesia, and to retire into Bohemia. But, as at Lutzen, they
                    retreated without precipitation or disorder, leaving neither cannon nor
                    prisoners in the hands of the conquerors. This negative advantage they owed
                    partly to their superiority in cavalry, and partly also to their position. At
                    Bautzen the Prussians fought well, the Russians indifferently. With the former
                    the quarrel had long become national; the latter were far from their homes, and
                    careless whether they advanced or retreated. The victory of Bautzen uncovered
                    Silesia, and opened to the French a passage to the Oder. Glogau was relieved,
                    Breslau occupied, and Berlin itself menaced. The Russian and Prussian armies
                    were obviously unable to cope with the young soldiers of France; and hence, in
                    retiring into Bohemia, the allies renewed their instances with Austria, to
                    induce her to join the coalition. Accordingly, on the day after <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193516073" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6073-0162"/>the battle of Bautzen, a
                    message reached the French headquarters, proposing an armistice. We shall
                    immediately see how Napoleon was first deceived, and then insulted, by a power
                    on whose neutrality he had too hastily calculated.</p>
                <p>At Goerlitz, in Lusatia, the French were severely handled, and lost several
                    cannon. This affair took place on the 22d of May. The enemy, however, continued
                    their retreat towards the Oder, followed by Napoleon, who had astonished Europe
                    by the spontaneous creation of a new army, and whose late success had
                    re-established his renown. On the 30th Hamburg was retaken by Marshal Davoust
                    and General Vandamme, who thus recovered the territory situated on the right
                    bank of the Lower Elbe, which had been annexed to the French empire by a decree
                    of the senate dated the 13th December 1810. On the 4th of June an armistice was
                    concluded at Plesswitz in Silesia, between Napoleon and his enemies. The French
                    were only to occupy a small part, and that the least fertile, of Silesia; their
                    line was not to extend to the Oder, except in a space extremely confined; and
                    Breslau was to remain free between the two armies; so that the French were, in
                    some sort, pressed into a country devastated, burned, exhausted, and menaced
                    with famine. In subscribing conditions so extremely disadvantageous, Napoleon
                    was no doubt influenced by the hope of seducing his enemies, or disuniting their
                    formidable coalition, and also by the desire to gain time in order to repair his
                    losses by means of very considerable reinforcements which he expected from
                    France, andbymeansof which he wouldbe enabled to act with larger masses. Victory
                    had again returned to his standards, and he confided in the power of his genius
                    for repairing every disaster, and obtaining new triumphs. The enemy were also
                    guided by the same desire of augmenting their forces, without wishing, however,
                    that the armistice should be followed by a peace. They reckoned on a general
                    rising in Germany; on the defection of the confederation of the Rhine; on
                    popular movements in Holland, Switzerland, the Tyrol, Italy, Dalmatia; on the
                    progress of Wellington in the south of France, since the departure for Germany
                    of part of the troops who had been opposed to him. They also calculated upon
                    disturbances in France; and, above all, they hoped to see Austria, already under
                    arms, take an active part in this war, which, even from the geographical
                    position of the theatre of operations, could scarcely fail, if she took part in
                    the contest, to become fatal to the French.</p>
                <p>Napoleon, therefore, could not disguise from himself that the politics of all the
                    continental powers seemed on the eve of experiencing great alterations; but
                    still he endeavoured to persuade himself of the contrary. On the 14th of June a
                    treaty was concluded at Reichenbach, twelve leagues from Breslau, by which
                    England agreed to grant Prussia a subsidy of L.666,666 sterling, to enable her
                    to continue the war; and, by the same treaty, a subsidy of L.1,333,334 sterling
                    was also granted to Russia for the same purpose. Austria now offered her
                    mediation, which, by a convention signed at Dresden upon the 30th June, was
                    accepted by Napoleon. The professed object of this mediation was the
                    accomplishment of a general peace, or, if that could not be effected, a
                    continental pacification. With this view a congress was to be opened at Prague
                    on the 5th of July; and, in the mean time, the armistice of Plesswitz was
                    prolonged until the 10th of August. In signing this preliminary act, Metternich
                    commenced that course of duplicity for which he has since become so deservedly
                    famous in Europe, and Austria remained faithful to her oblique system of policy,
                    even more so indeed than to that of temporising, which she has at all times
                    followed. At this moment her only aim was to profit by all the chances; in
                    transporting, or rather hawking, her alliance from camp to camp, she had but one
                    view, namely, to be always on the side which should obtain the division of the
                    spoil. As Russia desired Poland, and Prussia Saxony, so Austria had her eye
                    continually fixed on Italy. Her media- ' tion, therefore, was neither more nor
                    less than a manoeuvre to gain time and enable her to watch events. The peace was
                    altogether a pretext of the allied cabinets, to mask their real views. The
                    opening of the congress of Prague on the 12th of July, to which day it had been
                    postponed, clearly indicated the objects which were aimed at. In the absence of
                    one of the two French envoys, the ministers of Austria, Prussia, and Russia,
                    commenced the conferences, and promptly decided that Germany should remain
                    independent; they, however, consented to leave Napoleon in possession of the
                    French empire, with the boundaries of the Rhine and the Alps. This was not
                    negotiation, but dictation; not an attempt to conciliate or adjust interests,
                    but to give the law. Italy was disposed of by an implication, in the absence of
                    the principal French negotiator; the confederation of the Rhine was annihilated;
                    and Napoleon, though victorious, was called upon to accept of terms which would
                    have been sufficiently harsh and humiliating after defeat. But this was merely
                    insulting. Perfidy followed. The armistice expired upon the 10th of August; and
                    it was not until the 7th of that month that the Austrian minister at Prague
                    brought forward the conditions definitively fixed by his court as necessary to
                    the pacification of the Continent. He demanded, first, the dissolution of the
                    duchy of Warsaw, and its partition between Russia, Austria, and Prussia;
                    secondly, the re-establishment of the towns of Hamburg, Lubeck, <hi
                    rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> in their independence; thirdly, the re-construction
                    of Prussia, with a frontier on the Elbe; fourthly, the cession to Austria of all
                    the Illyrian provinces, including Trieste; fifthly, a guarantee that the state
                    of the powers, great and small, such as it might be fixed by the peace, should
                    not be altered except by common consent. The question of the independence of
                    Holland and Spain was at the same time brought forward; but the
                    plenipotentiaries of the allied powers seemed inclined to consent that it should
                    be adjourned until a general peace. The answer of Napoleon, containing certain
                    proposed modifications, was promptly returned, and, by incredible expedition, it
                    reached Prague in the night between the 10th and 11th; but the confederate
                    powers, impatient to appeal to arms, broke up the congress on the very hour when
                    the armistice expired on the 10th, and absolutely refused to receive or consider
                    the answer which had been returned.</p>
                <p>On the 12th of August Austria declared war against France, and notified
                    officially her adhesion to the alliance of Russia and Prussia.</p>
                <p>The allies had derived great advantages from the armistice. By maintaining
                    themselves in Silesia, they had secured time for the arrival of the Swedish army
                    under ’ Bernadotte, and the Russian corps under Sacken, as well as for the
                    organization of the Prussian troops, and the formation of the army of Beningsen
                    in Poland. The armistice had covered Berlin; it had also been of great use to
                    Austria, in enabling her to complete her armaments, as well as to render more
                    active her negotiations with the states of the confederation; whilst Napoleon
                    derived from it no real advantage except that of fortifying his line of
                    operations on the Elbe, which it was his object to maintain. Placed <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic">cheval</hi> on that river, with the head
                    of his army at Dresden, and the rear at Hamburg, he supported himself on all the
                    fortified points which secure the possession of that large and beautiful valley,
                    namely, Konigstein, Dresden, Torgau, Wittenberg, Magdeburg, and Hamburg, with
                    its dependencies on the Elbe, and Merseburg, Erfurth, and Wurtzburg, which
                    connect the Rhine with the Elbe. But he lost upon the Oder the garrisons of
                    Kustrin, Stettin, and Glogau, and ιq&gt;on the Vistula those of Modlin, Thorn,
                    and Dantzick; garrisons which absorbed more than <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193516086" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6086-0163"/>sixty thousand men. The grand
                    French army, divided into fourteen corps, in which the Italian, German, and
                    Polish auxiliaries were incorporated, was inferior to that of the allies with
                    which it was now about to contend, in the proportion of two to five. These corps
                    were generally weaker than during the preceding campaigns, and, united, they did
                    not exceed two hundred and eighty thousand effective combatants, of whom the
                    half were recruits who had never been in fire. The allies, on the other hand,
                    had under arms five hundred and twenty thousand men, of whom about four hundred
                    and fifty thousand were on the principal theatre of operations, viz. Austria, a
                    hundred and twenty thousand men, including the forces sent to Italy, and the
                    reserves; Russia, a hundred and thirty thousand; Prussia, a hundred and eighty
                    thousand, exclusive of the <hi rend="italic">landsturm</hi> or levy <hi
                    rend="italic">tn</hi><hi rend="italic">niaise;</hi> and Sweden, thirty thousand,
                    including the Mecklenburg and Hanseatic troops; making the total as above
                    mentioned. The French army was therefore inferior to that of the allies by two
                    hundred and twenty thousand men; yet, notwithstanding this inferiority of force,
                    Napoleon resolved to maintain his position at Dresden, and to try the fortune of
                    arms upon the Elbe. On the 11th the Austrians effected a junction with the
                    Prussians, in the hope of anticipating Napoleon; but, as we shall immediately
                    see, they were themselves anticipated.</p>
                <p>Having divined the plan of the allies, which was to direct their forces from
                    three points upon Dresden (viz. from Berlin on the north, Silesia on the east,
                    and Prague on the south), and there concentrate them to make a combined attack
                    on that position, Napoleon calculated that before their grand army, debouching
                    from Bohemia, could arrive under the fire of the redoubts constructed around
                    Dresden, he would have time to execute a combined operation by simultaneously
                    attacking Berlin on the north, and projecting his army of Silesia towards
                    Breslau on the east. With this design, he first executed a military march in
                    Lusatia on the 16th of August; on the 18th he advanced as far as Görlitz, near
                    the frontier of Silesia, threatening to throw himself upon Blucher, who
                    commanded a powerful army; then, abruptly changing his direction, he turned
                    towards Bohemia, in order to ascertain if it might still be ]&gt;ossible to
                    prevent the junction of the forces in Silesia with the Austrians. But, although
                    Napoleon was still ignorant of the fact, neither of them had waited till the
                    16th to commence the development of their hostile manoeuvres. He however marched
                    with the second and eighth corps under Victor and Poniatowski, supported by the
                    first and fourth corps of cavalry under Lefebvre-Desnouettes and Kellerman.
                    Debouching from the environs of Zittau, these troops passed the frontier,
                    advanced by the defiles, and occupied Reichemberg on the Neisse, and Friedland
                    on the Willich. But having received information that the enemy, apprised of his
                    departure from Dresden, were pouring their masses in that direction, Napoleon,
                    calculating that they would require eight days to assemble under the walls of
                    that place, countermarched, and, like an arrow shot from a bow, flew to attack
                    Blucher, and drive him beyond the Bober. On the 21st of August he crossed the
                    Bober, on the 22d he repulsed the enemy on the bank opposite to Katzbach, and
                    again defeated diem on the 24th. Three days had sufficed to inflict two defeats
                    on the enemy, and to reestablish his eagles in advance in Silesia. But as it was
                    now time to return to Saxony, into which the great mass of the allied army had,
                    on the 20th, descended from the mountains of Bohemia, he faced about, and
                    leaving seventy-five thousand men under Macdonald to keep Blucher in check, he
                    arrived at Dresden on the 26th. But the effect produced by this bold and
                    brilliant operation was in a great measure lost by the failure of Oudinot, who
                    was charged with the execution of one of the three great parts of the campaign,
                    namely, the attack upon Berlin. Brave in the advanced guard, Oudinot was
                    deficient in the strategic ability necessary for conducting great operations.
                    Instead of advancing promptly, he hesitated, lost precious time, and allowed the
                    enemy to penetrate his design, and also deprive him of the lead. He was beaten
                    at Gross-Beeren; Berlin was saved; and the combined armies had now the facility
                    of advancing into the heart of Germany, and operating their junction in the
                    plains of Leipsic.</p>
                <p>Wherever Napoleon appeared personally, his ascendency was instantly manifest. But
                    his lieutenants had; neither his genius nor his foresight, and were as inferior
                    to him in activity and energy as in talent and capa- <hi rend="superscript">
                    l</hi> city. Near the Bober, a tributary of the Oder, and the Queiss, a
                    tributary of the Bober, Marshal Macdonald, in full retreat from Silesia after
                    his defeat on the Katzbach (26th of August), was again, from the 27th to the
                    29th, discomfited in a series of actions at the passage of these two rivers,
                    which the rains had swollen and converted into rapid torrents. By the results of
                    this isolated and accessory campaign of a few days, the French army lost fifteen
                    thousand men, and a hundred pieces of cannon. The defeat and surrender of
                    Vandamme followed. Wishing to drive the allied army which had fled from Dresden
                    into the defiles of Bohemia, Napoleon sent eastward, by circuitous roads, the
                    first, sixth, and fourteenth corps, with a numerous cavalry, to threaten their
                    flank, and force them back into the mountains. Vandamme commanded the column on
                    the left, Saint-Cyr and Marmont that of the centre, whilst the king of Naples,
                    with the cavalry, formed the right. On the evening of the 28th the imperial
                    head-quarters had scarcely been established at Pirna, when Napoleon was suddenly
                    seized with violent shivering, followed by vomiting. The persons around him were
                    seriously alarmed, but he himself felt more disquieted by the consequences which
                    might result from an accident so unexpected, than even by his illness, which was
                    the effect of exposure to cold and rain during the late battle. Profuse
                    perspiration, induced during the night, afforded him immediate relief, and in
                    the morning he found himself almost entirely recovered; but, unable from
                    weakness to continue with the troops, he returned to Dresden. This accident
                    detained the guard at Pirna; whilst the two corps forming the columns of the
                    centre, having experienced great difficulties in ascending the mountains and
                    penetrating the defiles, made little progress during three days. But Vandamme
                    having on the 28th dislodged an enemy’s corps from the position of Peterswalde,
                    descended next day as far as Kulm, and advanced into that deep valley, in the
                    hope of seizing Töplitz, the rendezvous of all the enemy’s columns scattered in
                    the moun tains. His advanced guard had approached within half a league of
                    Töplitz, and he only waited for his reserves to force the last obstacles, when
                    all of a sudden the enemy, ceasing to give way before him, stood firm, and made
                    the most determined resistance. The enterprise being thus checked, Vandamme,
                    instead of persisting, ought to have renounced it, and, profiting by the night,
                    regained the position of Peterswalde. He did the contrary; and the enemy being
                    powerfully reinforced, he was soon attacked both in front and flank, by at least
                    sixty thousand Austrians and Russians. For several hours, however, he resisted
                    all their efforts, retrograded without being broken, evacuated Kulm, and
                    prepared to ascend to Peterswalde; but Kleist and his Prussians having escaped
                    from Saint. Cyr, and found the position evacuated, had just occupied it. In vain
                    did the French, by the most gallant efforts, endeavour to break through the
                    enemy, which now cut off their retreat; in vain did the cavalry, clearing their
                    way with their swords to the very crest of the escarpment, seize the whole
                    artillery of Kleist; the cannon were promptly abandoned, and, overwhelmed by
                    hosts of enemies before <pb break="no" facs="nls:193516099"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-6099-0164"/>and behind, the greater part were either taken or
                    dispersed in the mountains. Vandamme, severely wounded, was made prisoner,
                    dragged in triumph to Prague, and subjected to every species of insult, in
                    retaliation of certain acts alleged to have been committed by him in the
                    countries conquered by the French. Nor did the misfortunes of Napoleon’s
                    lieutenants stop here. On the 6th of September, Ney, who had been sent against
                    Berlin, with his own corps and those of Oudinot, Reynier, and Bertrand, was
                    defeated at Dennewitz by Bernadotte, and lost two thirds of his artillery, his
                    ammunition, his baggage, and more than twelve thousand men. This disaster was
                    occasioned by the misconduct of two Saxon divisions, whose fidelity had already
                    been shaken.</p>
                <p>Although the victory of Dresden had disconcerted the first plan of offensive
                    operations adopted by the allies, it no longer exercised any influence on the
                    campaign. The anterior defeat of Oudinot at Gross-Beeren on the 23d of August,
                    that of Vandamme at Kulm on the 30th, and the grave checks'received by Macdonald
                    on the Katzbach and the Bober from the 26th to the 29th, enabled the allies to
                    pour three hundred thousand men into Saxony. The route of Ney rendered the
                    position of the French army still more critical, inasmuch as the right wing of
                    the enemy, arriving on the Elbe, was in a situation to intersect its
                    communications with Leipsic and Franconia. Immediately after the battle of the
                    27th, Napoleon had marched with the old and young guard, and other
                    reinforcements, to succour Macdonald; but the news of this disaster recalled him
                    to Dresden. From this central position, which certainly had many advantages, he
                    hoped to direct his operations in such a manner as to repair all the faults
                    committed by his lieutenants; he confided in the power of his own genius, and
                    never perhaps was its ascendency more conspicuously displayed. Every thing, in
                    fact, gave way before him. Blucher, who had defeated Macdonald, durst not commit
                    himself against Napoleon; Wittgenstein, who had made an irruption into Saxony,
                    was driven back into Bohemia; and similar attempts repeated by each of those
                    generals met with the same fate. In fact, the operations around Dresden
                    resembled what Homer recounts of the siege of Troy. When Achilles rushed forth,
                    the enemy were instantly routed and put to flight; when he retired, they took
                    courage, and failed not to gain some advantage. The plan of Napoleon was
                    magnificent, and though bold even to temerity, he had fully estimated all the
                    chances. So far from entertaining any apprehension of being cut off from France,
                    he waited at Dresden until the allies had so far committed themselves as to be
                    no longer able to avoid a general and decisive battle. Ĳis delight was to be
                    surrounded by enemies, with his army, which he knew so well how to direct,
                    compact and in hand. But his generals shrunk from such daring warfare. Brave and
                    skilful as lieutenants, they had none of that boldness and grasp of mind which
                    distinguished their illustrious chief. But the expected crisis was now
                    approaching. On the 7th of October Napoleon quitted Dresden, leaving in that
                    place Saint-Cyr with about thirty thousand men under his orders. After having
                    manoeuvred on the banks of the Mulde, so as to intercept the communications of
                    the armies of the north and of Silesia, he attacked them on the llth, 12th, and
                    13th, and forced them to retreat. It is even said that he proposed allowing the
                    allies to place themselves in the interval between the Elbe and the Saale, and,
                    covering himself by the fortified places on the Elbe, of which he was master
                    from Dresden to Hamburg, to establish the war between that river and the Oder.
                    On the 14th the imperial head-quarters were still at Düben on the Mulde, when
                    Napoleon received intelligence of the defection of Bavaria, and of the treaty of
                    Ried concluded on the 8th; but pn the 15th they were removed to Leipsic, where
                    Napoleon arrived early in the day, hoping that he would only have to do with
                    Schwartzeñ-berg. In this, however, he miscalculated.</p>
                <p>On the 16th of October the allies approached; Bernadotte and Blucher from the
                    north, ana Schwartzenberg from the south. Napoleon opposed himself to
                    Schwartzenberg, and during the entire day kept him in check upon the verge of
                    the hills which border the plain of Leipsic. Ney was less fortunate on the
                    north, where the Prussians under Blucher fought desperately, and at length
                    obliged him to retire with loss behind the Partha. But on the western side of
                    Leipsic Bertrand drove back General Giulay, and thus cleared the road towards
                    France. During the 17th the allies, notwithstanding their superiority in
                    numbers, hung back, awaiting the arrival of Beningsen’s army; the day was
                    accordingly spent in partial combats, and in preparations on both sides for the
                    inevitable conflict of the morrow. On the 18th the battle commenced to the
                    north, east, and south of Leipsic, in the vast plain extending beyond Lutzen and
                    Weissenfels, villages celebrated as the scenes of mighty deeds in arms. Leipsic
                    is surrounded with suburbs, excepting in the part towards the west, contiguous
                    to hollows, and facing a plain watered by the Pleiss and the Elster, which are
                    divided into canals, and several times intermingle before their definitive
                    junction. Haifa million of men, crowded together on a surface of three square
                    leagues, now engaged with extreme fury in the work of mutual destruction. The
                    disproportion of numbers, however, was enormous. Those of the confederate armies
                    were as follow: Army of Bohemia, Schwartzen berg, 140,000 men; army of the
                    north, Bernadotte, 65,000; army of Silesia, Blucher, 85,000; army of Poland,
                    Beningsen, 40,000; total 330,000 men. The French army was composed of the second
                    corps, Victor; the third, Ney; the fourth, Bertrand; the fifth, Lauriston; the
                    sixth, Marmont; the seventh, Reynier; the∙eighth, Poniatowski; and the eleventh,
                    Macdonald; together with the imperial guard and the cavalry. Its numbers were as
                    follow: Infantry of the line, 130,000; imperial guard, 30,000; cavalry, 15,000;
                    total 175,000. In numbers, therefore, the allied army exceeded that under
                    Napoleon by no less than a hundred and fifty-five thousand men; and this
                    unprecedented advantage was still further increased by the bad condition of the
                    French squadrons, which precluded the possibility of committing them against
                    even equal numbers of the enemy’s cavalry. Napoleon was therefore obliged to
                    rely principally on his artillery; but, pressed on all sides by overwhelming
                    masses, he in vain exhausted his ammunition; the artillery of the enemy was as
                    formidable as his, and latterly better served. Still the French soldiers fought
                    with astonishing courage, and, notwithstanding every effort, maintained their
                    ground. Poniatowski and his gallant Poles kept Schwartzenberg in check.
                    Macdonald was opposed to the Prussians, and, when hard pressed, Napoleon at the
                    head of the guard marched to his assistance, and drove back the enemy. Tc the
                    north of this attack, Bernadotte, with the army of the north, advanced against
                    Reynier, whose corps consisted chiefly of Saxon and Wurtemberg troops. Eager to
                    encounter the Prussians and Swedes, Reynier ordered thest troops to move
                    forward. They obeyed, but it was only to desert and join the enemy. Seven
                    battalions of Saxoι infantry, two regiments of Saxon cavalry, and several
                    Wurtemberg regiments, making in all twenty-six battalions and ten squadrons,
                    together with three Saxon batteries of twenty-six guns, passed over to the
                    enemy, and ranging themselves under the colours of Bernadotte, instantly
                    attacked their brothers in arms; in fact, before arriving at any distance, the
                    three batteries were turned against the division of Durutte, forming part of the
                    seventh corps and swept away entire files by a raking fire. Nevertheless<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193516112" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6112-0165"/>, the emperor,
                    undismayed by this disaster, caused his reserves instantly to advance, and
                    succeeded in checking the enemy, who were now pouring down upon Leipsic. But the
                    army could not long maintain its positions without exposing itself to total
                    ruin. It had neither been broken nor defeated; yet, after its enormous losses,
                    it was evident that want of time alone had prevented the enemy from obtaining
                    complete success. Napoleon was sensible of this; and, on the approach of night,
                    he issued orders for retreat.</p>
                <p>Next day, tire 19th, Leipsic was taken. The emperor of Russia, the king of
                    Prussia, and Bernadotte, entered by three different gates, and the king of
                    Saxony was made prisoner. Encumbered with the dead and the dying, with fugitives
                    and equipages, this city presented a horrible scene of route and carnage; but
                    the spectacle exhibited by the approaches to the suburb of Lutzen was most
                    appaling; it was a sort of gulf into which the French precipitated themselves,
                    as into a haven of safety. Nevertheless, the combat and the fusillade continued
                    for two hours, during which sixty pieces of cannon horsed, and twelve thousand
                    brave men, were saved: the enemy, master of Leipsic, feared to push to extremity
                    warriors who might set it on fire, and still more to oppose column to column in
                    a confined space. The retreat of the French could only be operated in braving
                    the greatest difficulties. Their route lay through a defile of more than two
                    thousand toises, between marshes, and along five or six bridges; nevertheless
                    the retreat was being executed without very great disorder, when some Russian
                    tirailleurs, gliding along the Elster, arrived near the principal bridge on that
                    river, which had been mined in the night. No sooner were they perceived than the
                    bridge was blown up by the chief of the post of sappers stationed there, who,
                    disregarding the safety of the emperor and of all those on the western bank,
                    fired the train. This accident, occasioned by the absence of the colonel of
                    engineers, to whom the charge of the post had been committed, having cut off the
                    retreat of all those who were still in the boulevards and suburbs, the bravest,
                    those old soldiers who had escaped the casualties of twenty campaigns, only
                    thought of selling their lives as dearly as possible, and jrerished under the
                    ruins of the houses, which they defended to the last extremity; whilst the
                    greater number believing resistance to be hopeless, fled towards the Pleiss and
                    the Elster. The first of these rivers presented few obstacles; but the other,
                    whose bed is deep and muddy, and whose banks are marshy, swallowed up all those
                    who could not swim. In this number was Prince Poniatowski, who had been created
                    a marshal of France on the 16th, and who on this same day had been wounded
                    whilst performing prodigies of valour on the field of Liebertwolkwitz. Having
                    failed to clear his way through the ranks of the enemies who surrounded and
                    pressed on him, and believing at this extreme moment, when the hands of the
                    Russians were extended to seize his person, that he might find a way to safety
                    through the waters of the Elster, he dashed into the river, and was drowned.
                    Marshal Macdonald, more fortunate, succeeded in clearing the muddy stream. The
                    carnage finally ceased about two in the afternoon. Two hundred pieces of cannon
                    and nine hundred caissons or waggons remained in the hands of the allies. The
                    loss of the French in these two days was immense, being estimated at upwards of
                    sixty thousand men killed, taken, or lost by desertion, exclusively of the
                    wounded. The number killed or mortally wounded on the field of battle did not
                    fall much short of thirty-seven thousand. But the allies paid dear for their
                    success, having lost in killed and wounded nearly eighty thousand men. This is
                    explained by the circumstance that, although their artillery was more numerous
                    than that of the French, the latter played on columns of greater depth and
                    density, and was thus proportionally more destructive. Napoleon arrived in the
                    evening at Marc-Renstaedt, and there rallied the remains of his army.</p>
                <p>Such was the terrible battle of Leipsic, the battle of nations, as the Germans
                    call it, in which the numbers of the combatants arrayed in the field, and the
                    extent of tire carnage, exceeded any thing which Europe had witnessed since the
                    use of artillery, and the results of which fixed for a time the fate of the
                    Continent. It is, however, difficult to conceive how a great captain like
                    Napoleon, who had fought thirty pitched battles and gained them all, and who had
                    attained the very summit of military glory, by availing himself with rare
                    ability of the great talents of a crowd of French generals, should have
                    concentrated his army in a position so unfavourable, and accepted a decisive
                    battle in the eastern part of the plains of Leipsic, having in his rear the
                    city, the marshes, and the waters of the Pleiss and the Eister, divided into
                    numerous canals, on which there are but few bridges. The only explanation seems
                    to be, that it no longer depended upon him to choose the position of his army;
                    for, if he had established himself beyond the Partha, the Elster, the Pleiss,
                    and the Luppa, he would have extended his army in a level country, where the
                    enemy’s cavalry, in all respects superior to his, would have interrupted and
                    paralysed all his movements. He could not avoid fighting on the 16th, in order
                    to force back die Austrian army from Leipsic, and pass the marshy defile which
                    leads from that city to Lindenau, on the road towards France. But his
                    determination to deliver battle on the 18th cannot be so easily justified. Since
                    the combats of the 16th produced no decided results how could he flatter himself
                    with being more successful on the 18th, when the enemy, more concentrated, were
                    in a condition to bring into action a still greater amount of force? Instead of
                    engaging anew, he should during the night have made dispositions for retreat,
                    which his army was still in a condition to effect, if not without embarrassment,
                    at least without disorder, and without encountering any serious obstacles.</p>
                <p>On the 23d of October the wrecks of the army defeated at Leipsic on the 18th
                    reached Erfurth, where were supplies of ammunitions, provisions, and clothing.
                    All that remained of the German troops had deserted since the battle of Leipsic.
                    On the 26th Wrede, commanding the Austro-Bavarian army, took possession of
                    Wurtzburg, and followed the course of the Mayn. The same day, the troops of
                    Wurtemberg marched to join those of Bavaria, against the French. On the 30th the
                    Austro-Bavarian army, amounting to about sixty thousand men, was found posted at
                    Hanau, on the line which the French had followed from Erfurth, no doubt in the
                    hope of arresting their progress, and thus affording time to Blucher to attack
                    them in the rear, whilst the grand army of Bohemia turned their left flank, and
                    that under the orders of the prince royal of Sweden (Bernadotte) extended itself
                    beyond their right. Placed under the necessity of breaking through this mass of
                    fresh troops, the French fell upon them with incredible fury, and cleared a way
                    by crushing all that opposed them. General Curial at the head of two battalions
                    of the old guard, General Nansouty with the cavalry of the old guard, and
                    General Drouot with fifty pieces of artillery, carried all before them, and not
                    only saved the remains of a brave army, but illustrated its retreat by a
                    brilliant victory. Wrede, who imagined that he had learned the art of war by
                    serving under the French colours, was wounded; whilst the loss of twelve
                    thousand men in killed, wounded, and prisoners, punished the temerity of the
                    general and the ingratitude of his country. Napoleon repassed the Rhine on the
                    1st of November with the remains of the guard and six corps d’armée, the
                    numerical force of which had been reduced nearly two thirds; and on the 9th he
                    arrived at the palace of Saint-Cloud.</p>
                <p>The second overthrow of the French was necessarily productive of more decisive
                    results than the first; Leipsic-completed what the disastrous fate of the
                    Russian expedition had only commenced. Germany regained its independence<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193516125" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6125-0166"/>, by which we mean
                    that it disengaged itself from all connection with France. The confederation of
                    the Rhine was dissolved. Hanover resumed its allegiance to England. Ferdinand
                    VII. was released from Valençay, and acknowledged as king of Spain. Holland,
                    evacuated by the French troops, recalled the stadtholder. Denmark concluded an
                    armistice with Russia, by which Napoleon lost his only ally in the north; and
                    Davoust was isolated in Hamburg, without the possibility of disengaging himself
                    Naples and Sweden alone remained under men of the Revolution, who both retained
                    their regal stations by betraying at once the chief whom they had served, and
                    the country which gave them birth. The exterior frame-work of Napoleon’s pow er
                    had been shattered to pieces by the rude shocks of adverse fortune; and all the
                    changes produced ou the Continent, whether directly by the Revolution, of
                    through the instrumentality of the extraordinary person who had been constituted
                    its representative, were obliterated. Nor were his enemies confined to the
                    provinces beyond the Rhine. The royalists stirred in the provinces, the
                    republicans in the capital; and, feeling the compression of despotism removed,
                    the constitutionalists of the first National Assembly began to raise their
                    heads, and to build hopes of re-establishing a representative government. In the
                    legislative body itself, purified as it had been of all those who were conceived
                    to be friendly to free institutions, there were men who still retained their
                    attachment to the principles which they had originally professed; and five of
                    its members, intrusted with drawing up an address, to be presented on the 1st of
                    January 1814, ventured to allude to the liberty of the subject, the necessity of
                    reforming abuses, and the urgent expediency of accepting peace, and being
                    contented with the frontiers of the Rhine and the Alps. This manifestation of
                    independent opinion excited the astonishment and indignation of Napoleon, who,
                    after replying in a style worthy of a disciple of Cagliostro, adjourned the
                    meeting of the legislative body, and shut up its hall.</p>
                <p>The situation of Napoleon had now become worse than critical. All Europe in arms
                    was arrayed against France, whose active means of defence had been nearly
                    annihilated in two campaigns terminating in unparalleled disasters. When
                    Napoleon recrossed the Rhine on the 1st of November 1813, he had not more than
                    thirty-five thousand men in a condition to face the enemy; and even towards the
                    close of the year, when three hundred thousand conscripts had been placed at the
                    disposal of the government, his total numerical force did not exceed three
                    hundred and sixty thousand men, whilst eleven hundred thousand enemies were
                    advancing from various points to pour their invading torrents upon France. On
                    the 11 th November, Dresden capitulated on honourable terms, which, however,
                    Schwartzenberg refused to ratify, and the French troops were marched as
                    prisoners into Austria; on the 1st of January 1814, Dantzick surrendered in
                    virtue of a convention, which the Russians in like manner refused to execute;
                    and the other fortresses occupied by the French in Germany speedily shared the
                    same fate. It has been said that the allies offered Napoleon France, imperial
                    France, with the Rhine for its boundary, and that this fair, this generous
                    offer, was madly refused by him. But this charge is without foundation. On the
                    2d of December 1813, Lite Duke of Vicenza, in a note addressed to the minister
                    of Austria, declared that the Emperor Napoleon adhered to the general and
                    summary bases proposed in the name of the allied powers at Franckfort, and also
                    agreed that negotiations should immediately ensue in a congress to be assembled
                    at Manheim. The bases proposed were, France confined within her natural limits
                    between the Rhine, the Alps, and the Pyrenees; Spain replaced under its ancient
                    dynasty; and Italy, Germany, and Holland, re-established as states independent
                    of France, and of every preponderating power. To these preliminaries Napoleon
                    now declared his unqualified adherence. The allied powers, however, were bent
                    upon conquest, not conciliation; their armies were preparing to pass the Rhine
                    for the purpose of . invading F rance; and their insincerity was proved by the
                    evasions which they practised when the bases proposed by themselves had been
                    unreservedly acceded to. Meanwhile the tide of war continued to roll on towards
                    France. On the 21st of December, six divisions of the enemy under ,
                    Schwartzenberg, amounting to more than a hundred thousand men, crossed the Rhine
                    between Basle and Schaffhausen, and ten days thereafter occupied Geneva. On the
                    31st,</p>
                <p>• the army of Silesia under Bluchercroβsed the Rhine between ' Manheim and
                    Coblentz; Bulow, advancing from Holland,! passed still more to the north; and
                    Wellington, descending I from the Pyrenees, was preparing to invade the south
                    of</p>
                <p>France. On the 25th of January 1814, Napoleon left Paris</p>
                <p>* to join the army, and give new proofs of transcendent military genius in
                    maintaining to the last a hopeless contest.</p>
                <p>Schwartzenberg, having advanced through Upper Burgundy, had come upon the Seine,
                    the course of which he intended to pursue towards Paris. Blucher, having passed
                    the Vosges Mountains, had established himself on the Marne, at Saint-Dizier and
                    at Joinville. Between these two rivers was the principal mass of the enemy,
                    amounting at least to a hundred and fifty thousand men. Napoleon could not
                    muster half that number, and the greater part of his army consisted of raw
                    levies who had never been in fire. Advancing from Chulons-sur-Mame, and throwing
                    himself between Schwartzenberg and Blucher, he directed his first blow at the
                    Utter. The Prussian commander now (29th January) occupied Brienne, with the
                    Russian corps of Sacken and Alsufiew, belonging to the army of Silesia, and was
                    at dinner in the castle when the French under Ney drove in his outposts. The
                    château, the town, and its approaches, naw became the scene of fierce combats,
                    in all of which the French were victorious. The castle was taken; and Blucher,
                    who had barely time to effect his escape, was compelled to fall back, take up a
                    position, and wait for reinforcements. The audacity of Napoleon increased in
                    proportion to the immobility of his enemies, who, in fact, durst not execute any
                    movement in his presence except in overwhelming masses. But as the battle of
                    Brienne had failed in its object of preventing the junction of Blucher and
                    Schwartzenberg, he should have returned in all haste to the town of Troyes,
                    where Marshal Mortier would have given him a considerable augmentation of force,
                    instead of waiting to measure himself a second time with an enemy so greatly
                    superior. On the 1st of February, Blucher, reinforced by the corps under Giulay,
                    Wrede, the Prince of Wurtemberg, and the Grand Duke Constantine of Russia, which
                    carried the force under his command to about a hundred and ten thousand
                    combatants, became the assailant in his turn, and attacked the French at La
                    Rothière, a village situated in the plain bounded by the Aube and its tributary
                    the Voire, and distant about two leagues and a half north of Brienne. Napoleon,
                    though he had scarcely forty thousand men present under arms, did not hesitate
                    to accept battle. The engagement commenced at one o’clock in the afternoon, and
                    did not terminate until midnight. Attacked along their whole line, the French
                    stood their ground with great firmness, and towards evening the Russians in the
                    centre began to waver; but a vigorous charge executed by Blucher secured him the
                    advantage. In the battle of La Rothière the French lost about six thousand men,
                    of whom two thousand five hundred were prisoners, and more than fifty pieces of
                    cannon. The loss of the allies in killed and wounded was nearly as great, but it
                    little affected their mass. In the night the French retreated to Troyes, without
                    being pursued in any direction; a proof of the incapacity or timidity of the
                    Prussian commander. <hi rend="subscript"> (</hi></p>

                    Austrians, tardy in their operations, both from character and from policy, and
                    persisted in advancing along the Marne. Meanwhile a congress was opened at
                    Châtillon between the four great allied powers ana France. It was composed of
                    Count Stadion, Baron Humboldt, and Count Rasumowski, plenipotentiaries of
                    Austria, Prussia, and Russia; England was represented by Lords Aberdeen,
                    Catheart, and Castlereagh; and Caulaincourt, duke of Vicenza, appeared as the
                    envoy of France. The result of the battle of La Rothière had decided Napoleon to
                    treat conformably to the bases proposed at Franckfort; and the congress
                    accordingly met on the 4th of February. But whilst occupied with the congress of
                    Châtillon, Napoleon had his eye upon Blucher, whose rash advance along the Mame
                    now inspired him with the idea of surprising and defeating the Prussians. Full
                    of this idea, and finding that the allies rose daily in their demands, and
                    refused to leave even Belgium to France, Napoleon recalled the carte-blanche
                    which a few days previously he had given to Caulaincourt, and, on the 9th of
                    February, refused to ratify the conditions transmitted to him by his minister
                    from Châtillon. An opportunity of striking a blow had now presented itself, and
                    he resolved once more to commit all to the fortune of a battle.</p>
                <p>Having abandoned Troyes, Napoleon transferred his army, by cross roads and forced
                    marches, from the Seine to the Marne, along which Blucher was confidently
                    advancing towards Paris, under the impression that the battle of La Rothière was
                    the last serious effort of the French. Of this notion he was speedily and
                    severely disabused. On the IOth of February Napoleon threw himself on the
                    Russian corps of Alsufiew, which formed the left flank of the Prussian army, and
                    occupied a position near Sezanne in order to connect the two allied armies. The
                    attack was made with such rapidity and impetuosity, that, of six thousand
                    Russians, scarcely fifteen hundred escaped. Alsufiew, two other generals,
                    forty-five officers, eighteen hundred soldiers, and twenty-one pieces of cannon,
                    were the trophies of the day of Champaubert. On the 1 lth, at Montmirail,
                    Napoleon came up with the corps under General Sacken, at the moment when he was
                    endeavouring to operate his junction with the Prussian general Yorck, and
                    defeated both with the loss of three thousand men killed and wounded, a number
                    of prisoners, twenty-one pieces of cannon, and nearly all their baggage. In two
                    days, three of Blucher’s lieutenants had been defeated, and the wrecks of their
                    con» driven beyond the Marne. On the 14th the emperor, after gaining some
                    advantages at Château-Thierry, on the 12th and 13th attacked Blucher himself at
                    Vaucamp, a league and a half west of Montmirail, and defeated him with the loss
                    of seven thousand killed and wounded, three thousand prisoners, and eighteen
                    pieces of cannon. Leaving Blucher thus humiliated to await the arrival of the
                    Russians under Winzingerode, who were advancing from Belgium to support him,
                    Napoleon now turned towards the Seine, where the grand army of the allies was
                    manoeuvring separately, with its advanced posts beyond Moret and Provins, whilst
                    parties extended to the south of Fontainebleau, and spread alarm even to the
                    gates of Orleans. Supported by Marshals Victor, Oudinot, and Macdonald,
                    commanding the remains of the corps, conducting himself the old and young guard,
                    and reinforced by troops which had arrived from Spain, Napoleon advanced on the
                    loth against the flank of the enemy disseminated upon the right bank of the
                    Seine. The French army presented a mass of about fifty thousand men. On the 17th
                    several strong Austro-Russian divisions, in full march on Paris, were completely
                    defeated near Nangis, by the emperor, who on the 15th had left Montmirail with
                    his guard and the corps of Marshal Ney, and marched twenty-eight leagues in two
                    days. In this action the enemy lost five thousand men, as many prisoners, and a
                    dozen cannon. But its result would have been more considerable if Victor had
                    acted with greater decision. The combat of Montereau on the 18th was merely a
                    continuation of that of the preceding day. The Prince of Wurtemberg being
                    impetuously attacked, lost seven thousand men. Generals Gérard and Pa-jol had
                    the greatest share in the success of the day. It was during this affair that
                    Napoleon said gaily to his soldiers, who murmured at seeing him expose himself,
                    “Ne craignez rien, mes amis; le boulet qui me tuera n’est pas encore fondu.”</p>
                <p>These successes revived the confidence of Napoleon in his genius and fortune, and
                    blinded him to the dangers by which he was menaced. After crushing Alsufiew at
                    Champaubert, he wrote to his plenipotentiaries at Châtillon to assume a prouder
                    attitude. The victory of Montmirail confirmed him in the belief that every thing
                    might yet be repaired; and this conviction was strengthened by the subsequent
                    successes at Nangis and Montereau. To an Austrian officer, who came to propose
                    an armistice, and urge his acceptance of the conditions of Châtillon, he
                    returned for answer that he would accede to those of Franckfort, but would on no
                    account consent to yield up Belgium. “Recollect,” said he, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> ∙ that I am nearer to Munich than my enemies are to
                    Paris." The conditions now offered were no doubt severe and humiliating.
                    Departing from the bases founded on the natural limits of France, which they had
                    themselves proposed at Franckfort, the allies now proposed that the emperor of
                    the French should renounce all the acquisitions made by France since the
                    beginning of 1792, and all constitutional influence beyond her ancient limits;
                    that he should recognise in the allied powers the right of determining,
                    conformably to the treaties they had entered into among themselves, the limits
                    and relations of the countries ceded by France, as well as of their own states,
                    without interfering therein in any manner of way; that all the colonies of
                    France should be restored to her, excepting Tobago, and the isles of Bourbon and
                    France; that all the fortresses of the ceded countries, and all those still
                    occupied by French troops in Holland, Belgium, Germany, and Italy, should be
                    given up without exception, and with the least possible delay; and that, under
                    the denomination of depots, the strong places of Besançon, Béfort, and Huningen,
                    should be occupied by the allierl armies until the ratification of a definitive
                    peace. Such were the humiliating conditions agreed to at Châtillon, and which
                    Austria now strenuously urged Napoleon to accept. “The peace,” observed some
                    one, “will be good enough, if it is time enough.” “It will come too soon,”
                    replied Napoleon, “if it bring disgrace.”</p>
                <p>On the 24th February, the French, after several affairs with the rear-guard of
                    the allied army, now in retreat, reoccupied Troyes. Some manifestations of
                    royalism were exhibited at this place, and one unfortunate individual lost bis
                    life. At Troyes a flag of truce arrived from the Austrian head-quarters
                    proposing an armistice, which, however, Napoleon refused except on the condition
                    of its extending to the whole line. The urgent remonstrances of the king of
                    Prussia having roused Schwartzenberg from the state of inaction in which he had
                    for some time remained, an attack was resolved upon, and, on the 27th, forty
                    thousand Austro-Russians advanced against fifteen thousand French under the
                    orders of Oudinot and Gérard. Oudinot allowed himself to be surprised, and was
                    only saved by the admirable dispositions of Gérard, and by a rapid and vigorous
                    charge of cavalry executed by Kellerman. The assailants gained nothing but the
                    field of battle. On the 2d of March Soissons was occupied by Bulow, the
                    commandant of the city having opened the gates without making an attempt to
                    defend it, although he had a sufficient garrison under his orders, and the sound
                    of the cannon already announced the approach of the French. On the 4th Marshal
                    Macdonald assumed the command of all the troops in presence <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193516151" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6151-0168"/>of the grand allied army,
                    amounting to about thirty thousand; and having evacuated Troyes and abandoned
                    the basin of the Yonne, he retired to establish his line of defence from Nogent
                    to Montereau. On the 7th Napoleon attacked Blucher at Craonne, about three
                    leagues south-east of Laon. The French had only thirty thousand men, the
                    Prussians upwards of a hundred thousand; but the force of the attack was
                    principally directed against twenty-two thousand Russians under Generals
                    Woronsow and Sacken. The action was long and obstinate; during the day the
                    Russians maintained their ground against the furious and reiterated onsets of
                    the French, and retreated in the night towards Laon, where they formed a
                    junction with the Prussians. In the critical situation of Napoleon this victory
                    was equivalent to a defeat. Laon, a place which served as an entrepôt to the
                    allied army, was next attacked, but without success. In the night of the 9th,
                    Marmont, advancing to support Napoleon in the approaching attack, suffered
                    himself to be surprised by Blucher, and lost two thousand five hundred
                    prisoners, with forty pieces of cannon. The consequences of this check were
                    fatal to Napoleon. On the following day he persisted in his design of
                    endeavouring to carry Laon by main force, but all his efforts failed, chiefly
                    from the want of artillery.</p>
                <p>At Laon had vanished Napoleon’s last hope of retriev- ’ing his fortunes in the
                    field. He therefore dispatched orders to Caulaincourt to treat with the allies
                    upon any terms; but the time fixed for receiving his answer to the conditions
                    proposed had elapsed, and, taking advantage of the change of circumstances, the
                    allied plenipotentiaries refused to enlarge it. Caulaincourt now gave in a
                    counter project, by which the emperor consented to restrict his domination
                    within the boundaries of ancient France, with Savoy, Nice, and the island of
                    Elba, on condition that the crown of the kingdom of Italy, with the frontier of
                    the Adige on the side of Austria, should be given to Eugene Beauharnais; but
                    this the allied plenipotentiaries rejected, and the congress broke up. Disasters
                    now thickened around Napoleon. Encouraged by the presence of the English army
                    under Wellington, Bordeaux declared in favour of the Bourbons; and intriguing
                    statesmen of the Revolution, at the head of whom was Talleyrand, were preparing
                    a similar re-action in the capital, in the hope of establishing a constitutional
                    government under the auspices of a restoration. Hitherto the allies had
                    carefully abstained from openly espousing the cause of the exiled princes; but
                    the manifestations of royalism in the provinces, and intimation of the intrigues
                    carried on in the capital, emboldened them not only to advance upon Paris, but
                    to declare in favour of a restoration.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Napoleon, having left Mortier and Marmont ’ with nearly twenty thousand
                    men, and given orders to the commandants of places on the Moselle, the Meurthe,
                    and the Meuse, to push strong parties in the rear of the enemy, marched on the
                    17th from Reims, at the head of about eighteen thousand men, with the intention
                    of effecting a junction with Macdonald, who was advancing with thirty thousand;
                    and, on the 20th, he moved on the Aube against Schwartzenberg, who had under his
                    command a hundred thousand effective combatants. During this day and the
                    following one, Napoleon displayed the talents of a great captain with the <hi
                    rend="italic">sang-froid</hi> of a brave soldier, manoeuvring wdth transcendent
                    skill, and fighting with the most determined bravery. With the loss of about
                    four thousand men the proposed junction was effected, and Napoleon retired on
                    Saint-Dizier and Joinville without being pursued. In thus operating on the right
                    bank of the Upper Marne, the emperor no doubt hoped to draw the enemy out of
                    their positions on the Aube, and cause them renounce their direction on Paris,
                    as well as to rally some reinforcements which had been sent to Metz. It has been
                    commonly supposed that his intention was, at the risk of uncovering Paris, to
                    manoeuvre in their rear, and intercept their communications with the Rhine; but
                    his troops were too feeble, particularly in cavalry, to enable him to flatter
                    himself with attaining such a result. Napoleon made every possible effort to
                    retard their advance, and, on the 26th, defeated with great loss ten thousand
                    Russian cavalry belonging to the army of Winzingerode, who had been sent in
                    pursuit of him.</p>
                <p>On the 27th he marched to succour the capital, and reached Montiérender, five
                    leagues south of Saint-Dizier. On the 29th Mortier and Marmont occupied
                    Saint-Mandé, Vincennes, and Charonne, and established themselves before the
                    barriers of Paris adjoining to these villages. On the 30th the allied troops
                    commenced the attack of the several heights, occupied by about twenty-five
                    thousand soldiers of all arms. The French assumed the offensive on the principal
                    points, and the villages of Pantin and Romainville were taken and retaken
                    several times. The battle commenced at sunrise, and at eleven o’clock in the
                    forenoon the Austrians and Russians were still in complete check. But at that
                    moment the Prussians appeared, entered into line, and proceeded to arrange their
                    attacks. Seized with terror, Joseph Bonaparte, who acted as generalissimo, now
                    only thought of providing for his own personal safety; and having intimated to
                    Mortier and Marmont that he authorized them to capitulate, he fled with all the
                    precipitation of a Thersites. A capitulation was accordingly concluded, and on
                    the last day of March the emperor of Russia and the king of Prussia entered the
                    French capital at the head of their troops. When Napoleon, who had reached
                    Fontainebleau on the 30th, encountered, in the evening of that day, while
                    advancing towards tl&gt;e capital, some of the troops of Marmont retiring by
                    virtue of the capitulation, he refused to give credit to the tidings; and it was
                    only by persuasion, amounting to force, that he was induced to return to
                    Fontainebleau. No wonder his astonishment was great. If the minister Clarke had
                    delivered twenty thousand new muskets to the national guard, to those robust
                    workmen who loudly demanded arms, the heights would not in all probability have
                    been carried on the 30th; and the sudden apparition of Napoleon in the centre of
                    such immense resources as Paris presented, might have suddenly changed the
                    fortune of the war, and led to a very different result; whilst a check sustained
                    by the allies before Paris would have inevitably led to their destruction, by
                    rousing all France to crush the invaders. But treason deprived Napoleon of the
                    last great resource on which he had all along calculated, and completed the
                    subjugation of France. A provisional government was appointed, with Talleyrand
                    at its head; and a proclamation was issued by the allied sovereigns, refusing to
                    treat with Napoleon as sovereign of France. In these circumstances, finding
                    himself deserted by his marshals, officers, and dependents, from Berthier,
                    prince of Neufchatel, down to the Mamluke Rustan, this wonderful man, who had
                    never appeared greater than during the late struggle, signed an unconditional
                    abdication, and, on the 11th of April 1814, his dynasty expired.</p>
                <p>There yet remain to be treated of, the first restoration; the reign of the
                    hundred days, with the extraordinary events crowded into that short space; the
                    second restoration, that comedy of fifteen years, as it has been called; and,
                    lastly, the revolution of July 1830, by which the third impression of the old
                    monarchy was destroyed, and a new dynasty established in France on the basis of
                    the interests created by the first revolution. But unavoidable circumstances,
                    and a desire to procure authentic information, render it proper that we should
                    stop at the epoch of Napoleon’s abdication in 1814; and for the details
                    necessary to complete our historical survey, we therefore refer the reader to
                    other parts of the work, particularly to the article <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>i SITUATION AND EXTENT, PACE OP THE COUNTRY, CLIMATE AND SOIL.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> important part of continental Europe extends from
                    the forty-third to the fifty-first degree of north latitude, and from longitude
                    8∙25 east, to longitude 4∙43 west. The greatest length of France, exceeding 600
                    miles, is from east to west, viz. from Alsace to Bretagne, a province which
                    projects into the Atlantic like a wedge, and without which France would approach
                    in form to a square. Its breadth from north to south is about 560 miles; and its
                    superficial extent, as stated in the <hi rend="italic">Statistique</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de la France,</hi> is 52,768,618 hectares, equal to 185,515 square
                    miles, or J 18,729,390 English acres.</p>
                <p>Though in point of extent of coast and ready access from the interior to the sea,
                    France is far inferior to Britain and Ireland, she is, on the other hand, more
                    fortunate in these respects than the vast inland territories of Austria and
                    Russia. She has the advantage of these countries likewise in strength of natural
                    barriers, the Pyrenees forming a great bulwark on the south-west, the Alps on
                    the south-east, and the Jura and the Vosges Mountains on the east. The
                    Netherlands are the only open part of the frontier of France.</p>
                <p>The surface of France exhibits, in general, an advantageous succession of high
                    and low ground. Less level than Poland, the north of Germany, or the greater
                    part of European Russia, it is, on the whole, less mountainous than Spain or
                    Italy, and may with great propriety be compared to England, with this
                    distinction, that whilst in the latter the mountainous tracts are in the north
                    and west, in France they are in the south and east. Passing over the lofty
                    ridges which form the frontier line of France on the side of the Pyrenees, the
                    Alps, the Jura, the Vosges, and confining our attention to the interior, we find
                    throughout Flanders, Picardy, Normandy, and thecountries to the north and south
                    of the Loire, a level country, diversified occasionally by hills, either
                    insulated or in succession, but by none of the massy elevations entitled to the
                    name of mountains. These we do not meet until reaching the south of Champagne
                    and north of Burgundy, near the sources of the Meuse, the Moselle, the Saône,
                    the Seine. From this bleak quarter (lat- 47 and 48) a very long range of
                    mountains proceeds from north to south in a direction parallel to the course,
                    first of the Saône, and subsequently of the Rhone, until, on approaching the
                    Mediterranean, they branch off to the south-west and join the Pyrenees. Their
                    greatest height is in Auvergne (about lat. 45), where this chain, or more
                    properly a lateral branch of it, attains, at the mountains called Cantal and
                    Puy-de-Dôme, an elevation of fully 6355 feet, and has its highest ridge covered
                    with snow during the greater part of the year. Another, but a much less lofty
                    range, extends from Bordeaux to the south-east, a distance of a hundred and
                    fifty miles, until it reaches the Pyrenees. The smaller chains are numerous in
                    the east and south-east of the kingdom, viz. in Lorraine, the Nivernois,
                    Dauphine, Provence; also in part of the interior, particularly the Limousin and
                    Guienne. They are interspersed with extensive plains, but, on the whole, the
                    south and east of France are rugged and elevated tracts, and may be said to be
                    to that country what Wales and Scotland are to Great Britain.</p>
                <p>The course of the great rivers is easily connected with this view of the surface
                    of the territory of France. The Moselle, the Meuse, the Marne, the Aube, the
                    Seine, the Yonne, taking their rise on the northern side of the mountain chain,
                    between lat. 47 and 48, flow all to the north or north-west, until reaching the
                    sea, or quitting the territory of France. From the southern slope of the same
                    range proceed the Saône, the Doubs, and the Ain. These, along with many smaller
                    streams, are all received by the Rhone, which flows almost due south, with a
                    full and rapid current, until it reaches the Mediterranean. The Loire has by
                    much the longest course of any river in France. It rises to the southward of
                    lat. 45, flows in a northerly direction above two hundred miles; turns, near
                    Orleans, to the west, is joined by the Cher, Indre, and Vienne from the south,
                    and, after receiving the Sarthe from the north, falls into the Atlantic below
                    Nantes. The Garonne, a river of less length of course, but of a greater volume
                    of water, descends from the French side of the Pyrenees, flows northward, and,
                    after receiving from these mountains a number of tributary streams, of which the
                    chief is the Arriège, turns to the westward near Montauban (lat. 44), and tails
                    into the Atlantic after being augmented by the waters of the Tarn, Aveyron, Lot,
                    and finally the Dordogne, all flowing from the western face of the mountains of
                    Auvergne.</p>
                <p>France has very few lakes, either in the mountainous districts of the south, or
                    in the great levels of the north and west. It contains, however, a number of
                    maritime inlets, forming inland bays, and communicating with the sea only by a
                    channel of greater or less width. These occur partly on the south-west coast, in
                    Gascony; but more in the south and south-east, in Languedoc and Provence. Their
                    want of depth prevents them from serving as roadsteads for shipping, and they
                    are useful chiefly for fishing, or for the manufacture of bay-salt.</p>
                <p>France has much less of artificial or ornamental plantations than England, and
                    much more of natural forests, the total extent of ground covered by wood being
                    computed at seventeen millions of acres, or one eighth of the territorial
                    surface of the kingdom. Forests are found in almost every department. Lower
                    Normandy contains several of considerable extent. There is a large one at
                    Fontainebleau, only forty-five miles from Paris; and a larger to the north of
                    the Loire, in the vicinity of Orleans. Those situated in the neighbourhood of
                    the sea, or of navigable rivers, or of great works, such as glass-houses and
                    iron-founderies, have long been subjected to an improvident consumption, which
                    is likely to be increased by the heavy duties imposed on foreign coal, and by
                    the undue encouragements given to the smelting of iron by the heavy duties which
                    were in 1814 and in 1822 laid on the importation of foreign iron; so that at
                    present the principal forests are at a great distance inland, particularly in
                    the east of the kingdom, in the department of Ardennes, and in the long
                    mountainous tract that forms the boundary of France on the side of
                    Switzerland.</p>
                <p>The want of ornamental plantations, and still more the almost total want of
                    hedges, forms a great deduction from the beauty of scenery in France, and
                    deprives the country of the cheerful aspect so striking in England. The nearest
                    approach to the latter is seen in travelling through the fresh pastures and
                    gentle eminences of Normandy. Of the other provinces, some, like Picardy,
                    Champagne, Poitou, consist of wide uninteresting levels; whilst others, such as
                    Auvergne, part of Upper Languedoc, and the vicinity of the Alps and Pyrenees,
                    contain a bold but bleak scenery. The most beautiful and picturesque views are
                    to be found in the Limousin, or on the borders of the great rivers. The banks of
                    the Loire from Orleans westward are proverbially beautiful. The Rhone, bordered
                    by mountains, has generally a bold, and occasionally a wild aspect. The Seine,
                    equally wide, but much more tranquil, flows through verdant but less striking
                    landscapes.</p>
                <p>In a country of so great extent and of such diversified surface as France, it is
                    difficult to condense a description of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193516177"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-6177-0170"/>the climate into a few comprehensive heads. The
                    most natural division is into the north, south, and central regions. The north,
                    comprehending Flanders, Picardy, Normandy, Bretagne, and in general all that
                    part of France which would be bounded on the south by a diagonal line from lat.
                    47 on the west to lat. 49 on the east frontier, bears a great resemblance, both
                    in temperature and produce, to the south of England, rain occurring frequently,
                    and the country being consequently fit for pasture. There, as with us, the
                    predominant culture is wheat, barley, oats, rye, and such fruit as apples,
                    pears, cherries; also hemp, flax, rapeseed. It is here, and here only in France,
                    that the natural pastures are rich and extensive; here also the species of wood,
                    oak, ash, elm, bear a close resemblance to ours. The central region may be said
                    to comprehend the country to the south of the Loire, or rather of the diagonal
                    line we have mentioned, until reaching a similar line in lat. 45 on the west and
                    47 on the east frontier. Here, with the exception of the mountainous parts, the
                    winter is sensibly shorter and milder. Wheat, barley, oats, and rye, are still
                    cultivated, but maize begins to appear, and vines become general. The weather in
                    this great inland tract is much more steady than in the north. In the summer
                    months there is little rain, and storms, when they occur, are frequently
                    accompanied with hail; but, on the whole, the temperature is perhaps the most
                    pleasant in France, being exempt equally from the oppressive heat of the south
                    and the frequent humidity of the north. The third region, comprehending the
                    whole breadth of the French territory from lat. 45 and 46 to lat. 43, and in
                    some parts to 42∙30, approaches in climate to the heat of Spain and Italy; it
                    being necessary in the summer months to suspend all active exertion during the
                    middle of the day, and to reserve it for the morning and evening. A shaded
                    situation is here the <hi rend="italic">desideratum</hi> for a dwelling, and a
                    supply of water for agriculture. In this region the heat will invariably produce
                    an exuberant crop where irrigation can be applied; hence the frequency of wells,
                    which are generally worked by a wheel and some rude machinery. Wheat is
                    partially cultivated; barley, oats, and rye, only on the high grounds; maize is
                    very general, and vines supply not only the main article of export, but the
                    usual drink of the inhabitants. The common fruits are olives and mulberries,
                    and, in a few very warm situations, oranges and lemons. Pasturage is good only
                    on mountainous or irrigated tracts. To pulmonic invalids the climate may be
                    advantageous, but in this respect also material distinctions occur from
                    locality, the winter in the south-east of France being at intervals very cold,
                    from the <hi rend="italic">vent</hi><hi rend="italic">de bise,</hi> a piercing
                    wind that blows from the Alps and the mountains of Auvergne. Here,
                    notwithstanding the latitude, the cold of winter is intense.</p>
                <p>Bretagne, projecting into the Atlantic, is as rainy as Ireland or Cornwall.
                    Normandy, with part of Picardy and French Flanders, may be compared to our
                    inland counties. In the interior of France the rains are less frequent, but far
                    more heavy; so that there is much less difference in the quantity of rain that
                    falls in the course of the year than in the number of rainy days. The atmosphere
                    of France is much less cloudy than ours. The most frequent wind in the north of
                    France, as in Britain and Ireland, is the south-west; it prevails also, but to a
                    less degree, in the central part of the kingdom. In the south of France the more
                    common winds are from the north.</p>
                <p>The difference of temperature between London and Paris is not considerable, nor
                    is the degree of heat found to be intense along the west coast of France, until
                    reaching or rather passing Poitou. In the interior it is much more perceptible,
                    being strongly felt at Lyons, and still more in the latitude of Nismes, Aix,
                    Marseilles, and Toulon. On the whole, the variations of climate between the
                    north and south of France are considerably greater than between the north and
                    south of Britain, where the effect of difference of latitude is so much modified
                    by the vicinity of the sea. We know, besides, of no such variation as the very
                    material one indicated by the diagonal line from east to west, the latter being
                    two degrees colder in consequence of the breezes and vapours of the
                    Atlantic.</p>
                <p>The harvest begins in the north of France between the 20th and 25th July, in the
                    central part about the middle of that month, in the south about the end of June.
                    September and October are the months of vintage. The great hazard to the corn of
                    the central part of the kingdom arises from violent storms of rain and hail, in
                    the south from the want of rain in spring. In winter the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vent</hi><hi rend="italic">de bise</hi> proves often destructive to the olives.
                    The great heats are in July, August, and September; a time of much annoyance in
                    the south of France, from gnats, flies, and other insects; whilst scorpions even
                    are found in that warm latitude.</p>
                <p>To exhibit a classification of the different kinds of soil is a task of
                    difficulty in any extensive country, and in none more than in France, where a
                    striking difference prevails, not only in contiguous departments, but in
                    contiguous districts of the same department. In Flanders, Picardy, Artois,
                    Normandy, and the Pays de Beance, a fertile tract to the south of Paris, the
                    soil consists frequently of a loamy mould; in the central and southern parts of
                    the kingdom it is often lighter; whilst the greater part of Bretagne, and of the
                    departments along the western coast, have a heathy soil, naturally unproductive,
                    but capable of considerable improvement. But these collective estimates are
                    liable to great deductions; and the attempts made by Arthur Young and other
                    statistical writers to calculate the prc- ⊂'' ∙n of the different descriptions
                    of soil, whether loam,</p>
                <p>, chalk, gravel, or the like, are considered by the French as far from
                    successful; even the more systematic effort made by their own government, in the
                    beginning of this century, to compute the value of land by <hi rend="italic"
                    >masses de culture,</hi> that is, by classing all kindred soils under one head,
                    proved altogether abortive. We shall forbear, therefore, all such vague
                    calculations, and proceed to state the value of annual produce in the different
                    departments, endeavouring to class the latter in lots, according to their
                    position and relative productiveness.</p>

                    rivers being too near their source to be navigable.</p>

                    adapted to the growth of the vine. But a great part of this tract (Dauphine and
                    Upper Languedoc) is mountainous; and the export of wine is consequently attended
                    with much more difficulty than along the banks of the Garonne. Wheat, maize, and
                    silk, are the other principal products.</p>

                <p>It remains that we notice a few departments so particularly circumstanced as not

                    fertile. Its products are wheat, oats, and, in the warmer situations, maize.</p>

                <p>Here the degree of fertility becomes less and less as we approach to the elevated

                <p>Nothing can be more simple and uniform than the territorial divisions of France
                    since the Revolution. Instead of old provinces or counties, disproportioned in
                    size, and having frequently their chief town at one or other of the extremities,
                    the departments of France have almost always the capital in the centre, and, in
                    their extent, approximate in a great degree to equality. Each department is
                    divided into three, four, five, or more arrondissements; each arrondissement
                    into seven, eight, or nine cantons; and each canton into twelve, fifteen, or
                    more communes. The communes in France are nearly similar to our parishes, though
                    they are constituted communes by having a civil instead of a clerical
                    functionary. The numbers of each class are as follows :—</p>

                <p>A far different result this from the gigantic empire of Bonaparte, which, after
                    his latest acquisitions in 1810, extended to Rome in the south, and to Hamburg
                    and Lubec in the north, comprehending above 130 departments, and a population of
                    forty-four millions. But of all these splendid conquests, none, with the
                    exception of the Netherlands, formed a substantial addition to the power of
                    France. The Italian provinces, separated by a vast natural barrier, were
                    inhabited by a people who bore the ascendency of their northern neighbours only
                    until circumstances should enable them to throw off the yoke, and become
                    incorporated into one great and independent state; <pb break="no"

                    more distinct in habits and language from the French, were indignant at their
                    humiliation, and eager to riβe with the first appearance of foreign aid. Belgium
                    alone had no natural barrier, no political attachment, to oppose to a union with
                    France.</p>
                <p>The ecclesiastical division of France is into archbishoprics and bishoprics.
                    These, before the Revolution, were numerous, there being eighteen archbishops
                    and a hundred and twelve bishops; but as that great political change bore
                    particularly hard on the clergy, of whom, as of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >noblesse,</hi> the great majority were adherents of the Bourbons, the number of
                    prelates was reduced, first to eighty-five, and eventually (in 1801) to fifty,
                    viz. nine archbishops and forty-one bishops. On the restoration of the Bourbons,
                    measures were taken to re-augment their number; and in 1817 a new <hi

                    creation of nine additional archbishoprics and thirty-three bishoprics, carrying

                    whole kingdom twenty-two, each having a general of rank and a body of officers
                    stationed in a central town.</p>
                <p>III. HARBOURS, <hi rend="smallcaps">navigable</hi> RIVERS, CANALS, ROADS,
                    BRIDGES.</p>
                <p>In this important point France is considerably inferior to England, her long
                    tract of coast opposite to the Atlantic and the Bay of Biscay being
                    indifferently provided with sea-ports, and those on the southern shore of the
                    Channel forming a striking contrast to the spacious maritime inlets on the side
                    of her rival. To begin from the north-east, Dunkirk has a small harbour in the
                    interior of the town, approached on the Dutch plan by a canal leading from the
                    sea. Boulogne has a shallow roadstead, indebted for its celebrity under
                    Bonaparte to the facility of giving protection, by land-batteries near its
                    entrance, to a numerous assemblage of small craft. The port of Dieppe is
                    exposed, and, of course, unsuitable for winter; that of St Malo is better; and
                    on doubling the projecting part of Bretagne, we find, in the south-west of that
                    province, L’Orient, a port adapted to the entrance of large merchantmen.
                    Proceeding further to the south, we find at La Rochelle a small but secure
                    harbour, and at Bordeaux a river nearly equal in width to the Thames at London.
                    From this there is no sea-port until we reach Bayonne, a place of no easy
                    access. On the Mediterranean, France has the ports of Cette and Marseilles, the
                    latter spaciousand secure.</p>
                <p>Nantes, though a large commercial town, adjoins a shallow part of the Loire, and
                    vessels of burden are obliged to load and unload at Paimboeuf. The great
                    dockyards and naval stations of the kingdom are at Brest and Toulon, both
                    excellent harbours, and at Rochefort, which is situated on the river Charente,
                    near its mouth. In all these the accommodation for shipping is the gift of
                    nature; but at Cherbourg the case is very different, that port containing works,
                    of which the labour and expense Ísee the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Breakwater)</hi> have been very great, ts roadstead, extensive but open, has a
                    sea-wall, which, though now in a state very different from its original
                    destination, affords some protection from the swell of the sea; and its spacious
                    dock, excavated since the beginning of this century, at an expense of
                    L.3,000,000 sterling, is capable of containing fifty sail of the line. Havre de
                    Grace, the best mercantile harbour in the north of France, has also been formed
                    at a heavy expense.</p>
                <p>The square form of France, favourable as it is for military defence, subjects the
                    greater part of the country to the want of those ready and economical means of
                    transport by sea which form the great physical advantage of Britain and Ireland.
                    Unluckily, this want is very imperfectly supplied by the inland waters, canals
                    being very thinly spread, and the navigation of the great rivers subject to many
                    obstructions; occurring in one part from rapidity, in another from shallowness;
                    at one season from drought, at another from overflow. The application of steam
                    to navigation promises to correct in part this most inconvenient tardiness; but
                    the accommodation which will even then be afforded by the Loire in the interior,
                    the Rhone in the south, the Seine in the north, and the Garonne with its Canal
                    du Languedoc in the south-west, will be but a small portion of what is furnished
                    by our numerous intersections in England, or of what is wanted for so extensive
                    a territory as that of France.</p>
                <p>The canal of Languedoc, begun in the reign of Louis XIV. and completed in the
                    year 1668, was the first example in Europe of inland navigation on a great
                    scale. It is the most stupendous undertaking of the sort that has been executed
                    in France. Its length is 148 miles, its general breadth sixty feet, its depth
                    six and a half feet. It has 114 locks and sluices, and in its highest part i t
                    is 600 feet above the level of the sea. As a scientific work, it did honour to
                    an age as yet little advanced in engineering; but in a pecuniary point of view
                    it was unproductive, the tolls never having paid the interest of the very large
                    sum (upwards of L.1,300,000 sterling) expended upon it. It extends from the
                    Mediterranean, near Agde, to the Garonne, below Toulouse, and will ere long be
                    prolonged in a northerly direction to Montauban.</p>
                <p>The canal of Briare is of earlier date, and of much less extent. The object here
                    was to open a navigation from the Loire on the south to the Seine on the north,
                    by a canal running almost due north, a distance of forty miles. It then receives
                    from the west the canal of Orleans, commenced in 1675, and proceeding also from
                    the Loire; after which the canal is continued to the north, under the name of
                    Canal de l’Oing, till it reaches the Seine. This canal was begun in 1605, in the
                    reign of Henry IV. and was completed in 1642, under Louis XIII. There are,
                    besides this great work, several other important and extensive canals in France.
                    The Canal du Centre unites the Saône and the Loire in the early part of the
                    course of the latter. It is seventy-two English miles in length, and was
                    completed in 1791, at an expense of L.456,000. Its summit level is about 240
                    feet above the level of the Loire at Digoin. It has eighty-one locks, five and a
                    half feet of water, forty-eight feeţ of breadth at the water’s edge, and thirty
                    feet at the bottom. The canal of St Quentin, twenty-eight English miles in
                    length, was completed in 1810. It joins the Scheldt and the Somme. The canal of
                    Besançon is extensive. It joins the Saône, and consequently the Rhone, to the
                    Rhine. From the Saône it stretches a little above St Jean de Losne, by Dole,
                    Besançon, and Mulhoine, to Strasburg, a distance of 200 miles, where it joins
                    the Rhine. This canal is not quite finished. The canal of Burgundy, which joins
                    the Rhone to the Seine, will, when completed, be 150 English miles in length. It
                    is at present navigable to little more than a third of this distance. The canal
                    of the Ouxeq was dug, not for a commercial purpose, but to convey the water of
                    that little <pb break="no" facs="nls:193516216" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6216-0173"
                    />river to Paris, for the consumption of the inhabitante. At a village called La
                    Villette, on the north side of Paris, there has been lately excavated, at the
                    expense of a million sterling, a basin, approaching in size to our London docks,
                    and calculated, when the necessary canals shall be completed, for the deposit of
                    merchandise brought from Havre and Rouen on the one side, and from Flanders and
                    Champagne on the other. In the south of France there is a short canal proceeding
                    from the Rhone, near Tarascon, in a south-west direction, to the Mediterranean,
                    and called, from its vicinity to a well-known annual fair, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canal de Beaucaire.</hi> These are as yet the chief canals of France. In the
                    year 1836 there were seventy-four canals, having a total length of 3,699,913
                    mètres, nearly equal to 2280 English miles. But it is probable that this
                    improved mode of communication may be superseded by the still greater
                    improvement of the rail-road, which has, to a considerable degree, engrossed the
                    public attention in France. There are, however, obstacles to the progress of
                    these improvements, arising partly from the mode of management adopted, and
                    partly also from the high price of the materials required. All great works for
                    the behoof of the community at large, such as canals, rail-roads, docks, and the
                    like, are carried on at the expense, for behoof, and under the control of the
                    government. Plans and estimates must be made out and laid before the minister of
                    the interior, who refers them to other public functionaries, namely, the prefect
                    of the department, and afterwards to the <hi rend="italic">bureau</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des ponts et des chaussées;</hi> and when all these persons are
                    satisfied, a public officer is then appointed to superintend the work. This
                    tedious official routine, through which all public undertakings have to pass,
                    tends to discourage individual enterprise, and accounts perhaps for the
                    comparatively few works of this description which have been undertaken in
                    France. The high price of iron, in consequence of the tax on foreign iron, must
                    operate as a great discouragement to the construction of rail-roads in France;
                    and thus we have an additional illustration of the ruinous effects of this tax
                    in obstructing the domestic improvement of the country.</p>
                <p>The great roads in France are managed, not, as with us, by county commissioners,
                    but by government <hi rend="italic">bureaux</hi> or boards, the chief of which
                    are at Paris. The extent of road under their direction is about 30,000 miles;
                    and the annual expenditure from L.l,300,000 to L.1,500,000, the whole of which
                    is defrayed without one toll or turnpike. An attempt was made under Bonaparte to
                    levy tolls; but this excited so much clamour in a country where commercial
                    intercourse is carried on almost wholly by land-carriage, that it was found
                    indispensable to seek the necessary funds from another source, namely, a tax on
                    salt. The great roads in France arc in general in tolerable condition; but no
                    epithet can convey an idea of the wretched state of the cross roads in almost
                    every department; full of hollows, encumbered with stones, or inundated with
                    water, they receive hardly any repair, but are abandoned, year after year, to
                    the effects of the elements.</p>
                <p>The great roads in France are much wider than in England, exhibiting frequently a
                    long straight avenue lined on each side with chestnut or other large trees. They
                    are often paved like a street for many miles in succession; the art of
                    road-making being as yet too little understood to prevent material injury from
                    the heavy waggons and ill-constructed wheels, without resorting to this
                    unpleasant alternative. Travelling is thus much less agreeable than in England,
                    particularly as the villages want neatness and cheerfulness, whilst most of the
                    towns along the road are disfigured by narrow crooked streets, in which new
                    stone buildings arc often mixed with antiquated wooden structures, such as have
                    disappeared from our provincial towns for nearly a century past. The clumsy
                    vehicles former ly used as stage-coaches in France have at length been replaced
                    in most frequented roads by coaches in the English style; and the mails are now
                    conveyed in a kind of chariot called a <hi rend="italic">malle-poste.</hi></p>
                <p>The French have as yet but few cast-iron bridges, all their great structures of
                    this description being of stone. Of these, the chief are the bridges over the
                    Loire at Orleans, Tours, and Nantes; those on a smaller scale over the Seine at
                    Paris; and those over t)ιe Saône and Rhone at Lyons. The Pont du St Esprit above
                    Orange, over the Rhone, is a long structure of sixteen arches. At no great
                    distance from it is the Pont du Gard, one of the most entire and beautiful
                    monuments of Roman architecture, composed of a triple tier of arches, erected
                    for the purpose of conducting an aqueduct over the river Gardon. This
                    magnificent structure is 157 feet in height, 530 feet in length at the bottom,
                    and 872 at the top. Of the lately erected bridges in France, the most remarkable
                    are those over the Seine at Neuilly near Paris, and over the Oise at St Maixent,
                    with two of larger dimensions, viz., one over the Garonne at Bordeaux, the other
                    over the Seine at Rouen.</p>
                <p>IV. AGRICULTURE.</p>
                <p>The agriculture of France is in a very different state from that of England or
                    Scotland, being marked by a degree of backwardness not a little surprising in a
                    country so far advanced in many departments of art and science. The causes of
                    this, however, are not of difficult explanation. France never enjoyed till
                    lately the advantage of a representative body; and the condition of the
                    peasantry was long far inferior to that of the same class in England. No
                    ecclesiastical reformation had taken place to remove a valuable part of the
                    national territory out of the hands of indolent life occupants; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">grands seigneurs,</hi> the other great body of landholders,
                    devoted their attention to Pans and Versailles, without bestowing a thought on
                    their lands or their tenantry, except to extract from them the meansof defraying
                    theirexpenses in thecapita). To this was added a system of taxation, less heavy
                    indeed than that to which we are subjected in England, but extremely crude and
                    impolitic, as evinced in the <hi rend="italic">gabelle,</hi> or tax on salt used
                    in private families, and in the <hi rend="italic">corvée,</hi> or obligation on
                    the peasantry to labour on the high roads. To these were joined the humiliating
                    enactments of the game-laws, and the more substantial injury of tithes; for the
                    clerical body in France levied this pernicious assessment as in England, though
                    possessing in property lands of the computed rent of five millions sterling.</p>
                <p>Another great drawback on French agriculture was the insignificant size of the
                    occupancies, whether held as farms or in property. A French agriculturist on a
                    small scale has little idea of selling his paternal acres, and converting the
                    amount into a capital for a farm. He is much more likely to go on as the
                    proprietor of eight or ten acres of land, and the cultivator of as many more.
                    The mode of paying rent was equally singular; money rents were general only in
                    the north or most fertile parts of France; they did not, on the whole, exist in
                    more than a fifth or sixth of the kingdom before the Revolution. A more frequent
                    species of tenure was by a grant made under a reservation of a fine, of a
                    quitrent, or of certain servitudes, of which the least burdensome were sending
                    corn to the mill, or grapes to the press, of the proprietor. But of all
                    indications of poverty and backwardness, the most striking was the system of <hi
                    rend="italic">métairie</hi> described by Dr Smith; a practice by which a tenant,
                    having little capital of his own, receives from the proprietor the live stock
                    and implements necessary for cultivating his petty tenure, and divides with him
                    its produce. This wretched method was and still is common, not indeed in the
                    north or north-east of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193516229"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-6229-0174"/>France, but in many of the poorer districts of the
                    centre and south. There are, it is to be remarked, several distinctions in this
                    system; the landholder, in some parts, providing only half the cattle and seed,
                    and in others the whole. There is of course a corresponding difference in the
                    apportionment of the produce.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">La Revolution</hi><hi rend="italic">a été faite pour le
                    cultivateur</hi> is a common saying in France; indeed, that great convulsion
                    improved so much the situation of the agriculturists, by cancelling, at one
                    decisive blow, the tithes, the game-laws, the <hi rend="italic">corvée,</hi> and
                    other relics of feudal servitude, that, after all the horrors of Jacobinism, and
                    all the tyranny of Bonaparte, the escape from former degradation still preserves
                    an attachment to the Revolution among this pacific class. Further, the sale of
                    the church lands transferred a valuable mass of property from indolent into
                    active hands. But with this we must terminate our eulogy on the Revolution, the
                    further progress made by agriculture having been caused less by any political
                    change, than by the gradual effect of experience, and the diffusion of
                    information. The degree of agricultural improvement in France since the
                    Revolution has certainly been less than in England and Scotland, and in one very
                    material point that memorable convulsion has tended to retard it; we mean by the
                    law, suggested by a jealousy of the ascendency of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >noblesse,</hi> which obliges the owner of property, whether in land or money,
                    to make an almost equal division of it amongst his children. The parent of two
                    children has the free disposal of only one third of his property, and the parent
                    of three children of only one fourth, the residue being shared equally amongst
                    all. The claim of primogeniture is thus in a manner annulled; and a law which is
                    apparently wise and equitable, proves the source of great injury to agriculture,
                    by multiplying the petty lots of land throughout a country where they were
                    previously far too numerous.</p>

                <p>This parallel, brief as it is, places in a striking light the very different
                    state of agriculture in the two countries. The surprising proportion of land in
                    France under tillage is owing to the smallness of the occupancies, the cheapness
                    of labour, and the general use of bread instead of animal food by the lower
                    orders. The last is connected with another remarkable circumstance; the very
                    slender proportion of land under pasture, of which the main cause is the dry
                    climate of the southern and central part of the kingdom. In the proportion of
                    poor and unproductive land the two countries are nearly on a par, but the French
                    incur a very heavy disadvantage by using wood instead of coal for fuel, and
                    covering with forests many tracts which might be made available either to
                    pasture or tillage.</p>

                <p>We proceed to add a few remarks on French agriculture, with reference to articles
                    less known or less generally raised in England. Buck wheat is cultivated
                    extensively in Normandy and the north of France, partly as green food for
                    cattle, partly for the diet of the peasantry; it is generally sown in June and
                    reaped in the end of September. Rape-seed is very general in French Flanders and
                    Normandy; it supplies oil for the market and food for cattle, either when green
                    or in the cake. Colza (coleseed) is raised for the same purposes. Tobacco would
                    be generally cultivated in France, but it is monopolized for the beneĥt of the
                    state, and its cultivation is confined to certain licensed parts, which are
                    chiefly in Alsace and Picardy. The quality of the article produced under the
                    royal monopoly is greatly inferior to that produced by private cultivators
                    abroad, whilst, the price being 400 per cent, higher, the latter is smuggled
                    into France in great quantities, notwithstanding all attempts to prevent it.
                    Flax is raised very generally, not merely in French Flanders, Alsace, and
                    Normandy, but in the provinces of the west and south, where the family of almost
                    every peasant rears a little stock annually to be spun by his wife and
                    daughters. Hemp also is raised in many parts of France, particularly in the
                    north. Maize is a plant of great importance, whether for the food of man or of
                    cattle; when intended to stand for harvest, it is planted in rows with very
                    little seed, and yields more than twice the quantity of wheat that would be
                    produced on the same space.</p>

                <p>During its growth the leaves are stripped regularly for the food of cattle; and
                    in some districts it is sown thick ' and mown merely for that purpose. Such
                    valuable substitutes have as yet prevented turnips from being generally
                    introduced into France. Even potatoes were long very little known, and it is
                    only during the last half century that the dislike to this root has disappeared.
                    Chestnuts are most common in the central part of France, where they supply no
                    inconsiderable portion of the food of the peasantry. In the south the fruits are
                    chiefly olives, almonds, mulberries, figs, and prunes; oranges are partially
                    cultivated in the south-eastern extremity of the kingdom, on the verge of Italy,
                    but with great uncertainty, for a severe winter is fatal to these trees, and in
                    some measure also to the olives.</p>
                <p>Irrigation is little understood in the north of France, but in the south the want
                    of frequent rain renders it a primary object of attention; it in fact determines
                    the <hi rend="italic">ratio</hi> of productiveness, since the warmth of the sun
                    seldom fails to ripen whatever, whether grass or corn, has received an adequate
                    supply of moisture. It takes place in some parts by guiding the rills from the
                    side of the hills and mountains; in others by digging wells or raising water by
                    a wheel; and in the vicinity of rivers by diverting a portion of their
                    stream.</p>
                <p>The culture of the vine extends more or less over fully the half of France,
                    beginning as far north as Champagne, and spreading over the country to the south
                    and the west. This culture is, however, very limited in Champagne, and even in
                    Burgundy; in Provence and the lower part of Languedoc the climate is warmer, and
                    the culture general, .though not managed with such skill as along the banks of
                    the Garonne, where the spirit of improvement is excited by a demand for foreign
                    markets. As vines succeed in light and unproductive soils, their culture gives a
                    value to much ground which would otherwise be useless; and the petty
                    subdivisions of land-are here less injurious than in the case of corn. From the
                    great variety of soil and climate, the quality of French wines is very various.
                    The amount produced has been considerably increased since 1790, as well from the
                    division of many large estates, as from the quantity of waste land which has
                    been brought into culture. It is computed that nearly 5,000,000 acres of land
                    are planted with vines, and that the value of the annual produce is from
                    L.28,000,000 to L^0,000,000 sterling, of which about a tenth or twelfth part
                    only is exported. A further quantity, equal to about a sixth of the above, is
                    made into brandy, for brandy is distilled wherever vines are grown; and of it
                    also the best in quality is in the vicinity of the Garonne. This important and
                    staple branch of French industry has been very seriously injured by the
                    prohibitory system of customhouse laws, which have been extended and increased
                    in rigour since the restoration of the Bourbons, and to which many of the
                    leading statesmen of France still evince a most mistaken partiality. France, by
                    excluding the produce of other nations, virtually deprives, or greatly limits,
                    by the same laws, the reception of her own produce into foreign countries. It is
                    clear that they must pay for the wines of France with their own produce, which,
                    if France refuse to receive, they have no other equivalent to give her in
                    return; they must procure an equivalent from foreign countries, and the effect
                    of this is to restrict the trade, by raising the price of French wines.
                    Accordingly, it appears that whilst France exported to England from 16,000 to
                    20,000 tuns of wine when the population was only five millions, this supply had
                    fallen off, partly owing to the heavy duties imposed in Britain, and partly to
                    the prohibitory duties imposed in France on British produce, to 1800 tuns,
                    whilst the population of the country had in the mean time greatly increased; a
                    melancholy illustration of the effects of that illiberal policy which pretends
                    to improve commerce by prohibiting the free intercourse of commercial
                    countries.</p>
                <p>The minuteness of the <hi rend="italic">Cadastrai</hi> survey has led to official
                    calculations in France, of products which have not yet engaged the attention of
                    other governments. Madder is cultivated on a small scale, partly in the north,
                    partly in the south of France; its chief use is in dyeing woollens and cottons.
                    Wood is used for yellow and green colours; saffron, cultivated formerly to a
                    great extent, is now confined to one district (the Gatinois) in the south of
                    France; hops are raised only in Picardy and French Flanders.</p>

                    chiefly mountainous; in the low grounds, the grass, whether natural or sown, is
                    brought forward only <pb break="no" facs="nls:193516255"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-6255-0176"/>by means of irrigation. Clover and sainfoin are
                    cultivated in France, but chiefly in the north and north-east; lucerne is much
                    more general, being raised not merely in the north, but in the central and
                    southern provinces, wherever irrigation is practicable and the soil and climate
                    are favourable. The art of improving cattle by breeding is little understood in
                    France, nor is there much judgment shown in gradually fattening them by a
                    removal to richer pastures. Still the beef and mutton of the north and west are
                    very good; their price varies from province to province, but very seldom from
                    year to year; the general rate is 30 per cent, less than in England. Butter is
                    made and used throughout the chief part of France, as in England, but cheese
                    comparatively little. In the south, however, even butter is little known, and
                    its place in cooking is supplied by olive oil, an unwelcome ingredient to a
                    northern palate. One of the latest novelties in French pasturage is the
                    introduction, in 1819, of a large flock of Cashmere goats, which were sent to
                    browse in the Eastern Pyrenees, and are said to experience but little
                    inconvenience from the change of climate.</p>
                <p>In the number of horses, as well as in their size and beauty, France is greatly
                    inferior to this country. In the performance of labour, however, the inferiority
                    is much less conspicuous; large, old-fashioned carriages, drawn by four or six
                    horses, are seen proceeding along a paved road much more easily than we should
                    anticipate from the weight of the vehicle, the knotted harness, and the
                    diminutive size of the animals. The same observation is applicable to the
                    ploughs, the carts, and the waggons of France, which are awkwardly built, but
                    all dragged on with expedition, the strength of the horses surpassing the
                    promise of their appearance; a strength, however, attended by a circumstance of
                    no slight inconvenience, very few of these animals being gelded. A French
                    mail-coach performs only five instead of seven or more miles an hour as with us;
                    but this is owing less to inferiority in the horses, than to the state of the
                    roads, and to the general want of dispatch at post-houses.</p>
                <p>Of the aggregate of horses in France (about 1,500,000), more than half belong to
                    the northern provinces, viz. Normandy, Bretagne, Picardy, Alsace, and the Isle
                    of France. In the central and southern departments, a great proportion of the
                    work is done by oxen, which are more suitable to petty farms and mountainous
                    districts. The total of horned cattle in France in 1812 was reported officially
                    as follows:</p>

                </table>
                <p>Since this period, however, the number must have materially increased, as in 1816
                    a duty was laid on all foreign cattle imported; and, however impolitic this
                    duty, as indeed it is known to have inflicted grievous injury on particular
                    districts, still it must have tended to increase the breed at home.</p>
                <p>Sheep are reared in almost every province of France, the gentle elevations of the
                    north and the mountains of the south being alike favourable to them. The mutton
                    is good; but in the art of improving the fleece, the French have as yet much to
                    learn. Merinos were first brought from Spain in 1787, and formed into a royal
                    flock at Rambouillet. The quality, originally good, has been progressively
                    improved, and distributions of Merinos have been successively made to
                    proprietors of sheep pastures in all parts of the kingdom. The consequence has
                    been, that in many districts the weight of the fleece has been nearly doubled.
                    Still, in the more backward parts of France, very little attention is paid to
                    the care of sheep or to the improvement of the wool. The animals are not folded
                    during night, but crowded into covered buildings <hi rend="italic"
                    >(bergeries),</hi> and exposed, particularly in winter, to much injury from
                    going suddenly in to the air. To encourage the rearing of sheep, a duty of
                    twenty per cent, was in 1822 laid on foreign wool.</p>
                <p>Mules are almost as little known in the north of France as in England; but in the
                    central and southern parts they are very generally reared. Poultry, in France,
                    is both larger in size and more abundant than in England.</p>
                <p>Even in the north and north-east of France, the farms I are of small extent. To
                    occupy 200 acres, or to pay a ∣ rent of L.200 a year, places one in the foremost
                    rank of farmers. Larger possessions are common in pasture districts, that
                    department of agriculture admitting, in France, as in England, of a greater
                    concentration of capital and extension of business than in the case of tillage.
                    But such districts are rare; and in by far the greater part of France the farms
                    under tillage, if farms they can be called, are of fifty, forty, thirty, and
                    often as small as twenty or even ten acres, there being, it is computed, no less
                    than three millions of such petty occupancies in the kingdom. In the south of
                    France the system of <hi rend="italic">métairie</hi> is still prevalent, and
                    nearly on the same footing as in Lombardy and Tuscany. That such insignificant
                    occupancies are adverse to all enlarged ideas of farming, is sufficiently
                    obvious; and to their many disadvantages there can only be opposed this single
                    benefit, that no spot of tolerable soil is neglected, even the space given by us
                    to hedges being reserved for culture.</p>
                <p>The beneficial effect of long leases is as little understood in France as it
                    still unfortunately is in a great part of England. The common method is to let
                    land for periods of three, six, or nine years. The peasantry, though exceedingly
                    illiterate, are by no means a slow or phlegmatic race. They exhibit, as
                    Frenchmen in general do, no small share of sprightliness and activity in the
                    individual, with very little concert or combination in the mass. They are
                    content to hand down the family occupancy from father to son, without any idea
                    of altering their mode of life. The dwellings of the farmers, and still more of
                    the cottagers, are like those of our forefathers half a century ago; the outside
                    having frequently a pool of water in its vicinity, whilst the inside is
                    miserably bare of furniture. Their implements are equally rude, and discover but
                    too clearly that the price of iron is beyond their reach, being greatly enhanced
                    by the duty imposed on foreign iron, and the French iron masters having never
                    been able to supply the market in any quantity with this useful article. Their
                    harrows have wooden teeth; and even the ploughs, in some backward districts, are
                    almost entirely of wood. The cart in common use is an awkward medium between a
                    cart and a waggon, being as long as the latter, and not broader than the former.
                    The singularity, to an Englishman, is to see a vehicle of great length and
                    burden supported by a single pair of wheels. Corn and hay, in France, are not
                    stocked, but housed. The winnowing machine is in a great measure, and the
                    thrashing machine altogether, unknown. Thrashing often takes place in the open
                    air, and is in general performed by the flail. In the south of France, the
                    antiquated mode of treading out the corn by horses and mules is still
                    prevalent.</p>
                <p>The diet of the French peasantry is exceedingly simple. Bread and cider, with
                    soup, pease, cabbage, or other vegetables, form its chief ingredients in the
                    northern provinces; whilst, in the central and southern, the same aliments are
                    in use, with the substitution of thin wine <hi rend="italic">(υin de pays)</hi>
                    for cider, and of chestnuts for the pears and apples of the north. Bread is,
                    still more than with our peasantry, the grand component part of diet, and the
                    article of which the price determines the comfort or distress of the lower
                    orders for the year. Butcher-meat is reserved for the tables of the middle and
                    upper classes.</p>
                <p>The landholders in France give almost no attention whatever to beautifying the
                    country; its aspect is consequently<pb break="no" facs="nls:193516268"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-6268-0177"/> monotonous, without plantations, seats, or
                    cheerful cottages. The peasantry live in villages, frequently ill built and ill
                    situated. The purchase of land, however, is the favourite mode of investing
                    money in France. It sells, in general, for twenty-five years purchase; whilst
                    the public funds seldom fetch above sixteen or eighteen. The French have little
                    confidence in government stock, and, in fact, very little knowledge of its
                    nature. There is at Paris a society similar to the Board of Agriculture in
                    England, and forming, like it, a central point for corresponding with the
                    different agricultural societies in the kingdom. It holds its sittings twice a
                    month, and a public meeting annually, for the distribution of prizes. The French
                    have also (since 1819) a corn law, permitting imports and exports only when the
                    home market shall be above or below a specific rate. This law, somewhat similar
                    to ours in form, is materially different in its operation, the limitation prices
                    being very low, and the landed interest in France having no power to create an
                    artificial enhancement. The Revolution, by breaking landed property into
                    fragments, has destroyed the ascendency of its owners as a separate interest.
                    The members of the French House of Commons are in general lawyers, merchants, or
                    <hi rend="italic">propriétaires,</hi> that is, owners of land and houses on a
                    scale which we should account very small. Even in their House of Peers the
                    country interest is of little account. The chief difficulty the French
                    government have to contend with, in regard to the corn trade, is the popular
                    prejudice that freedom of export raises the home price. The south of France,
                    being in a great degree appropriated to the culture of the vine and olive,
                    stands in need of an almost annual importation of corn. The north is very
                    different; yet the smallness of the farms, the use of bread in every meal of the
                    day, and the want of agricultural capital, are great drawbacks on exportation.
                    In the present century, the only shipments of consequence have taken place in
                    1810 and 1814, both years of unusual abundance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Of the 16,700,208 acres which we have mentioned as
                    covered with wood, there belonged to government in 1836, 2,293,063, which were
                    divided into 1473 forests. A very small part of this is allowed to grow for
                    large timber. The rest is subject to an annual cutting and sale, for fuel; a
                    purpose for which coal is very little used in France, excepting in the case of
                    forges, glass-houses, and other large works. In the government-forests gross
                    mismanagement took place during the disorders of the Revolution. Extensive
                    tracts were sold for an insignificant consideration, whilst in those that
                    remained timber was felled with a lavish hand, and without any regard to the
                    ultimate effect on these valuable properties. The case, however, was altered in
                    1801, when a special board, appointed for the care of the forests, introduced
                    the most satisfactory regulations. In the years of financial pressure (1815,
                    1816, and 1817), it was proposed to effect sales of these great domains; but a
                    fair price being unattainable, government continues to keep them, and derives
                    from the wood annually cut and sold a revenue of from L.700,000 to L.800,000
                    sterling. Fuel being little wanted in the south of France, the forests are
                    confined to remote and rugged situations. These, like most of the forests of the
                    kingdom, harbour a multitude of wolves, which are frequently destructive to the
                    sheep and lambs. Regular officers, called <hi rend="italic">Lieutenants de
                    Louve-terie,</hi> are appointed for wooded districts; and on occasions of heavy
                    loss, recourse is had to a general <hi rend="italic">battue,</hi> of which the
                    usual result is a partial destruction of these animals, without any sensible
                    reduction of their numbers at large. Bears also are found in the forests; but
                    they are much more rare, being confined to the elevated districts in the Alps
                    and Pyrenees.</p>
                <p>After these observations on the agriculture of France, it remains to compare its
                    produce with that of our own coun try, and this inquiry naturally divides itself
                    into two parts; the total, or, as it is termed, the gross amount produced; and
                    the nett income afforded, after all deductions for expense of culture. First, as
                    to the gross produce, Dr Colquhoun estimates the property created in Great

                <p>Those readers who imagine that the addition for the difference in the value of
                    money is too large, have merely to refer to the quantities of produce in the
                    preceding corn table, or to the surer test afforded by the relative population
                    of the two countries. Supposing that our population is now increased to nineteen
                    millions, that of I⅛ance still exceeds it by fully ten millions, a number which,
                    were the consumption of the individual the same, would imply, on the part of
                    France, an annual production of the value of above L.280,000,000. If to this a
                    small addition be made for the French produce exported, our estimate will be
                    found to make the requisite allowance for the plainer fare of Frenchmen; and a
                    small allowance will be deemed sufficient, when we take into account the very
                    cheap diet of the Irish part of our population. But the point to be explained
                    is, not how France produces so much, but how she does not produce more. Britain
                    and Ireland are to her, in territorial extent, in the proportion of sixty-one to
                    a hundred; but in produce they are as sixty-nine to a hundred. But as the soil
                    of France, if not superior, on an average, to that of England and Ireland, is
                    greatly superior to that of Scotland or Wales, to what are we to look for the
                    inferiority of her produce? There are, we apprehend, two main causes; first, the
                    waste of large tracts in wood; and, secondly, the inadequacy of manual labour,
                    largely as it is afforded by her dense agricultural population, to
                    counterbalance the productive powers of the capital and machinery applied by us
                    to agriculture.</p>
                <p>We come next to the question of the clear income arising from land, the amount of
                    which is seldom above a fourth part of the gross produce, since it implies a
                    number of very heavy deductions, viz. the support of the farmers, their
                    families, their servants, their cattle; the mortality and depreciation of live
                    stock; wages, and wear of tools and implements; in short, every description of
                    charge that intervenes between preparing the ground for culture, and realizing
                    its produce in money. In regard to France, we are enabled to proceed in such
                    computations with considerable accuracy, in consequence of several late
                    estimates made by order of government, of which the highest, and we believe the
                    most accurate, made in 1815, gives, for the</p>

                <p>In these returns of nett income the balance is considerably more in our favour
                    than in those of gross produce. In the one, Britain and Ireland are to France as
                    sixty-nine to a hundred, in the other as eighty to a hundred. To what is this
                    extraordinary disadvantage upon the side of France to be attributed? We answer,
                    to the employing of manual labour instead of machinery, and to the very great
                    addition thus caused to the number of persons to be supported out of the produce
                    of the land before realizing its proceeds. In England and Scotland the
                    agriculturists are not to the population at large as forty to a hundred; and,
                    after making a large addition for Ireland, which, in its petty occupancies,
                    bears no slight resemblance to France, the result does not give, for our whole
                    population, forty-four persons in a hundred dependent for support on
                    agriculture. But in France this proportion exceeds sixty in a hundred; and there
                    are thus to be supported out of agricultural produce above 5,000,000 persons
                    more than there would be were the proportion of agriculturists as in Britain and
                    Ireland.</p>

                <p>V. MINES AND QUARRIES.</p>
                <p>Far from equalling her northern neighbour and rival Great Britain in metallic
                    wealth, France yields in this essential article of produce to Germany, to
                    Russia, to Sweden, and to Hungary. According to the most approved works recently
                    published, the mines of France may be classed into five groups, namely, the
                    mines of the Vosges and the Black Forest; those of the central provinces of
                    France; those of Bretagne; those of the Pyrenees; and those of the Alps. It is
                    not many years since the mines of the Vosges yielded above 30,000 cwt. of lead,
                    and a small quantity of silver, besides copper mixed with silver. The produce
                    did not, it is probable, repay the expense, as they have since been abandoned.
                    In the central part of France there are numerous mines of lead, but they are not
                    productive. They are chiefly situated in the department of La Lozère; and they
                    yield annually, along with the lead, 1600 marcs of silver. The mines in Bretagne
                    are of some consequence, as they employed in 1828 about 900 workmen, and
                    produced, along with about 1,200,000 cwt. of lead, 2000 marcs or 16,000 ounces
                    of silver. In the chain of the Pyrenees there is only one mine of copper, which
                    has long since been abandoned. There are, however, numerous iron mines, which
                    furnish materials for more than 100 forges. The chain of the Alps contains many
                    mines of iron, but is not rich in other metals, possessing some unproductive
                    mines of lead, and one of silver, which has long been abandoned. There are some
                    appearances of gold in the department of the Isère; but not such as to encourage
                    any trial of their value. If there are few other mines, those of iron are in
                    great abundance, being scattered throughout the country; and of these the
                    produce is every day improving. The whole value of the metallic produce of
                    France was estimated in 1828 to be equal to L.3,199,595. The number of mines is
                    estimated at 500, and the number of workmen employed at 18,000. The working of
                    mines is impeded in France by the want of good roads and canals, on which to
                    convey the ore and the coal for smelting it. The production of iron has been
                    encouraged by heavy duties on foreign iron. In 1814 a duty was imposed of
                    fifteen francs per fifty kilogrammes, or 12s. 6d. per 110 lbs. imperial, on all
                    foreign iron imported, which was in 1822, including the decime or the tenth
                    added to all duties, raised to L.1.2s. lid. on all coal-worked foreign iron. But
                    this prohibition did not bring prosperity to the. trade, though by these duties
                    the price of iron in France was L.23. 9s. 2d. per ton, whilst English iron was
                    sold at L.9. 6s. 8d. It is estimated that these heavy duties on foreign iron
                    cost the agriculturists of France, in the additional expense of ploughs and
                    other implements of agriculture, a sum varying from L.l,500,000 to L.2,000,000 a
                    year.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                    France to be 160,000 tons, and the difference of price between French and
                    English iron to be L.10 per ton, the law of 1814, which imposed a duty on
                    foreign iron, and the law of 1822, which increased that duty, cannot have cost
                    the French people less than L.30,000,000 sterling of direct loss; whilst it is
                    scarcely possible to calculate the indirect evil of this monopoly or protecting
                    duty in favour of the iron masters. One reason of the high price of French iron
                    is the want of coal, an evil which is aggravated by the heavy duty on foreign
                    coal, in consequence of which they are compelled to employ wood in their forges;
                    and it <pb break="no" facs="nls:193516294" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6294-0179"/>is
                    calculated that one fourth part of the wood cut down in the forests is consumed
                    in the manufacture of iron. Coal has been discovered in more than half the
                    departments of . the kingdom, and would doubtless be traced in others; but the
                    want of water communication limits the consumption of this article almost to the
                    place where it is produced. At St Etienne, near Lyons, are excellent coal mines;
                    but there being no iron mines in the vicinity, nor of course iron works, there
                    is no consumption of fuel on a large scale. The coal is only used for domestic
                    fuel, and for the manufacture of hardware. Μ. Costaz, in an estimate contained
                    in his work on the agriculture and commerce of France, makes the coal produced
                    in France to amount to 15,310,687 metrical quintals or cwtβ∙, equal to 765,000

                    at between L.700,000 and L.800,000. The quantity of coal imported from Britain
                    amounted in 1831 to 40,000 tons, though subject to a heavy duty of one franc
                    sixty-five cents per hundred kilogrammes, or Is. 4∣d. per 220 lbs. imperial; and
                    there were imported from Belgium, the duty being thirty-three cents per hundred

                    injuriously on the industry of France. It is a most serious impediment to the
                    working of the iron mines, for the encouragement of which such heavy duties are
                    imposed on foreign iron. But such is always the effect of the prohibitory
                    system. It pulls down with one hand what it builds up with another. The iron
                    masters and the coal owners have each a monopoly of the home market. But is it
                    not clear that these two monopolies run counter to each other, and that the iron
                    trade is encouraged by the one, whilst it is most seriously discouraged by the
                    other, and the whole inhabitants of France are taxed in a much higher price for
                    fuel by the heavy duty laid on the importation of this useful article?
                    Steam-boat navigation is also discouraged, so that no steamboats regularly ply
                    between any of the Atlantic ports of France. A steam-boat which in England could
                    be navigable at an expense for coal of L.2280, would cost in France L.5700,
                    about eighteen per cent, on the capital employed. It is the owners of forest
                    property who are the most zealous supporters of this duty, an impost which
                    benefits them at the expense of the whole of France, and indirectly depresses
                    the national commerce and industry in its most important branches. Only a small
                    portion of Paris is lighted with gas, which is ascribed to the high price of
                    iron pipes; and the supply of water is also impeded by the same cause. The
                    mines, like other large undertakings in France, are under the direction of
                    government, being superintended by a board at Paris (<hi rend="italic">Conseil
                    GénéraD,</hi> and having an <hi rend="italic">Ecole Royale</hi> with public
                    teachers, the whole under the control of the minister of the home department.
                    This, however, does not prevent their machinery being in general very clumsy and
                    antiquated.</p>
                <p>Turf fit for fuel, or peat, as in Ireland, is found in various parts of France,
                    and is likely to be used, as wood becomes progressively scarcer. This article is
                    produced in the departments of Gard, Isère, and the Lower Rhine.</p>
                <p>Salt is made in various parts of the kingdom. The works corresponding to the salt
                    mines, or rather to the brine springs, of Cheshire, are called, from their
                    position, <hi rend="italic">Salines de l’Est,</hi> and are situated at the small
                    town of Salins in Franche Comté; they are wrought by undertakers on lense, yield
                    about 20,000 tons a year, and afford a considerable revenue to government. The
                    heat of the climate on the south and south-west coast of France is favourable to
                    the evaporation of salt water, and consequently to the formation of bay-salt,
                    the name given to salt made, not by the action of fire, but by the heat of the J
                    sun, operating on sea water enclosed in α shallow bay (in French <hi
                    rend="italic">étang),</hi> so as to produce a saline deposit. The duty raised
                    from salt in France is in alhnearly L.2,000,000, a sum of great importance to
                    the Treasury, but attended with fully as much injury to the productive powers of
                    France as was formerly our salt tax to those of England. The Revolution began by
                    abolishing entirely the odious <hi rend="italic">gabelle,</hi> and salt being
                    soon afterwards made in great quantities, and sold very cheap, became the object
                    of a most extensive consumption, being given to cattle as food, mixed with
                    manure on the fields, or scattered as a stimulant to vegetation at the foot of
                    olive trees. But this extended use of salt was of short duration. No sooner was
                    the power of Bonaparte consolidated, than he ventured to impose a tax on salt,
                    less impolitic and oppressive, indeed, than the <hi rend="italic">gabelle,</hi>
                    but which had the effect of limiting the use of this article to such a degree,
                    that the value of bay-salt consumed, instead of amounting to L.1,000,000
                    sterling, does not at present exceed L. 100,000. The consumption is confined to
                    domestic purposes, and to a trifling export; yet the few cattle which still
                    receive salt as a part of their food are visibly in better condition than those
                    which are deprived of it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> France is in general much better supplied with
                    quar-1 ríes than England. The vicinity of Paris abounds in quarries of
                    freestone. The case is similar in the mountainous districts, and even in
                    several, such as Lower Normandy, that are comparatively level. The houses are
                    consequently built of stone in those cities which, like Paris or Caen, are in
                    the vicinity of quarries. In other situations they exhibit a mixture of stone
                    and brick. Slates being comparatively rare, the roofs of the houses are
                    generally of tile, and the annual value of this rude species of productive
                    labour, the manufacture of bricks and tiles, may be computed at nearly
                    L.1,000,000 sterling. There are marble quarries in several of the mountainous
                    districts, but not situated so as to admit of export.</p>
                <p>VI. MANUFACTURES.</p>
                <p>Our historical notices of French manufactures are very imperfect until towards
                    the year 1600, when the wars of religion were brought to a close, and peaceful
                    industry received encouragement from Henry IV. and his minister Sully. It was
                    then that the patronage of government was extended to the manufacture of silk,
                    of glass, of jewellery, of gold and silver tissues; also of the finer woollens
                    and linens, the coarser kinds having been established many centuries before. But
                    the great extension of the finer manufactures of France took place after 1663,
                    during the reign of Louis XIV. and the ministry of Colbert. It was then that
                    workmen were invited from Holland, and induced to settle at Sedan and Abbeville,
                    places still celebrated for their woollens. In the south of France also,
                    establishments were formed for making the light cloth suited to the Turkey
                    market, so that, towards the year 1700, the manufactures of France, as well for
                    woollens as other articles, had made considerable progress; we mean that they
                    had arrived at the state to be expected from a people of great activity, but of
                    little combination. The manual labour of the workmen was ingenious; the
                    machinery extremely imperfect; the linen, the paper, and in some measure the
                    woollens and hardware, found their way abroad, because in the rest of Europe
                    these manufactures were very backward, and, in particular, because the exports
                    of England were then very limited. The repeal of the edict of Nantes was a very
                    impolitic measure, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193516307"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-6307-0180"/>but its consequences have been much overrated, for
                    England has profited very little by the extension of her silk ' fabrics; and
                    Brandenburg, the chief resort of the French emigrants, has never become an
                    exporting manufacturing country.</p>
                <p>Another and a more important error is the current notion that French manufactures
                    were formerly (from 1650 to 1750) more extensive and flourishing than at
                    present, also that they underwent an almost total extinction during the
                    Revolution. These, like many other impres sions in regard to France, rest merely
                    on the loose allegations common in that country, where current report almost
                    always partakes of the marvellous. Official <hi rend="italic">data,</hi>
                    wherever they are preserved, far from sanctioning such fluctuations, are
                    decidedly in favour of a progressive though slow increase.</p>
                <p>To begin with the oldest and most widely diffused branch, woollens,<note

                <p>Lizieux also in the north had nearly the same number of workmen (5000)
                    throughout.</p>
                <p>The finest qualities of woollens are made at Sedan in Champagne, and at Louviers
                    in Normandy. In these the only material is merino wool. At Elboeuf and Darnetal,
                    both likewise in Normandy, the qualities are very various, the prices being from
                    6s. to 28s. the English yard. Carcassonne and Limoux owed the origin of their
                    extensive manufactures to the abundant supply of wool from the pastures in the
                    Pyrenees. Since the reduction of their exports to the Levant, an alteration in
                    the quality of their cloths has opened to them a vent in the interior of France.
                    The mountainous districts in Languedoc contain great numbers of sheep, and are
                    the seat of the manufacture of serges, tricos, and other coarse woollens, most
                    of which are made, not by workmen collected in a factory, but on the domestic
                    plan still followed in part of Yorkshire, and in the north-west. In the hamlets
                    or villages of the departments of the Tarn and Aveyron, almost every house has
                    its loom, and during the evenings in winter, or in the daytime when the weather
                    is adverse to country labour, the women employ themselves in spinning, and the
                    men in weaving.</p>
                <p>A highly finished species of the woollen manufacture, viz. shawls» veils, ladies’
                    cloth, &amp;c. has been introduced in the present age into France. Rheims is the
                    seat of this important branch, and employs, in the town and neighbourhood, no
                    less than 20,000 workmen. Similar articles are made at Paris.</p>
                <p>Shawls became fashionable in France as an indispensable article of female apparel
                    after the expedition of Bonaparte to Egypt. Many of the officers who were
                    attached to the army brought back numerous presents of shawls, so those who did
                    not display a Cashmere shawl were judged to belong to the humbler classes of
                    society; and shawls were imported in great quantities from Constantinople,
                    Moscow, Vienna, and London. These shawls, however, brought an enormous price
                    when imported into France, which necessarily limited their consumption to the
                    richer classes. The great demand now turned the attention of manufacturers to
                    this important manufacture, and ordinary shawls are now made of merino and other
                    wools. But this was only a step in the progress of the manufacture; and a finer
                    species of wool having been imported from the countries to the north of the
                    Caspian Sea, the ingenious manufacturers with these materials at last produced
                    shawls which rivalled in beauty those of the East, and in which it required the
                    most practised and skilful eye to discern any difference. In 1819 and 1823
                    medals were given to several individuals for having brought this branch of
                    industry to such perfection.</p>
                <p>Two towns very remote from each other, Lodève in the south, and Vire in the
                    north-west of France, manufactured, under Bonaparte, very largely for the army.
                    French woollens are, in general, much thicker than ours. In the fine qualities
                    the raw material forms (Chaptai, vol. ii. p. 131) somewhat more than half the
                    cost. In ordinary qualities it is somewhat less; but it is only in the slight
                    qualities that the price of labour goes considerably beyond that of the
                    materials. The computation for the whole country is, that a value of L.4,000,000
                    sterling in wool becomes converted into a manufactured value of L.9,000,000, of
                    which a tenth only is exported ∙, for, though French woollens in general are
                    more substantial and durable than English, the inability of their merchants to
                    give long credit prevents their competing with us in the United States, or other
                    foreign markets. The cloth in France which corresponds to our superfine, and
                    which is worn in general by the upper ranks, is very fine and durable, but
                    heavy. In price it varies from 22s. to 35s. the English yard. It is remarkable,
                    that notwithstanding an import duty of 33 per cent, imposed in 1822 on foreign
                    wool, the importation oſBritish wool into France has been increasing for the
                    last ten years. In 1824 the quantity imported amounted to 4187 lbs., whilst in
                    the last four years from the year 1834 the average importation has amounted to
                    1,000,000 lbs. This duty on foreign wool has, however, been very injurious to
                    the French woollen manufacturers; because, by compelling them to pay a high
                    price for the raw material, it prevented them from manufacturing woollen cloth
                    as cheaply as their English competitors, to whom the foreign market, where the
                    raw material had now fallen to a low price, was open. One third of this duty has
                    been since reduced.</p>
                <p>The cotton manufacture was introduced into France about 1770, and at first in the
                    south of the kingdom; the raw material being supplied, not from America, but
                    from the Levant. From the south, this manufacture passed, about the year 1780,
                    to Rouen, St Quentin, Paris, Lisle, and other parts in the north, extending with
                    a rapidity surpassed only by that of England. At present, and for many years
                    past, the great import of cotton is from the United States. In this great
                    department of manufacture the French have only followed in the footsteps of
                    Great Britain, whose machinery, after the lapse of a certain time, the French
                    manufacturers have imitated; and though they have equalled the British
                    manufacture in durability, they have generally been inferior in elegance or
                    cheapness. The last is, in a great measure, owing to the centre of the
                    manufacture being at Rouen and Paris, places where the support of workmen,
                    including the extra price of fuel, is not less expensive than in Lancashire. The
                    districts at present most remarkable for the cotton manufacture are,</p>

                <p>Cotton yarn is often made in a different place from cotton cloth. Paris and

                    value, calculated at 7d. a pound, to L.34,000,000; from which it will be seen to
                    how much greater an extent this manufacture is carried on in Britain than in
                    France. The cotton manufacture is, however, prosecuted in many parts of France,

                    manufacture; and the consequence is, that as the importation of English cotton
                    goods is prohibited, they are smuggled into the country in great quantities.
                    Among these, the introduction of cotton twist is most extensive; and as the
                    French mills cannot manufacture the higher numbers, from 170 to 200, which are
                    required in the fabrication of bobbinet, it has been found impossible to repress
                    the contraband importation of this article. “It makes its way,” say the writers
                    of the Report on the Commercial Relations between Great Britain and France,
                    “both by land and sea, in spite of all interdictions, and to a continually
                    increasing amount.’<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    English can be sold also at half the price of the French article, which presents
                    an additional inducement to the smuggler. The annual value of the manufactures
                    thus illicitly introduced is estimated at L.500,000 sterling. English bobbinet
                    is also smuggled into France to the estimated annual value of L.625,U00
                    sterling, which sells at from seven to eight per cent, above the price of French
                    goods of the same nominal quality. Quiltings, cambrics, and muslins are also
                    largely introduced by the illicit traders; and the delivery of these goods is
                    ensured at a premium of from eighteen to fifty per cent., according as the risk
                    is greater or less in the case of heavy or of light goods.</p>
                <p>In the extent of her linen manufacture France is great- 1 Iy superior to England;
                    not that her soil is better adapted to the growth of hemp and flax, but because
                    England depends on importations of linen from Ireland and Germany, and the
                    spinning of flax does not form the occupation of our female peasantry. In
                    France, particularly in the north, every farmer, and almost every cottager,
                    covers a litüe spot with hemp or flax sufficient to employ his wife and
                    daughters in spinning throughout the year; a stock of linen being the usual
                    dowry of these humble occupants of the soil. The manufacture of this article is
                    not exclusively concentrated in the towns, like that of the other fabrics. Many
                    of the weavers reside in villages, and even in hamlets; and the hemp and the
                    flax are spun by the hand. This is a most valuable branch of domestic industry,
                    which gives employment to females under the roof of their parents. But it is
                    destined, in the progress of capital and industry, to be superseded by machinery
                    and great establishments, in which the poor of both sexes are collected together
                    under one roof, to the utter ruin of morality. In Normandy, Lisieux, Dieppe, the
                    neighbourhood of Havre, Yvetst, Bolbec, and the more inland towns of Vimoirtiers
                    and Domfront, are all remarkable for one or more branches of the linen
                    manufacture. The more backward province of Bretagne manufactures, at Rennes, St
                    Malo, and Vitré, quantities of coarse linen, canvass, and sacking; but Anjou
                    affords a much superior article; the <hi rend="italic">toiles de Laval</hi> have
                    long been in repute, and give employment, in Laval and the contiguous towns, to
                    nearly 25,000 workmen. Lisle and its populous district have very extensive
                    manufactures of hemp and flax; for the number of workmen so employed, directly
                    or indirectly, in this part of French Flanders, is not short of 50,000. Since
                    1790, fine linen has, in France as in England, been in a great measure replaced
                    by fine cotton; and the two together employ, at St Quentin (in Picardy) and the
                    neighbourhood, no less than 40,000 workmen. In a very different part of the
                    kingdom, the province of Dauphiné, there are carried on linen manufactures of
                    various qualities, the prices being from 1 s. 6d. to 5s. a yard.</p>
                <p>Cambrics, thread, gauze, and lawn, rank among the leading manufactures of the
                    north-east part of France. They are made at St Quentin, Valenciennes, Cambray,
                    and in a smaller degree at Douai, Chauney, and Guise. Lace is still more
                    general, being made in quantities at Valenciennes, Dieppe, Alençon, Caen,
                    Bayeux, and Argentan. Machinery had up to 1820 been very little applied to this
                    manufacture in France, and the number of women employed by it was very great.
                    There are considerable manufactures of printed linens, and the dyeing of linen
                    thread gives rise to an extensive commerce. At Rouen, and in the surrounding
                    districts, this branch of industry is carried on; and many <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193516333" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6333-0182"/>stuffs of great variety, and
                    for which there is a brisk demand, are produced. In 1822 the duties on foreign
                    thread and linen were raised by the French government till they were nearly
                    prohibitory; and the annual importation from Germany and Belgium, which formerly
                    amounted to a million and a half, fell almost entirely away. The price of
                    home-made linen rose twenty-five and thirty per cent.; the consumers had
                    recourse to cotton as a substitute; the French dyeing trade fell off, and also
                    the entrepôt trade in foreign linens, both of them sources of great
                    business.</p>
                <p>The value of the hemp annually grown in France may be computed, as a raw
                    material, at L.1,200,000, the quantity imported at L.200,000, together,
                    L.l,400,000; a value which is doubled irι the coarse, and tripled in the finer
                    manufactures. Of this quantity of hemp, the half is made into canvass and
                    thread, a third into cordage, and the remainder into cloth for domestic use. Of
                    the flax annually employed, the value, as a raw material, is about L.800,000; a
                    sum which is tripled when made up into thread, linen, and mixed stuffs, and much
                    more than tripled in the finer qualities. Upon the whole, the value of the
                    finished fabric from hemp is supposed (Chaptai, vol. ii p. 142)tobeabout
                    L.4,500,000 That from flax, including lace 3,000,000</p>
                <p>Add for the domestic manufacture of the pea santry 2,500,000</p>
                <p>Total value made in France, from the stout est sail-cloth to the finest lace
                    L.10,000,000</p>
                <p>French linen differs in quality according to the place of manufacture; but in
                    general it is thicker and stiffer than Irish linen, whilst in whiteness it is
                    inferior to the linen of Flanders and Holland. It is, however, a substantial and
                    durable article.</p>
                <p>This useful article is manufactured in great perfection in France, and has been
                    much improved since the era of the Revolution, at which time the art had
                    remained in much the same state as it was when it was first invented. Subsequent
                    to this period it has been improved in every stage; and its annual produce is
                    valued at above a million sterling. Various attempts have been made to reduce
                    the price of paper, by extracting the ink from paper which has been printed or
                    written upon, and converting it into the raw material for a new manufacture. But
                    it does not appear that any of these processes have been brought to
                    perfection.</p>
                <p>France has 330 blast-furnaces, the position of which is regulated by that of the
                    iron mines. They are chiefly in the mountainous departments of the Dordogne in
                    the south-west, and of the Haute Marne, the Haute Saône, and the Côte d’Or, in
                    the east of the kingdom. Of forges for malleable iron, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >forges d</hi><hi rend="italic">la Catalane,</hi> there are eighty-six scattered
                    throughout different departments, but chiefly in the hilly part of Languedoc.
                    There are also a number of wire-works in France, in which, as in the
                    blast-furnaces, there has been since 1790 a progressive but very slow increase,
                    altogether different from the rapid advance of the iron-works of England
                    previously to 18Í5. The stationary character of these works has evidently been
                    owing to the deficiency of fuel and of water communication; disadvantages which
                    prevent the hardware manufactures from being concentrated in cities or populous
                    districts, and cause them to be spread over the country in petty towns or
                    villages, with a very limited division of labour, and a consequent inferiority
                    of execution. The result is, that France does not export hardware, and that in
                    nothing is the inferiority of domestic accommodation in that country more
                    conspicuous than in articles which belong to the province of the locksmith and
                    cutler. The amount of pig-iron annually made in France appears (Chaptai, vol.
                    ii. p. 154) to be about 100,000 tons. The value of the hardware of the kingdom,
                    including cutlery, arms, and other articles of nice workmanship, is computed at
                    L.8,000,000 or L.9,000,000 sterling. Fine cutlery is, however, largely smuggled
                    into France. The annual import ofiron and steel isonly from L.2,000,000to
                    L.3,000,000, having greatly declined in consequence of the heavy import duty on
                    it. The high price of iron is a great obstruction to the progress of the
                    hardware manufactures; and this circumstance places in a strong light the
                    impolicy of the heavy duties on foreign iron, by which all those important
                    branches of industry in which iron is used are stunted in their growth. In
                    copper, the importations greatly exceed the home produce. From Great Britain the
                    quantity imported for the last ten years has increased from 200 to 20,000
                    hundredweight. Of lead, also, the chief part is imported. The manufacture of
                    steel has only been lately introduced into France. Prior to 1786 there was no
                    manufactory of this useful article; and it was only after accounts had been
                    published by scientific persons, of the composition of that article, and after
                    repeated experiments, that in 1809 manufactories of steel were established,
                    which have been since extended to several departments, especially to those of
                    the Loire.</p>
                <p>The invention of these wonderful machines has been introduced into France from
                    Britain, where they are now employed in every department of industry. It was in
                    the year 1779, at the village of Chaillot, near Paris, that the first
                    steam-engine was established in France; but, owing to prejudices, to attachment
                    to old customs, it was long before it came into very general use. These
                    prejudices, however, gradually faded away before the productive powers and
                    manifest utility of this extraordinary application of science to the business of
                    life, and there are now many establishments for the manufacture of these
                    machines. A premium has also been offered for the invention of any expedient by
                    which the danger of explosion may be prevented, or by which any saving can be
                    effected in the consumption of fuel. The scarcity of coal is a great obstruction
                    to the extensive use of steam-engines; and the tax on foreign coal is in this
                    view peculiarly impolitic, and injurious to the general interests of the
                    community.</p>
                <p>In this department France possesses, both from physical causes and from
                    long-established manufacture, a decided superiority. Mulberry trees were
                    introduced in the fifteenth century, and were first planted, not in the south,
                    but in the central part of the kingdom, near Tours. That town was the seat of
                    the earliest silk manufactures, and it was not till 1600 that the culture of the
                    mulberry was carried southward. It is now prosecuted in twelve departments,
                    which, in 1812, produced as follows (Chaptai, vol. i p. 181):</p>

                    weeks, after which the cocoons are in a state to be purchased for winding or
                    carding. These processes reduce the quantity so much that the produce of an
                    average year does not exceed 560,000 lbs. <hi rend="italic">soie</hi><hi

                <p>The manufacture of silk is considered as an important branch of French industry,
                    not only on account of the variety and beauty of the fabrics, but because the
                    raw material is an indigenous product of the country. It is estimated <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> that the amount of the annual sales to foreigners is
                    thirty millions of francs, or L.1,250,000; that the home consumption of the
                    kingdom amounts to L.3,333,334; and that the whole annual value of the silk
                    manufacture is equal to L.4,598,889. The export of silk manufactures from
                    Britain amounted, in 1832, to L.529,990. The manufacture of silk is not confined
                    to any particular spot. It is carried on in different parts of the country, in
                    all of which it diflfàises prosperity. It has enriched the poor of Nismeβ, of
                    Avignon, and of Tours; St diamond, St Etienne, owe a great part of their
                    prosperity to the manufacture of ribbons, and the town of Ganges to bonneterie;
                    Paris derives immense profits from her manufactures of silk stockings, and other
                    fabrics, either of silk or with a mixture of silk, or of wool and cotton. Silk
                    is also the great staple manufacture of Lyons, in which it is carried on in all
                    its branches with prodigious success; and since the Revolution, in addition to
                    fabrics of silk, all sorts of stuffs mixed with silk, and with cotton and wool,
                    have been manufactured; and to these manufactures Lyons is indebted for its
                    riches, having risen not only to be the second town of France, but to be one of
                    the most opulent and flourishing cities in the world. It is estimated that about
                    60,000 or 70,000 individuals, young and old, are supported by the silk
                    manufacture in Lyons and the adjacent district. The dyeing of silk being an
                    important branch of the manufacture, many experiments were made to bring it to
                    perfection; and, in particular, a dye of perfect black, that would retain its
                    colour, was a desideratum. This dye was invented by a common dyer at Lyons, who
                    received a pension, besides being made a member of the legion of honour. Prior
                    to this, the black dye which was used changed in a few days to a brown, and came
                    off the stuff when it was hard pressed by the hand. Another improvement which
                    was made consisted in procuring a silk of a permanent white colour. The eggs of
                    the worm which produced this silk were brought from China, not, however, with
                    the desired success. The worm was afterwards purchased from a merchant of Alais,
                    and being distributed in the northern departments of the country, the produce of
                    white silk is now very considerable, and is of great importance in the
                    manufacture of gauzes, crapes, and tulles. Other inventions were devised for
                    saving labour in the various stages of the silk manufacture, by which, in this
                    branch of industry, France was long enabled to outstrip all her neighbours,
                    though of late years the silk manufacture has made rapid advances in Great
                    Britain.</p>
                <p>Articles of leather are in France cheaper by a third than in England. The value
                    of leather annually prepared for sale in France is (Chaptai, vol. ii. p. 187)
                    nearly L.3,000,000 sterling; when made up into articles, as boots, shoes,
                    saddles, harness, its value is nearly double. Great improvements have been made
                    in the art of tanning, in consequence of the progress of chemical science.</p>
                <p>Jewellery, as well as watch and clock making, are carried to a considerable
                    extent in France, particularly at Paris; a time-piece is there a much more
                    frequent article of ornamental furniture than in England, and the number of new
                    watches made annually in the kingdom is not less than 300,000; altogether, the
                    value of these different kinds of workmanship amounts to L.1,500,000, of which
                    more than the half is made in the capital. The works in bronze belong still more
                    particularly to the capital, and form in their different branches and stages, of
                    which gilding is the chief, a further annual value of L.1,500,000 sterling.</p>
                <p>Paris is remarkable for other fabrics of taste and luxury; in particular, the
                    porcelain of Sèvres, near St Cloud, and the beautiful but very expensive
                    tapestry of the Gobelins. The materials of the latter are silk and the finest
                    woollen thread; the subjects woven into the work are taken from paintings
                    executed on purpose. Both the establishments have been long conducted by
                    government at a sacrifice, and both are now on a reduced scale, the articles
                    being far too costly for private individuals. The latter are more frequently
                    purchasers of <hi rend="italic">passementerie,</hi> by which is understood
                    artificial flowers, fringes, gold and silver lace, with a variety of trifling
                    but tasteful articles, all sufficiently adapted to a city where so much more is
                    thought of display than of utility.</p>
                <p>The value of all the soap made in France is computed at L.l,400,000. The main
                    ingredient is olive oil; and Marseilles was formerly the seat of this
                    manufacture for almost all France; an advantage owing both to the extent of the
                    olive-grounds in the south-east of the kingdom, and the vicinity of Marseilles
                    to Italy, the Levant, and Spain, whence soda and olive oil were imported in vast
                    quantities. The disorders of the Revolution, and the establishment of similar
                    manufactures in other parts of France, have caused to Marseilles the loss of a
                    third of its soap works; they are still however very extensive. Of the oil used
                    in France, whale oil forms a very small proportion; the great supply is of
                    vegetable oil, viz. that extracted from the rape and cole-seed of the north, and
                    the olive oil of the south. The collective value of these is very considerable,
                    not short (Chaptai, vol. i. p. 186) of L.3,000,000 sterling, almost all consumed
                    in France, where lamps instead of candles are in very general use.</p>
                <p>Beer, formerly little drunk in France, has become of extended consumption since
                    1790; but even at present the quantity used does not exceed L.2,000,000
                    sterling, its place being supplied by cider in the north, and by wine in the
                    south. The consumption which corresponds to that of our home-made spirits, and
                    in a great measure to that of our rum, is in brandy, of which the value annually
                    made is between L.2,000,000 and L.3,000,000 sterling. Further, there are at
                    Paris a number of establishments very recently formed for the singular purpose
                    of distilling from potatoes a spirituous liquor, which (Chaptai, vol. ii. p.
                    197) has been generally approved, and has been brought into competition with
                    brandy.</p>
                <p>Of hats, an article which in France is made more durable, but much less light and
                    pleasant than in England, the manu- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> factures,
                    formerly concentrated at Lyons and Marseilles, are now diflused throughout
                    several towns; and the value annually made is about L.1,000,000 sterling.
                    Perfiιmery is made extensively in the south, where, from the mildness of the
                    climate, aromatic plants are abundant. Paper being exempt from the heavy duties
                    of England, is sold in France upon very reasonable terms, whilst in quality it
                    is equal to our <pb break="no" facs="nls:193516359" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6359-0184"
                    />own. The value annually used in printing, in writing, and in the hanging of
                    rooms, is computed at fully L.1,000,000 sterling. Of glass, the manufacture has
                    been much improved and extended during the present age. Whether for mirrors, for
                    windows, or for bottles, this article in France is good and of a moderate price.
                    The number of glass-houses in 1818 was 185, and the value of their manufacture
                    L.900,000. As to earthenware, it is only since 1790 that English pottery has
                    been successfully imitated in France. It is now made to the value of L.200,000
                    or L.300,000, whilst the coarse earthenware, fabricated in almost every province
                    of the kingdom, is computed at L.600,000.</p>
                <p>Saltpetre, till lately a monopolized manufacture, is now unrestricted, and is
                    made to the value of somewhat more than L.100,000 annually. Sulphuric acid has,
                    since the beginning of the present century, been greatly lowered in price and
                    increased in quantity; its annual manufacture representing a value of nearly
                    L.300,000. Muriatic acid is used in whitening linen and cotton, and is made to
                    an annual value of L.100,000. Soda is manufactured in France to the value of
                    L.100,000; copperas L.100,000; alum L.250,000.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of sugar from beet-root was introduced into France during the war
                    with Great Britain, when the coasts of France being blockaded by the enemy’s
                    superior fleets, the importation of foreign articles, and among others that of
                    sugar, was rendered dangerous and difficult; and its price was so high as
                    entirely to preclude its consumption by the middling classes in society. Various
                    articles were resorted to as substitutes, such as honey, the juice of raisins,
                    &amp;c. But they were not relished by the taste of the people; and in this case
                    experiments were tried by eminent chemists to extract from beet-root the sugar
                    which it contained. These experiments were successful, and there are now more
                    than 200 establishments, from which were produced annually 7,480,000 lbs. of raw
                    sugar. After the peace of 1814 this manufacture fell into discredit, especially
                    under the now free competition of West India sugar. But in 1826, by new
                    experiments, and more perfect tnachi-nery, it was found that sugar could be
                    extracted from beetroot, and sold at a moderate price with a profit; and the
                    quantity manufactured in 1829 amounted to 13,200,000 lbs.,<note anchored="true"

                <p>Labour in Paris is as much dearer relatively to the provincial towns of France,
                    as labour in London is relatively to those of England. It still remains for us
                    to remove from our capital some manufactures which have been most inju- '
                    diciously established there; but the French have carriedļ this false calculation
                    much further, Paris being the centre not only of ornamental fabrics, such as
                    jewellery, bronze, sculpture, cabinet-making, but of a number of coarser
                    employments, which a very slight change of plan might transfer to a cheaper
                    quarter. There are at Paris periodical exhibitions of French manufactures held
                    once in three or four years, at which are present the king, the princes, the
                    nobility, and all eminent men of science. There is also in that capital a <hi
                    rend="italic">Conservatoire des Arts</hi><hi rend="italic">et des Métiers;</hi>
                    a collection, on a large scale, of models of all instruments or machines that
                    relate to arts and manufactures.</p>
                <p>It is more the practice also in France than in Britain to encourage ingenious
                    inventions in the mechanical arts, by premiums and honorary marks of
                    distinction. Yet, with all these advantages, industry has not made the same
                    progress as in this country. The truth is, that profit derived from the utility
                    of the invention itself is the great stimulus to industry; and the inventor of
                    any new improvement in manufactures, by taking out a patent, and obtaining the
                    monopoly of his invention for a term of years, is sufficiently rewarded,
                    provided the invention be really useful by saving labour, and thus enabling its
                    contriver to bring a cheaper article of equal quality into market.</p>
                <p>To prescribe the mode of manufacture was formerly a favourite course with
                    government in England as in France. From the time of Colbert (1660) the French
                    <hi rend="italic">ordonnances</hi> prescribed peremptorily the length and
                    breadth of serges, of druggets, in short, of every kind of cloth calculated for
                    export, under the plausible idea that all these precautions were necessary to
                    establish a reputation for quality. It is a curious fact, that these rules were
                    desired by the manufacturers themselves, and were long considered as the
                    safeguard of French industry. A change was introduced in 1779, and permission
                    given to every manufacturer to follow his own method, provided he distinguished
                    the goods thus made from those which were in conformity with the regulations.
                    But this was of very short duration. The power of habit and prejudice prevailed.
                    New <hi rend="italic">ordonnances,</hi> issued the succeeding year, revived the
                    former limitations; and the manufactures of France were not put on an
                    unrestricted footing till the Revolution. Much inconvenience had also been
                    sustained from the absurd law which prevented a workman from settling in
                    business in any town excepting that in which he had served an apprenticeship.
                    This law was abrogated in 1767.</p>
                <p>The manufacturing industry of France is confined, far more than ours, to the home
                    market, whether we look to the supply of the raw material, or to the export of
                    the finished articles. Her imports are large only in cotton and silk; in wool
                    and iron they are not considerable; whilst in flax, hemp, and leather they may
                    be termed insignificant. In exports the limitation is still more striking, her
                    hardware, her linen, her woollens, her cotton, her leather, and, in a great
                    measure, her silk, being confined to the home market; a restriction owing partly
                    to our manufacturing superiority, but more to the capital of our merchants, and
                    their ability to give long credit. The productive industry of France is
                    consequently much less subject than ours to sudden fluctuation. It follows
                    nearly the same routine year after year. On the occurrence of a war, or other
                    political change, the commerce and manufactures of our neighbours, to borrow a
                    phrase of Talleyrand (Letter to Mr Fox, 1st April 1806) <hi rend="italic">se

                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-6372-0185"/><hi rend="italic">eux-mimes.</hi> Need more be
                    added to show the error of those who maintain that, half a century ago, her
                    manufactures were of great amount; that they were almost entirely suspended by
                    the Revolution, and indebted for their subsequent revival to the exertions of
                    the government? The fluctuations, at no time of great amount, have related
                    chiefly to the export trade, and owed their origin to the general hostilities of
                    1793.</p>
                <p>An analysis of the causes of success in manufacture is instructive, as showing
                    that excellence, where it exists, is the natural result of specific causes, and
                    by no means a consequence of that general superiority, the belief of which is so
                    dear to the vanity of every nation. The individual talents of workmen in France
                    and England may fairly be considered on a par; the quickness and activity of the
                    French being counterpoised by their volatility and want of adherence to a given
                    object. The leading advantage of their manufactures is solidity, arising from
                    the comparative cheapness of labour and raw materials. Hence the durability of
                    their woollens and silks; and hence also the cheapness of their paper and
                    leather. The points of inferiority are much more numerous, but may be almost all
                    traced to one cause, an imperfect division of labour. In England, the facility
                    of water communication maybe said to unite several towns into one, facilitating
                    the division of employment, and overcoming the disadvantages of a separate and
                    remote position; but in French towns, instead of the inhabitants limiting
                    themselves to a few manufactures of kindred character, there prevails a habit of
                    endeavouring to make every thing on the same spot. Lyons, Rouen, and Lisle, are
                    populous cities, and entitled to rank with Manchester, Glasgow, and Leeds; but
                    there must end the parallel; for St Etienne forms a poor counterpoise to
                    Sheffield; and Birmingham, with several of our other towns, is without a rival.
                    In short, it may be assumed generally, that, in a French town of equal size, the
                    work, both of manufacturers and of artisans, is, even in the case of ingenious
                    individuals, much less nice and accurate than in England.</p>
                <p>VII. COMMERCE, COLONIES, FISHERIES, SHIPPING.</p>
                <p>In no country in Europe has trade been laid under such galling restrictions as in
                    France; and it is remarkable that this system of restriction has in a great
                    measure been the creation of modern times. The ancient legislation of France was
                    rather friendly to foreign trade. It encouraged importation in preference to
                    exportation. This latter privilege of export was in 1577 claimed by Henry III.
                    as his royal and seignorial right; and he regulated by his ordonnances the
                    export duty on a variety of articles, whilst the produce of foreign countries
                    was admitted on payment of an <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi> duty of two per
                    cent. Louis XIV. introduced a sort of navigation act, by which he levied a tax
                    of fifty sous on all foreign ships. In 1667 further restrictions were
                    introduced; and in 1687 the exclusive system was established in its full rigour.
                    Her statesmen seem to have imagined that a flourishing commerce could be created
                    by legal authority, and that domestic industry could only be encouraged by the
                    exclusion of all foreign competition; and hence all the vices and obsolete
                    maxims of the mercantile system will still be found in the commercial policy of
                    France. The extension of the restrictive system was promoted by the authority of
                    Colbert, a minister who, though he introduced order into the finances, and
                    improved in many particulars the system of taxation, and was indeed a great
                    master of detail, adopted the most erroneous maxims of commercial legislation.
                    It is justly observed, in the masterly Report of Villiers and Bowring on the
                    commercial relations between Great Britain and France, that the “whole of the
                    bounties by which he induced adventurers to enter into remote speculations, as
                    well as the excessive duties which he imposed on cheaper foreign articles, were
                    almost uncompensated sacrifices; while, on the other hand, of the manufactures
                    which he transplanted into France, and which he protected by the exclusion of
                    rival productions, scarcely one took permanent root and even those which he
                    intended to support by special encouragement would all of them have been more
                    prosperous, but for the regulations with which his mistaken zeal retarded the
                    progress of manufacturing industry. His whole system was an attempt to regulate
                    by law what would have been better left to the sagacity of individuals, and to
                    give an artificial direction to the national capital. Thus he encouraged a trade
                    to the West Indies by granting a bounty of 25s. on every ton of goods exported,
                    and of 41s. 8d. on every ton imported. He boasted of setting up 40,000 looms by
                    virtue of legal enactments, without considering that the capital employed in
                    these establishments would have taken a more natural direction, and been more
                    profitably employed, but for his interference. The restraints also which were
                    thus laid on domestic industry were often enforced by the despotic authority of
                    the government. Many of the absurd and pernicious regulations of Colbert were
                    broken down by the French Revolution; but others remained, and the tariff of
                    1791 was from beginning to end a system of prohibition, the object of which was
                    to encourage the home manufacturer by freeing him from the intrusion of all
                    foreign competitors. It must be confessed that the trade of Great Britain was
                    originally regulated by the same narrow views, and is still shackled in many of
                    its important branches. Indeed it is undeniable that Britain set the example of
                    illiberality; and it was no wonder that the French legislature of that day
                    should be jealous of a country which excluded her silks and cambrics, and laid α
                    discriminating duty of thirty-three and a half per cent, on French wines; and
                    whose parliament, under the reign of William HL, declared the trade with France
                    to be a nuisance. These views, however, have been now abandoned by all British
                    statesmen. The commercial treaty concluded with France in 1786 by Mr Pitt, was
                    the earnest of a better system; and since this period the legislators of this
                    country have been impressed with the injurious tendency of all commercial
                    restrictions; and they have been labouring strenuously to emancipate the
                    national industry from those fetters in which it has been too long bound. But in
                    France the progress of improvement has been slower, and it has besides been
                    retarded by political events. The long and sanguinary war waged between Great
                    Britain and France subjected the latter to the maritime hostility of her
                    powerful opponent, the consequence of which was, that her trade was interrupted
                    with foreign countries, and the supply of many of their staple articles of
                    produce greatly diminished, and of course raised enormously in price. It became
                    a great object, in this case, to produce these articles at home; and thus, in
                    addition to the existing restraints upon the importation of foreign
                    manufactures, special encouragements were given to the production of articles
                    for which neither the soil nor the climate of France was peculiarly fitted. And
                    thus when the maritime blockade of France was raised by the peace of 1814, her
                    industry had, partly from ancient and mistaken maxims, and partly from the
                    pressure of war, received a very artificial direction, and was oppressed by the
                    most ruinous and complicated restrictions. At the restoration of the Bourbons in
                    1814, the tariff of 1791 was the law of the land in commercial matters. It had
                    undergone a few modifications, but these were all mostly in the restrictive and
                    prohibitory spirit, and were accommodated to the hostile position which France
                    occupied in regard to surrounding nations; and when the barrier to a free
                    intercourse with foreign nations was at length <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193516385" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6385-0186"/>thrown down by the peace of
                    1814, the exclusive provisions of the tariff of 1791 were brought into full
                    operation, and it was then found that when the obstacles to her commercial
                    intercourse with foreign nations raised up by the war were withdrawn, ano less
                    effectual line of circumvallation had been drawn around her commerce by the
                    restrictions and prohibitions of her own erroneous policy. It is remarkable,
                    indeed, that a committee of the Chamber of Deputies, in reporting on the budget
                    in 1832, enter into an exposition and defence of the restrictive system, the
                    principle of which is to encourage domestic industry by the exclusion of the
                    cheaper and better manufactures of foreign nations. The fallacious and narrow
                    views, the loose reasonings, and the gross mis-statements of facts, especially
                    where a reference is made to the commercial policy of Britain, is far from
                    evincing on the part of this committee either diligent research or legislative
                    wisdom.</p>
                <p>The tariff of 1791 either excluded from France, or laid under heavy duties,
                    almost all the great staple manufactures of other countries. Manufactured iron
                    in every shape, manufactured steel, copper, tin, cutlery, and all articles
                    manufactured from any of the metals; all fabrics, of wool, cotton, silk, or
                    tissues of hair, saddlery, spirituous liquors, grain, refined sugar, tobacco,
                    toys, and various other inconsiderable articles, are included in this magna
                    charta of domestic commerce. The weakness, the inconsistency, and the various
                    fallacies on which this system is founded, are so well exposed in the Report of
                    Villiers and Bowring, to which we have already alluded, that we subjoin the
                    passage, which, though somewhat long, is replete with instruction.</p>
                <p>“It requires merely to state some of the objections to importations, in order to
                    show their narrow and anti-commercial spirit. The introduction of manufactured
                    tin, for example, is opposed because it might benefit England, which is rich in
                    tin mines, as if the importation into France could take place without equally
                    benefiting her. The reasons, too, which are grounded on the superiority of other
                    countries; as, for example, ‘ dangerous rivalry’ in the case of manufactured
                    steel; ’ cheapness’ of foreign article in the case of shipping; threatened *
                    annihilation of the French manufacture’ in that of cutlery; ’ extra advantages
                    of the English' in plated ware; ‘ apprehension of the English’ in articles of
                    pottery; ‘ imprudence of admitting English saddlery,’ as so many persons,
                    regardless of price, prefer it; ‘ advantages of machinery’ in works of iron; all
                    are modes of announcing the superiority of the foreign articles, and the power
                    which foreigners possess of supplying them on cheaper terms than they can be
                    produced at home.</p>
                <p>“There are other grounds of prohibition by which particular French manufactures
                    are avowedly sacrificed to the interest of other branches of French industry.
                    The importation of extracts of dye-woods is disallowed for the purpose of
                    encouraging the importation of the dye-woods themselves; the interest of the
                    dyer, the manufacturer, and consumer, being wholly forgotten. The importation of
                    iron of certain sizes is prohibited, lest small manufacturers should establish
                    fabrics, and supply the markets at a less cost than the larger establishments.
                    Woollen yarn is not allowed to be imported, because it can be produced in
                    France, though the high price must be a great detriment to the woollen
                    manufacture; and cast iron of a great variety of sorts is prohibited, on the
                    ground that a sufficiency may be obtained at home, though the cost is
                    notoriously more than double that of many articles of foreign cast iron.
                    Molasses are not allowed to be introduced, because the price in France is so
                    low, and the exportation so large, on the ground that importation will lower the
                    prices still more, though the lowness of price would obviously make importation
                    unprofitable; and the fact of considerable exportation is the best evidence that
                    the average prices are low in France. Rock salt was prohibited in 1791, and the
                    prohibition is now justified on the ground that mines have lately been
                    discovered. The prohibition of refined sugar is supported on the ground that its
                    admission would not benefit the treasury; but it is clear, if the interest of
                    the treasury were kept in view, that all prohibitions would be suppressed, or
                    superseded by a system of duties. While some articles are prohibited because the
                    production is small in France, and requires protection, others are prohibited
                    (dressed skins, for example) because the production is great, and engages a
                    large number of hands.”</p>
                <p>There is another branch of the French legislation regarding commerce, and of the
                    legislation indeed of most other commercial countries, which is equally
                    exceptionable with the prohibition to import foreign manufactures; namely, the
                    system of drawbacks and bounties on the exportation of domestic produce. Having
                    by special encouragements created a surplus of certain articles at home, and
                    which the high price prevented from being sold to foreigners, the public were
                    called upon to pay the difference between this high price and the price abroad;
                    and thus they were taxed, by the exclusion of the foreign article, in a higher
                    price for what was consumed at home, and also taxed for all that was consumed
                    abroad, in the bounty which was paid on the exportation of the article. This is
                    a double iniquity, which has of late years gone on increasing in France. In
                    1817, the whole amount of what was conceded on this account amounted to L.3500
                    per annum, whilst in 1830 it amounted to L.600,000, nearly one fifth of the nett
                    amount of the whole custom-house revenues of France; and as it was going on
                    progressively, it might soon have absorbed the whole custom-house income,
                    without in the least benefiting, but rather injuring, the general interests of
                    commerce. During the first nine months of the year 1832 premiums or bounties
                    were paid to the amount of 24,448,375 francs, or L.l,018,682.</p>
                <p>The commerce of France, obstructed by these restrictive duties, has not made the
                    same advances as her agriculture and manufactures. The internal produce of every
                    country necessarily increases with its population; and the inhabitants of France
                    having increased, since 1780, from 24,800,000 to 33,000,000, must produce as
                    well as consume more. But in the mean time her commerce has not kept pace with
                    this increase in her population. The value of the imports into France amounted
                    in 1787 to 631,790,700 francs, or about twenty-five millions sterling, and
                    engaged 888,868 tons of shipping; and her whole imports only amounted in 1830 to
                    twenty-five and a half millions sterling, and employed 1,009,454 tons of
                    shipping, which is far from being an increase corresponding to her augmented
                    population. The foreign commerce of England was, in the year 1787, about seven
                    millions less than that of France, or about eighteen millions sterling, and
                    employed 1,349,419 tons of shipping. Her population was nine millions. In 1830
                    her foreign trade had increased to L.69,700,748, including L.17,127,764 to the
                    colonies, which employed 2,860,515 tons of shipping. Thus, whilst the official
                    value of the commerce of England has nearly quadrupled, and her shipping nearly
                    doubled, not aboveone fiftieth part has been added to the foreign commerce of
                    France; a fact which strongly illustrates the pernicious influence of monopolies
                    in damping the energies of individual enterprise, and thus obstructing the
                    national prosperity.</p>
                <p>The following is a brief sketch of the trade of France with other countries.</p>
                <p>The corn, the hemp, the flax, the tallow, which form such important articles of
                    export from the north of Europe to England, are comparatively unnecessary to
                    France. Their timber and pitch are imported there, but the quantities required
                    by a people where ship-building is so limited<pb break="no" facs="nls:193516398"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-6398-0187"/> are necessarily of little consequence. The
                    further articles of import are iron, copper, lead, salt, fish, all likewise on a
                    small scale. The returns from France are no longer in the sugar and coffee,
                    which, before the loss of St Domingo, furnished an annual export to the north of
                    fully two millions sterling. They are limited to wine and brandy, luxuries of
                    which the consumption is confined to a few large towns, such as Petersburg,
                    Hamburg, Stockholm, and Dantzick.</p>
                <p>With Germany, at least with the centre and south of Germany, the exchanges of
                    France are carried on by a tedious land carriage, or by a still more tedious
                    river navigation. Here are no canals to facilitate the conveyance of bulky
                    commodities; all proceed in a slow routine, excepting horses and horned cattle,
                    which are imported into France in considerable numbers, and made to travel with
                    expedition. In regard to the Netherlands the case is different. With them there
                    is an easy communication by sea, and, as far as regards French Flanders and part
                    of Picardy, a still more easy communication by means of canals. The following
                    table presents a view of the trade between France and the Netherlands in
                    1830.</p>

                <p>From Holland are imported spirituous liquors, spices, butter, cheese. The returns
                    from France consist chiefly of wine, silks, brandy, and dried fruit. When the
                    Netherlands were subject to France, this intercourse was very active; but since
                    1814 it is much impeded by restrictions on both sides.</p>
                <p>From Italy France imports raw silk, corn, rice, olive oil, and fruit, chiefly
                    lemons, oranges, figs, and raisins. The returns, various in kind, but small in
                    quantity, consist of wine, brandy, cattle, woollens, linen, leather, hats,
                    stockings, jewellery, glass, hardware. From the Levant, the imports, though less
                    than formerly, still consist of raw silk, cotton, wool, corn, dried fruits; the
                    exports, manufactured silks, woollens, stockings, and, in a small degree,
                    hardware, paper, liqueurs, linens, lace. With Spain the intercourse is more
                    extensive: the exports from France consist of corn, flour, salt fish, wine,
                    brandy, also woollens, cottons, silks, leather, linen, lace, hats; all articles
                    which have passed through some process of manufacture, and bear testimony to the
                    industry of the French. The Spaniards, on the other hand, true to their
                    character, make no returns except in produce and raw materials, viz. wool, silk,
                    fruit, sweet wines, along with some iron and copper. With Portugal the trade of
                    France is not considerable, the staple products, wine and brandy, being the same
                    in both countries.</p>
                <p>Were congeniality of feeling, either in an individual or a national sense, the
                    regulator of commerce, the intercourse between the French and Americans should
                    be great; for no nations ever sympathized more cordially with the sufferings of
                    each other, or were more decided in ascribing them to the aggressions of
                    England. But a mutual want of capital restricts the connection. The Americans
                    require long credit, and to give credit exceeds the means of the French. The
                    cotton, tobacco, and rice of the United States are paid partly by wine and
                    brandy, but in a very slight degree by manufactures. This branch of trade will
                    increase with the population and wealth of the United States; and this appears
                    to be the case, as the tonnage employed has increased from 30,793, its amount in
                    1820, to 95,818, its amount in 1830. The most ready means of extending French
                    commerce would be with England; a country of customers whose activity supplies
                    them with the means of giving in exchange a number of useful commodities. At
                    present the intercourse is more considerable than with almost any other country;
                    but a partial reduction of the custom-house duties would extend greatly the
                    mutual trade of the two countries. England would supply France in greater
                    quantities with imports, consisting of cottons, hardware, earthenware, copper,
                    tin, coals, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi>; whilst a corresponding increase
                    would take place in the French exports, of which the staple articles are wine
                    and brandy, the smaller silks, olive oil, fruit, butter, poultry, and, when our
                    laws allow, corn and butchermeat. In the importation of the produce of the soil
                    from France, our course would be clear and direct, our climate not admitting of
                    the growth of the vine, the olive, or the mulberry; but, in regard to
                    manufactures, it is a matter of nicety to say in what articles an exchange would
                    take place, our late improvemenu in machinery counterbalancing the cheap labour
                    of France in several branches, such as lace, in which our competition would
                    formerly <pb break="no" facs="nls:193516411" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6411-0188"/>have
                    been hopeless. It is evident, however, that there would be a series of varied
                    and extensive exchanges, not so much perhaps in distinct articles, as in
                    different qualities or shades of quality in the same article or branch of
                    manufacture. These exchanges are necessary for completing assortments in shops,
                    in warehouses, in shipments; and their extent would be such as to be
                    comprehended only by those who are familiar with the endless ramifications of
                    manufacture, or who are aware of the striking exemplification of this truth,
                    afforded by our intercourse with France in the auspicious interval between the
                    commercai treaty in 1786 and the rupture in 1793.</p>
                <p>The chief commercial business of Paris is necessarily inland; but it is the
                    centre of exchange transactions for France, foreign as well as inland; as London
                    is for England, and Amsterdam for Holland. Havre de Grace is the channel of the
                    maritime intercourse of the capital, the outlet for its exports, and the medium
                    through which <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> it receives colonial produce, raw
                    materials, and foreign manufactures. Bordeaux is a sea-port of great activity,
                    as well for the exportation of wine and brandy, as for the importation of sugar,
                    coffee, and cotton. Marseilles, a larger but a less bustling city, continues the
                    emporium for the trade with Italy and the Levant. Nantes has suffered greatly by
                    the loss of St Domingo, as well as by the abolition of the slave trade, of which
                    it was the centre. It still exports to Martinique and Guadeloupe, linen,
                    hardware, printed cottons; and, like Bordeaux, receives in return sugar, coffee,
                    and raw cotton. Rouen, though accessible to vessels of burden, is, like Lyons
                    and Lisle, chiefly remarkable for manufactures.</p>

                <p> The currency of France consiste chiefly of gold and silver, in which the main
                    payments are effected, and of copper coins for the smaller sums. It appears that
                    from 1803 to 1814 there were coined, with the effigy of Napoleon, at the
                    different mints, of which there are thirteen in France, in gold to the value of
                    L.22,001,018, and in silver to the value of L.36,992,502. From 1814 to 1828, the
                    amount of the coinage was L.17,081,635 in gold, of twenty and forty franc
                    pieces; and in silver the amount in pieces of five francs down to five sous was
                    L.36,996,560, bearing the effigy of Louis XVIΠ. and Charles X. On the above
                    data, the amount of circulating specie in the kingdom was estimated on the 1st
                    of January 1828 at 2,713,731,183 francs, equal in value to L.l 13,072,132
                    sterling. The gold and silver currency, prior to the Revolution in 1789, was
                    estimated at L.87,500,000 sterling. We can scarcely, however, draw any positive
                    inference from the quantity of gold and silver coined in France, respecting the
                    amount of the specie actually circulating, as within the last seven years the
                    exportation of coin, with a liberality that is rather at variance with the
                    ordinary policy of France, has been freely permitted. The coinage of France has
                    accordingly become an article of trade; and bullion and coin have been freely
                    exported or imported, according to the necessities of commerce. For the ten
                    years preceding 1830, the quantity of bullion imported has exceeded the quantity
                    exported by L.39,089,667, as will appear from the following table :—</p>

                <p>This bank, which is the city privileged bank in France, received its charter in
                    1803 for fifteen years, which was afterwards extended in 1818 to the year 1845.
                    It is under the direction of a governor, named by the king, with a salary of
                    100,000 francs a year. It has, besides, two deputy-governors, and a general
                    council of eighteen directors; also a separate council for the discount
                    department, composed of twelve members chosen from among such of the
                    shareholders as are merchants. This bank issues notes of the amount of 1000 and
                    300 francs, which are payable in specie at the will of the holder. Its capital,
                    which consists of 67,900 shares at 1000 francs, making a total of 67,900,000
                    francs, is employed in discounting bills of exchange, in making advances of
                    money in government securities, and in deposits of bullion or foreign coin,
                    diamonds, shares in public companies, at the rate of one per cent, per annum. No
                    less than the value of 10,000 francs is received as a deposit, and discount for
                    forty-five days is deducted from the amount of the sum advanced; nor, if the
                    deposit be redeemed the next day, is any part of the discount refunded. The
                    paper of the bank of France chiefly circulates in Paris and the neighbourhood;
                    at a distance from Paris its notes pass at a discount of one and a half per
                    cent., as they are not received in payment of taxes or custom-house duties in
                    sea-ports; so that remittances to Paris must be made in cash, for which a charge
                    of five per cent, is made al the post-office: the dividend of the bank on each
                    share has been thirty francs half-yearly, or at the rate of six per cent, per
                    annum. A surplus fund, which has accumulated, has been, in consequence of the
                    reiterated demands of the shareholders, put in a course of distribution; and in
                    the year 1831 two entire dividends were made of fifteen francs and six francs
                    per share, besides two other payments, under the name of a bonus of reserve, the
                    one amounting to seven francs fifty centimes, and the other to three francs, per
                    share. The balance of the reserved fund amounted in 1830 to 6,974,398 francs,
                    which would give a further bonus of 146 francs 95 cents, on each share; and for
                    the purpose of authorizing the distribution of this sum, a law was passed in
                    December 1831. By this law the bank is bound to hold a third part of its profits
                    in reserve, after paying the regular dividend of six per cent, per annum. The
                    circulation of the bank varies from 214,000,000 to 240,000,000 of francs. In the
                    commencement of the year 1831, it held commercial bills to the amount of
                    75,000,000 of francs, which by its cautious or timid policy was reduced towards
                    the end of the year to 23,000,000, the greatest reduction which it had
                    experienced for the previous fifteen years. The diminution of discounts
                    occasioned a corresponding rise in its stock of bullion, which was increased
                    from 103,000,000 to 266,000,000 francs. Saving banks, <hi rend="italic">causa
                    d’</hi><hi rend="italic">épargne,</hi> have been lately introduced at Paris.</p>
                <p>Land carriage in France costs only from 2s. to 2s. 6d. per cwt. for a hundred
                    miles; a cheapness which facilitates the transport of merchandise to the various
                    annual fairs which are still held in every great town in the kingdom, exactly as
                    was done by our forefathers a century ago. This periodical routine begins by the
                    <hi rend="italic">foire</hi><hi rend="italic">de Longchamps,</hi> which is held
                    annually at Paris in spring, and is followed by a long list of provincial fairs,
                    of which the chief are those of Beaucaire in Languedoc, and Guibray in
                    Normandy.</p>
                <p>The weights and measures of France were reduced, as is well known, to a very
                    simple and uniform scale, soon after the Revolution; but there has been much
                    difficulty in accustoming the inhabitants, particularly in country districts, to
                    the adoption of the new system, which unluckily preserved none of the names with
                    which they were familiar. In 1812 a kind of compromise took place, government
                    sanctioning the retention of the old names, such as pounds, ounces, ells, and
                    bushels; but requiring that their contents should be calculated by a reference
                    to the new standard. It is, accordingly, on this footing that business is now
                    transacted in France. The new weights and measures are, in general, larger by a
                    fraction than the old, and the use of the latter is prohibited by law.</p>
                <p>The colonial possessions of France are quite unsuited to her greatness in other
                    respects. The insurrection engendered by the Revolution deprived her of the
                    western half of St Domingo, a rich and beautiful territory, containing formerly
                    more negroes, and exporting more produce, than all the British West Indies
                    together. The French government seems to have relinquished the hope of regaining
                    this country, at least by military means, and to limit its ambition to the
                    remaining colonies, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Cayenne, in the West Indies. The
                    first two are, like most of our West India islands, cultivated to a considerable
                    extent, but capable of much improvement. The petty island of Marie Galante is in
                    a similar state; but Cayenne forms a part of a most extensive tract, of which
                    one corner only is as yet rendered pro-</p>
                <p>• ductive, and which may eventually become a great settlement; though on the
                    score of health it is as unpromising as the adjacent colonies of Demerara and
                    Surinam. Before<pb break="no" facs="nls:193516489" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6489-0194"
                    /> the loss of St Domingo, the annual import into France amounted to 70,000
                    hhds. of muscovado or brown sugar, 60,000 hhds. clayed, and nearly 20,000 of
                    fine clayed. Of this very large supply there were exported nearly 40,000 hhds.
                    of brown, and above 60,000 hhds. of clayed, forming, exclusively of any duty, an
                    annual value of between L.2,000,000 and L.3,000,000 sterling, and affording a
                    most acceptable exchange for a number of imported commodities. The sugar thus
                    imported from St Domingo has long been lost to France, no sugar being now
                    exported from that country.</p>
                <p>In Africa the French possess Goree and some factories near the mouth of the
                    Senegal. In the East they have the isle of Bourbon, and Pondicherry,
                    Chandernagore, and some smaller factories on the mainland of India; and their
                    vessels are, like the Americans, admitted to trade with Calcutta, Madras, and
                    other British settlements, on payment of moderate dues; but they possess no
                    power of annoying, or even of resisting Britain, in the event of hostilities.
                    The retention of the Mauritius, at the peace of 1814, deprived them of the great
                    receptacle for their privateers in the East; and in a very different part of the
                    world, the continent of North America, they retain nothing since the cession of
                    Louisiana in 1803. In the seas of Europe, Corsica is almost the only insular
                    possession of the French. They have no great maritime fortresses, like Gibraltar
                    or Malta, and no dependencies of the nature of the Ionian islands.</p>
                <p>The commerce of France with her colonies is regulated by the same narrow maxims
                    as the other branches of her foreign trade. The colonies and the mother country
                    are mutually bound to trade exclusively with each other. The staple produce of
                    the French West India colonies, as well as the isle of Bourbon in the East, is
                    sugar; and it appears that the price of this article in the European markets
                    will not repay the expense of its cultivation in those countries. The colonists,
                    therefore, insist that all other sugars shall be excluded by heavy duties from
                    the markets of France; that they shall have the exclusive privilege of supplying
                    these markets; and on a complaint that the duties imposed on foreign sugars were
                    not high enough to give them the monopoly of the home market, an additional duty
                    was in 1822, on the suggestion of the director-general of the customs, imposed
                    on all foreign sugars. In return, France possesses the exclusive privilege of
                    supplying the colonies with all the manufactures and other European goods which
                    they require. On this principle of mutual monopoly the trade is now conducted.
                    The effect of this system is to levy a tax on the inhabitants of France, in
                    order to indemnify the colonists for the losses which they incur in carrying on
                    an unprofitable trade. They cannot furnish a supply of sugar to France at the
                    ordinary rate of the European market; and the price must therefore be
                    artificially raised in that country, in order to enable them to carry on the
                    cultivation of their estates; whilst, on the other hand, they are not at liberty
                    to buy the goods which they require in the cheap-∣ est market, but must take
                    them at whatever price they can be afforded by the mother country. The quantity
                    of sugar imported into France is 60,000,000 of kilogrammes, or 1,178,571 cwts.;
                    of coffee, 4,000,000 of kilogrammes, or 74,107 cwts. The whole amount of the
                    colonial importation into France is estimated at L.2,125,000, and the average
                    exports at L.l,416,666. The additional expense which France pays for colonial
                    products, in consequence of the exclusion of foreign sugar and other articles,
                    is estimated at L.833,333 per annum. To this amount the French people are taxed
                    for the colonial monopoly. The colonies again purchase the articles which they
                    require for their consumption at a higher price than they could be procured from
                    Great Britain; and they complain that on this account they pay L.625,000 per
                    annum. Thus both parties suffer. The restrictive system is a source of mutual
                    mischief to the colonies and the mother country; and indirectly also it produces
                    injurious consequences to the general trade of the country. The merchants of
                    Faris, Bordeaux, and Marseilles, who are interested in the trade, concur in
                    stating that the impossibility of importing bulky articles, such as sugar, from
                    foreign countries, interrupts the commerce with India and the Levant. Indigo,
                    silk, spices, &amp;c. the produce of India, are not indeed excluded from France;
                    but a vessel cannot be loaded with these costly articles, for which there is no
                    sufficient demand; and hence the want of the more bulky articles effectually
                    obstructs the trade between the two countries.</p>
                <p>Another evil of this colonial monopoly is, that the colonies supply more sugar
                    than France can consume. But it cannot be sold in other countries at the price
                    which is paid to the colonies by the mother country; and hence it becomes
                    necessary to find out the means of forcing a sale of the surplus which cannot be
                    consumed at home. A bounty is accordingly granted on all sugar exported from
                    France; and in 1831, whilst the duty on the importation of sugar produced
                    L.l,636,030, there was paid back for bounties L.483,951, which is more than one
                    fourth of the gross receipts. The loss which France has incurred since the peace
                    of 1814 by this erroneous system is estimated in Bowring and Villiers’ Report,
                    at L.40,000,000 sterling; and in return for these great sacrifices, the colonies
                    afford but a limited demand for the manufactures of the mother country, as will
                    appear from the following account of the population of the principal colonies,
                    extracted from the colonial budgets.</p>

                <p>The fisheries of France are composed, like our own, of those on the coast and
                    those at a distance, particularly at Newfoundland. All along the north coast of
                    France, the fisheries consist, as on our side of the Channel, of cod, mackerel,
                    herrings, and pilchards. On the shore of the Atlantic, and still more on that of
                    the Mediterranean, are caught great quantities of sardines, a fish of passage,
                    which appears periodically in shoals, like the herring. The tunny, a fish not
                    known in northern latitudes, is found in the Mediterranean in the early part of
                    summer. It varies in weight from ten to twenty-five pounds, and is in like
                    manner caught in shoals. These home fisheries, little calculated for forming
                    seamen, have been left to their natural progress, whilst repeated attempts have
                    been made by government to extend the fishery in America; a design favoured by
                    the early possession by France of Newfoundland and Canada, as well as by the
                    long peace that followed the treaty of Utrecht. Towards the middle of last
                    century the French fisheries in America employed annually about 5000 seamen; but
                    the unsuccessful contest with England in 1756 reduced them greatly, and deprived
                    them of their principal station, Cape Breton. The peace of 1783 was concluded
                    under better auspices. The islands of St Pierre and Miquelon were ceded to
                    France by the treaty of Versailles, and the rights of fishing and of drying fish
                    from the Cape St John to Cape Ray. In the Gulf of St Lawrence her rights were
                    subsequently recognised, by the treaties of 1802 and 1814, at three leagues
                    distance from the coasts belonging to Great Britain; but within the gulf, at a
                    distance of fifteen leagues from Isle Royale, and thirty leagues from New
                    Brunswick.</p>
                <p>For the encouragement of the French fisheries, enormous pecuniary sacrifices have
                    been made. The only time they were ever in a prosperous state was, not when they
                    were protected by the artificial encouragement of the mother country, but when
                    the French colonists, being in possession of a large tract of the American
                    seacoast, were in consequence compelled to trust to prudence and economy alone
                    for the success of their adventures. During the last session of the chamber of
                    deputies, a committee, appointed to inquire into this subject, made their
                    report, in which they state “that the French fishermen have now to compete with
                    those who are always on the spot; who carry on their fishing concerns in small
                    boats, and at a trifling cost; who pay no charge of outfit; who lose no time in
                    voyages; who employ the eneaper labour of children, women, and old persons; who
                    have their drying and salting establishments in the neighbourhood; and who can
                    accommodate all their proceedings to the urgency of circumstances.” It is to
                    counterbalance these advantages that France has resorted to the system of
                    bounties, which has been carried to a great length in order to force the
                    establishment of a trade in the face of natural obstacles. The result of the
                    investigations of the committee was the recommendation to government to grant
                    such a premium to those who adventured in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193516515" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6515-0196"/>fishery as should place them
                    on a level with their more fortunate rivals. In 1816 a bounty was granted of
                    fifty francs per man for the cod fishery, fifteen francs per man for the herring
                    fishery, and twenty-four francs per quintal on the introduction of the fish into
                    the colonies. In 1818 these premiums were raised by royal ordonnances to forty
                    francs per quintal, which is more than 100 per cent, on the value; and the
                    market price of the fish became in consequence a nett profit to the adventurer.
                    This premium was reduced in 1822 to thirty francs per quintal. But a new law was
                    passed in 1832, which is to be valid till 1837, and which allows a premium of
                    fifty francs for every seaman engaged in the cod fishery of St Pierre and
                    Miquelon; thirty francs for each engaged in the fisheries of the Great Bank of
                    Newfoundland, or Iceland; fifteen francs if on the Dogger Bank; and fifty francs
                    in every case if the fish are dried at St Pierre or Miquelon. An additional
                    premium is allowed of twenty-four francs per metrical quintal or cwt. on cod
                    fish shipped from France to the French colonies, thirty francs if shipped direct
                    from the fisheries, twelve francs per quintal if shipped to other ports from
                    France, and ten if direct from the fisheries; also twenty francs per quintal as
                    a premium on cod roes. The effect of these bounties is to place the adventurer
                    in the French fisheries beyond all risk of loss. In many cases they are equal to
                    the whole expense of the outfit, the voyage, and the return; and, though no
                    cargo is brought home, no loss can be incurred. The whole expense and hazard of
                    the trade is thus borne by the public.</p>

                <p>From the above accounts it appears that for the five years previous to 1831 the
                    cod fish caught amounted to 1,223,006 hundredweight, which, estimated at twenty
                    francs per quintal, the price quoted in the French ports, is equal to 24,460,120
                    francs, or L.978,405 sterling; and for this produce France has paid in the shape
                    of bounties 15,158,950 francs, equal to L.606,358 sterling; and if we add seven
                    francs per hundredweight for freight and expenses, it will be found that the
                    produce of the fisheries, which is worth only L.978,405, has cost the French
                    nation between L.l,200,000 and L.1,300,000; besides that the fish are of very
                    inferior quality to those caught by the Americans, the latter selling at
                    forty-seven francs thirty-five cents, per quintal, whilst the French cod fish
                    only brought twenty-six francs ninety-five cents. With all this expense,
                    however, the French fisheries are not adequate to the supply of the colonies,
                    which receive considerable quantities of fish from foreigners, as will be seen
                    from the following table.</p>

                <p>If we contrast the expense and the produce of the British fisheries with those of
                    France, the disadvantages under which the French prosecute this branch of trade
                    will be manifest. It appears that whilst the British only employ in the
                    Newfoundland fishery at the rate of seven men per hundred tons, the average
                    number employed by the French in their different fisheries is nineteen and a
                    half men per hundred tons; and in the report laid before the Chamber of Deputies
                    for 1832, it is stated that the cost of each man employed in the cod fishery
                    amounted, from 1823 to 1825, to 223 francs, in 1829 to 296 francs, in 1830 to
                    440 francs, being about L.17. 12s. sterling, or 6s. 9d. a week, independently of
                    the cost to the owner of the vessel.</p>

                <p>From the above tables it will be seen that the number of British seamen does not
                    amount to a third of the number employed by France, the average being only 2539
                    seamen to 40,220 tons of shipping, while the proportion of French seamen is 6690
                    to 37,036. They catch double the number of fish, and these of a better quality,
                    namely, 966,294 cwts. while the French only take 464,671 cwts. On the whole, it
                    appears that the French risk about seven times the capital in these fisheries
                    for which they could purchase the same supply of fish from foreigners. We
                    subjoin two other tables, the first giving a detail of the state of the French
                    fishery for 1831, and the other a general view of its produce from 1823 to 1831
                    inclusive.</p>

                <p>The whale fishery was established in France in 1784, by means of encouragements
                    held out by Louis XVI. who ordered that no duty should be collected on the
                    articles exported, and that the produce of the fisheries should pay no import
                    duty. He guaranteed the adventurers against loss, and ultimately paid, in
                    addition to 300,000 francs (L.12,500), which he advanced without interest, an
                    additional sum of 160,691 francs (L.6695), being the balance of loss on
                    seventeen voyages. Notwithstanding these encouragements, the whole project was
                    abandoned in 1787. In 1816, the offer of bounties attracted new adventurers into
                    this branch of trade. The premium offered by the government was fifty francs per
                    man, and two thirds of the crews were allowed to be foreigners. In 1819, forty
                    francs were allowed to foreign vessels having a crew half French, fifty francs
                    when the captain and one third of the crew were French; the premium to be
                    doubled if the vessel passed Cape Hom. In 1829, a new ordonnance granted ninety
                    francs per ton on vessels wholly equipped by Frenchmen, forty francs when only
                    two thirds were Frenchmen, and thirty francs if the captain was a foreigner. The
                    premium was doubled if the vessel passed Cape Hom. A supplementary premium was
                    allowed to vessels fishing to the south-east of the Cape of Good Hope, and the
                    double premium was given to all vessels fishing at a higher northern latitude
                    than sixty degrees; and as the fishing is seldom or never prosecuted at a lower
                    latitude, this premium of 180 francs per ton (L.7. 4s.) was invariably paid. The
                    law of 1832, which regulates the whale fishery of France, establishes a bounty
                    of seventy francs per ton from March 1832 to March 1833, if the whole ctew be
                    French; the bounty to be diminished four francs yearly till it reaches
                    fifty-four francs. If one third of the crew be foreigners, the bounty to be
                    forty-eight francs per ton, to diminish two francs yearly till it reaches forty
                    francs per ton. A supplementary bounty to be given of fifty francs per ton if
                    the crew be French, decreasing three francs per annum per ton, and twenty-four
                    francs if one third be foreigners, decreasing one franc per annum, to be paid to
                    vessels doubling Cape Hom, or reaching sixty-two degrees of south latitude, if
                    returning with less than half a cargo, or after an absence of sixteen months;
                    five hundred tons to be the minimum for a single whaler.</p>
                <p>With these extraordinary encouragements, capital was attracted to this new line
                    of industry; and in 1831 three vessels cleared out for the Greenland whale
                    fishery, and thirteen for the South Sea fishery, which employed 6412 tons of
                    shipping, and were manned by 551 men. The following table exhibits the gradual
                    progress of the French whale fishery from 1817:</p>

                <p>It was estimated by the minister of commerce, in his report on this subject to
                    the Chamber of Deputies, that the 550 seamen employed in the whale fishery do
                    not cost the state less than 1,000,000 francs, at the rate of L.72.12s. per man,
                    or L.6 a month. The wages granted by the budget to seamen employed in ships of
                    war amounts to L.l per month; so that the allowance to the seamen employed in
                    the Greenland fishery is six times the ordinary allowance of seamen in the
                    public service. It is remarkable that France was granting these extravagant
                    allowances for the encouragement of the whale fishery exactly at the time that
                    Great Britain was withdrawing the bounties by which she had formerly endeavoured
                    to promote this branch of trade as a nursery for seamen. Yet in 1830 the number
                    of vessels that cleared out for the fishery was 123, consisting of 40,166 tons,
                    navigated by 5044 seamen; being thus about eight times the quantity of tonnage
                    employed by France.</p>
                <p>France seems destined, by the natural advantages which she possesses, to become a
                    maritime power of the first rank. Her sea-coast exceeds in extent that of any
                    other continental state. On the Atlantic she has 130 leagues of coast, 150 on
                    the Channel, and ninety on the Mediterranean; whilst her position between
                    northern and southern Europe, and her numerous ports and navigable rivers, are
                    eminently favourable to the extension of her navigation. But in this, as in all
                    other branches of the French trade, the prejudicial effects of the restrictive
                    system have been abundantly manifest. France, in forcing a trade with her
                    colonies, containing less than half a million of inhabitants, has sacrificed her
                    trade with other tropical countries and their numerous population, to the great
                    injury of her shipping interest; the vessels employed in carrying on her foreign
                    trade having fallen off since 1787, instead of havine increased, as they ought
                    to have done, considering the great advances which have been made since that
                    time in population, in capital, and in productive industry. The following
                    accounts exhibit a view of the changes which have taken place in the shipping of
                    France since the year 1787.</p>

                <p>From the above accounts it will be observed that a very great decline has taken
                    place in the shipping employed in the foreign trade of France, whilst a great
                    increase has taken place in the tonnage employed in the coasting trade; a fact
                    which affords clear and convincing evidence of the extending resources of the
                    country, which would have coually occasioned an increase in the shipping
                    employed in the foreign as well as the domestic trade, if this important branch
                    of industry had not been stunted in its natural growth by the monopolizing
                    system. The navigation of France no doubt suffered grievously during the last
                    war, under the maritime hostility of Britain. But in the course of nearly twenty
                    years it would have recovered from this state of depression, if the natural
                    energies of the country had been allowed free scope in this line of industry.
                    The whole amount of the tonnage employed in the trade between France and Great
                    Britain was, according to French accounts.</p>

                <p>One cause of the slow advances made by the French shipping is, that their ships
                    are manned by so much greater a number of men than those of either Britain or
                    the United States. The British shipping by which the trade between Great Britain
                    and France is carried on amounted in 1830 to 110,766 tons, and they were
                    navigated by 10,029 seamen, being a proportion of nine men for a hundred tons.
                    The whole British shipping employed in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193516580"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-6580-0201"/>the foreign trade outwards amounts to 2,180,042
                    tons, navigated by 122,103 seamen, which gives five and a half seamen for 100
                    tons. Of the French shipping which entered France in 1831, the tonnage employed
                    in the trade with all foreign countries amounted to 372,931 tons, navigated by
                    34,355 men, being a proportion of above nine men for 100 tons. The navigation of
                    the United States is carried on by a proportion of four and one third seamen per
                    100 tons. In the coasting trade of France 1,618,896 tons of shipping were
                    employed in 1831, and 209,831 men, making an average of about thirteen men per
                    100 tons. In the coasting trade of the united kingdom 8,777,921 tons were
                    employed, and 513,109 men, or an average of five and seven eighths men per 100
                    tons. The ship-owners complain that one of the great obstructions to the
                    progress of shipping in France is the high price of iron. The whole shipping of
                    France, they say, consists of 11,000 vessels, in which there are 1,122,000 cwts.
                    of iron. Estimating the annual waste at ten per cent, the iron consumed by the
                    shipping of France will cost 6,283,200 francs (L.261,800 sterling), of which,
                    they say, more than one half is sacrificed to the interests of the iron masters;
                    besides that, the monopoly which they enjoy, and the duty imposed on foreign
                    coals, raise enormously the value of timber, and thus also tend to obstruct the
                    progress of navigation.</p>
                <p>VIIt. RELIGIOUS AND CHARITABLE ESTABLISHMENTS.</p>
                <p>The condition of the church and clergy forms a most important feature in the
                    history and present situation of France. In former times, the Gallican church,
                    without desiring a separation from the holy see, had often advanced a claim to
                    independence, and maintained long and animated discussions, or rather
                    controversies, familiar to those readers of the French annals who have attended
                    to the history of the Jansenists and Molinists. The result of these, and of the
                    general progress of knowledge in France, was an exemption from a part at least
                    of the interference in ecclesiastical affairs, exercised so despotically by the
                    court of Rome in Spain, in Portugal, and in Italy. As to pecuniary means, though
                    the· income of the lower ranks of the clergy was extremely small, the church of
                    France was on the whole richly endowed; the rent of land and houses appropriated
                    to abbeys, priories, bishoprics, archbishoprics, and benefices of every
                    description, being computed at five millions sterling, exclusive of the tithes
                    levied, with more or less strictness, throughout the whole kingdom. As a
                    political body, the French clergy were differently situated from the English,
                    having no voice in legislating, but aiming at, and frequently attaining, the
                    highest offices in the executive government.</p>
                <p>In 1789 a number of the clergy, both in the upper and lower rank«, participated
                    in the general wish for a political reform, and evinced that disposition by
                    their readiness in coalescing with the <hi rend="italic">tiers</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">état,</hi> at a time when the majority frf the noblesse refused to
                    do it, until compelled by the call of the people, and the positive order of the
                    court. In the highly interesting discussions that ensued during the years 1789
                    and 1790, several of the leading orators were Catholic clergymen, nor did they
                    in general take the alarm, until the menacing aspect given to public affairs by
                    the too rapid progress of the Revolution. The National Assembly stripped the
                    church of her lands, and declared them the property of the public, providing,
                    indeed, for the income □f the clergy, but making the payment of it dependent on
                    government All this might have passed and been forgiven in the ardent hopes of
                    national benefit from the Revolution; but the assembly did not stop here.
                    Considering both the court of Rome and the court of France invete-ralely hostile
                    to the Revolution, they determined to detach the clergy from both, and sought to
                    compel their adherence, by imposing on them an oath of fidelity to the new
                    constitution, on ∣&gt;ain of forfeiture of their livings. The sincerity of the
                    clerical body was now put to the test, and ' a striking proof was given of their
                    being actuated by that conscientious feeling for which the public in Protestant
                    countries are so little disposed to give them credit. In every rank, whether
                    prelates, curates, vicars, or the humble <hi rend="italic">desservants,</hi> the
                    majority preferred the hazard of losing their livelihood to taking an oath at
                    variance with their conscience. The violent party continued to triumph at Paris,
                    and the non-conforming clergy had no alternative but to fly their country. Hence
                    the clouds of emigrants who, in 1791 and 1792, sought refuge in Italy, Germany,
                    and, above all, in England. Those who remained in France were exposed to all the
                    atrocities of the Jacobins. Hundreds of them were sacrificed in the massacres of
                    September 1792, and hundreds more were brought to the guillotine in the dreadful
                    years 1793 and 1794. With the fall of Robespierre (July 1794) the executions
                    ceased; but a tone of hostility to the church was still kept up, and accounted
                    an indispensable part of the policy of the revolutionary government. The only
                    class allowed to remain in quiet were the <hi rend="italic">curés,</hi> whose
                    humble station and scattered position created no political alarm. It was not
                    till the established sway of Bonaparte (in 1801) that circumstances admitted of
                    cooler calculation, and enabled that skilful usurper to seek in a hierarchy a
                    prop to his own power, and an engine of opposition to the liberal party, which
                    still hoped to secure to France advantages from the Revolution. With this view
                    he affected great respect for the Catholic church, concluded a concordat with
                    the pope, and made a pecuniary provision for a specified number of sees. His
                    next step was to frame and circulate throughout all France a catechism,
                    calculated to impress the rising generation with a profound veneration for a
                    sovereign who had been “anointed by the pope, and received his mission from the
                    Almighty.” The power of Bonaparte received in this manner a most substantial
                    support, and would have taken deep root with the lower orders, had he not
                    counteracted it by his subsequent quarrel with the pope, which assumed an angry
                    aspect in 1809, and became more and more aggravated during the remainder of his
                    reign.</p>
                <p>On the restoration of the Bourbons in 1814, the Catholic clergy hailed the change
                    with enthusiasm; but the public, at least the great majority of the middling
                    classes, soon showed a marked distinction between their cause and that of the
                    king. The conduct of Louis in regard to the clergy was marked by moderation and
                    judgment. Religious himself, he sought to revive similar impressions among his
                    subjects, to enforce the observance of the Lord’s day, and to relieve from
                    indigence the <hi rend="italic">desservants</hi> or country curates. But he
                    placed no clergymen in political situations, nor made any attempt to give the
                    bishops or archbishops seats in the House of Peers.</p>
                <p>A concordat or compact between the pope and the king ( is a transaction of high
                    importance in a Catholic country, where the public are impressed with the
                    belief, that in all that relates to religion, reference ought to be had to the
                    court of Rome, and that their temporal sovereign possesses authority in such
                    affairs only as far as it is delegated by the holy father. The object of a
                    concordat is to define the respective powers of the pope and king. In France the
                    aim of the executive government has long been to secure the patronage of the
                    church, and to stipulate that no bulls, briefs, decrees, or other acts of a
                    nature to agitate the public mind, should be promulgated without the royal
                    sanction. Three centuries ago, when the alarm of the Reformation, and some
                    urgent political considerations, made it of importance to the court of Rome to
                    attach to its cause the reigning sovereign of France, there was passed between
                    Leo X. and Francis I. a concordat, declaring that <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193516593" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6593-0202"/>the power of nominating the
                    archbishops and bishops of France resided in the crown, the sanction of the pope
                    being required only for their inauguration <hi rend="italic"
                    >(institution</hi><hi rend="italic">canonique).</hi> This compact was considered
                    a kind of charter or standard document in the long discussions which afterwards
                    ensued about the independence of the Gallican church, until the whole sunk into
                    insignificance before the storm of the Revolution. During the ferment of that
                    convulsion, the Jacobins, and even the Directory, made no proposition for
                    accommodation with the holy see, and bade, or affected to bid, it defiance.
                    Bonaparte, more politic, concluded a concordat, which, though it reinstated only
                    fifty of the 130 sees existing.before the Revolution, stamped him in some
                    measure a restorer of the church. That he did not afterwards augment their
                    number, is to be accounted for solely by a dread of alarming the revolutionists.
                    The Bourbons, on their restoration, appear to have felt all the delicacy of such
                    a measure; and nothing favours the probability of the charge of their intending
                    to restore the lands, the tithes, or temporal influence of the clergy.
                    Negotiations for a concordat were early begun with the court of Rome, but its
                    conclusion was delayed till 1817; and the interest with which it was received in
                    France can be comprehended only by persons resident among a people still
                    agitated by political division, and dreading the influence of the clergy as an
                    engine for the revival of all past abuses. From this, and from differences with
                    the court of Rome that are foreign to our subject, the execution of the new
                    concordat has been very tardy. Of the forty-two additional sees appointed by it,
                    a considerable part are still vacant.</p>
                <p>The prelates of the church of France are as follows:— Cardinals, at present five
                    in number, with an annual income of nearly L.1300 sterling.</p>
                <p>18 archbishops, average income about 800</p>
                <p>74 bishops, do. about 600</p>
                <p>The next in rank are the vicars-general, to the number of more than a hundred;
                    and the chanoines or canons, who also exceed a hundred; after which come the <hi
                    rend="italic">curés</hi> or established curates, in number nearly 3000, and
                    divided into three classes (first, second, and third), with incomes of only
                    L.40, L.50, or L.60, but with certain emoluments, from surplus fees, which vary
                    according to the population of their respective districts. Lastly come the <hi
                    rend="italic">desservants,</hi> or acting curates, of whom there is one in
                    almost every country <hi rend="italic">commune</hi> or parish in the kingdom,
                    amounting in all to above 2⅛000, but with incomes of only between L.20 and L.30
                    a year; a pittance equal to about L.40 in England, but still too small to
                    provide for even the limited wante of a state of celibacy. There are also a
                    number of <hi rend="italic">succursales,</hi> or chapels, appended to large
                    parishes; but of these a considerable number (at present about 2000) are vacant
                    from want of funds, bad repairs of the building, and other causes. These various
                    appointments are all paid out of the public treasury. The expense of the
                    Catholic church to the nation is L.l, 100,000 sterling a year; but as there are
                    other heads of disbursement, particularly salaries to Protestant ministers, the
                    total ecclesiastical charge is about L.1,300,000.</p>
                <p>The nomination of all clergymen, whether Catholic or Protestant, is vested in the
                    crown. As to political feeling, the Catholic clergy are, almost without
                    exception, hostile to the interests produced by the Revolution, and attached to
                    the Bourbons.</p>
                <p>Female convents have all along existed in France, with the exception of a few
                    years of the worst part of the Revolution, when their inmates were obliged to
                    forsake their establishments, and to seek an abode with their relations.
                    Monasteries are, with very few exceptions, abolished, and no idea is entertained
                    of re-establishing the abbeys, priories, and other endowed establishments; the
                    Bourbons and the court of Rome having repeatedly pledged themselves not to
                    disturb the revolutionary purchasers of the church-lands, and to appropriate to
                    ecclesiastical purposes only that proportion of these lands that remains unsold.
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi></p>
                <p>What, it may be asked, have been the effects of the Revolution on the state of
                    religion in France? It has subverted the power of the church, and, what is much
                    more; serious, the belief of Christianity in the minds of the young ι and the
                    middle-aged of the male part of the population; but with the elders of that sex,
                    and with almost all females, the Catholic creed preserves undiminished sway; a
                    sway which extends much farther than can readily be conceived by Protestants.
                    The extent of this influence is owing to various causes; in part to commendable
                    conduct in the clergy, who in general act the part of careful pastors, and
                    attentive visitors in sickness or distress; but in part also to that blind
                    credulity with which the tenets of the church are received both by the hearers
                    and their spiritual guides, whose education has by no means kept pace with the
                    general progress of knowledge; for it does not embrace the philosophical course
                    of the universities of France, but ia conducted in separate seminaries, and upon
                    a much more confined plan.</p>
                <p>The Protestants in France amount to above 2,000,000, and are most numerous in the
                    south, particularly at Nismes' and its vicinity. They are almost all adherents
                    of the Revolution; and a political change, such as that which twice took place
                    in 1815, could not be accomplished in a divided community without a contest; but
                    the alarm which was then so loudly raised in England in their behalf was founded
                    on exaggeration. The Bourbon government received with attention the applications
                    of the Protestants, whether for increase of pastors or repair of churches. On
                    the whole, the Protestants of France form an industrious and valuable portion of
                    the population; but they are animated by a strong <hi rend="italic"
                    >esprit</hi><hi rend="italic">de secte,</hi> by a feeling approaching to
                    animosity towards the Catholics; and have all along evinced considerable
                    distrust of the reinstated government.</p>
                <p>Before the Revolution the poor in France, as in Italy ι and other Catholic
                    countries, were supported chiefly by the <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> abbeys,
                    priories, or other beneficed establishments. On ’ the absorption of these
                    sources of income by the revolutionary government, a provision for the poor
                    became a subject of legislative inquiry; and, after long investigation, it was
                    decidedly determined to avoid a poor-rate on the English plan, but to provide
                    for the aged and helpless an annual fund to the proposed amount of L.2,000,000
                    sterling. Several years elapsed before this was acted on, and the fund
                    eventually provided consisted of a revival of part of the old <hi rend="italic"
                    >octrois,</hi> or dues levied on wine, cider, spirits, and other articles of
                    consumption, on their entrance into towns; a tax from which the Revolution had
                    relieved the public, and which was now disguised under the specious name of <hi
                    rend="italic">octroi</hi><hi rend="italic">de bienfaisance.</hi> These dues,
                    however, were soon extended and applied to the general expenditure of the
                    government, after retaining a portion, which at present constitutes the only
                    regular fund for the poor. Further sums are collected by subscription in the
                    depth of winter, or on the occurrence of extraordinary distress. From the public
                    treasury, likewise, there are made occasional issues, in a season of hardship,
                    on the application of the mayors or local magistrates. There are at Paris a
                    number of hospitals, of which by far the largest is the. Hôtel Dieu. In the
                    provincial cities there are in general two hospitals for the poor, one for the
                    sick, the other for the aged. Of other charitable institutions, the principal
                    are the <hi rend="italic">sociétés de charité maternelle,</hi> or associations
                    on a large scale, at Paris and some of the chief towns, for the aid of indigent
                    women in child-bed. Mendicity is not restricted in France, and prevails in many
                    places to a reprehensible degree.</p>

                <p>IX. ESTABLISHMENTS FOR EDUCATION.</p>
                <p>The organization or framework of the system of public instruction in France is
                    one of the happiest applications which has yet been made of the principle of
                    centralization. It is due to the genius of Napoleon. In 1808 he promulgated his
                    decree for establishing the University of France, the provisions of which, being
                    full of the wisdom and foresight so characteristic of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >civil</hi> acts,-have engrafted themselves on the institutions of the country,
                    and, with a few slight modifications suggested by experience or by the course of
                    events, are now in full operation, and producing the happiest effects. By this
                    decree the establishments for education throughout France, whether endowed or
                    not, from the village school, through all the gradations of grammar schools,
                    academies, and colleges, up to the faculties and universities, were comprehended
                    under one great central administration, called <hi rend="italic">l’</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Université impériale</hi> (now <hi rend="italic">Royale)</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de France.</hi> The term <hi rend="italic">University,</hi>
                    therefore, in the sense first introduced by Napoleon, and now naturalized and
                    generally adopted in France, does not describe, as in Britain and elsewhere, an
                    institution for liberal education, but a branch of the administration or
                    government of the state. It has, nevertheless, so much of the nature of a
                    corporate body, that it possesses large disposable funds of its own, consisting,
                    partly of real property, partly of pecuniary endowment secured on the public
                    revenue, and partly of the produce of a tax levied on every institution for
                    educating the children of the wealthier classes, which is called <hi
                    rend="italic">retribution</hi><hi rend="italic">universitaire.</hi> All
                    professors, public teachers, and schoolmasters are necessarily members of this
                    vast body, called the University, the control and direction of which reside in
                    the following authorities:</p>
                <p>1. The grand master, who is also minister of public instruction, with a sèat in
                    the cabinet. At the moment we write (September 1834) Μ. Guizot holds this
                    important office, in virtue of which he not only appoints all the officers of
                    university administration, but fills up all the vacancies in colleges and
                    schools, only, however, upon the recommendation of the inferior local
                    authorities, and after rigorous examinations and comparative trials by them.</p>
                <p>2. The second university authority is the royal council of public instruction,
                    composed of ten members, selected from the names most eminent in the various
                    branches of science and literature. They hold their sittings in Paris, and are
                    generally distinguished members of the Institute, as at present, for example,
                    Villemain, Cousin, Orfila, Thénard, &amp;c. This council, with the grand master
                    <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi> president, is the fountain-head of authority,
                    and the supreme court of appeal in all that regards education. Their province is
                    to suggest and sanction improvements in the method of teaching; to direct and
                    superintend the compilation of books to put into the hands of youth, and to see
                    that they be adopted in schools and colleges; to judge and remove incompetent
                    teachers, upon the reports of general inspectors; in short, to watch over the
                    concerns and interests of public instruction in all its branches.</p>
                <p>3. The University, or, in other words, the whole territory of France, as far as
                    regards the purposes of education, is divided into <hi rend="italic">twenty-six
                    academies,</hi> each comprehending three or more departments; for the term <hi
                    rend="italic">academy,</hi> like <hi rend="italic">university</hi> itself, no
                    longer designates a local institution for the training of youth, but a certain
                    territorial extent of educational jurisdiction. In the central town of each
                    academy resides a rector, whose business it is to superintend all the schools,
                    colleges, and faculties within the departments which form his district, to
                    promote their moral and intellectual improvement, to collect the reporta of the
                    inspectors who are employed to visit and examine all plates of education under
                    his jurisdiction, to transmit the result to the central administration at Paris,
                    and to serve as the organ of communication with the minister of public
                    instruction. He is assisted and controlled in the exercise of his functions by
                    an academical council of ten, who are, partly official persons connected with
                    the university, with the department, and with the municipality, and partly
                    respectable inhabitants of the town which is the seat of the academy. This
                    council stands in the same relation to the academy as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >conseil</hi><hi rend="italic">royal</hi> at Paris does to the university,
                    except that in most cases an appeal lies to the latter from the decisions of the
                    former.</p>
                <p>4. Attached to the <hi rend="italic">conseil</hi><hi rend="italic">royal</hi> are
                    ten inspectors-ge-nerał of the university. Amongst these France is divided into
                    ten districts, each of which is visited once a year by a different inspector,
                    who makes a survey of the principal establishments, controls their
                    administration, and reports to the minister of public instruction.</p>
                <p>Besides these inspectors, who are the agents of the central administration, each
                    rector has, acting under him, two or more <hi rend="italic">inspecteurs</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d’</hi><hi rend="italic">academie,</hi> who examine more minutely
                    every primary school or college within the limits of his jurisdiction, and
                    report to him on the general condition of the establishments, on the progress of
                    the pupils, and on the conduct and character of the teachers.</p>
                <p>Such is the general constitution of the administrative body by which appointments
                    are made, abuses prevented or remedied, the finance department conducted, and
                    the general efficiency of the system of practical instruction secured. With
                    regard to that system itself, the constituent parts of the great <hi
                    rend="italic">corps</hi><hi rend="italic">enseignant</hi> may be thus
                    enumerated, beginning with the highest:</p>
                <p>1. First, then, we have <hi rend="italic">les facultés;</hi> a term which has
                    superseded the use of the word <hi rend="italic">université</hi> in its local
                    and separate meaning, and which corresponds to the Scottish use of the words
                    college and university. The faculties in France are reckoned five; that of the
                    sciences, mathematical and physical, of letters, of law, of medicine, and of
                    theology; and all these faculties, with their complement of professors, a dean
                    at the head of each, and a resort of students more or less numerous, are found
                    established in eight different towns of France, which in Scotland we should call
                    seats of universities. They are the following: Paris, Caen, Toulouse, Strasburg,
                    Dijon, Poitiers, Rennes, and Metz.</p>
                <p>It is by the faculties alone that degrees can be conferred, and these degrees are
                    of three kinds: Bachelor’s <hi rend="italic">(le baccalauréat),</hi> which
                    cannot be obtained before sixteen years of age; licentiate’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >(la licence),</hi> which presupposes the former, and at least one additional
                    year of age and study; and doctor’s degree <hi rend="italic">(le doctorat),</hi>
                    granted to licentiates when still further advanced in age and acquirement.</p>
                <p>2. Subordinate to the faculties, and intended to be a preparation for them, are
                    the colleges; institutions which resemble a good deal those known by the same
                    name in England, when the term College is applied, not to the universities, but
                    to the schools of Eton, Harrow, Westminster, &amp;c. The French <hi
                    rend="italic">colleges</hi> are either royal or communal. Of the former there
                    are at present thirty-nine, of the latter 320. Of these 320, by far the greater
                    number are in a very imperfect and inefficient state; and the minister Guizot
                    has announced his intention of bringing in a bill to put them on a better
                    footing. In many of the <hi rend="italic">colleges</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >royaux,</hi> such as those of Caen and of Rouen, the work of reformation is
                    already begun, by having conjoined with the old course of instruction, which was
                    too exclusively classical, what are called <hi rend="italic">cours
                    spéciaux,</hi> in history both natural and civil, in mathematics and physics,
                    and in geography and modern languages.</p>
                <p>3. The third and lowest stage of national instruction is that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">écoles primaires,</hi> corresponding to our parochial and village
                    schools. The law of the 28th of June 1833 has new-moddled and added greatly both
                    to the number <pb break="no" facs="nls:193516619" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6619-0204"
                    />and value of the <hi rend="italic">écoles primaires.</hi> It ordains that
                    there shall be a school in every one of the 37,187 <hi rend="italic"
                    >communes</hi> or parishes into which France is divided; and this ordinance is
                    advancing rapidly to its full accomplishment.</p>
                <p>Still more important and commendable are the provisions contained in this
                    memorable law, for making the course of instruction in these schools, and the
                    methods of imparting it, such as to bestow on the great mass of the population
                    that amount of religious, moral, and intellectual training which is best adapted
                    to their condition in life and the duties they have to discharge. This law
                    provides also for a somewhat fuller and more comprehensive education of the
                    children of the middle class and wealthy burghers in considerable towns, by
                    ordaining that in every commune which contains above 6000 souls (the number of
                    these in France is 273) there shall be an <hi rend="italic">école primaire
                    supérieure,</hi> corresponding to and borrowed from the Burger-or Mittel-schule
                    of Germany, in which a considerable extension is given to the list of subjects
                    taught in the primary schools. Of these schools, intermediate between the
                    primary schools and the colleges, forty-five had been established at the date of
                    March 1834.</p>
                <p>The educational system of France, as we have briefly sketched it, may be
                    considered as now happily established, with a fairer prospect of success, and
                    less risk of failure, than in any former attempt in that country. This result is
                    rendered probable, above all, by two other parts of the system, which deserve
                    particular mention, on account of their tendency to give permanence and
                    efficiency to any system whatever of national instruction. One of these is the
                    <hi rend="italic">école normale,</hi> established at Paris by Napoleon in 1808,
                    for the purpose of maintaining 300 pupils, and training them not only to great
                    acquirements in literature and science, but to the art of communicating their
                    knowledge to others in an attractive and interesting form, and thus to become
                    able regents in the <hi rend="italic">collèges royaux,</hi> and professors in
                    the faculties. None are admitted into this institution who are under the age of
                    seventeen complete, and who have not distinguished themselves in the previous
                    stages of their education. The pupils are divided into two sections, that of the
                    sciences and that of letters, and remain three years in the one or the other.
                    The first two years are employed in confirming and extending their acquirements
                    by a rigorous and effectual discipline under the best professors and teachers
                    that Paris can afford. During the last year they are regarded as future teachers
                    or professors, and trained particularly, both by theory and practice, to the art
                    of communicating instruction.</p>
                <p>The other security we spoke of is an extension and application of this noble
                    conception of Napoleon, so as to embrace a preparatory course of discipline for
                    the teachers of the primary schools. This idea, though originated and even acted
                    upon long before the revolution of 1830, never was followed out with energy and
                    effect till after that event, and above all since Μ. Guizot was minister. Even
                    so late as 1828 there existed only three <hi rend="italic">écoles normales
                    primaires,</hi> as these seminaries for schoolmasters are called. According to
                    the last account rendered to the king and the chambers by Μ. Guizot in April
                    1834, sixty-two of these seminaries were in full activity, providing able and
                    accomplished teachers for the primary schools of no less than seventy-three out
                    of the eighty-six departments of France; and there can be no doubt that in a
                    very short time the law of 1833, which ordains that there shall be a normal
                    school in every department, will be executed to the letter.</p>
                <p>When this and all the other measures, either actually voted by the chambers or
                    contemplated by the minister, for giving effect to the system of public
                    instruction which has been described above, shall have received their full and
                    final accomplishment, and shall have taken root universally in the habits of the
                    people, we may congratulate France on possessing the strongest of all securities
                    for good government, and against the recurrence of revolutionary changes.</p>
                <p>X. ESTABLISHMENTS FOR THE PURPOSES OF WAR.</p>
                <p>The French army first assumed a regular form under Henry IV.; but its peace
                    establishment, including both horse and foot, did not then exceed 10,000 men,
                    whilst the whole charge for the war department, including ordnance and half pay,
                    was L.500,000. In 1610 Henry carried his army to a war establishment of 40,000
                    men. In 1640, under the able administration of Richelieu, France took an active
                    part in the war of Germany, carrying her force at one time to 100,000 men, and
                    her expenditure to the then unexampled sum of I..4,000,000 sterling in one year.
                    In 1659, Louis XIV., already full of ambitious projects, kept up a peace
                    establishment of 70,000 men; and the war of 1672 having brought Germany,
                    Holland, and Spain, into the field against France, the force of the latter
                    country was carried to the number of 160,000 men. From 1679 to 1688 there was
                    peace; but Louis passed the interval in preparing for war, and the introduction
                    of the funding system now enabled France, England, and Holland, to surpass all
                    their former exertions. The contest begun in 1688 required on the part of France
                    a force of between 200,000 and 300,000 men. The peace of Utrecht gave a long
                    repose to exhausted France, and the war of 1741 did not, until conducted in its
                    advanced stage by Marshal Saxe, call forth a military force equal to that of
                    Louis XIV. In the war of 1756 the French army was less numerous, and far less
                    ably commanded. During the continental peace of thirty years (from 1762 to 1792)
                    its establishment was kept, with little fluctuation, at 100,000 men.</p>

                    only 140,000 men; but this was speedily augmented by the compulsory levies of
                    February 1793, and by the still more comprehensive operation of the re-,
                    quisition in September. The republican spirit was now at its height, and the
                    unlimited issue of assignats led to. the maintenance of a force hitherto
                    unexampled in the. annals of any country, ancient or modern. In 1794, the
                    Frenchmen in <hi rend="italic">actual service</hi> in the Netherlands, on the
                    Rhine, in Piedmont, the Pyrenees, and La Vendée, appear to have amounted to
                    between 500,000 and 600,000; a force which, though imperfectly disciplined and
                    officered, baffled the greatest confederacy that had at that time been formed in
                    Europe. In 1795 the assignats lost their efficacy, and France was obliged to
                    reduce her army by a third; but its discipline was now greatly improved. During
                    the campaigns of 1795, 1796, and 1797, as well as in those of 1799 and 1800, the
                    force maintained by France and Holland was between 300,000 and 400,000. At the
                    peace of Amiens, Bonaparte kept up a peace establishment of 300,000 men; and
                    after the renewal of war it was raised to 400,000 ,∙<note anchored="true"

                    united arms of Austria and Russia. His annual levy of French conscripts, though
                    apparently only 80,000, amounted (see Declaration of the Minister at War, 18th
                    September 1809) to 100,000; a supply which, joined to the recruits of his allies
                    in Germany and Italy, kept up his numbers, and even increased them,
                    notwithstanding the wasteful campaigns of 1806 and 1807 in Poland, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193516632" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6632-0205"/> followed by the
                    no lees wasteful campaigns of Spain. In 1812 the force of France and her allies
                    reached their <hi rend="italic">maximum,</hi> Bonaparte having led against the
                    Russian empire a mass of360,000 men, whilst there remained in Spain, Germany,
                    and France, a number which carried the aggregate to between 500,000 and 600,000.
                    Need we then wonder that, even after the almost total loss of his troops in
                    Russia, there remained a force competent, with the aid of fresh levies, to
                    withstand the efforts of the allies during two campaigns?</p>
                <p>In 1815 Bonaparte, in returning from Elba, found under arms in France about
                    120,000 men, all of whom, with the exception of a few thousands, rejoined his
                    standard. But so sick were the French of war, that the greatest efforts during
                    the next three months added only 60,000 to this number, and the loss of one
                    battle exposed all the hopelessness of resistance to the allies.</p>
                <p>On the second restoration of the Bourbons in 1815, the army had fallen into a
                    very disorganized state, the disciplined soldiers being dispersed, and the ranks
                    slowly filled by new levies. This led to the legislative act of the 10th March
                    1818, which revived the conscription, but in a mitigated form, and allowing a
                    great latitude in providing substitutes. A recurrence to this method of raising
                    levies was held to be the only effectual method of filling the ranks with men of
                    steady habits; for the army in France, never a receptacle for the refuse of the
                    populace, has in general been composed of young peasantry and labourers of good
                    character. Such was its constitution in the war of the Revolution, and its
                    discipline was exemplary, until Bonaparte adopted the unprincipled practice of
                    making war without magazines, and obliged the soldiers to live at free auarters
                    on the inhabitants. The new conscription is indeed greatly modified, the numbers
                    annually required being limited to 40,000, and the term of service to six years;
                    still the measure is compulsory, and falls heavily on the middle and lower
                    classes; the alternative for a youth, when drawn, being either to give up his
                    intended profession, or to pay L.4O or L.50 for a substitute. In 1832, the
                    French army amounted to 411,816 men, including 19,036 officers and 3794
                    children. The infantry, including the guards, amounts to 264,141 men, including
                    9505 officers; the cavalry, consisting of various denominations of chasseurs,
                    dragoons, cuirassiers, and hussars, to 51,235 men, including 2805 officers; and
                    the artillery to 32,594 men, including 1190 officers; besides gendarmerie,
                    engineers, &amp;c.; the latter being a numerous and well educated body of
                    officers.</p>

                    rend="italic">de camp.</hi> There are on full pay twice as many officers as are
                    necessary for the duty; but the number of half-pay officers exceeds all
                    proportion; for this part of Bonaparte’s vast machine has remained, whilst most
                    of the private soldiers have sunk tranquilly into the occupations of the lower
                    classes.</p>
                <p>Promotion in the French army never takes place by purchase, and not often by
                    special order; seniority at present determines more than half the appointments,
                    a course which, whilst it renders promotion extremely slow, will eventually give
                    employment to almost all the half-pay officers. Of the soldiers in service,
                    there is still a part of the army of Bonaparte, but the majority are recent
                    levies.</p>
                <p>Of the military seminaries of France, the one of highest repute is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ecole Polytechnique</hi><hi rend="italic">,∙</hi> a school for the
                    instruction of young men in mathematics, and drawing for the engineer and
                    artillery corps. None but candidates of talent are admitted; and it is well
                    entitled to the name of a nursery <hi rend="italic">(pépinière)</hi> of
                    intelligent officers.</p>
                <p>The charge to government of a foot soldier in France does not, in time of peace,
                    exceed L.20 a year; that of the cavalry soldier is nearly double. The pay for
                    either officer or soldier is little more than half the rate in England, and its
                    inadequacy is much complained of. The whole charge of the war department under
                    Bonaparte was about L.20,000,000 sterling. In the year 1833 it amounted to
                    L.8,564,470.</p>
                <p>The gendarmerie are not a part of the regular army, but a corps charged with the
                    police duty, and scattered in small divisions throughout all France; their total
                    number, including officers, is 18,000. The <hi rend="italic">gardes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nationales</hi> correspond to our yeomanry and volunteers; and
                    every town of consequence has a con&gt;s of this description.</p>
                <p>The chief fortifications of France, on the side of Flanders, are the well-known
                    towns of Lisle, Valenciennes, Condé, and Douai; on the side of the Alps, Embrum,
                    Grenoble, and Antibes; on the side of the Pyrenees, Perpignan, Bellegarde,
                    Mont-Louis, and Bayonne. The fortified sea-ports are Brest, Toulon, Cherbourg,
                    Rochefort, and Boulogne. France is, without question, the first military power
                    on the Continent, being nearly equal to Russia in population, and greatly
                    superior in pecuniary resources, as well as in the intelligence of the
                    individuals who compose her army.</p>
                <p>The superiority of the English navy over the French existed in ages when our
                    pecuniary means were far inferior; and though, during the middle of the reign of
                    Louis XIV. the French, by financial sacrifices, obtained a numerical
                    superiority, one great battle, that of La Hogue, in 1692, was sufficient to
                    restore our ascendency. The war of 1741, however successful on the part of
                    France by land, was, particularly towards its close, unfortunate to her at sea.
                    In the succeeding interval of peace, great efforts were made to reinstate the
                    French navy; but the war of 1756 proved doubly disastrous, and at last swept it
                    almost entirely from the ocean. A very different scene opened in the war of
                    1778, when France, unembarrassed by a continental struggle, was enabled to
                    direct all her disposable resources to her marine. She was then enabled to keep
                    in an effective state about seventy sail of the line, the crews of which, added
                    to those of the frigates and corvettes, formed a total of 60,000 seamen. The
                    blows given to this force by our navy, towards the end of the war, were repaired
                    with great diligence in the peace; and to prepare young officers for the sea in
                    preference to the land service, became a favourite object in several of the
                    government schools. In 1791, an official report stated the effective French navy
                    at seventy-four sail of the line, sixty-two frigates, and twenty-nine corvettes;
                    a state of preparation which accounts for the resistance made to our navy by the
                    revolutionary government under all the disadvantages of an unparalleled
                    continental struggle. This proud force, however, disappeared progressively at
                    the capture of Toulon, the victory of the 1st June 1794, and still more in the
                    victory of Aboukir; so that Bonaparte, on his accession to power, found the
                    French marine in a very reduced state. He laboured, however, to reinstate it;
                    the years of continental peace, 1801, 1802, 1803, and 1804, were favourable to
                    his efforts; and in 1805 he boasted of having in equipment sixty sail of the
                    line, a force destined to an early diminution at Trafalgar and St Domingo. The
                    Bourbons, on recovering their crown, found little more than half the force which
                    existed previously to the Revolution. It has since been augmented, and in 1831
                    it amounted to thirty-five ships of the line, forty frigates, twenty-three
                    corvettes, fifty-seven brigs, twenty-nine<pb break="no" facs="nls:193516645"

                    twelve steam-boats, sixteen armed store-ships, thirty-two armed transports, two
                    yachts; total, two hundred and eighty-ſour. There were at the same time building
                    twenty ships of the line, twenty-six frigates, seven corvettes, ten brigs of
                    seventeen guns, five steam-boats, nine store-ships; total, seventy-seven. Other
                    three ships of the line, two frigates, three corvettes, and five steam-boats,
                    were put on the stocks in 1832.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>XI. REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE.</p>
                <p>In France the ancient system of taxation and finance was extremely unequal and
                    oppressive. Her various provinces, though they were united under one head,
                    retained nevertheless many of their own peculiar laws and privileges, which were
                    absurd in themselves, and were, besides, opposed to the general interests of the
                    empire. Amongst these privileges was an exemption from certain imposts, to which
                    some were subjected, and consequently over-taxed; and others, again, contributed
                    a certain quota of revenue to government, which they raised by taxes imposed by
                    their own local authorities. The consequence was, that no uniform system of
                    taxation could be established throughout the country. The taxes on many
                    commodities were higher in one province than in another; and customhouses were
                    accordingly established on their respective frontiers, to prevent the
                    importation of goods until they had paid the duties. In this manner, owing to
                    the inequality of taxation, commodities could not freely pass from one district
                    of the country to another; and the kingdom was thus broken into separate
                    divisions, to the great interruption of trade. The partiality shown to the
                    privileged orders was another serious grievance in the ancient system of French
                    taxation. The taxes by which the public revenue was raised were, first, the <hi
                    rend="italic">taille,</hi> a tax on real property, or on income derived from
                    commerce and industry. From this tax the lands of the noblesse and clergy were
                    exempt. Secondly, the <hi rend="italic">vingtième</hi> was a tax of one
                    twentieth on property, from which the clergy alone were exempted. Thirdly, a
                    poll tax was levied on all classes indiscriminately. Many of the taxes were
                    farmed by rich capitalists, who paid annually into the treasury a fixed sum, and
                    collected the taxes from the people. Those ſarmers-general held the monopoly of
                    the manufacture and sale of tobacco and salt; and also the <hi rend="italic"
                    >octroi,</hi> which was a duty on all articles entering Paris. The power
                    delegated to these contractors was the source of grievous oppression to the
                    people. The duties called <hi rend="italic">aides</hi> were imposed on
                    spirituous liquors and other articles of consumption; they also included duties
                    on all articles wrought in gold or silver, on wrought iron, playing cards,
                    leather, paper, starch, &amp;c. These duties were levied by collectors for the
                    behoof of government. The <hi rend="italic">corvée,</hi> which consisted in so
                    many days’ labour annually, of men, horses, oxen, carriages, &amp;c. was
                    nominally applicable to the maintenance of roads. The tax was payable either in
                    money or in labour. This system of taxation, so prejudicial to internal
                    commerce, was to a certain extent reformed by Colbert, the minister of Louis
                    XIV., who, though his views in regard to the principles of commerce were narrow
                    and illiberal, yet improved in many particulars the system of taxation, by
                    rendering it more uniform, and thus breaking down the barriers which obstructed
                    the free intercourse between the different provinces. Under his administra tion
                    the public revenue of France amounted in 1682 to L.5,000,000.</p>
                <p>The long and expensive wars of Louis XIV. produced a great accumulation of debt
                    (nearly L. 100,000,000 sterling), which, after his death, was lessened by an
                    appeal to a singular privilege, of which advantage has often been taken in
                    France, viz. that a new sovereign is not bound to pay the debts of his
                    predecessor in full. During the eighteenth century the revenue of France
                    increased progressively, but more slowly than that of England; the vicious
                    system of farming the taxes still continued. Neckar, appointed to office in
                    1776, sought to teach the French court the value of publicity in financial
                    statements, and exhibited the rare example of a war conducted for several years
                    witlκ&gt;ut new taxes, the supplies being found by loans, the interest of which
                    was provided for by successive retrenchments in the public expenditure. His
                    successor, Μ. de Calonne, pursued a very different course, and was found
                    altogether incapable of the measures necessary to remedy an annual deficiency of
                    L.2,000,000, which now took place. The revenue of France was then about
                    L.22,000,t)00 sterling. The sum required for payment of the interest of the
                    public debt was nearly L.10,000,000,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    other public expenses.</p>
                <p>Such was the state of the French finances at the era of the Revolution of 1789,
                    which was followed by invasion on the frontier, and in the interior by all the
                    confusion consequent on the reign of terror. In this era of confiscation and
                    judicial murder, the national debt could hardly be respected. It was not,
                    however, openly cancelled, but the interest was issued in assignats of no value
                    except for purchases of national property. At last, in 1798, on an approximation
                    to regularity in the management of public business, there was passed a law,
                    declaring that one third of the old national debt should be sacred, and the
                    interest on it payable in <hi rend="italic">bons,</hi> or paper receivable in
                    discharge of taxes. This third was called <hi rend="italic">la tiers</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">provisoire,</hi> but its price in the market continued very low
                    until Bonaparte succeeded to power, and placed Gaudin, afterwards Duke of Gaeta,
                    at the head of the treasury, when means were found to redeem the stocks from
                    their depression, and to resume the payment of the dividends in cash. The amount
                    of the revenue was greatly impaired by the general confusion of the Revolution.
                    In 1799 the expenditure exceeded the receipt by L.8,000,000 sterling.<note

                    subsequent years both received a progressive augmentation, and in 1813 the
                    revenue derived from France, exclusive of conquered territory, was about
                    L.27,000,000. On the restoration of the Bourbons in 1814, the public debt,
                    funded and unfunded, did not exceed L. 123,000,000;<note anchored="true"

                    interest L.7,000,000 France had thus a fair prospect of financial prosperity,
                    when the return of Bonaparte, and a second invasion by the allied troops,
                    overthrew public credit, and produced a national loss and a general derangement
                    of trade. 11 has been estimated that the return of Napoleon from Elba which led
                    to the second invasion of France by the allied troops, occasioned a loss to the
                    country of 4,000,000,00( of francs. The direct loss, which included the expenser
                    paid to the allied powers, and those incurred by the main tenance of their
                    armies, placed in cantonments through <pb break="no" facs="nls:193516658"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-6658-0207"/>out France, may be estimated; but the indirect
                    evila occasioned by the ravages inseparable from the invasion of a hostile army,
                    by the confusion and derangement of all commercial relations, and the
                    impossibility of collecting the revenue in such a time of trouble, cannot be
                    summed up in money. At the same time there are scarcely any national
                    difficulties which may not be overcome by the energies and industry of a free
                    and intelligent people such as the French; and accordingly we find, that with an
                    inconsiderable addition to her debt, France has defrayed all these heavy
                    expenses, the contributions imposed on her by the allied powers, the expenses of
                    the temporary maintenance of her armies, and her own warlike expenses. For this
                    purpose, however, it became necessary in 1815 to impose additional taxes. In
                    1817 a loan was required of 392,989 000 francs; and in 1818, to defray the
                    extraordinary contribution paid in that year to the allies of 575,807,197
                    francs, the minister had recourse to another loan of 220,510,718 francs; whilst
                    by the taxes which had been imposed, the revenue of that year was carried to
                    L.35,000,000. The following is the state of the receipt and expenditure for ten
                    successive years.</p>

                <p>Besides the public revenue of the empire, the communes raise a revenue for their
                    own local expenses. This revenue partly arises <hi rend="italic">from
                    octroi»,</hi> which amount throughout France to forty millions of francs per
                    annum, and from other sources, being altogether about two hundred millions of
                    francs; which, added to the public revenue of a thousand millions, amounts to
                    about 1,200,000,000 francs for the whole revenue of France, equal to fifty
                    millions sterling, or L.41,666,666 if we deduct the local revenue. During the
                    administration of Μ. Villèle, the five per cents, in France were converted into
                    a three per cent, fund, at the rate of 133∙33 cents, for every hundred of the
                    five per cent, stock; so that the whole five per cent stock, bearing an annual
                    interest of 30,574,116 francs, was converted into a three per cent, fund, of
                    which the capital was increased one third. The effect of this transaction by Μ.
                    Villèle was in reality to reduce the interest on the five percent, stock to four
                    per cent., by which he saved annual interest to the amount of six millions,
                    though by a very useless complexity in his operations. It could serve no end to
                    commence a three per cent, fund, when he was in reality paying four per cent.;
                    the nominal reduction of interest being compensated to the stockholders by the
                    increase of the capital stock. The interest on the public debt of France, thus
                    reduced, may be stated as follows:</p>
                <p>The public debt of France amounts to 4,988,738,000 francs, equal to
                    L.207,864,000. The annual interest of the debt is about 10,812,000, whilst the
                    sinking fund <pb break="no" facs="nls:193516671" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6671-0208"
                    />amounts to 1,120,54·1,828 francs, and yields an annual interest of 44,053,005
                    francs, equal to about L.l,835,542, which is nearly one fourth part of the whole
                    debt.</p>
                <p>The ancient system of taxation in France was subverted by the National Assembly
                    in 1791, and new taxes were substituted in lieu of those formerly in force.
                    These consisted of direct and indirect taxes. The direct taxes are, 1. <hi
                    rend="italic">Contribution</hi><hi rend="italic">foncière</hi> or land-tax; 2.
                    <hi rend="italic">Contribution</hi><hi rend="italic">personelle</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et mobilière;</hi> 3. A tax on doors and windows; 4. <hi
                    rend="italic">Droits</hi><hi rend="italic">de patente,</hi> or a license duty on
                    particular trades and professions, and a duty on mines.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">contribution</hi><hi rend="italic">foncière</hi> is raised
                    equally on all lands and houses in proportion to their nett revenue. There are
                    no longer any exemptions in favour of the nobility since the Revolution. The
                    royal domains and the property of the state are alone exempted. The <hi
                    rend="italic">contribution</hi><hi rend="italic">personelle</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et mobilière</hi> is divided into two parts. The first is a
                    species of poll-tax, rated at three days’ labour, and levied on all males above
                    eighteen years of age. The <hi rend="italic">contribution</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mobilière</hi> is a house-tax levied on all rents from 200 to 2500 francs. For
                    the <hi rend="italic">contribution</hi><hi rend="italic">personelle,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">octroi,</hi> which is a customduty on all goods entering a
                    town, is substituted in Paris and other large cities. The tax on street-doors
                    and gateways, and windows, varies in proportion to the size of the town in which
                    the house is situated, and also in proportion to the size and value of the house
                    and the number of windows. The <hi rend="italic">droits de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >patentes</hi> or license-duty is levied on every person following a profession,
                    trade, or business; and is divided into two heads; the proportional tax, which
                    amounts to ten per cent, on the rent of the persons dwelling; or the fixed tax,
                    which depends on the extent and population of the town where he exercises his
                    profession. A merchant pays from forty to 500 francs per annum, according to the
                    population of the place where he resides, and an additional ten per cent, on the
                    rent of his dwelling-house. Bankers in all cases pay 500 francs a year; and
                    there is in like manner a fixed rate for other inferior trades and professions.
                    The duty on mines is in proportion to the extent of the surface, and also to
                    their nett produce.</p>
                <p>The law which fixes the amount of the direct taxes also determines the quota
                    which each department is required to pay. This is announced by the minister of
                    finance to the prefect of the department, who communicates it to his
                    sous-prefect and to the mayors. The sum thus assigned by the prefect to each
                    arrondissement is subdivided by the councils of the arrondissement and by the
                    communes; and the amount allotted to each is apportioned among the inhabitants
                    by persons appointed for that purpose, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >répartiteurs</hi> or assessors. These assessors regulate the amount of taxable
                    property, and they fix the scale. The land-tax is however very unequally
                    assessed, amounting in some departments to six per cent., whilst in the
                    department of the Seine it is seventeen per cent. The equalization of the
                    land-tax has always been accounted a capital object in the financial policy of
                    France; and with this view a minute survey and measurement of all the landed
                    property in France (termed the <hi rend="italic">cadastre)</hi> was begun in
                    1803, and is still going on. Not above one third of this survey is yet
                    completed. The inequality of the land-tax has long been a subject of loud and
                    just complaint; and various plans have been adopted for a more accurate
                    classification of the land. But these have generally proved inefficient and
                    unsatisfactory. It is only by an exact survey of the land that the burden of the
                    tax can be equalized; and the survey which is at present in progress, when it is
                    completed, will no doubt effect this desirable object. But, in the mean time,
                    the unequal assessment of this tax, the many overratings on the one hand, and
                    omissions on the other, are loudly and justly complained of; and the slow
                    progress of the <hi rend="italic">cadastre</hi> affords but a tardy remedy for
                    so great an evil.</p>
                <p>The indirect taxes consist chiefly of the <hi rend="italic">droits réunis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">or</hi> excise duties on articles of consumption, of stan&gt;p
                    duties, registration duties, duties on carriages, on canals and ferry boats, on
                    gold and silver plate, lotteries, and gaming houses. A revenue is raised from
                    the monopoly of tobacco and gunpowder; from the post-office; the <hi
                    rend="italic">octroi,</hi> or custom duty on all articles entering large towns,
                    one tenth of which goes to the royal treasury, and the remainder is applied to
                    local expenses. The customs form an important branch of the French revenues.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">droits</hi><hi rend="italic">réunis</hi> or excise duties
                    are laid on wine, brandy, &amp;c. which pay one and a half franc per hectolitre,
                    of 120 English quarts, on being removed from one place to another. Wine in
                    bottles pays ten francs on its removal. Cider, perry, and mead pay eighty cents,
                    per hectolitre. A duty of ten per cent, on the above duty is paid on their
                    removal from the wholesale warehouse. Prior to 1830 a duty distinct from the
                    octroi was levied on the entry of all wine or spirituous liquors into communes
                    the population of which amounted to 1500 and upwards. All communes whose
                    population does not amount to 4000 are exempted from this tax; and a new tariff
                    has been established, rising progressively from 4000 to 5000 inhabitants, in
                    proportion to the estimated wealth of the departments, which are divided into
                    four separate classes; a very vague, as we should ≡, and uncertain standard of
                    taxation. There is a duty on wine and liquors sold by retail, which since 1830
                    has been reduced from fifteen to ten per cent. A reduction of three percent, on
                    this duty is made to dealers, and of twenty-five per cent, if the wine be grown
                    by the retailer himself. Strong beer pays a duty of three francs, and small beer
                    a duty of fifteen sous, per hectolitre. Retailers of liquors must take out a
                    distinct license, which varies, in proportion to the size of the town, from
                    twenty to six francs. Proprietors of public carriages pay one tenth of the price
                    of each place for passengers, a third being deducted for vacant places, and one
                    tenth of the price received for merchandise. Private carriages are subjected to
                    a moderate duty, according to their size, of forty francs per annum for a
                    carriage with two wheels, and holding two persons; and of 150 francs per annum
                    for a carriage with tour wheels, and holding nine persons. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >enregistrement,</hi> or registration duties, embraces a variety of
                    transactions, where property is conveyed or given away by marriage-settlement or
                    otherwise. There is a duty on gifts <hi rend="italic">inter vivos,</hi> which
                    increases with the distance of the relation between the parties. It was modified
                    by an ordonnance of the king in 1832. The duties payable on registry are either
                    fixed or <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the fixed or
                    certain duties apply to common certificates, those of life or residence, account
                    books, bills of lading, appointments of arbitrations, valuations of furniture,
                    and the like. The <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi> duty applies to all bonds or
                    obligations, discharges, judgments, deposits or releases of sums of money, and
                    for every transfer of property, contract or engagement arising from real or
                    personal property, whether between persons living, or given by way of bequest.
                    It is also applicable to leases, annuity deeds, deeds of gift during life,
                    negotiable securities with the exception of bills of exchange; to policies of
                    assurance, copies of the judgments of civil and criminal courts, &amp;c. These
                    duties are either fixed, varying from fifty centimes to twenty-five francs, or
                    they are in proportion to the property conveyed, and vary from seven francs to
                    twenty centimes per cent. The stamp duty applies to receipts, bills of exchange,
                    newspapers, handbills, playbills, admission cards to public places. It is also
                    payable upon all paper used for civil and judicial <hi rend="italic">actes,</hi>
                    and upon all writings which may be required in evidence in courts of justice,
                    &amp;c., and varies either in proportion to the size of the paper, or to the
                    amount of the sum specified in bills, promissory notes, &amp;c. The tax does not

                    miserable resources of French finance. The latter are farmed out to a company,
                    and paid, previous to the year 1830, five and a half millions annually; and for
                    this sum the government of France degrades itself by thus trafficking with its

                <p>The duty on doors and windows commenced in its present form on the 1st of January
                    1833; and it is regulated partly by the amount of the population of the town or
                    commune in which it is situated, a circumstance which seems to afford a very
                    uncertain standard of taxation. This tax is very trifling, averaging, where
                    there is only one door, from thirty centimes to one franc, as the population
                    increases from 5000 to 100,000; where there are more doors than one the duty is
                    increased. A house with five doors <hi rend="italic">(ouvertures)</hi> pays from
                    2 francs 50 cents. (2s. Id.) to 8 francs 50 cents, (7s. 10d.), as it is situated
                    in a town or commune of 5000 or 100,000 souls. For houses having street-doors
                    and gate-ways called <hi rend="italic">portes cochères</hi> 1 franc 60 cents.
                    (Is. 5d.) to 18 francs 80 cents, (15s. 8d.), in proportion to the amount of the
                    commune or town in which it is situated.</p>
                <p>The duties levied on this branch of the French revenues produce about L.3,000,000
                    sterling. In Britain the customs yield about L.18,000,000 sterling. In France
                    these duties are laid on in many cases more with a view to restriction and
                    monopoly than to revenue. France sacrifices a large revenue for the
                    encouragement of the colonial monopoly; paying for the produce of the colonies
                    an exorbitant price, and afterwards, as in the case of sugar, the staple article
                    that is imported from the colonies, giving a great portion of the duty as a
                    bounty on its exportation to foreign countries, to indemnify the exporter for
                    the loss that he would incur if he were selling the sugar at its ordinary price
                    in the markets of Europe. In 1830 the gross receipts from the sugar duty
                    amounted to L. 1,397,340, of which one third, namely, L.420,903, were paid back
                    in bounties on the exportation of the surplus. Thus the nett duty only amounted
                    to L.976,437, when in 1822, though the quantity of sugar consumed was only
                    1,086,596 cwts. or 281,075 cwts. less than in 1830, the nett amount of the duty
                    was L.l,234,653. It is by means of heavy customduties that the French
                    legislators endeavour to preserve the monopoly of the home market to their own
                    manufacturers, by which policy they compel the French community to buy at a high
                    price the inferior articles of their own manufacture, rather than the better
                    articles of the foreigner at a lower price. They thus lay the whole community
                    under contribution for the benefit of a few. They exclude the produce of foreign
                    industry because it is better and cheaper, in order to force a sale of
                    workmanship that is inferior and dearer; and one miserable consequence of this
                    narrow and mistaken policy is a great contraband trade in these prohibited
                    articles, which no efforts have been able to repress. The increased numbers and
                    superior vigilance of the custom-house officers have been still counteracted by
                    the new expedients and persevering ingenuity of the smuggler. The frontier of
                    France is the scene of this persecution against commerce, where all the illegal,
                    daring, and ingenious resources of the contraband traders are called into
                    activity. Amongst other expedients, they have trained packs of dogs to carry
                    prohibited goods across the frontier. These dogs being conducted to the
                    frontier, are kept without food for many hours; they are then beaten and laden
                    with goods, and are started on their travels when it begins to grow dark, and
                    reach the abodes of their masters as soon as they can, where they are well
                    treated, and receive a full meal. According to the accounts of the French
                    custom-house, 40,278 of these dogs were destroyed in the year 1830, on which
                    account premiums were paid to the custom-house officers to the amount of 40,278
                    francs. The great objecte of this illicit trade are tobacco, sugar, and colonial
                    produce generally; also British cotton manufactures, quiltings, cambrics,
                    muslins, fine cutlery, &amp;c. That the trade, though it may be obstructed, is
                    not prevented, is evident from the circumstance that there are regular rates of
                    insurance on the conveyance of contraband goods into France, varying from ten to
                    seventy per cent. A revision, and if possible a reduction, of these heavy duties
                    would be the true policy of France. Monopoly was never yet the source of
                    commercial greatness in any country. These special encouragements rather tend to
                    deaden ingenuity; while it is animated by a free competition, in which all
                    parties are on an equal footing, and in which the prize is the sure reward only
                    of merit and talent.</p>
                <p>XII. NATIONAL INCOME AND CAPITAL; POPULATION.</p>
                <p>Of the official surveys of the French territory, by far the most minute and
                    accurate is the <hi rend="italic">cadastre,</hi> a survey which became
                    indispensable from the time it was determined to exchange the taxes on
                    consumption for taxes on produce. A return of the rent of land, such as was made
                    under the property-tax act in England, would not have answered, or indeed have
                    been practicable in France, where so many thousands of petty lots are cultivated
                    by their proprietors. At first the <hi rend="italic">cadastre</hi> proceeded on
                    the plan of an estimate <hi rend="italic">par masses de culture,</hi> or
                    continuous valuation of extensive tracts; but this proving unsatisfactory, it
                    has been conducted since 1807 on a plan of such minute detail, as to give the
                    value of every separate <hi rend="italic">parcelle</hi> or patch of land. The
                    progress of this minute survey of the landed property in France has been
                    retardée by many causes; and in 1830 not above two thirds of the land had been
                    surveyed. It was estimated in the reporι of one of the committees of the chamber
                    in 1832, that iι would still require from that period about eight years and an
                    expense of above L.2,000,000 sterling, to complete it. They had only surveyed
                    thirty-one millions of hec tares, or sixty-eight millions of acres. The annual
                    expense of the survey is L.120,000.</p>
                <p>It is common to dwell on the advantages of France, as situated in the centre of
                    civilized nations, as raising within herself a great variety of products, and as
                    capable o conducting her manufactures with comparatively few imports. Those,
                    however, who have studied the subject thoroughly, will pronounce her real
                    advantages to consist in a temperate climate, in a territory upon the whole
                    tertile, in a considerable extent of sea-coast, and in the possession of
                    military strength sufficient to protect her from aggression. As yet neither the
                    capital nor labour of the French have been skilfully directed; but the
                    disposition to industry exists, and needs only a judicious impulse.</p>
                <p>The taxation of France, computed by the individual, hardly exceeds L.l. Ils.
                    (English value) per head, whilst that of Britain and Ireland is not less than
                    L.3. 10s. per head. This, however, is a very inconclusive comparison, the
                    question being not the relative number of the inhabitants, but the result of
                    their productive industry. Μ. Chaptai computes (vol. i. p. 225) the value of the
                    land and farming capital of France at fifteen hundred millions sterling, to
                    which making an addition for the difference of money, and a further addition for
                    the capital employed <pb break="no" facs="nls:193516697"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-6697-0210"/>in manufacture and commerce, we arrive at an
                    amount <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> not unlike the very large sum which Mr
                    Colquhoun gives '(see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">England,</hi> page 149)
                    for the collective capital of Great Britain and Ireland. But we fix, by
                    preference, the attention of our readers on the annual produce.</p>

                <p>The difference in the expense of living between France and our country is about a
                    third, that is, L.100 in France is equivalent to L.130 or L.140 in the southern,
                    and to L.120 or L.130 in the northern part of our island. The difference, as far
                    as regards provisions, is somewhat greater; but it receives a counterpoise in
                    the cheapness of our fuel. The proportion now mentioned will be found applicable
                    to the expense of the middle, as well as of the lower ranks. It will be found
                    equally general in the sense of locality, being applicable to France and Britain
                    at large, provided the parallel be made between towns or districts at a similar
                    distance from either capital, Paris being as expensive compared to the rest of
                    France, as London is compared to the rest of England. Fortunately for us, the
                    French have not paid much attention to the price, either of labour or fuel, in
                    the places, such as Paris and Rouen, where they have established their rival
                    manufactures. Another remarkable circumstance is, that various kinds of work,
                    when performed by the piece, are nearly as dear in France as in England; so
                    unaccustomed are our neigh-hours<pb break="no" facs="nls:193516710"

                <p>In the end of the seventeenth century, the territory of France, when equal, or
                    very nearly equal, to its present extent, appears, from the report of the
                    intendants or provincial governors, to have contained about 20,000,000 of
                    inhabitants. This number was found, by the census made by order of the National
                    Assembly, to have increased nearly a third in the course of a century; the
                    amount, in 1791, being 26,363,600, a numřer which, by the latest*</p>
                <p>computation, made in 1817, had further increased to above 29,000,000. In the year
                    1820 the population was 30,451,187; and, according to the ordonnance of January
                    1832, it amounted to 32,661,078. The marriages are annually about 236,996, and
                    the deaths about 785,268, of which 395,250 are males, and 388,018 females. The
                    births are 967,533, of which there are 498,707 boys and 468,826 girls. The
                    number of illegitimate children is 68,081. The average population of France is
                    144 inhabitants to the square mile.</p>

                <p>The estimates of population in France subsequently to 1791 are formed, not, like
                    our population returns, on an actual survey, but by adding for the period which

                <p>That the proportion of our population inhabiting towns is greater than in France,
                    is at once ascertained by taking the aggregate of twenty of the largest cities
                    in each. For France, that aggregate is about 1,700,000; for Britain and Ireland,
                    2,300,000.</p>
                <p>The ratio of the increase of population in France is greatest in the lower
                    classes; the middling and upper ranks have seldom large families. Men in such
                    stations in France are much less habituated to steady industry than in England;
                    the openings in trade to respectable employment and eventual competency are
                    comparatively fewer; and, in many situations, the incomes are adequate to the
                    support of an individual only. In that country, as with us, the population
                    evidently increases faster since the adoption of vaccine inoculation. The
                    climate and soil are in general not less salubrious than those of Britain, and
                    the advantages attendant on agricultural habits are enjoyed by a much greater
                    proportion of the population; but a considerable waste of health, and even of
                    life, takes place from the crowded nature of the towns, and the damp position of
                    many of the cottages. A want of comfort on the part of the lower orders tends,
                    along with their deficient cleanliness, to the same result; but, on the other
                    hand, the general activity, temperance, and cheerfulness of the people, are all
                    in favour of health and longevity.</p>
                <p>XIII. <hi rend="smallcaps">government.</hi></p>
                <p>The charter in virtue of which Louis XVIII. ascended the throne of his ancestors
                    is the basis of the present government of France. The following are the leading
                    provisions of this memorable and solemn compact, concluded between the sovereign
                    and the people.</p>
                <p>The king is declared the supreme head of the executive power, in whom is vested
                    the power of declaring war and making peace; the command of the national force,
                    whether by land or sea; and the nomination of all ministers, ambassadors, and
                    other public functionaries, civil and military. He has the power of granting
                    pardons and commuting punishments; and by the original charter he might issue
                    ordonnances and regulations, such as the orders in council in England, for the
                    benefit and security of the state; but this clause has been annulled by the
                    chamber, as it was made the pretext for the arbitrary proceedings which produced
                    the revolution of 1830. The person of his majesty is declared to be sacred and
                    inviolable; and his ministers alone are held responsible for all acts of
                    administration.</p>
                <p>The legislative power is exercised by two chambers, the Chamber of Peers and the
                    Chamber of Deputies, in conjunction with the king, without whose concurrence no
                    measure can have the authority of law. He has the power of convoking,
                    proroguing, and dissolving the Chamber of Deputies; with this provision,
                    however, that in the latter case a new chamber must be re-assembled within three
                    months after the dissolution. It is further declared in this charter of French
                    freedom, that all Frenchmen, either by birth or naturalization, are to be
                    considered as equal in the eye of the law; that the Roman Catholic and apostolic
                    faith shall be considered as the established religion of the state; and that all
                    persons, whatever may be their religious faith, shall be protected in its
                    exercise, and admissible to all civil and military offices. The clause
                    respecting the national religion was altered after the expulsion of Louis
                    XVIII., on Napoleon’s return from Elba, it being declared, merely as a matter of
                    fact, that the Catholic was the religion of the majority of the French, but not
                    the religion of the state, which gave not its sanction to one particular mode of
                    faith more than another.</p>
                <p>The two chambers form an important part of the French« constitution. The Chamber
                    of Peers consists of no defini-1 tive number, as the king has the unlimited
                    power of creating peers. The number of peers in 1826 was 214, and in 1827 it was
                    increased to 290 by the creation of seventy-six new peers. But this great and
                    sudden addition to the peerage being considered as an unconstitutional exercise
                    of the prerogative by Charles X., was declared null and void after his
                    abdication; and in 1833 the number of peers, including five princes of the blood
                    and several new creations, only amounted to 262. Louis XVIII. could by his
                    prerogative convoke this chamber when that of the Deputies was not sitting. But
                    this power was withheld in the new charter of 1830, excepting in the case of the
                    chamber sitting as a court of justice; and on such occasions it is strictly
                    confined to its judicial functions. No meeting of the chamber can take place
                    except by an express order of the king; and it is convoked by bis majesty at the
                    same time as the Chamber of Deputies, the session of the one commencing and
                    finishing at the same time with that of the other. A peer of France may be
                    admitted into the chamber at the age of twenty-five; but he is not admitted to
                    the exercise of any prerogative until he has completed his thirtieth year.
                    Members of the royal family and princes of the blood are peers by birth, and sit
                    and vote in the house after the age of twenty-five. Every peer receives a
                    summons from the king to attend the chamber, without which authority he may be
                    refused admittance by the usher. The chamber takes cognizance of high treason,
                    and of all crimes committed against the security and peace of the state; and on
                    these high occasions the peers are convened by a special summons from the king.
                    No peer can be arrested except by the authority of the chamber. Those who were
                    members of the senate during Bonaparte’s reign were created peers after his
                    abdication, and their pensions of L.1500 a year were confirmed. By an ordonnance
                    of Louis XVII1. no person could be created a peer unless he possessed a certain
                    entailed property in trust or in the funds, producing, in order to enable him
                    merely to support the title of a duke, a clear income of 15,000 francs, or L.625
                    perannum; for the title of a marquis, 10,000 francs; and for viscounts and
                    barons, 5000 francs. In order to exercise the privileges of a peer of France,
                    double the amount of clear income is required. Several members of the present
                    chamber who were created by Louis XV1II. receive pensions equal to the amount
                    required. Others of the ancient regime, as well as of those lately created,
                    possess a larger revenue than the law requires <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193516736" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6736-0213"/>for the maintenance of their
                    rank, and of course receive no pensions. The sum annually disbursed for the
                    support of peers, or their widows, amounts to 1,634,000 francs. The chancellor
                    of France, formerly appointed by the king, was president of the Chamber of
                    Peers, and received an annual salary of 100,000 francs. Since the revolution of
                    1830 this office has been abolished, and a speaker or president is now appointed
                    by the chamber.</p>
                <p>this popular branch of the French legislature consisted, according to the
                    original provisions of the charter, of 258 members, who were elected by a
                    committee of voters <hi rend="italic">(collège électoraD,</hi> each paying
                    direct taxes to the amount of L.40 per annum, and who were delegated to elect a
                    deputy by a lower class of electors, whose qualification was the payment of L.12
                    per annum of direct taxes. One fifth of the chamber was to be renewed every
                    year; so that every five years the whole would be re-elected anew. In 1817 a law
                    was passed abrogating the intermediate class of electors, and giving to all the
                    voters the right of immediately electing the deputy; and in 1821 the plan of
                    renewing the chamber by one fifth at a time was also abrogated, and a law was
                    passed for dissolving and re-electing the whole assembly at once. It was at the
                    same time provided that 172 members should be added to the chamber, thus making
                    the whole number 430; and in order to counteract the democratic influence which
                    was supposed to predominate in the chamber, the right of electing those members
                    was confined to the departmental college, or the fourth part of the voters, who
                    paid the highest amount of direct taxes, and who, besides this exclusive right
                    of voting for these 172 members, had aright to vote along with the other
                    electors of the arrondissement for the other members of the chamber. In 1831 a
                    new electoral law was passed, reducing the qualification of the electors to 200
                    francs (L.8. 6s. 8d.), and also the age from thirty to twenty-five years, and
                    reducing the qualification of deputies from forty to thirty years of age, and
                    the pecuniary qualification from 1000 to 500 francs. The privileges of the
                    departmental colleges are also abolished; all who are qualified by the payment
                    of direct taxes to the amount of two hundred francs, voting at once for the
                    deputy. It was estimated, that by thus lowering the pecuniary qualification of
                    electors, the number would be increased from 100,000 to 190,000.</p>
                <p>In the colleges, the president, formerly appointed by his majesty, is now chosen
                    by the electors. If there be more than 600 electors in an inferior college, it
                    is divided into sections, with not less than 300 electors in each. These
                    sectionselect a vice-president. In the few instances where the total number of
                    electors does not exceed 600 in the whole department, they assemble in one
                    college only. The presidents and vice-presidents have the supreme rule and
                    authority over the regulations and internal police of their respective colleges
                    and sections, whose sittings are restricted to ten days at most. The military
                    are not allowed to interfere in any case.</p>
                <p>The votes are collected with the utmost care and accuracy. Each elector must
                    write his name, qualification, and residence, and hand it, previous to giving
                    his vote, to the president, who deposits it in an urn along with all the other
                    suffrages of the electors, whose names are inscribed on a register by the
                    secretary, or by one of the scrutineers; and it is not seen by any person before
                    it is thrown into the general urn. The names are then taken out, read, counted,
                    and a list made, specifying the number of votes given to each candidate. The
                    papers on which are written the names of the candidates are then committed to
                    the flames. All possible means are thus employed to secure secrecy; and no
                    public functionary can incur the least hazard though he were to vote against the
                    minister under whom he is employed.</p>
                <p>The prefect of the department decides, in the first instance, on the validity of
                    the qualifications claimed by the electors, and makes out and publishes annually
                    a list of all whom he considers as entitled to vote. Those who are rejected by
                    the prefect, from whatever cause, have their appeal to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cour royale;</hi> and if any dispute arise relative to the payment of their
                    contributions, or their civil or political residence, their case is decided by
                    the <hi rend="italic">conseil</hi><hi rend="italic">d’</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >état.</hi> An order from either of these courts is binding on the prefect; and
                    if he afterwards refuse to insert the name in the list of electors, he incurs a
                    penalty of from 300 to 500 francs, and is interdicted from exercising his
                    functions for twenty years. No prefect, sub-prefect, or general officer
                    commanding a military division, can be elected for the department in which he
                    exercises his functions.</p>
                <p>The French Chamber of Deputies, consisting of430 members, chosen for 86
                    departments, is equivalent in its ∣κ&gt;wer, influence, and privileges, to the
                    House of Commons in the legislature of Britain. They are both the
                    representatives of the people, whose influence, when it is exerted through this
                    legitimate organ, is and must ever be irresistible. The original charter of
                    Louis XVIII. assigned to the monarch the exclusive right of proposing all public
                    measures; and it was necessary, in proposing any new law, to move an address to
                    his majesty, praying that it might be presented to the chamber for its adoption.
                    The charter of 1830 dispenses with this form, and gives the right of initiating
                    laws to all the branches of the legislature, with the exception of taxation
                    bills, which must originate, as in Britain, with the representatives of the
                    people. The proceedings of the chamber are regulated by a president, who was
                    formerly chosen by the king out of five members, presented to him by the
                    assembly; but is now chosen by the deputies themselves at the commencement of
                    each session. The session is always opened by a speech in the Chamber of
                    Deputies from the throne; but the minister of the interior prorogues the session
                    by the command of his majesty. When the session commences, <hi rend="italic"
                    >bureaux, oτ</hi> special committees, nine in number, are formed, and they are
                    periodically renewed; and when any new law is presented to the chamber on the
                    part of the king, it is referred in the first instance to these special
                    committees; if the law be approved by two or more of them, it is reported by the
                    chamber, when the principle of the measure is considered and discussed by the
                    chamber, and the clauses are afterwards voted article by article; which
                    proceedings correspond to the second reading and the committal of a bill in the
                    British parliament. The decision of the <hi rend="italic">bureaux</hi> i⅛
                    reported by the chairman or <hi rend="italic">rapporteur,</hi> to the whole
                    chamber; which, so far from being guided by this report, very frequently
                    pronounces an opposite decision. The special clauses of a law are voted by <hi
                    rend="italic">assis et levée;</hi> those who are for the law, the <hi
                    rend="italic">ayes,</hi> rising, and those who are against the law, the <hi
                    rend="italic">noes,</hi> keeping their places. The vote on the whole measure is
                    by secret scrutiny, the ayes being indicated by white balls, and the noes by
                    black ones, thrown into an urn placed on the tribune of the chamber. The
                    sittings of the chamber are public; but on the demand of any five members, all
                    strangers are excluded, and the house forms itself into a private committee. To
                    form a chamber, the presence of half the members is necessary. No deputy can be
                    arrested for debt during the sitting of the chamber, nor within six weeks
                    previous to its assembling, or six weeks subsequent to its prorogation; and if
                    arrested at any other period, he must be liberated during the session; nor can
                    any deputy be arrested or prosecuted for a criminal charge, except he be
                    detected in the act, unless by permission of the chamber. The senators of
                    Bonaparte received each a salary of 10,000 francs per annum. The deputies to the
                    chamber receive no salary. The president, the secretaries, and the officers
                    attached to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193516749" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6749-0214"
                    />the chambers, such as <hi rend="italic">questeur», huissiers,</hi> &amp;c. are
                    the only persons paid. The salary of the president was, under the Bourbon
                    regime, 100,000 francs per annum, besides a furnished hotel, horses, equipage,
                    &amp;c. But it has been reduced by the stern economy of these reforming times to
                    4000 francs per month, payable only during the session.</p>
                <p>The executive department of the government is administered by the king and his
                    cabinet council, consisting of nine ministers, viz.</p>
                <p>1. The minister of finance, whose business it is to receive the taxes from the
                    receivers-general, and all the other revenues of government. He disburses the
                    payments for the other departments of the state, for the interest of the public
                    debt, and all pensions, &amp;c. To this ministry are attached certain other
                    offices, the chiefs of which are called directors; namely, directors-general of
                    taxes, customs, registries and domains, ports, lottery, woods and forests, and
                    the mint. The salary of the minister of finance was reduced by the Chamber of
                    Deputies from 150,000 to 120,000 francs per annum, and the salaries of the
                    directors vary from 40,000 to 50,000 francs per annum. The revenue is conveyed
                    to the treasury through various subordinate offices. There is a <hi
                    rend="italic">percepteur</hi> or collector in each commune, who pays his
                    collections to the special receiver for each arrondissement, who transmits the
                    revenue to the general receiver of taxes for the department, by whom it is,
                    lastly, remitted to the office of the finance minister.</p>
                <p>2. The minister of the interior. This minister is one of the most important
                    functionaries of the state. He is in direct correspondence with all the civil
                    authorities of the kingdom; no local tax can be imposed, nor any disbursements
                    made, in any of the departments, districts, or communes, without his authority.
                    The general police of the kingdom, with all its various details, is under his
                    superintendence, as well as all public roads and bridges, mines, public
                    buildings, all poor-houses, charities, and hospitals, the national guard of
                    France, the censorship of the theatre, the royal institute, the public libraries
                    and government archives, the examination of all passports, and all reports from
                    prefects and sub-prefects of departments. He takes cognizance also of the press.
                    He has directors under him, who relieve him from the trouble of details. His
                    salary is 120,000 francs.</p>
                <p>3. Minister of justice and keeper of the seals. He is at the head of the law
                    department, though he seldom presides in any court of justice. He corresponds
                    with the law officers of the crown throughout France, and takes cognizance of
                    all cases of criminals after conviction, and of all applications for royal
                    mercy. His salary is 120,000 francs.</p>
                <p>4. Minister of marine, who has the direction of the navy and the colonies of
                    France. His salary is 120,000 francs.</p>
                <p>5. Minister of foreign affairs. His duties are expressed in his designation. All
                    passports to cross the frontiers must be nominally countersigned by him. His
                    salary is 150,000 francs.</p>
                <p>6. Minister of war. He superintends of course the whole service of the army and
                    navy. He has also the sole control of the gunpowder and saltpetre manufactories,
                    barracks, military hospitals, &amp;c., and the government founderies and
                    manufactories of small arms. He has also the charge of organizing and inspecting
                    the corps of gendarmerie or garde municipale of Paris, as well as in all the
                    departments. Salary 120,000 francs.</p>
                <p>7. Minister of ecclesiastical affairs. His salary is 120,000 francs.</p>
                <p>8. Minister of public instruction. His functions are strictly confined to secular
                    education. He nominates the different functionaries in the public academies and
                    faculties, authorizes the opening of private boarding-schools for both sexes,
                    and regulates the works to be used in these seminaries; he grants diplomas in
                    law and medicine, superintends the receipts of colleges, fixes the pensions of
                    retired functionaries, grants aids and indemnities to collegiate corporations,
                    and generally takes cognizance of all institutions ' for public instruction. He
                    has a council of nine members, of which he is president. His salary is 100,000
                    francs.</p>
                <p>9. Minister of commerce and manufactures. This is a new office, of which the
                    business partly belonged to the minister of finance and the minister of the
                    interior. He corresponds with the chambers of commerce; nominates
                    exchange-brokers, with the exception of those in Paris, who are nominated by the
                    minister of finance; examines all demands made for the establishment of
                    assurance offices, their rules and regulations; grants patents for inventions,
                    establishes or suppresses fairs or markets, judges of the qualifications of
                    candidates for the office of judges in any of the commercial courts, and has an
                    especial jurisdiction over all that may be deemed necessary for the prosperity
                    of commerce and manufactures. His salary is 120,000 francs.</p>
                <p>Besides these cabinet ministers, the king has a privy council, the members of
                    which are seldom summoned; the public business being entirely managed by the
                    cabinet council. The king formerly presided at the meetings of this council; but
                    since the last revolution, the presence of the king has not been so frequent,
                    and is now usually dispensed with.</p>
                <p>Each of these ministers presents to the Chamber of Deputies his own budget of
                    expenses, which is examined by a committee specially appointed for the purpose.
                    It is competent for these committees to propose a reduction in the items of
                    these ministerial budgets, which may be adopted by the chamber, as in 1828, when
                    the salaries of ministers were reduced 30,000 francs per annum, besides other
                    modifications that were proposed. After these various budgets have been
                    considered and discussed, the general account of the national expenditure is
                    considered and put to the vote.</p>
                <p>Ministers of state. These are nominal functionaries, and the appointments are
                    generally given to retired cabinet ministers, as a reward for past services. The
                    pension was formerly 20,000 francs per annum, but since the revolution of '1830
                    it has been restricted to 12,000 francs a year.</p>
                <p>Council of state <hi rend="italic">(conseil</hi><hi rend="italic">d’état).</hi>
                    The councillors of state are appointed by the king eitherfor ordinary or
                    extraordinary service, or as mere honorary members of the council, at which,
                    since the restoration, the keeper of the seals always presides. This council
                    deliberates, in the first place, on all bills or <hi rend="italic">projets de
                    loi,</hi> which are laid before them by the ministers before they are submitted
                    to the chambers. The ministers, as well as the directors of the several
                    administrations, have a seat in this council, which for ordinary affairs is
                    limited to twenty-four members, and is divided into four sections. 1. For
                    legislation and litigation, which is by far the most important in the council of
                    the state, as it deliberates on all law projects and regulations respecting
                    civil, criminal, and ecclesiastical affairs, brought under its consideration by
                    the respective ministers. It is in fact ♯ tribunal which decides all matters in
                    dispute between individuals and officers of the state; and its decisions are
                    final. 2. The section of the interior takes cognizance of all matters connected
                    with internal and colonial commerce, public roads, bridges, canals, mines,
                    departmental police, &amp;c. 3. and 4. The section of finance, and the section
                    of war and marine, take charge of all matters connected with their respective
                    departments. The councillors of state on actual or ordinary service receive a
                    salary of 12,000 francs a year, a deduction being made if they enjoy any other
                    situation of emolument under government. Those who are employed on extraordinary
                    service have generally other situations, and receive no salary whatever. To the
                    council of state are attached the <hi rend="italic">maitres</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de requites,</hi> appointed likewise for ordinary and
                    extraordinary service, but some are merely honorary. Their business is to draw
                    up all acts of council, for which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193516762"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-6762-0215"/>they receive a salary of 6000 francs a year. The
                    office of <hi rend="italic">maitre</hi><hi rend="italic">de reyuétes</hi> may be
                    considered as the first step towards ' the rank of councillor of state. There
                    are also <hi rend="italic">auditeurs,</hi> who are merely present at the
                    discussions of the council, for the purpose of initiating themselves in the
                    routine of business, and who receive no salary.</p>
                <p>Audit office, or <hi rend="italic">cour des comptes.</hi> It is the business of
                    this court to receive and examine all the accounts of the different ministers,
                    and those of the receivers-general and prefects of the departments; and to
                    certify the correctness of the general accounts published every year by the
                    minister of finance. The ordinary business of this court is managed by three
                    chambers, each having a president; and there is also a chief president, who sits
                    when these chambers are united. There is also a councillor of reference in each
                    chamber <hi rend="italic">(référendaire),</hi> whose duty is the verification of
                    the accounts; also a procureur-general, whose office corresponds to that of
                    solicitor of some of the public offices in England, and who sees that all the
                    necessary accounts are delivered into this office within the period fixed by
                    law, and who, in case of neglect, proceeds against the offending parties for the
                    penalties they have incurred. There is likewise a chief registrar, in whose
                    custody remain all the accounts and vouchers transmitted to his office.</p>
                <p>The revenue of the king, or the civil list, was fixed at the restoration, by the
                    budget of 1814, at 15,510,000 francs per annum; and a further grant was made to
                    the other branches of the royal family of four millions a year. By the budget of
                    1816 the income of the king was augmented to thirty millions; but at the
                    accession of Charles X. it was fixed at twenty-five millions, whilst the
                    allowances to the other branches of the royal family were increased to seven
                    millions a year. The royal household, as it is designated, includes the
                    following appointments:</p>

                <p>There were, besides, thirteen palaces, each with a separate and expensive
                    establishment; a large sum was annually paid in pensions; and, under the heads
                    of music, the wardrobe, medical establishment, stables, the annual disbursements
                    amounted to between two and three millions of francs. The support of the
                    magnificent manufactory of ∣x&gt;rceluin at Sevres, and the manufactory of
                    tapestry at Gobelins in Paris, cost a large annual sum; the expenses connected
                    with the <hi rend="italic">garde</hi><hi rend="italic">meuble,</hi> where the
                    crown jewels and royal insignia were kept, and the expense of coining medals,
                    were considerable; the establishments for the support of the museum of painting
                    and sculpture at Paris amounted to nearly three millions of francs a year; an
                    annual sum of 80,000 francs was allowed for the support of the Italian opera,
                    and a sum of 45,000 francs for the encouragement of sacred music. After the
                    revolution of 1830, the civil list of Louis Philippe was settled in 1832; and in
                    fixing his allowances the chamber had two matters to deal with; the royal
                    domains, which had hitherto been appendages of the crown, and the money-grant of
                    an annual allowance. The real property of the crown consisted of the Louvre, the
                    Tuileries with their dependencies, the Elysée Bourbon, the chateaux, houses,
                    buildings, manufactories, lands, meadows, farms, woods and forests, composing
                    the domains of Versailles, Marly, Saint Cloud, Meudon, St Germain-en-Laye,
                    Rambouillet, Compiègne, Fontainebleau, Strasburg, Bordeaux, Pau, and others. Of
                    these, the chateau of St Gennuin-en-Laye, and those of Strasburg and Bordeaux,
                    with several other items, amounting to L.626,000, were taken from the crown, and
                    made applicable to the purposes of the state. The money allowance to the king
                    was fixed at twelve millions of francs, or L.500,000 per annum; and the annual
                    sum of one million of francs, or L.41,666, was allowed to the prince royal; and
                    the allowances to the daughters were to be regulated by special laws.</p>
                <p>The system of provincial government throughout France is simple and effective.
                    The kingdom is at present divid-1 ed into eighty-six departments, with their
                    capital towns. These departments are subdivided into 362 arrondissements or
                    districts, 2842 cantons, and 39,381 communes. In each department the prefect is
                    the chief magistrate, and, as well as the sub-prefect, is paid by government in
                    proportion to the population and the extent of his jurisdiction, the salary
                    varying from 40,000 to 10,000 francs a year, whilst that of the sub-prefect is
                    4000 francs. The prefect of the department of the Seine has 100,000 francs a
                    year. To each prefecture and sub-prefecture are attached councillors <hi
                    rend="italic">(conseillers de préfecture,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">conseillers
                    d’arrondissement),</hi> who are likewise paid by government; and he has,
                    besides, a general council, composed of the most opulent and respectable persons
                    in the department, appointed by the king, which he convokes when necessary; and
                    before this council he lays all public matters for its approbation. He is at the
                    head of the police and of the national guard within his prefecture It is his
                    business to superintend all necessary repairs of public buildings, bridges,
                    fortresses, walls and barriers of close towns, 4c.; to fix the seat of <hi
                    rend="italic">voiries</hi> (for the reception of rubbish, of ful, ⅛c.),
                    slaughter-houses, and manufactories considered as dangerous to health; to direct
                    the cleaning and paving of streets and high-roads; to inspect all ports, quays,
                    common sewers, fountains, poorhouses and hospitals, prisons, &amp;c. He
                    superintends public libraries, museums, primary schools; fixes the price of
                    bread; and grants passports. He is in correspondence with all the subordinate
                    functionaries in his department, as well as with the minister of the interior,
                    from whom he receives instructions to settle the question of all general taxes,
                    and to provide for the public expenses of the department. He receives the
                    produce of the <hi rend="italic">octroi,</hi> a custom-duty levied on all
                    articles of general consumption as they enter the town; and of all the rents of
                    government entrepôts; of stalls and shambles in public markets; of
                    slaughter-houses; of the proceeds from the sale of manure; as well as fines of
                    police, and other imposts. One tenth of the octroi is only paid to the
                    government; and out of the remainder, and from other funds, he defrays all the
                    local expenses of police, lighting and cleaning streets. AU his accounts are
                    transmitted to the minister of the interior, who sends them to the <hi
                    rend="italic">cour</hi><hi rend="italic">des</hi><hi rend="italic">comptes.</hi>
                    The functions of a sub-prefect are the same as those of a prefect. A <hi
                    rend="italic">juge de paix</hi> is at the head of every canton, who has also
                    similar duties, and is, besides, employed in deciding civil suits to a certain
                    amount. The mayors of the communes possess similar powers to those of the
                    prefects of departments; and their receipts and expenses are provided for in a
                    similar manner. In case of their requiring any extra funds for local expenses,
                    they have the authority of the legislature to raise a contribution caUed <hi
                    rend="italic">centimes</hi><hi rend="italic">communaux</hi> from the inhabitants
                    of the commune. To the office of mayor are attached municipal councillors, who
                    have the same functions as the general council of the prefecture. The mayor may
                    celebrate marriages, and at <pb break="no" facs="nls:193516775"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-6775-0216"/>the <hi rend="italic">mairie</hi> of the commune a
                    marriage register is kept, as well as one of births and deaths; a notice of
                    which the relatives of the parties are obliged to deposit at the office of the
                    mayor, under a penalty of a fine in case of neglect. There is in every town a
                    commissary of police, who is paid according to its population. Paris is divided
                    into twelve <hi rend="italic">mairies,</hi> called municipal arrondissements, in
                    each of which is a mayor with two assistants. It is also distinguished from all
                    other cities by having a prefect of police, who has very extensive functions,
                    exercising all the multifarious duties of police within its precincts, having
                    under his immediate orders the whole corps of police officers, the forty-eight
                    commissaries of police belonging to Paris, and the corps of firemen.</p>
                <p>The most comprehensive, though the least ancient, order, is that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Legion d</hi><hi rend="italic">Honneur;</hi> an order instituted
                    by Bonaparte, and maintained on nearly the same plan by the Bourbons. The usual
                    title to admission is the discharge of functions, either civil or military, with
                    distinction; and, in time of war, the performance of an action of eclat. The
                    gradations are, <hi rend="italic">chevaliers,</hi> of whom the number is
                    unlimited, and very great; <hi rend="italic">officiers,</hi> who amount to no
                    less than two thousand; <hi rend="italic">commandeurs,</hi> to the number of
                    four hundred; <hi rend="italic">grand</hi><hi rend="italic">officiers,</hi> a
                    hundred and sixty; and <hi rend="italic">grand</hi><hi rend="italic">croix,</hi>
                    to the number of eighty. A member must serve several years as a chevalier before
                    becoming an officer, and the same progressively through the other ranks.
                    Admissions take place once, and frequently twice a year; a specific number being
                    allotted to each great department of the public service, the military, the
                    judicial, and the administrative.</p>
                <p>The other orders are, that of St Louis, which is strictly military; that of St
                    Michel, which dates from 1469, is limited to a hundred members, and is conferred
                    as a recompense for distinction in science, literature, or the arts. Eminent
                    professional men and artists, and the authors of discoveries of public utility,
                    constitute the members of this order. The order <hi rend="italic">du St
                    Esprit,</hi> created in 1578, and of the very highest rank, comprises princes of
                    the blood, prelates, and members of the order of St Michel; the whole being
                    limited to the number of a hundred.</p>
                <p>XIV. LAW, AND ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.</p>
                <p>In this great department France shows nothing of the backwardness apparent in her
                    situation in many other respects, but is entitled to the particular attention of
                    other nations, and of none more than our own. Law does not rest on tradition,
                    nor is it necessary to study it in a never-ending accumulation of decisions. It
                    is reduced to a compact and definite form, the result of a code formed recently,
                    and with all the benefit of the application of the knowledge of an enlightened
                    age to the principles of jurisprudence. Nothing could be more irregular than the
                    administration of justice in France before the Revolution. The first stage of a
                    process took place before judges appointed, not by the king, but by the <hi
                    rend="italic">seigneur</hi> or lord of the district. These judges had power to
                    impose a fine, to decree a short imprisonment or other correctional punishment,
                    and to give, in a civil suit, a decision subject to appeal. The <hi
                    rend="italic">seneschals</hi> and <hi rend="italic">baillis</hi> ranked a degree
                    higher, and were entitled to give a verdict in cases of importance, subject,
                    however, to an appeal to one or other of the parliaments, of which there were in
                    all thirteen in France; and which, very different from the parliaments with
                    which we are familiar, were composed of judges and public officers of rank. The
                    whole of this unharmonious mass was reduced into a simple and uniform system by
                    the National Assembly in 1791; the seignoral judges being replaced by justices
                    of the peace, and every district of importance <hi rend="italic"
                    >(arrondissement)</hi> obtaining its court, or <hi rend="italic">tribunal de
                    premiere</hi><hi rend="italic">instance.</hi> The higher courts were not added
                    till afterwards, but the judges of every description were elected by the
                    inhabitants of the province, a right which continued with them until the
                    usurpation of Bonaparte.</p>
                <p>But there remained for the National Assembly another and a much more laborious
                    work. Each province had its peculiar code, some founded on the Roman law, others
                    on tradition and local custom, but the whole replete with ambiguity and
                    discrepancy. To digest a complete body of law, that might suffice for the
                    country at large, and supersede the provincial codes, was the labour of many
                    years, and of a number of eminent lawyers. It was not completed until the
                    beginning of the present century, when it was promulgated under Bonaparte, and
                    gave to the jurisprudence and judicial constitution of France nearly the form
                    they at present bear. This body of law consists of five codes, entitled
                    respectively, 1. <hi rend="italic">Code Civil</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">2. Code</hi><hi rend="italic">de Procédure</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Civile</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> 3. <hi rend="italic">Code de
                    Commerce</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> 4. <hi rend="italic">Code d’
                    Instruction</hi><hi rend="italic">Criminelle;</hi> 5. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Code</hi><hi rend="italic">Pénal.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Code Civil,</hi> the first and by far the most
                    comprehensive of these divisions, defines the rights of persons in their various
                    capacities of citizens, parents, sons, daughters, guardians, minors, married,
                    unmarried. It next treats of property in its respective modes of acquisition and
                    possession, as inheritances, marriage portions, sales, leases, loans, bonds, and
                    mortgages.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Code de Procedure Civile</hi> prescribes the manner of
                    proceeding before the different courts of justice, beginning with the <hi
                    rend="italic">juge de paix;</hi> also the mode of carrying into effect
                    sentences, whether for the payment of damages, the distraining of goods, or the
                    imprisoning of the party condemned. It declares likewise the course to be
                    followed in transactions distinct from those of the law courts; as in
                    arbitration, taking possession of an inheritance, or a separation of property
                    between man and wife.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Code de Commerce</hi> begins by defining the duties of
                    certain officers or commercial agents, such as sworn brokers and appraisers: it
                    next treats of partnerships; of sales and purchases; of bills of exchange; of
                    shipping, freight, and insurance; of temporary suspensions of payment, and
                    bankruptcies.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Code d’Instruction</hi><hi rend="italic">Criminelle,</hi> a
                    very different but equally important division, explains the duties of all public
                    officers connected with the judicial police, whether mayors, assistants of
                    mayors <hi rend="italic">(adjoints),</hi><hi rend="italic">procureurs</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">du roi,</hi><hi rend="italic">juges</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >d’instruction,</hi> &amp;c. After prescribing the rules regarding evidence, it
                    regulates the manner of appointing juries, and the questions which fall within
                    their competency. Its further dispositions relate to the mode and nature of
                    appeals, and to the very unpopular courts authorized to try state offences,
                    termed <hi rend="italic">Cours Speciales</hi> under Bonaparte, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cours Prévotales</hi> under the Bourbons.</p>
                <p>Lastly, the <hi rend="italic">Code Pénul</hi> describes the punishments awarded
                    for offences in all the variety of gradation, from the penalties of the <hi
                    rend="italic">police</hi><hi rend="italic">correctionnelle,</hi> to the severest
                    sentence of the law. All offences are classed under two general heads; state
                    offences, such as counterfeiting coin, resisting police officers, sedition,
                    rebellion; and offences against individuals, as calumny, false evidence,
                    manslaughter, murder.</p>
                <p>These codes, the first attempt to reduce the laws of a great nation to the
                    compass of a volume, consist of a number of sections and short paragraphs, each
                    paragraph marked by a number, as a means of reference. The style is as concise
                    as is compatible with clearness. The arrangement is minute and elaborate. The
                    whole is sold for a few shillings, in the shape of one octavo or of two
                    duodecimo volumes; and copies of it are in the possession not only of all
                    judges, pleaders, and attomies, but of agents, merchants, and persons in
                    business generally, who, without being enabled by it to dispense with the aid of
                    lawyers<pb break="no" facs="nls:193516788" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6788-0217"/> in a
                    suit, find in it a variety of useful explanations relative to questions of
                    frequent occurrence in their respective occupations.</p>
                <p>The justices of the peace are very numerous, there being one for each canton, and
                    consequently nearly three thousand in the kingdom. They never are, as in
                    England, clergymen, and seldom country gentlemen, but persons acquainted with
                    law, and in circumstances which make the salary, small as it is (from L.30 to
                    L.40), an acceptable return for a portion of their time. They are not
                    unfrequently provincial attomies, or pleaders retired from business. The justice
                    of the peace, or <hi rend="italic">juge de paix,</hi> is authorized to pronounce
                    finally in petty questions (under fifty francs, or L.2); and to give, in
                    questions of somewhat greater amount (up to a hundred francs, or L.4), a
                    decision subject to appeal. He takes cognizance likewise of disputes about
                    tenants’ repairs, servants’ wages, and the displacing of the landmarks of
                    property. No action can be brought before a court of justice in France until the
                    plaintiff has summoned his adversary before a <hi rend="italic">juge</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">paix,</hi> with an amicable intent <hi
                    rend="italic">(cité en</hi><hi rend="italic">conciliation),</hi> and received
                    from the <hi rend="italic">juge a procès</hi><hi rend="italic">verbal,</hi>
                    showing that the difference could not be adjusted. When the justice is prevented
                    from acting, his place is taken by his first, and, if necessary, by his second
                    substitute.</p>
                <p>: Of the <hi rend="italic">Primary Courts</hi> there is one for every
                    arrondissement, making above three hundred and sixty for the whole of France.
                    Each is composed of three or four members, of two or three <hi rend="italic"
                    >suppléons</hi> or assistant members, and of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >procureur</hi><hi rend="italic">du roi</hi> acting on the part of the crown. In
                    populous districts, <hi rend="italic">cours</hi><hi rend="italic">de premiere
                    instance</hi> comprehend six, seven, eight, or more members, and are divided
                    into two or three chambers. They are chiefly occupied with questions of civil
                    law, and hold, in the extent of their jurisdiction, a medium between the humble
                    limits of the <hi rend="italic">juge de paix</hi> and the wide powers of the <hi
                    rend="italic">cour royales</hi> their decisions being final wherever the income
                    from a property does not exceed forty shillings, or the principal forty pounds,
                    but subject, in greater matters, to an appeal to the <hi rend="italic">cour
                    royale.</hi> The members of these inferior courts are named, like other judges,
                    by the crown, and hold their places for life; the salary of each is only L.80 a
                    year, equal to L.120 in England; their number, throughout all France, including
                    <hi rend="italic">suppléons,</hi> is not far short of 3000-</p>
                <p>A section of the <hi rend="italic">Tribunal</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Première</hi><hi rend="italic">Instance</hi> is appropriated to the trial of
                    offences, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Tribunal de Police</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Correctionnelle</hi><hi rend="italic">s</hi> and here the English
                    reader must be careful to distinguish between judicial and government police;
                    the former having no reference to state offences, such as libel or treason, but
                    comprehending a very numerous list of another kind, viz, all offences which do
                    not amount to crimes, or subject the offender to a punishment <hi rend="italic"
                    >afflictif ou infamant.</hi> These offences, when slight, are called <hi
                    rend="italic">contraventions de police,</hi> and are brought before a <hi
                    rend="italic">juge de paix,</hi> or the mayor of the commune; when of a graver
                    stamp, and requiring a punishment exceeding five days’ imprisonment, or a fine
                    of fifteen francs, they are brought before the court now mentioned, whose
                    sentences, in point of imprisonment, may extend to the term of five years. The
                    trespasses brought before a justice of the peace or mayor are such as damaging
                    standing corn, driving incautiously in the highway, endangering a neighbour’s
                    property by neglecting repairs. The offences referred to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tribunal</hi><hi rend="italic">Correctionnel</hi> are such as assault and
                    battery, swindling, privately stealing, using false weights or measures,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>We now come to the higher courts of justice, which equal in jurisdiction our
                    courts in Westminster Hall and on the circuit, but with the material
                    distinction, that in France the civil courts are always stationary. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Cours</hi><hi rend="italic">Royales,</hi> in number twenty-seven,
                    are attached to the chief provincial towns throughout the kingdom. They are all
                    formed on the same model, and possessed of equal power, though differing
                    materially in extent of business and number of members. The number of the latter
                    depends on the population of the tract of country (generally three departments),
                    subject to the jurisdiction of the court. In a populous quarter, like Normandy,
                    a <hi rend="italic">cour royale</hi> comprehends twenty, twenty-five, or even
                    thirty judges, and is divided into three or four chambers, of which one performs
                    the duty of an English grand jury, in deciding on the bills of indictment <hi
                    rend="italic">(mises en</hi><hi rend="italic">accusation)</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> another is for the trial of offences <hi rend="italic">(police</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">correctionnelle);</hi> and a third, with perhaps a fourth, is for
                    civil suits. These courts are often called <hi rend="italic">Cours d’Appel</hi>
                    as all the cases which come before them must have been previously tried by an
                    inferior court. The collective number of judges in these higher courts is not
                    short of nine hundred; an aggregate hardly credible to an English reader, and
                    which would prove a very serious charge on the public purse, were not their
                    salaries very moderate, viz. from L.100 to L.300 a year, according to the
                    population of the towns where the court is held. In the financial pressure of
                    1816 and 1817, a reduction of this numerous body was much called for; but no
                    diminution was made in the number of the courts, whatever gradual decrease may
                    be allowed to take place in the members from decease or retirement.</p>
                <p>Paris does not, like London and Edinburgh, absorb almost all the civil business
                    of the country. It has, it is true, a <hi rend="italic">cour royale</hi> on a
                    large scale (five chambers and fifty judges), but confined in its jurisdiction
                    to the metropolis and the seven adjacent departments. There is a <hi
                    rend="italic">procureur</hi><hi rend="italic">du roi</hi> for every <hi
                    rend="italic">tribunal</hi><hi rend="italic">de première</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >instance,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a procureur</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >general</hi> for every <hi rend="italic">cour</hi><hi rend="italic">d’</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">appel.</hi></p>
                <p>The Assize Courts take cognizance exclusively of criminal cases; that is, of the
                    crimes or serious offences referred to them by the <hi rend="italic">cours
                    royales.</hi> They consist of three, four, or five judges, members of the <hi
                    rend="italic">cours royales,</hi>-but never belonging to the section that finds
                    the indictments. The grand accompaniment of a French assize court is a jury,
                    which, as in England, consists of twelve members, and decides on the facts of
                    the case, leaving the application of the law to the judges. Complete unanimity
                    was at no time necessary in a French jury. At first a majority of ten to two was
                    required; but this was subsequently altered to a simple majority, with the
                    qualification that, in case of condemnation by only two voices (seven to five),
                    the verdict should be re-considered by the judges, and the party acquitted, if,
                    on taking judges and jurymen collectively, there was a majority in his favour.
                    The assizes are the only courts in France that are not stationary. They are,
                    however, generally held in the chief town of a department once in three months.
                    The costs of suit are very exactly defined by a printed <hi rend="italic"
                    >tarif;</hi> and it is a rule in criminal as in civil cases, that the party
                    condemned is liable for all.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Special Courts</hi> were constituted out of the usual
                    course for the trial of state offences. The <hi rend="italic">Cours</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Spéciales</hi> were appointed by Bonaparte, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prévotales</hi> during the period of political effervescence (fortunately short
                    lived) which succeeded the second entry of the king, and the misfortunes brought
                    on the nation by Bonaparte’s return from Elba. In both cases, the courts were
                    considered as under the influence of government, and were of course obnoxious to
                    the enlightened part of the public.</p>
                <p>The name of <hi rend="italic">Tribunal</hi> or court, is given in France to a
                    committee of five merchants, or leading tradesmen, appointed by the mercantile
                    body in every town of considerable business or population. Their competency
                    extends to all disputes occurring in mercantile business, and fall-ins? within
                    the provisions of the <hi rend="italic">code de commerce.</hi> Their <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193516801" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6801-0218"/> decisions are
                    founded on that code, and on the customs of merchants. They are final in all
                    cases below L.40. The presence of three members is necessary to form a court.
                    The duty is performed gratuitously; and the number of these courts in France is
                    about a hundred and sixty.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Court of Cassation,</hi> the highest in the kingdom, is
                    held at Paris, and is composed of three chambers, each of sixteen members and a
                    president, making, with the <hi rend="italic">premier president,</hi> a total of
                    fifty-two. Its province is to decide definitively in all appeals from the
                    decrees of the <hi rend="italic">cours royales;</hi> investigating not the facts
                    of the case, but the forms of law, and ordering, wherever these have been
                    infringed or deviated from, a new trial before another <hi rend="italic">cour
                    royale.</hi> This revision takes place in criminal as well as in civil cases.
                    The royal court chosen for the new trial is generally, for the convenience of
                    the parties, the nearest in situation to the other. The <hi rend="italic">Cour
                    de Cassation</hi> has farther powers, and of the highest kind. It determines all
                    differences as to jurisdiction between one court and another, and exercises a
                    control over every court in the kingdom. It has power to call the judges to
                    account before the minister of justice, and even to suspend them from their,
                    functions; acting thus as a high tribunal for the maintenance of the established
                    order of judicature.</p>
                <p>The minister bearing the title of Keeper of the Seals and Minister of Justice,
                    may be compared to the chancellor of England, though his patronage is much less
                    extensive, and his functions much more suitable to the station of minister. He
                    rarely acts as a judge, but exercises a general superintendence over the
                    judicial body. He is the medium between the king and the courts of justice, in
                    the same way as the minister of the home department is in regard to the civil
                    authorities. The expenses of the judicial body fall under his cognizance. The
                    <hi rend="italic">procureurs généraux</hi> and <hi rend="italic">procureurs du
                    roi</hi> throughout the kingdom address their correspondence to him; and it is
                    his province to report to the king on the alleviation of punishment, on pardons,
                    in short, on all disputed points, whether of legislation or administration.</p>
                <p>Juries were introduced into France in 1791, and confined from the beginning to
                    criminal trials; nor does there seem any wish to extend their jurisdiction to
                    civil suits. During several years there were in France grand juries constituted
                    as in England; but under Bonaparte their functions were transferred to the <hi
                    rend="italic">cours royales,</hi> on the plea that none but judges could be made
                    to understand the difference between bringing to trial and bringing to
                    punishment; and that the consequence frequently was a discharge, when a true
                    bill ought to have been found. It has in fact been questioned, whether the
                    institution of juries is advisable in a nation of which the mass is still
                    strongly tinctured with the credulity engendered by blind submission to an
                    absolute government. That the French can supply special jurymen of judgment and
                    discrimination, must be admitted by all who know how eminent are many of their
                    men of business; but by their common juries the nature of evidence is as yet
                    little understood, and considerable experience will be necessary to form to the
                    habit of deliberate reflection individuals so much more open to impressions of
                    feeling than of reasoning. Adroit pleaders have been known to obtain very
                    unexpected acquittals; and it is remarkable that all the charges against French
                    juries turn on their bias to clemency; none on a leaning towards the prosecutor,
                    whatever may be his wealth or rank. The very numerous party called <hi
                    rend="italic">Liberaux</hi> maintain, that practice only is wanting to qualify
                    their countrymen to act on juries. They demand, therefore, the restoration of
                    grand juries, and the exclusion of the executive power from interference with
                    the election of common juries, or with the appointment of <hi rend="italic"
                    >juges</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">paix,</hi> mayors, or
                    other local magistrates. These encroachments on popular rights all owe their
                    origin to Bonaparte; but they are too convenient for the executive power to be
                    readily relinquished by his successors.</p>
                <p>One of the chief improvements made by the French National Assembly was of the
                    nature which now engages the deliberation of our own parliament—a general
                    mitigation of the penal code, or rather the substitution of punishments likely
                    to be enforced, for others of such severity as in general to put their
                    application out of the question. Stealing privately in a dwelling-house was
                    formerly punishable in France by the rack and death; an extreme which prevented
                    respectable persons from bringing delinquents before a court, and tended, of
                    course, to give frequency to the offence.</p>
                <p>There still exists in France the singular practice of parties engaged in a
                    law-suit visiting the judges in private; a practice originating in an age when
                    suitors thought a personal interview the only effectual mode of explaining their
                    case, and continued in more enlightened times from that over-complaisance which
                    is the groundwork of several of the defects of the national character. Such
                    interviews are little else than an exchange of compliments; nor have the judges,
                    either before or since the Revolution, been charged with acting under the
                    influence of such <hi rend="italic">ex parte</hi> statements.</p>
                <p>The salaries of French judges must appear insignificant to an English reader; but
                    there are in that country a number of men of small patrimony but good education,
                    who have no idea of trade or of active pursuits in private life, while they
                    attach much importance to government employment; moreover, the functions of
                    judges, and in general of public officers in France, engross much less time than
                    in England.</p>
                <p>The law style of the French is much more brief than ours; their deeds, such as
                    leases, mortgages, and sales, being generally contained in a very few pages, and
                    free from obscure or antiquated phraseology.</p>
                <p>Prior to the year 1825 there existed in France no authentic documents respecting
                    the administration of criminal justice in France; and in order to know the
                    nature and the number of the crimes committed during the preceding years, it
                    would have been necessary to look back into the records of every prefecture
                    throughout the country; and such a work, besides its extreme difficulty, would
                    have been too incomplete to be of any utility.<note anchored="true"

                    Within the last seven years, however, the statistics of crime and of criminal
                    justice in France have been made familiar to the world by a series of official
                    reports, in which the details of the criminal calendars throughout France are
                    brought together and perspicuously arranged. In these reports, the crimes and
                    offences brought under consideration are divided into three great branches; the
                    first relating to such crimes as are tried before the courts of assize, with the
                    assistance of a jury; the second to offences of minor importance, decided by
                    correctional tribunals; and the third to such as are disposed of by the ordinary
                    magistrates of police. Of 6962 persons tried in the courts of assize in the year
                    1830, 3910 were for crimes against property, and 1158 for crimes against the
                    person. This latter class of offences appears to be decreasing. They amounted in
                    1825 to 2069, in 1826 to 1709, in 1827 to 1911, and in 1828 to 1844. The
                    proportion between the number of persons judicially accused of offences, and the
                    general population of the kingdom, was, in 1829, as one in 4321; and in 1830, as
                    one in 4576. Of the 6962 brought to trial in 1830, 5608 were men, and 1354 were
                    women.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193516814" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6814-0219"/>
                <p>With respect to the ages of the accused, 114 had not completed their sixteenth
                    year; and 1161 were from sixteen to twenty-one years of age. The whole of the
                    accused were natives of France, with the exception of 216. With regard to
                    education, it appears that the great majority are ignorant; 4319 could neither
                    read nor write, 1826 could only do so imperfectly, only 688 could read and write
                    well, and 129 had received a superior education. It is a curious and rather a
                    consolatory fact, that in the case of the worst crimes, the proportion of the
                    illiterate was the greatest. Thus all that were accused of parricide were
                    grossly ignorant; and rather less than one half of those accused of murder, of
                    theft, &amp;c. were in the same state. We subjoin a table containing the nature
                    of the crimes that were tried before the court of assize by a jury, the number
                    convicted, and their punishments.</p>

                <p>Μ. Goldsmith is of opinion, from an attentive examination of the French
                    establishments of criminal police, and from the character of their inmates, that
                    crimes against property are not pursued with the same boldness and systematic
                    combination as in England. Robbery is not regularly pursued there as a
                    profession. “The thieves in France,” he observes, “are not less than a century
                    behind us. The skill and combination which are necessary to the perpetration of
                    a burglary in a banking-house have hitherto been reserved among our neighbours
                    for less objectionable objects. The ordinary incentives to crime are here the
                    vulgar ones of hunger and want.” The public peace in France is maintained by an
                    armed police, or <hi rend="italic">gendarmerie,</hi> partly on foot and partly
                    mounted; and in all emergencies, whether arising from seditious meetings,
                    popular assemblies, or any other cause, when this force is found insufficient
                    for the preservation or execution of the laws, the national guard and troops of
                    the line may be called in to assist, being, however, subject to the orders of
                    the police. Since the revolution of 1830 the gendarmerie of Paris have been
                    abolished. They have been replaced by a force termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >garde</hi><hi rend="italic">municipale,</hi> the duties of which are nearly the
                    same.</p>
                <p>whom 32,575 were acquitted, 5860 were imprisoned for one year and upwards, 20,021
                    were imprisoned for less than a year, and 150,603 were amerced in a penalty of
                    sixteen francs and upwards. The petty courts have only the power of inflicting
                    five days' imprisonment and a fine of fifteen francs on the offending party. The
                    total number of cases disposed of were 112,114 fined, 4933 imprisoned, and
                    20,006 acquitted. In France, the prisons, which constitute an important
                    department of the criminal police, are under the special direction of the
                    minister of the interior. His delegates are the prefects; and the jailers or
                    governors of the prisons are called directors. In every city containing a prison
                    there is an inspector-general, who attends to the proper distribution of the
                    provisions, and sees that they are of good quality; he daily visits the prisons,
                    listens to the complaints of the prisoners, and attends to their comforts. The
                    departmental prisons are for the confinement of debtors, for persons to be
                    brought to trial for crimes, and for those who are condemned to imprisonment for
                    a shorter period than a year. The annual expense of these prisons makes part of
                    the budget of the minister of the interior, and amounts to 500,000 francs a
                    year. The other prisons <hi rend="italic">(maisons centrales)</hi> are nineteen
                    in number, and are for the confinement of prisoners whose sentence is for a
                    longer term than a year.</p>
