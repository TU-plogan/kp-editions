                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">FUST, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, a goldsmith of
                    Mayence, in the middle of the fifteenth century, and a man not more
                    distinguished for his riches than for his knowledge of the arts, shares with
                    Guttemberg and Schoeffer the glory of having invented printing. Guttemberg is
                    generally considered as the first inventor of this art; and, according to some,
                    Fust had only the merit, by no means a slight one, of supplying him with money;
                    whilst others are of opinion that the goldsmith contributed both his funds and
                    his industry towards the completion of the invention. But, however this may be,
                    a partnership was formed between them in 1450, and it appears that these
                    associates practised successively three sorts of impressions; first, the <hi
                    rend="italic">tabellary,</hi> that is, in carved tablets or plates, like our
                    engravings on wood; secondly, the <hi rend="italic">xylographie,</hi> or in
                    moveable characters of wood; and, lastly, the impression in characters cast in
                    moulds or matrices, analogous to, if not identical with, the stereotype founding
                    of the present day. There is reason to believe, however, that Fust,
                    notwithstanding his acquirements, contributed but little of his own invention to
                    the operations of the partnership contracted with Guttemberg; since the latter
                    appears to have been the first who thought of applying to regular compositions
                    the same mode which had been long practised at the foot of engravings for their
                    explanation; and since Schoeffer, iin inventing the punch, completed the
                    discovery, if indeed this ought not to be considered as the discovery itself.
                    Fust, zealous in favour of all that regarded his art, was so much delighted with
                    the invention of Schoeffer, that he gave the latter his daughter in marriage.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Biblia</hi><hi rend="italic">Sacra Latina,</hi> without
                    date, in folio, and consisting of 637 leaves, is probably the first production
                    of printing, and seems to have been executed between 1450 and 1455, during the
                    partnership of Fust and Guttemberg; but some think that the impression was
                    struck from the characters invented by Schoeffer. In 1455, difficulties arose
                    between Fust and Guttemberg, who, in consequence, separated on the 6th of
                    November. But, in reimbursements of the sums he had advanced, Fust remained
                    proprietor of the establishment, which he now carried on with Schoeffer; and to
                    this new partnership we are indebted for the Psalter, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Psalmorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Codex,</hi> of 1457, the most ancient work
                    printed with a date (reprinted in 1459, from the same characters, which also
                    served for the re-impressions of 1490, 1502, and 1516); the <hi rend="italic"

                    Fust and Schoeffer exercised printing until 1466, when Fust went to Paris, and
                    is thought to have died of the plague which then ravaged that city.</p>
                <p>Fust, the goldsmith of Mayence, and the promoter of printing, has, however, been
                    sometimes confounded with Faust the magician, whose name is associated with so
                    many imaginary horrors. The latter, born about the commencement of the sixteenth
                    century, was the son of a peasant of Weimar, or, as some say, of Rundling. He
                    was educated by one of his uncles, who caused him to study theology, and,
                    notwithstanding a strong propensity to debauchery, he completed his course, and
                    obtained the degree of doctor. But having become disgusted with this pursuit, he
                    cultivated medicine and astrology, and in particular applied himself to the
                    study of magic. From this time his historians are only insipid romancers, who
                    relate a thousand absurdities respecting him. They make him conjure up the devil
                    himself; employ an infernal spirit named Mephistopheles, with whom he made a
                    paction for twenty-four years; descend into hell, and travel through the
                    celestial spheres, as well as through all the countries of this sublunary world,
                    everywhere surrounding himself with illusions, playing mischievous pranks,
                    having commerce with Helen the wife of Menelaus, causing Alexander the Great to
                    appear to Charles V., and, lastly, to terminate the whole in a suitable manner,
                    having his neck twisted by the devil at the expiration of his compact with that
                    personage. Much more infallible than even the illustrious Mathew Laensberg,
                    Faust yearly circulated in Germany almanacks, which, being dictated by
                    Beelzebub, could scarcely fail to have great success. Such are the marvellous
                    feats related by George Rodolph Widman, who published at Franckfort, in 1587,
                    8vo, the history of John Faust, and Christopher Wagner his valet. This history,
                    or rather this romance, reprinted at Berlin in 1590, and at Franckfort in 1591,
                    re-appeared at Hamburg, 1598-1600, in three volumes 4to, with historical,
                    physical, and moral commentaries, filled with ignorance and folly; and it was
                    also translated into English, Dutch, and French. Adelung has honoured Faust with
                    an article at the end of his History of Human Follies, where will also be found
                    the <hi rend="italic">Conjurationes Fausti,</hi> but without the mysterious
                    figures which ought to have accompanied them, and by means of which the reader
                    might easily perform the same prodigies as the magician of Weimar. The Germans,
                    who are fond of the marvellous, have often brought upon the scene the descent of
                    Dr Faust to the infernal regions. Of this number are the celebrated Goethe,
                    Klinger, and J. F. Schink; whilst Trithemus, the most ancient of all, J.
                    Manlius, Schaller, Wier, Del Rio, and even Camerarius and Gesner, have
                    discoursed of Faust and his enchantments, of which Peter-Frederick Arpe has
                    favoured the world with a catalogue. But notwithstanding the testimony of these
                    writers, many others, perhaps with reason, regard this personage as entirely
                    imaginary, and consider his history as a romance intended merely for amusement.
                    Some, indeed, including Conrad Durius, are disposed to think that the legend of
                    Faust is a satire fabricated by the monks against John Fust, one of the
                    inventors of printing, who had incurred the resentment of these cenobites by
                    being concerned in a discovery which superseded their useful functions as
                    copyists of manuscripts; but others have shown that this opinion is not well
                    founded. Upon the subject of Faust, the curious reader may consult Zeltner’s <hi
