                <p><label type="entry">FULLER</label>, Da <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas,</hi> an
                    eminent historian and divine of the church of England, was born at Aldwinckle,
                    in Northamptonshire, about the year 1608. After receiving the rudiments of
                    education at home, he was sent to Cambridge, where he took the degree of
                    bachelor of arts in 1624. and that of master of arts in 1628, after having much
                    distinguished himself for industry and talent. He was chosen minister of St
                    Bennet’s parish, Cambridge, and became very popular as a pulpit orator. In the
                    year 1631 he obtained a fellowship at Sidney College, and was collated to a
                    prebend in the cathedral of Salisbury. The same year he published a poem
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">David’s hainous sin, heartìe repentance, and heavie
                    punishment.</hi> This was his first production, and it is now little known.
                    Having taken priest’s orders, he was instituted to the rectory of Broad Winsor,
                    in Dorsetshire. In 1635 he proceeded bachelor of divinity. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of the Holy War</hi> first appeared in 1640; soon after the publication
                    of which work he removed to London, and was chosen lecturer at the Savoy church
                    in the Strand. He was member of the convocation which met in 1640, and was one
                    of the select committee appointed to draw up new canons for the church. In 1642
                    he published a loyal sermon, which endangered his personal safety; and shortly
                    afterwards he joined the king at Oxford. Before he left London, however, his <hi
                    rend="italic">Holy State,</hi> had appeared. After the loss of the battle of
                    Cheviton Down in 1644, he went first to Basin-house, and then to Exeter, where
                    he was appointed chaplain to the infant princess Henrietta Maria. After the
                    surrender of Exeter in 1646, he went to London, and was chosen lecturer, first
                    of St Clement’s Church, then of St Bride's. About the year 1648 the Earl of
                    Carlisle presented him with the rectory of Waltham Abbey in Essex. Two years
                    afterwards he published <hi rend="italic">A Pisgah sight of Palestine and the
                    confines thereof; with the history of the Old and New Testament acted
                    thereon,</hi> in folio, with maps and views. In 1650 appeared his <hi
                    rend="italic">Abel</hi><hi rend="italic">Redivivus,</hi> which consists of lives
                    of reformers, martyrs, divines, and the like. In 1656 he published the <hi
                    rend="italic">Church History of Britain, from the birth of Jesus Christ to the
                    year</hi> 1648; to which was subjoined <hi rend="italic">The History of the
                    University of Cambridge since the Conquest,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of "Waltham Abbey.</hi> He removed to Crauſord in Middlesex in 1658,
                    which living had been conferred upon him. At the restoration he was reinstated
                    in his prebend of Salisbury. Soon after he obtained the degree of doctor of
                    divinity, Was appointed chaplain to his majesty, and destined for the episcopal
                    bench. This last preferment, however, was prevented by his death, which took
                    place , on the 15th of August 1661. In the year following, his principal
                    literary work, <hi rend="italic">The Worthies of England</hi> was published in
                    folio. This production is valuable on account of the information which it
                    contains relative to the provincial history of the country, and the fund of
                    anecdote and acute observation on men and manners which are profusely scattered
                    throughout it. It is, however, tainted with that elaborate display of quaint
                    conceit, vhich to a certain extent deteriorates all his productions. But this
                    affectation was the vice of the age, as well as of the author of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Worthies of England. Dr</hi> Fuller was remarkable for the
                    strength of his memory, and many almost incredible anecdotes are related of his
                    powers in this respect. It is positively affirmed that he could repeat verbatim
                    a sermon of ordinary length after once hearing it. A new edition of his
                    Worthies, with his life prefixed, appeared in 1810, in two vols. 4to.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fuller,</hi> a workman employed in the woollen manufactories
                    to mill or scour cloths, serges, and other stuffs, in order to render them more
                    thick, compact, and durable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Fvller’s</hi><hi rend="italic">Earth,</hi> a species
                    of clay much used in scouring woollen cloth and other stuffs, and thus freeing
                    them from oil and grease. Its colour is greenish white, and different other
                    shades of green. Sometimes it has a spotted colour. It is opaque, shining, and
                    resinous in the streak, very soft, and possesses a greasy feel. It falls into
                    powder with water, and melts into a brown spongy scoria before the blowpipe. In
                    England it occurs in beds; the best is found in Buckinghamshire and Surrey. When
                    good it has a greenish-white or greenish-grey colour, falls into powder when put
                    into water, appears to dissolve on the tongue like butter, communicates a milky
                    hue to water, and deposits very little sand when mixed with boiling water. It is
                    used by fullers in taking grease out of cloth before the soap is applied; and as
                    it contains a considerable proportion of alumina, the remarkable detersive
                    property which woollen cloth possesses depends upon the alumina which it thus
                    obtains. Malcolm, in his <hi rend="italic">Survey of Surrey,</hi> published in
                    1809, states the consumption of fuller’s earth for the whole Jdngdom to be about
                    6300 tons, and that Surrey alone furnished 4000 tons.</p>
