                    chaplain in ordinary to his majesty, was born in London in the year 1721, and
                    was the son of Richard Franklin, well known as the printer of an
                    anti-ministerial paper called <hi rend="italic">The Craftsman</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> in conducting which he received great assistance from Lord
                    Bolingbroke, Mr Pulteney, and other writers, who then opposed Sir Robert
                    Walpole’s measures. By the advice of the second of these gentlemen, young
                    Franklin was devoted to the church, with a promise of being provided for by the
                    patriot, who, however, forgot his undertaking, and entirely neglected him. He
                    was educated at Westminster School, whence he removed to the university of
                    Cambridge, where he became a fellow of Trinity College, and in 1750 was chosen
                    Greek professor. In 1757 he was instituted vicar of Ware and Thundridge, which,
                    with the lectureship of St Paul, Covent Garden, and a chapel in Queen Street,
                    were all the preferments he held till he obtained the rectory of Brasted in
                    Surrey, which he held till his death. He first appeared as an author in a
                    translation of The Epistles of Phalaris in 1759, and of Cicero’s tract De Natura
                    Deorum. About this period he is said to have published An Inquiry into the
                    Astronomy and Anatomy of the Ancients, reprinted in 1775, in 8vo. In 1759
                    appeared his translation of Sophocles, in 2 vols. 4to. This work is allowed to
                    be a fair and forcible version of that great tragic poet. It was followed by A
                    Dissertation on Ancient Tragedy. In 1765 Dr Franklin published a volume of
                    Sermons on the Relative Duties, which met with considerable attention. In the
                    year following he produced the Earl of Warwick, a tragedy, borrowed without
                    acknowledgment from tite French of Laharpe. Notwithstanding his clerical
                    preferments and duties, he continued to write for the stage, and on one occasion
                    descended so low as to bring out a farce. In 1780 appeared his excellent
                    translation of Lucian, in 2 vols. 4to. Dr Franklin died on the 15th of March
                    1784, leaving behind him the character of a learned, able, but jealous and
                    peculiar man. Besides the works above enumerated, he was the author of a
                    humorous piece entitled A Letter on Lectureships, An Ode on the Institution of
                    the Royal Academy, three volumes of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193516866"

                    have ' aided Smollett in the Critical Review, and in the translation of the
                    works of Voltaire.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Franklin,</hi><hi rend="italic">Betyamin,</hi> one of the
                    most distinguished men whom America has produced, was born at Boston in New
                    England, North America, on the 17th of January 1706. His ancestors were petty
                    freeholders at Eaton in Northamptonshire, and he was the youngest but two of a
                    family of seventeen children. About the year 1682 his father emigrated to
                    America, and commenced soap-boiler and tallow-chandler in the town of
                    Boston.</p>
                <p>Franklin, from his earliest years, discovered the strongest propensity towards
                    literary pursuits, which determined his father to qualify him for the ministry;
                    but he was thwarted in his designs by a numerous and increasing family, and
                    therefore Benjamin was taken from the more learned seminary, and placed under a
                    teacher of reading and writing, preparatory to his being bound to some
                    handicraft trade. At ten years of age he was withdrawn from school to take part
                    in the drudgery of his father’s trade. This greatly mortified the aspiring mind
                    of young Franklin, who would have preferred a seafaring life to such an
                    employment; but from this he was dissuaded by the influence of his father, who
                    was a man of considerable penetration and judgment. He made it his chief aim to
                    inspire his children with the love of knowledge and the principles of moral
                    rectitude. He had few books; yet from amongst these Benjamin selected a number
                    of voyages and travels, as well as different histories, a species of reading for
                    which he had a strong predilection. By going through a course of controversial
                    divinity in this unaided manner, he greatly strengthened his argumentative
                    powers, which was most probably all he had in view. Defoe upon Projects,
                    according to his own account, made impressions upon his mind which in a great
                    measure influenced the principal events of his subsequent career.</p>
                <p>He was now chosen to an employment which accorded much better with the natural
                    bent of his mind than the business of a tallow-chandler. A brother of his own
                    had a printing office in Boston, and to him Benjamin was bound apprentice at
                    twelve years of age. With the mechanical part of the business he was soon
                    acquainted; and the opportunities thus afforded him of procuring new books to
                    read were eagerly seized, and the greater part of the night frequently spent in
                    the perusal of them. He soon became anxious to imitate the works which he most
                    admired, and his first attempts were of a poetical nature. He composed and
                    printed ballads, which were well received by those who love this species of
                    reading; yet his father had the address to convince him that nature never
                    designed him for a poet. He accordingly turned his whole attention to the
                    cultivation of prose composition, in which he made great progress. He had a
                    young friend with whom he kept up an epistolary dispute, which afforded him an
                    admirable opportunity of exercising his pen. He also read with avidity and
                    attention various works, particularly Xenophon’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memorabilia,</hi> which enabled him either to confute or confound an adversary
                    by a number of questions. It is also certain that he became a sceptic as to the
                    religion in which he had been educated, and propagated his unbelief with zeal
                    and assiduity. The fatal consequences which this produced on the deportment of
                    some of his intimate companions at length happily convinced him that it is
                    extremely dangerous to destroy the salutary influence of religion, without being
                    able to substitute anything in its place of equal importance and efficacy. He
                    seems, however, to have continued a sceptic in his own mind; yet he still
                    retained a love for moral rectitude, which led him to adopt honourable means in
                    the prosecution of valuable ends. Much to his honour be it spoken, he acquired,
                    at a very early period of life, that triumph over his sensual appetites, which
                    is so essentially necessary to a life of dignity, usefulness, and virtue. Having
                    read Tyron’s recommendation of a vegetable diet, at sixteen years of age, he
                    abandoned the use of animal food; and on offering to his brother to support
                    himself on half the money which was paid for his board, he was allowed to adopt
                    his own plan, by which means he was enabled to save a considerable sum for the
                    purc)ιase of books. Although he relaxed considerably as to a vegetable diet, yet
                    he thus acquired the habit of being satisfied with little; and a contempt of the
                    gratifications of the palate was frequently of singular advantage to him
                    throughout the whole of his life.</p>
                <p>His brother having commenced a newspaper, Benjamin sent a number of pieces on
                    various topics to be inserted, which met with the approbation of the most
                    competent judges; a satisfaction he enjoyed without being known, as they were
                    all anonymous. His brother treated him with the harshness of a master, which he
                    bore with the utmost impatience, as the public had already pronounced him to be
                    possessed of merit. The states of America having prohibited James Franklin from
                    publishing this paper, on account of some political offence, the name of
                    Benjamin was employed as publisher, in consequence of which he procured his
                    indentures, although he agreed privately wiui his brother to serve out his time.
                    But having been harshly treated by his brother, he went to New York by sea, and
                    from that place to Philadelphia, in the seventeenth year of his age. He himself
                    acknowledges this to hav'e been a fault, and has therefore averted that censure
                    which he would otherwise have deserved. At Philadelphia he engaged with a
                    printer of the name of Keimer, whose affairs he soon placed on a more
                    respectable footing; and here also he became acquainted with several young men
                    of a literary turn of mind, by whose company his taste was greatly improved.</p>
                <p>Shortly after his arrival he became acquainted with Sir William Keith, at that
                    period governor of the province, who was struck with the composition and
                    penmanship of young Franklin, and strenuously advised him to commence business
                    on his own account, promising to use his influence in his favour. Encouraged by
                    this gentleman to adopt such a plan, he set out for Boston on a visit to his
                    parents, in order to procure from them some pecuniary aid; but a welcome
                    reception was all he could obtain. Having returned to Philadelphia without
                    accomplishing his object, Sir William offered to take the whole burden upon
                    himself, and advised Franklin to make a voyage to England in order to procure
                    every thing necessary for establishing a printing-office. He accordingly set
                    sail in the year 1725, and took with him his intimate companion Ralph, who has
                    been celebrated in the <hi rend="italic">Dunciad.</hi> Unfortunately for
                    Franklin, Sir William Keith, on whose letters of recommendation and credit he
                    entirely relied, deceived him, and he was compelled to work as a journeyman in
                    London for his immediate subsistence. His friend Ralph could only live by his
                    head, and his income of consequence was extremely circumscribed, as well as
                    precarious, which made him a heavy burden upon Franklin. In the dissolute
                    metropolis the one forgot his wife and child in America, and the other the
                    solemn promises of fidelity which he had made to a Miss Read prior to his
                    departure, another step of his conduct which he himself severely censures. By a
                    dissertation on liberty and necessity, pleasure and pain, he acquired
                    considerable reputation; and it was the means of introducing him to the
                    celebrated Dr Mandeville, author of the <hi rend="italic">Fable of the
                    Boes.</hi> In the second printing-office in which he worked, he laboured
                    incessantly to convince his fellow-workmen that a pint of porter does not
                    contain half so much nourishment as a penny roll, for which he obtained the
                    ludicrous epithet of the <hi rend="italic">American aquatic;</hi> yet he was
                    finally enabled to make many converts to his doctrine; <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193516879" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6879-0224"/>a proof that he possessed
                    strong persuasive powers, when we consider the deep-rooted attachment of those
                    with whom he had to treat to their favourite beverage.</p>
                <p>After eighteen months residence in London, he returned to Philadelphia in the
                    year 1726, and became clerk to a Mr Denham, a man of respectability, who had
                    opened a warehouse in that city. He soon became acquainted with the principles
                    of commerce, and led a very happy life in this new situation, till the
                    connection was dissolved by the death of Mr Denham, which happened the following
                    year. This again obliged him to become journeyman printer, and he was afterwards
                    overseer in the office of Keimer his former master.</p>
                <p>Keimer having engaged Franklin solely with the view of having his apprentices so
                    far initiated in the art that he could dispense with their instructor’s
                    services, took the first occasion to quarrel with him when he thought he had
                    sufficiently attained his object. Upon their separation, one of Keimer’s
                    apprentices, named Meredith, who, like all the others, had conceived a great
                    veneration for Franklin, proposed that they should enter into partnership
                    together, Meredith’s friends undertaking to furnish the capital necessary for
                    purchasing the materials, &amp;c. This offer was too advantageous to be refused;
                    and types, a press, and other things, were forthwith commissioned from London;
                    but whilst preparing to puttheir plan into execution, Franklin was induced,
                    during the interval, to return again to Keimer, at the urgent solicitation of
                    the latter. The motive for this humble entreaty was that individual’s having
                    taken a contract for the printing of some paper-money for the state of New
                    Jersey, requiring a variety of new cuts and types, which he knew well nobody in
                    that place but Franklin could supply. This also presents us with a very striking
                    instance of Franklin’s remarkable gift of invention. “To execute the order,”
                    says he, “I constructed a copperplate printing-press, the first that had been
                    seen in the country. I engraved various ornaments and vignettes for the bills,
                    and we repaired to Burlington together, where I executed the whole to the
                    general satisfaction, and he (Keimer) received a sum of money for this work
                    which enabled him to keep his head above water for a considerable time
                    longer.”</p>
                <p>At Burlington, Franklin formed acquaintance with all the principal personages of
                    the province, who were attracted by his superior abilities and intelligence.
                    Amongst these was the inspector-general, Isaac Decon, “who,” says Franklin, “was
                    a shrewd and subtile old man. He told me that his first employment had been that
                    of carrying clay to the brick-makers; that he did not learn to write till he was
                    somewhat advanced in life; that he was afterwards employed as underling to a
                    surveyor, who taught him his trade; and that, by industry, he had at last
                    acquired a competent fortune. ‘ I foresee,’ said he, ‘ that you will soon
                    supplant this man (speaking of Keimer), and get a fortune in the business at
                    Philadelphia.’ He was wholly ignorant at the time of my intention of
                    establishing myself there, or anywhere else.”</p>
                <p>Immediately after Franklin’s return from Burlington, the types arrived from
                    London, and the partners commenced business. They were at once successful, and
                    by his unwearied industry Franklin obtained great credit amongst his townsmen,
                    and at last found himself in circumstances to attempt a newspaper, always a
                    favourite speculation of his. The intention of the partners, however, having
                    been incautiously divulged, their old master Keimer took steps to establish a
                    paper of his own, and issued a prospectus to that effect. Franklin defeated his
                    object by the strenuous support which he gave to the paper which was then in
                    existence. He published in it a series of amusing articles, in which Keimer⅛
                    proposals were burlesqued and ridiculed. The paper, however, was published, but
                    after a short time it passed into the hands of Franklin, by whom it was very
                    ably conducted. In the mean time the partnership between him and Meredith was
                    dissolved; but, by the generous aid of friends, Franklin was enabled to take the
                    whole business upon himself, to which he added that of a stationer. When the
                    increase of paper-money engaged the attention of the American government,
                    Franklin wrote an anonymous pamphlet in defence of the measure, by which he
                    acquired considerable reputation, and the countenance of men in power. In the
                    mean time, Miss Read, the person to whom he had been engaged, was married to
                    another individual, in consequence of his neglect. But a report having gone
                    abroad that the lady’s husband was married to another woman, he retired to the
                    West Indies, where he died, and Franklin at last espoused the object of his
                    first love.</p>
                <p>To him we are to ascribe the establishment of a public library at Philadelphia,
                    which he accomplished in the year 1731. His <hi rend="italic">Poor Iłichard’s
                    Almanac</hi> was begun in 1732, and became remarkable for the many prudential
                    maxims with which it abounded; and the proverbial manner in which they were
                    expressed made them take fast hold on the memory. His political career commenced
                    in 1736, when he was chosen clerk to the general assembly of Pennsylvania, to
                    which he was re-elected for several years; and at last became a representative.
                    In 1737 he was made postmaster of Philadelphia; and in the subsequent year he
                    greatly improved the police of the city, by the formation of a fire-company, and
                    afterwards an insurance-company against losses by fire. In the war with France,
                    which broke out in 1744, when the best means of defending the province against
                    the inroads of the enemy were in discussion, and when the militia bill was
                    thrown aside from its being obnoxious to the people, Franklin suggested the idea
                    of a voluntary association for defence, which was instantly signed by 1200
                    persons, and 10,000 subscriptions were obtained in a short time by circulating
                    the proposal through the province. By this and similar means America had an
                    opportunity of ascertaining her own strength, and how to make use of it with
                    advantage in cases of emergency.</p>
                <p>About this time he began his interesting experiments on electricity, by the
                    result of which he gained an immortal name in the annals of science. The library
                    society of Philadelphia having received from Mr Peter Collinson, in the year
                    1745, an account of the facts respecting electricity, which at that time
                    engrossed the attention of philosophers in Europe, Franklin set about studying
                    the subject with the greatest assiduity. He gave the account of his researches
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">New Experiments and Observations on Electricity,
                    made at Philadelphia in America,</hi> and addressed it to Mr Collinson, in the
                    form of letters, bearing date from 1747 to 1754. They were everywhere read with
                    avidity, and universally admired, though not at first very generally in England.
                    Dr Priestley speaks of them in the following terms. “It is not easy to say
                    whether we are most pleased with the simplicity and perspicuity with which the
                    author proposes every hypothesis of his own, or the noble frankness with which
                    he relates his mistakes when they were corrected by subsequent experiments.” It
                    is unnecessary to enter into a detailed account of all his discoveries; we shall
                    therefore content ourselves with mentioning the most interesting of them all,
                    namely, that lightning and electricity are identically the same. This identity
                    had begun to be suspected, and experiments had been made in France to ascertain
                    the fact; but it was reserved to Franklin to demonstrate it by his own
                    experiments. He obtained his first decisive proof in the month of June 1752, by
                    setting up a silken kite into the air with a point of iron, and a key fastened
                    to the end of the hempen string by which he held it. In this manner he drew down
                    from a thunder-cloud a sufficient quantity of electric fire to emit sensible
                    sparks from <pb break="no" facs="nls:193516892" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6892-0225"
                    />the key. By means of an insulated iron rod which he fixed upon his house, he
                    drew down the lightning, and was thus furnished with an opportunity of
                    discovering whether it was positive or negative. As he firmly believed that
                    philosophical discoveries were only valuable in so far as they could be
                    productive of benefit to man, he made them subservient to the protection of
                    buildings from the effects of lightning, which are frequently alarming in North
                    America. He applied physics to the purposes of common life; and in 1745 invented
                    his Pennsylvania fireplaces, in which the qualities of an open grate were
                    combined with that of a stove.</p>
                <p>Politics also engaged a considerable share of his attention. He was chosen a
                    representative of the city of Philadelphia for the provincial assembly in 1747.
                    At this time a contest subsisted between the assembly and the proprietaries, as
                    to the claim of the latter to be exempted from public burdens. Franklin took the
                    popular side of the question, by which he acquired great influence, and was
                    regarded as the head of the opposition. This was not the offspring of eloquence;
                    for he seldom spoke, and never in the form of a harangue: but his pointed
                    observations, and his unadorned good sense, frequently destroyed the effect of
                    elaborate orations.</p>
                <p>He drew up the plan of an academy to be founded at Philadelphia, from a
                    conviction that education is of the utmost importance. It was carried into
                    effect in the year 1750, by virtue of a subscription, to which the proprietors
                    afterwards liberally contributed. He discharged the duties of his office as
                    postmaster of Philadelphia with so much punctuality that he was appointed deputy
                    postmaster-general for the British colonies in 1753, and the revenue was greatly
                    augmented by his exertions. A plan for conciliating the Indians, and forming an
                    alliance with them, was drawn up by Franklin in 1754, to which the commissioners
                    at Albany agreed; and a copy of it was transmitted to the British privy council.
                    It is a singular circumstance that this plan was rejected by the assemblies, as
                    giving too much power to the crown; while the British ministry declared that it
                    gave too much influence to the representatives of the people. In the year 1757
                    Franklin set sail for London, as agent for Pennsylvania, the assembly of that
                    province being involved in disputes with the proprietary. It was agreed by the
                    privy council that landholders should pay their share of the public burdens, on
                    condition that Franklin would engage they should be fairly proportioned. He
                    continued at the British court as agent for his province, and acquired so great
                    reputation that the same trust was reposed in him for Massachusetts, Maryland,
                    and Georgia. His merit as a philosopher was now justly appreciated in Europe;
                    and he was made a fellow of the Royal Society of London. The degree of LL.D, was
                    also conferred upon him at St Andrews, Edinburgh, and Oxford.</p>
                <p>In the year 1762 he returned to America, where he received the thanks of the
                    assembly of Pennsylvania, and a handsome recompense in money, for his services.
                    When the stamp-act occasioned so much disturbance in America, Dr Franklin was
                    summoned to the bar of the House of Commons to give evidence respecting the
                    dispositions of the people, whether he thought they could be induced to submit
                    to it; and the energy and clearness of his representations were instrumental in
                    procuring the repeal of that obnoxious measure.</p>
                <p>On the commencement of hostilities between Great Britain and the colonies in
                    1775, he returned to America, and was chosen a delegate to congress by the
                    legislature of Pennsylvania. In 1776 he treated with Lord Howe on the subject of
                    a reconciliation; and in one of his letters described in strong terms the temper
                    of the British nation, to which he imputed the fatal extremity which had
                    arrived. When the question of independence came to be discussed, he was
                    decidedly in favour of the measure, and was highly instrumental in bringing over
                    the public mind to the same opinion. When a negotiation with France was opened,
                    he was chosen one of the personages to reside at that court. His political
                    abilities eminently qualified him for such a station; and his character as a
                    philosopher gained him great esteem in a country where science was revered. He
                    brought about a treaty with France of an offensive and defensive nature in 1778,
                    the immediate consequence of which was a war with Britain. He was one of those
                    who signed the provisional treaty the year following. Prior to his leaving
                    Europe he concluded a treaty with Sweden and Prussia. He was recalled from this
                    station in 1785, and chosen president of the supreme executive council. His
                    increasing infirmities made him withdraw from all public business in 1788; and
                    on the 17th of April 1790 he terminated his active and useful life, in the
                    eighty-fifth year of his age.</p>
                <p>Perhaps no man ever exceeded Dr Franklin in that solid practical wisdom which
                    consists in pursuing valuable ends by the most appropriate means. His cool
                    temper and sound judgment secured him from unreasonable expectations. He saw
                    things in their true light, and predicted consequences with nearly a prophetic
                    st&gt;iril. He said of liimself, “I have always set a greater value on the
                    character of a <hi rend="italic">doer of good,</hi> than any other kind of
                    reputation.” In 1779, his <hi rend="italic">Political, Miscellaneous, and
                    Philosophical Pieces</hi> were published in 4to and 8vo. His Essays, humorous,
                    moral, and literary, were published after his death, in two small volumes, and
                    have frequently been reprinted.</p>
                <p>He was by no means inattentive to his own interest, of which his advancement in
                    life furnishes an ample proof; yet he never neglected the interest of his
                    country, or the good of mankind in general. The delicate situations in which he
                    frequently stood unavoidably exposed him to the censure of enemies; but his
                    general conduct has long ago received the approbation of his countrymen. When we
                    view him as a philosopher, we must ascribe his chief merit to his electrical
                    discoveries; yet on many other topics, such as meteorology and mechanics, he
                    evinced himself a man of great penetration. As a political writer, his chief
                    merit is clearness, energy, and simplicity; and as a miscellaneous author he
                    possesses a fund of humour which cannot fail to be at once both entertaining and
                    impressive, and a sagacity which never fails to instruct.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Franklin</hi> is the name of several counties in America,
