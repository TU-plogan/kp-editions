                <p><label type="entry">FREDERICK II</label>. king of Prussia, one of the greatest
                    warriors of the age in which he lived, was the son of Frederick-William, then
                    hereditary prince of Brandenburg, and Maria Dorothea, a princess of the house of
                    Brunswick. He was born in 1712, the year before his father Frederick I. mounted
                    the throne of Prussia. The latter was so far from being a patron of literature,
                    that he regarded nothing but what related to the military art; and most of his
                    generals, whatever their merits in their own line might be, scarcely knew how to
                    sign their names. So great indeed was the ignorance of the monarch himself, that
                    he banished from his dominions a philosopher of the name of Wolf, merely because
                    he maintained the doctrine of pre-established harmony; a theologian named Lange
                    having asserted, that on that doctrine his majesty’s grenadiers were not
                    culpable when they deserted, it being only the necessary consequence of the
                    impulse their machine had received from their Creator. His son was of a
                    disposition the very reverse of his father. Being put from his birth under the
                    care of Val de Recoule, a French lady of great merit and understanding, he
                    acquired, in his early years, not only a taste for literature in general, but a
                    predilection for the French language, which he retained through life.</p>
                <p>It is not to be supposed that a prince of the disposition above mentioned would
                    allow his son for any length of time to indulge in literary pursuits. At seven
                    years of age Frederick was taken out of the hands of Madame de Recoule, and put
                    under the care of military tutors. General Count de Finkestein, an old warrior,
                    was appointed his governor; his sub-governor was Colonel de Kalkstein, an
                    officer celebrated for his courage and experience. He was taught mathematics and
                    fortification by Major Senning; Han de Jendun, a Frenchman, instructed him in
                    other branches of knowledge; and a cadet of the name of Kenzel taught him his
                    exercises. At eight years of age he was furnished with a small arsenal stored
                    with all sorts of arms proportioned to his age and strength, of which his father
                    left him absolute master. In a short time he was named captain and chief of the
                    corps of cadets; and the young prince performed every day in miniature, with his
                    little soldiers, all the evolutions with which his father exercised his tall
                    regiment. At length he received the command of a company in his father’s
                    regiment, famous throughout all Europe, and which was composed of men of whom
                    scarcely one was short of seven French feet.</p>
                <p>Born, however, with a taste for the arts, he devoted to their cultivation every
                    moment he could steal from the vigilance of his guardians. He was more
                    particularly fond of poetry and music, and when he could find a moment’s
                    leisure, he read French authors or played on the flute; but his father,as often
                    as he surprised him playing or reading, broke his flute, and threw his books
                    into the fire. The prince, chagrined at such injurious treatment, and having a
                    great desire to visit Germany, England, France, and Italy, desired permission to
                    travel. This, however, his father would not allow, but permitted him to
                    accompany himself in the journeys which he made from time to time into Germany;
                    and, in 1728, took him to Dresden to see the king of ^Poland. By these little
                    expeditions, the desire of the prince to visit other countries was strengthened;
                    and at last he formed a resolution of Betting out without, his father’s
                    knowledge. The design was intrusted to two of the prince’s young friends, named
                    Kat and Keit; money was borrowed for the occasion, and the day of their
                    departure was fixed, when unluckily the whole project was discovered. The old
                    king, implacable . in his resentment, and considering his son as a deserter,
                    determined to put him to death. He was shut, up in the fortress of Custrin; and
                    it was with the utmost difficulty that the Count de Seckendorf, sent for the
                    purpose by the Emperor Charles VI., was able to alter the king’s resolution.
                    Vengeance, however, was decreed against the intended associates in Frederick’s
                    journey. Keit escaped the danger by flying into Holland; but Kat had not that
                    good fortune. The king first directed that he should be tried by a
                    court-martial; but as they, contrary to his expectation, only sentenced the
                    criminal to perpetual imprisonment, the revengeful monarch ordered him to be
                    beheaded. The execution was performed under the windows of the prince royal,
                    whose head was held towards the scaffold by four grenadiers; but no sooner did
                    he approach the window, and see his friend in the hands of the executioner, than
                    he stretched out his arms towards him, crying out, “Kat! Kat!" and instantly
                    fainted away. During the remainder of his life he considered capital punishments
                    with horror, and they were rare throughout the Prussian dominions while he
                    continued to reign. When the emperor had succeeded in preventing the execution
                    of Frederick, the king remarked that “Austria would one day see what a serpent
                    she had nourished in her bosom.” The royal prisoner remained a year at Custrin,
                    during which time his father wished him to learn the maxims of government and
                    finance. For this purpose Μ. de Munchow, president of the chamber of domains and
                    finances, was ordered to make him assist at all their assemblies, to consider
                    him as a simple counsellor, and compel him to work like others. The young
                    counsellor, however, though he assisted at their meetings, did not trouble
                    himself with reading acts or copying decrees. Instead of this, he amused himself
                    sometimes with reading French pamphlets, and at others with drawing caricatures
                    of the president or members of the assembly. Μ. Munchow himself was likewise
                    very useful to the prince at this time, by furnishing him with books and other
                    articles of amusement, notwithstanding the express prohibition of his
                    father.</p>
                <p>Frederick, after having passed in confinement the time above specified, was
                    recalled to Berlin, on pretence of being present at the celebration of his
                    eldest sister’s marriage with the hereditary prince of Bareith; but the real
                    reason was, that the king had now prepared a mutch for the prince himself. This
                    was the Princess Elizabeth Christina of Brunswick, niece to the empress.
                    Frederick, who was not only totally indifferent to the fair sex in general, but
                    particularly prejudiced against this princess, made some objections; his father,
                    however, overcame all obstacles with his usual arguments, his cane, and a few
                    kicks.</p>
                <p>On the celebration of this marriage, Frederick received from bis father the
                    county of Rupin. He resided in the capital of this county, named also Rupin, for
                    some time; but afterwards chose Rheinsberg for his place of abode. This town,
                    built on the sands on the confines of Mecklenburg, at that time contained only a
                    thousand inhabitants; but it was soon greatly improved by Frederick. Having put
                    over the great gate of the castle the following inscription, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Frederico</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Tranquillitatem
                    Colenti,</hi> his father was displeased with it, and hurried him from his
                    peaceful retreat into the noise and tumult of a camp. At this time the
                    succession to the crown of Poland had kindled a general war throughout Europe;
                    and the king of Prussia was to send ten thousand auxiliaries to the imperial
                    army, then commanded by Prince Eugene. The king conducted his troops in person,
                    and resolved to take this opportunity of giving his son an idea of war. At this
                    time, however, he learnt but little; and only saw, as he himself expresses<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193516931" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6931-0228"/> it, the shadow of
                    the great Eugene. That consummate general, nevertheless, did not overlook his
                    merit, but predicted that he would one day be a great captain. Frederick having
                    gone to reconnoitre the lines at Philipsburg, in his return through a very open
                    wood, was exposed to the cannon of the lines; but this neither caused him to
                    quicken his pace nor change his attitude in the least. The balls broke a number
                    of branches on every sicļe of him. Ĳe continued to converse with the generals
                    who attended him, without showing the smallest sign of apprehension. Being one
                    night at supper with Field-marshal Grumkow, the conversation turned on the young
                    Prince Eugene, who died on the Rhine; and he was asked whether that prince would
                    ever have become a great man. Frederick decided in the negative, on account of
                    young Eugene’s not having known at any period of his life how to choose a friend
                    who dared to tell him the truth.</p>
                <p>During this campaign the health of the old king was so much impaired that he was
                    obliged to leave the army; and Frederick was for some time intrusted with
                    signing all the orders in his father’s name. On the king’s recovery the prince
                    was sent to Stettin, under the care of the Prince of Dessau, that he might see
                    the fortifications of that town. He was afterwards permitted to go to Königsberg
                    to see the unfortunate Stanislaus, who had taken refuge in that place, and who
                    was no less remarkable for his philosophy and constancy than for his
                    misfortunes. With him Frederick remained for some weeks, and contracted a
                    friendship which was only dissolved by the death of Stanislaus. At last he was
                    allowed to return to his peaceful mansion at Rheinsberg, where he remained till
                    the death of his father. In this place his time was occupied alternately in the
                    study of the sciences, the cultivation of the arts, and the pleasures of
                    friendship. Philosophy, history, politics, the military art, poetry, and music,
                    agreeably succeeded each other, and had each its stated period. The prince
                    passed the greater part of the day in his library, and the remainder in the
                    society of a select company of agreeable and learned men.</p>
                <p>It was in this place that he composed his refutation of the principles of
                    Machiavel, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Anti-Ma-chiavel</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> of which he sent the manuscript to Voltaire to correct and
                    to get printed.</p>
                <p>The old king, now almost worn out with infirmity, saw with regret the
                    predilection of his son for men of letters; and, in his peevish fits, often
                    threatened the whole society with confinement in the fortress of Spandau. These
                    threats frequently occasioned a violent alarm among the joyous society assembled
                    at Rheinsberg, which it required all the eloquence of Frederick to quiet. Their
                    apprehensions on this account were at last removed, for the old monarch expired
                    upon the 31st of May 1740, leaving the throne to Frederick.</p>
                <p>The acquisition of a kingdom did not abate Frederick’s passion for literature,
                    though now obliged to perform the duties of a king. A consideration of his
                    transactions in this character belongs to the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Prussia,</hi> to which the reader is referred. These, indeed, so totally
                    engrossed the remaining part of his life, that little more remains to be said
                    than to relate some anecdotes by which we may be able to illustrate the
                    character of this very remarkable individual.</p>
                <p>It has already been mentioned, that in the early part of his life Frederick had
                    conceived a great inclination to travel. This passion seems not to have been
                    extinguished by the splendour of his new situation; for having, soon after his
                    accession, gone into Westphalia to receive the homage of the inhabitants, he
                    formed a resolution of proceeding <hi rend="italic">incognito</hi> as far as
                    Paris. Being discovered at Strasburg, however, he laid aside the design of
                    proceeding to Paris, and exchanged it for a visit to his states in Lower
                    Germany. Here lie wrote to Voltaire, informing him that he should come <hi
                    rend="italic">incognito</hi> to visit him at Brussels; but becoming indisposed
                    in the little palace of Meuse, two leagues from Cleves, he wrote again to that
                    philosopher, informing him that he expected he should make the first advances.
                    The following curious account is given by that celebrated writer of his
                    reception. “The only guard I found at the gate was one soldier. The privy
                    counsellor Bambonet was cooling his heels in the court: he had large ruffles of
                    dirty linen; a hat full of holes; and an old magisterial peruke, one end of
                    which descended as low as his pockets, and the other scarcely reached his
                    shoulder. I was conducted into his majesty’s apartment, where there was nothing
                    but bare walls. I perceived in a cabinet, by the glimmering of a taper, a
                    truckle bed, two feet and a half wide, on which lay a little man muffled up in a
                    night-gown of coarse blue cloth. This was the king, in a strong perspiration,
                    and even trembling, under a wretched blanket, in a violent fit of the ague. I
                    bowed to him; and began by feeling his pulse, as if I had been his first
                    physician. The fit over, he dressed himself and sat down to table. Algarotti,
                    Keyserling, Maupertuis, the king’s minister to the States General, and myself,
                    composed the party; and we conversed profoundly on the immortality of the soul,
                    on liberty, and the androgynes of Plato.”</p>
                <p>As Frederick had espoused his princess entirely contrary to his inclination, it
                    was imagined that on his accession to the throne he would embrace the
                    opportunity of setting himself free from an engagement so disagreeable to
                    himself. The queen was not without suspicions of this kind, insomuch that she
                    was on the point of fainting away when he made his first visit to her. To the
                    surprise of all parties, however, he made her a very affectionate speech,
                    apologizing for his indifference, and inviting her to participate with him the
                    throne of which she was so worthy. In the first year of his reign he restored
                    the Academy of Sciences at Berlin, which had been founded in 1700; but he soon
                    became disgusted with its members, whom he endeavoured at all times to ridicule
                    rather than encourage. His war with the queen of Hungary, however, which took
                    place almost immediately after bis accession, for some time prevented him from
                    taking such an active part in literary matters as he was naturally inclined to
                    do. After the peace, being at liberty to follow his inclination, he gave full
                    scope to his passion for literature; and in the interval betwixt the conclusion
                    of the first war and beginning of that of 1736, he composed most of the works
                    which are now ascribed to him. At this time he wrote his <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of his own Times,</hi> afterwards announced among his posthumous works.
                    In writing history he acquired a taste for historians, and justly gave the
                    preference to the ancients, the most celebrated of whose works he perused every
                    year. Voltaire was his principal literary correspondent, whom he invited to
                    reside with him. Afraid of losing his liberty, however, that philosopher
                    hesitated, excused himself, and entered into pecuniary treaties, first for
                    himself, and afterwards for hia niece, Madame Dennis, whom he wished to
                    accompany him. At last he was determined by seeing a poem from Frederick to Μ.
                    d’Arnaud, in which the latter war compared to the rising, and Voltaire to the
                    setting sun. By this Voltaire was so much piqued, that he set out for Berlin
                    without delay, and arrived there in June 1750. He was received in the most
                    magnificent and affectionate manner, and for some time his situation was very
                    agreeable; but the disputes and rivalship which took place betwixt him and
                    Maupertuis soon threw every thing into confusion. In these the king interfered
                    in a manner which was certainly below his dignity; and he often exercised<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193516944" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6944-0229"/> himself in making
                    a jest of the other men of letters in a way exceedingly disgusting, and which
                    induced many of them to leave him. The squabbles with Voltaire ended at last in
                    a final quarrel with that wit, and his departure from the kingdom. The restless
                    disposition of Frederick showed itself after his departure, by his attempts to
                    provoke the literati who remained at his court to quarrel with him as Voltaire
                    had been accustomed to do. But they were of too passive a disposition to gratify
                    him in this respect; choosing rather to suffer the most mortifying strokes of
                    raillery, or to leave the kingdom altogether, than to contend with him. This
                    proved so uneasy to the king, that he one day exclaimed, “Shall we have no more
                    quarrels, then ?” The breaking out of the war in 1756, however, put a stop to
                    his diversions, and afforded him as many enemies as he could wish. The exploits
                    he performed during the seven years which this unequal contest lasted are almost
                    incredible; and it is amazing how the fortitude and resolution of any person
                    could enable him to sustain the difficulties which, during this period, he had
                    to encounter. In one fatal moment, indeed, even the resolution of Frederick was
                    on the point of giving way. This happened after the battle of Colin, when his
                    affairs seemed altogether desperate, till they were retrieved by the victory at
                    Rosbach. At this time he wrote to his sister at Bareith that he was on the point
                    of putting an end to his own life; but as this resolution did not extinguish in
                    him the love of glory, he wished to have it said (hat he made verses on the
                    brink of the grave. With this view he wrote a long poetical epistle to the
                    Marquis d’Argens, in which he communicated to him his design, and bade him
                    farewell.</p>
                <p>Happily at last the king’s affairs took a better turn, and these desperate
                    thoughts were abandoned. His constitution, however, was irreparably injured by
                    the excessive fatigues which he had undergone. Soon after the conclusion of the
                    peace his body began to bend, and his head to incline to the right side. By
                    degrees he became very infirm; he was tormented with the gout, and a victim to
                    dyspepsia. All his distempers, however, were borne with invincible patience;
                    and, till a very short time before his death, he never ceased to attend his
                    reviews, or visit the different provinces of his dominions. He has been known to
                    review his troops, and gallop through the ranks as if he felt no pain,
                    notwithstanding that an abscess, which had approached to suppuration, frequently
                    touched the saddle. In August 1785 he impaired his health still further by
                    assisting at a review, where he was exposed, without even a cloak, to a heavy
                    rain for four or five hours. On his return to Potzdam he was seized with a
                    fever, and, for the first time, became unable to assist at the military
                    exercises which took place in September. His malady, however, did not prevent
                    him from dictating the disposition of these exercises during the three, days
                    which they occupied, and he always gave the word in presence of his generals and
                    the foreigners of distinction then at Potzdam. About the end of autumn the fever
                    left him, but was succeeded by a violent cough; and he continued free from the
                    gout, which had usually attacked him at this season. He was greatly weakened by
                    the cough, which prevented him from sleeping; but this did not in the least
                    interrupt him in the execution of his duties. Every morning, at four or five
                    o’clock, he ordered the three cabinet secretaries to enter his apartment, where
                    he dictated answers to their papers. It was not till after the dispatch of all
                    his affairs that he saw a surgeon, or sometimes a physician, though he had a bad
                    opinion of the physicians in general, whom he consulted on his distemper. In the
                    evening he amused himself from five to eight with some of his society; and after
                    that hour he passed the remainder of the time before he went to rest in hearing
                    some ancient authors read to him; and thus he continued to employ himself till
                    the day preceding his death. On the 17th and J 8th of May 1786, he was unable to
                    assist at the ordinary reviews, but still he hoped to be present at those of
                    Silesia. He several times attempted to mount his horse to go to the parade at
                    Potzdam; but finding his powers insufficient, he was obliged to return, after
                    having proceeded a few paces. He made other attempts, but with as little
                    success; and at last his disorder terminated in a dropsy. Being now no longer
                    able to remain in bed, he sat day and night in an arm chair with springs which
                    could be moved at pleasure. For near a month before his death the swelling of
                    his feet gave him violent pain, so that he wished an incision to be made; but
                    the surgeon refused to perform the operation, suspecting that it might hasten
                    his death. Nature, however, accomplished his desires; his right leg opened, and
                    discharged such a quantity of matter, that he was greatly relieved; and those
                    unacquainted with the medical art began to entertain hopes of his recovery. The
                    physicians, however, were of a very different opinion; and theevent justified
                    their apprehensions. On the 16th of August 1786 his throat began to rattle
                    violently, and his attendants expected every moment that he would breathe his
                    last. In this situation his three secretaries entered the room for the dispatch
                    of business as usual. Even then Frederick made an effort to collect his force,
                    giving them a sign to wait, as if he would speak with them in a short time.
                    This, however, was the last he could make, for he soon fell into a stupor,
                    though from this he recovered so far as to be able to speak. In the evening he
                    asked what o’clock it was, and on being answered that it was nine, he said,
                    “Well, then, I am going to rest.” His respiration and voice became gradually
                    more feeble; and he expired on Thursday, at nineteen minutes after two in the
                    morning, without any convulsion or symptom of pain.</p>
                <p>This great monarch was of the middle size, had large blue eyes, and a piercing
                    look. He spoke German incorrectly, and in a very rough manner; but talked French
                    very fluently, and his voice was then mild and agreeable. His constitution was
                    naturally feeble, but he had greatly improved it by his activity and laborious
                    life. He had the art of relieving everyone from that embarrassment which
                    frequently occurred in accosting such a celebrated monarch; and it seems
                    probable that he himself considered on what he should say to any illustrious
                    person who happened to come to his court. His universal knowledge enabled him to
                    converse on all subjects; and thus he talked of war with military men, of verses
                    with poets, of agriculture with farmers, jurisprudence with lawyers, commerce
                    with merchants, and politics with Englishmen. He had a very retentive memory,
                    was attached to gardening, and likewise took great pleasure in dogs, of which
                    animals he constantly kept a number about him. In company he was fond of asking
                    questions and jesting, in which last he proceeded such lengths as undoubtedly
                    was unbecoming in a superior towards his inferiors, who would not have failed to
                    resent such jokes from persons more on an equality with them. In military
                    affairs he was excessively severe, not to say cruel; of which the following
                    anecdote may serve as an instance. In the first war of Silesia, wishing to make
                    some alterations in his camp during the night, he forbade every person, under
                    pain of death, to keep, after a certain hour, a fire or other light in his tent.
                    He himself went the rounds; and in passing the tent of a Captain Zietern he
                    perceived a light. Entering the tent, he found the captain sealing a letter to
                    his wife, for whom he had a great affection. “What are you doing there ?” says
                    the king. <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Do you</hi> not know the
                    order ?” The captain fell on his knees and asked pardon, but did not attempt to
                    make any excuse. “Sit down,"</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193516957" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6957-0230"/>
                <p>says Frederick, “and add a few words which I am going to dictate to you.” Zietern
                    obeyed; and the king dictated, “To-morrow I shall perish on a scaffold.” The
                    unfortunate man wrote them, and next day he was barbarously executed. In matters
                    of domestic legislation he was more arbitrary than just; of which we have a
                    notable example in the famous case of Arnold the miller. The man had refused to
                    pay the rent of the mill which he possessed, on pretence that the stream which
                    turned it had been diverted into a fish-pond. This was evidently a frivolous
                    excuse, because the water which ran into the pond also ran out of it into the
                    same channel as before, so that little or nothing could be lost. The judges
                    therefore gave sentence against the miller; but the king not only reversed their
                    sentence, but disgraced them. For this he was celebrated through all the
                    newspapers in Europe; and yet he was in the wrong, and afterwards even
                    acknowledged himself to have been so; but, notwithstanding that he knew his
                    error, he not only made no reparation to the parties whom he had injured, but
                    allowed them to lie in prison at Spandau during his life, and they were only
                    released at the commencement of the succeeding reign.</p>
                <p>The literary pieces of this monarch cannot be considered as extraordinary,
                    although they are undoubtedly remarkable as the production of a monarch, a
                    considerable portion of whose life was spent in war. Voltaire boasts of having
                    corrected his works, and others of having furnished him with materials for his
                    history. In the former part of his life he entertained a great partiality for
                    the French learning and language; but as he advanced in years he entirely lost
                    this predilection, and inclined much more to favour the English and Germans.
                    Towards the close of his career, indeed, he affected a contempt for the French,
                    without whom, it is said, he would scarcely ever have made any figure except in
                    military affairs.</p>
                <p>His works are voluminous, and embrace a variety of subjecte. Those on which his
                    fame as an author principally rest are, his History of his own Times; The
                    History of the Seven Years’ War; The Art of War, a poem; An Essay on Forms of
                    Government, and on the Duties of Sovereigns; Considerations on the State of
                    Europe; and Memoirs of the House of Brandenburg. He also compiled the
                    Frederician Code with skill and judgment. Many editions of his writings have
                    been published. Of these, the best are the Berlin edition of 1788, in 15 vols.,
                    and another of 1790, with his life prefixed, in 25 vols. 8vo.</p>
