                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Under</hi> this head we propose, first, to give an account
                    of the rise, progress, and modifications of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Sinking
                    Fund,</hi> accompanied with some observations as to the probability of its
                    accomplishing the object for which it was instituted; and, next, briefly to
                    consider the best mode of providingfor our annual expenditure both in war and
                    peace, —an inquiry necessarily involving the policy of that <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >System of Funding</hi> of which the sinking fund was long considered as one of
                    the principal recommendations and props.</p>
                <p>I. On the subject of the sinking fund, we shall have frequent occasion to refer
                    to the statements of Professor Hamilton, in his very valuable publication
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">An Inquiry concerning the Rise and Progress, the
                    Redemption, and Present State of the National Debt of Great Britain.</hi> “The
                    first plan for the discharge of the national debt, formed on a regular system,
                    and conducted with a considerable degree of firmness,” says this able writer,
                    “was that of the sinking fund, established in 1716. The author of this plan was
                    the Earl of Stanhope; but as it was adopted under the administration of Sir
                    Robert Walpole, it is commonly denominated from him. The taxes which had before
                    been laid on for limited periods, being rendered perpetual, and distributed
                    among the <hi rend="italic">South Sea, Aggregate,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >General Funds,</hi> and the produce of these funds being greater than the
                    charges upon them, the surpluses, together with such further surpluses as might
                    afterwards accrue, were united under the name of the <hi rend="italic">Sinking
                    Fund,</hi> being appropriated for the discharge of the national debt, and
                    expressly ordained to be applicable to no other purpose whatever. The legal
                    interest had been reduced from six to five per cent about two years before; and
                    as that reduction was unfavourable to the commercial state of the country,
                    government was now able to obtain the same reduction on the interest of the
                    public debt, and apply the savings in aid of the sinking fund. In 1727 a further
                    reduction of the interest of the public debt, from five to four per cent, was
                    obtained, by which nearly L.400,000 was added to the sinking fund. And, in the
                    year 1749, the interest of part of the debt was again reduced to three and a
                    half per cent, for seven years, and to three per cent, thereafter; and, in 1750,
                    the interest of the remainder was reduced to three and a half per cent, for five
                    years, and to three per cent, thereafter, by which a further saving of about
                    L.600,000 was added to the sinking fund.”</p>
                <p>This sinking fund was for some time regularly applied to the discharge of debt.
                    The sums applied from 1716 to 1728 amounted to L.6,648,000, being nearly equal
                    to the additional debt contracted in that time. From 1728 to 1733, L⅛000,000
                    more were paid. The interest of several<pb break="no" facs="nls:193517152"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-7152-0245"/> loans, contracted between 1727 and 1732, was
                    charged upon surplus duties, which, according to the original plan, ought to
                    have been appropriated to the sinking fund.</p>
                <p>“Soon after, the principle of preserving the sinking fund inviolable was
                    abandoned. In 1733, L.500,000 was taken from that fund, and applied to the
                    services of the year.” “In 1734, L.l,200,000 was taken from the sinking fund for
                    current services; and in 1735 it was anticipated and mortgaged.” The produce of
                    the sinking fund, at its commencement in 1717, was L.323,437. In 1776, it was at
                    its highest amount, being then L.3,166,517; in 1780, it had sunk to
                    L.2,403,017.</p>
                <p>“The sinking fund would have risen higher, had it not been depressed, especially
                    in the latter period, by various encroachments. It was charged with the interest
                    of several loans, for which no provision was made; and, in 1772, it was charged
                    with an annuity of L.100,000, granted in addition to the civil list. During the
                    three wars which were waged while it subsisted, the whole of its produce was
                    applied to the expense of the war; and even in time of peace, large sums were
                    abstracted from it for current services. According to Dr Price, the amount of
                    public debt paid off by the sinking fund, since its first alienation in 1733,
                    was only three millions, paid off in 1736 and 1737; three millions in the peace
                    between 1748 and 1756; two millions and a half in the peace between 1763 and
                    1775; in all, eight millions and a half.</p>
                <p>“The additional debt discharged during these periods of peace was effected, not
                    by the sinking fund, but from other sources.</p>
                <p>“On the whole, this fund did little in time of peace, and nothing in time of war,
                    to the discharge of the national debt. The purpose of its inviolable application
                    was abandoned, and the hopes entertained of its powerful efficacy entirely
                    disappointed. At this time, the nation had no other free revenue, except the
                    land and malt-tax granted annually; and as the land-tax during peace was then
                    granted at a low rate, their produce was inadequate to the expense of a peace
                    establishment, on the most moderate scale. This gave occasion to encroachments
                    on the sinking fund. Had the land-tax been always continued at 4s. in the pound,
                    it would have gone far to keep the sinking fund, during peace, inviolate.”</p>
                <p>This fund terminated in 1786, when Mr Pitt’s sinking fund was established.</p>
                <p>To constitute this new fund, one million per annum was appropriated to it by
                    parliament, the capital stock of the national debt then amounting to
                    L.238,231,248.</p>
                <p>This million was to be allowed to accumulate at compound interest, by the
                    addition of the dividends on the stock which it purchased, till it amounted to
                    four millions, from which time it was not further to increase. The four millions
                    were then annually to be invested in the public funds as before, but the
                    dividends arising from the stock purchased were no longer to be added to the
                    sinking fund for the purpose of being invested in stock; they were to be applied
                    to the diminution of taxes, or to any other object that parliament might
                    direct.</p>
                <p>A further addition to this fund was proposed by Mr Pitt, and readily adopted, in
                    1792, consisting of a grant of L.400,000 arising from the surplus of the
                    revenue, and a further annual grant of L.200,000; but it was expressly
                    stipulated that no relief from taxation should be given to the public, as far as
                    this fund was concerned, till the original million, with its accumulations,
                    amounted to four millions. The addition made to the fund, by the grant of
                    L.400,000, and of L.200,000 per annum, together with the interest on the stock
                    these sums might purchase, were not to be taken or considered as forming any
                    part of the four millions. At the same time (in 1792), a sinking fund of a new
                    character was constituted. It was enacted, that besides a provision for the
                    interest of any loan which should thenceforward be contracted, taxes should also
                    be imposed for a one per cent, sinking fund on the capital stock created by it,
                    which should be exclusively employed in the liquidation of such particular loan;
                    and that no relief should be afforded to the public from the taxes which
                    constituted the one per cent, sinking fund, until a sum of capital stock, equal
                    in amount to that created by the loan, had been purchased by it. That being
                    accomplished, both the interest and sinking fund were to be applicable to the
                    public service. It was calculated, that, under the most unfavourable
                    circumstances, each loan would be redeemed in forty-five years from the period
                    of contracting for it. If made in the three per cent., and the price of that
                    stock should continue uniformly at 60, the redemption would be effected in
                    twenty-nine years.</p>
                <p>In the years 1798, 1799, and 1800, a deviation was made from Mr Pitt’s plan of
                    providing a sinking fund of one per cent, on the capital stock created by every
                    loan; for the loans of those years had no sinking fund attached to them. The
                    interest was charged on the war-taxes; and, in lieu of a one per cent, sinking
                    fund, it was provided that the war-taxes should continue during peace, to be
                    then employed in their redemption, till they were all redeemed.</p>
                <p>In 1802, Lord Sidmouth, then Mr Addington, was chancellor of the exchequer. He
                    being desirous of liberating the war-taxes from the charges with which they were
                    encumbered, proposed to raise new annual permanent taxes for the interest of the
                    loans of which we have just spoken, as well as for that which he was under the
                    necessity of raising for the service of the year 1802; but he wished to avoid
                    loading the public with additional taxes for a one per cent, sinking fund on the
                    capitals created by those loans, and which capitals together amounted to
                    L.86,796,375. To reconcile the stockholder to this arrangement, he proposed to
                    rescind the provision which limited the fund of 1786 to four millions, and to
                    consolidate the old and the new sinking funds, t’. e. that which arose from the
                    original million per annum, with the addition made to it of L.200,000 per annum
                    subsequently granted, and that which arose from the one per cent, on the capital
                    of every loan that had been contracted since 1792. These combined funds he
                    proposed should from that time be applied to the redemption of the whole debt
                    without distinction; that the dividends arising from the stock purchased by the
                    commissioners for the reduction of the national debt should be applied in the
                    same manner; and that this arrangement should not be interfered with till the
                    redemption of the whole debt was effected.</p>
                <p>In February 1803 the debt amounted to L.480,572,470, and the produce of the joint
                    sinking fund to L.6,311,626. In 1786 the proportion of the sinking fund to the
                    debt was as 1 to 238, in 1792 as 1 to 160, and in 1803 as 1 to 77.</p>
                <p>This was the first deviation of importance from Mr Pitt’s plan; and this
                    alteration made by Lord Sidmouth was not, perhaps, on the whole, injurious to
                    the stockholder. He lost, indeed, the immediate advantage of an additional
                    sinking fund of L.867,963, the amount of one per cent, on the capitals created
                    by the loans of 1798, 1799, 1800, and 1802; “but in lieu,” says Mr Huskisson,
                    “of this sinking fund, a reversionary sinking fund was created, to commence,
                    indeed, in about twelve to fifteen years from that time, but to be of such
                    efficacy when it should commence, and to be so greatly accelerated by subsequent
                    additions in its progress, as, under the most unfavourable supposition, to be
                    certain of reducing the whole of this debt within forty-five years. This
                    reversionary sinking fund was to arise in the following manner; by continuing
                    the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> sinking fund at <hi rend="italic">compound</hi>
                    interest, <hi rend="italic">after</hi> it should have reached its <hi
                    rend="italic">maximum</hi> of four millions: and by continuing also the <hi
                    rend="italic">neu&gt;</hi> sinking fund or aggregate of the one per cents of the
                    loans <pb break="no" facs="nls:193517165" xml:id="kp-eb0710-7165-0246"/>since
                    1792, after such one per cents should have liquidated' the several loans in
                    respect of which they are originally issued. There is nothing, therefore, in the
                    act of 1802 which is a departure from the spirit of the act of 1792."<note

                <p>The next alteration that was proposed to be made in the sinking fund was in 1807,
                    by Lord Henry Petty, then chancellor of the exchequer. His plan was extremely
                    complicated, and had for its object, that which ministers are too much disposed
                    at all times to view with complacency, namely, to lessen the burden of taxation
                    at the present, with the certainty of aggravating its pressure at a future
                    day.</p>
                <p>It was estimated by Lord Henry Petty, that the expenses of the country during war
                    would exceed its permanent annual revenue by thirty-two millions. For twenty-one
                    millions of this deficiency, provision was made by the war-taxes; the
                    property-tax amounting to L.11,500,000, and the other war-taxes to L.9,500,000.
                    The object then was to provide eleven millions per annum. If this sum had been
                    raised by a loan in the three per cents, when their price was 60, provision must
                    have been made by taxes for the interest and sinking fund, so that each year we
                    should have required additional taxes to the amount of L.733,333. But government
                    wished to raise the money without imposing these additional taxes, or by the
                    imposition of as few as circumstances would permit. For this purpose they
                    proposed to raise the money required, by loan, in the usual way, but to provide,
                    out of the war-taxes, for the interest and redemption of the stock created. They
                    proposed to increase the sinking fund of every such loan, by taking from the
                    war-taxes ten per cent, on its amount for interest and sinking fund, so that if
                    the interest and management absorbed only five per cent., the sinking fund would
                    also amount to five per cent.; if the interest amounted to four per cent., the
                    sinking fund would be six per cent. The sums proposed to be borrowed in this
                    manner were twelve millions for the first three years, fourteen millions for the
                    fourth, and sixteen millions for each succeeding year; making together, in
                    fourteen years, 210 millions, for which, at the rate of ten per cent., the whole
                    of the war-taxes would be mortgaged. It was calculated, that, by the operation
                    of the sinking fund, each loan would be paid off in fourteen years from the time
                    of contracting for it; and, therefore, the L.l,200,000 set apart for the
                    interest and sinking fund of the first loan would be liberated and available for
                    the loan of the fifteenth year. At the end of fifteen years a like sum would be
                    set free, and so on each succeeding year; and thus loans might be continued, on
                    this system, without any limitation of time.</p>
                <p>But these successive sums could not be withdrawn from the war-taxes, for interest
                    and sinking fund on loans, and be at the same time applied to expenditure; and,
                    therefore, the deficiency of eleven millions, for which provision was to be
                    made, would, from year to year, increase as the war-taxes became absorbed; and
                    at the end of fourteen years, when the whole twenty-one millions of the
                    war-taxes would be absorbed, instead of eleven millions, the deficiency would be
                    thirty-two millions.</p>
                <p>To provide for this growing deficiency, it was proposed to raise supplementary
                    loans, increasing in amount from year to year; and for the interest and sinking
                    fund on such loans, provision was to be made in the usual way by annual
                    permanent taxes; on these loans the sinking fund was not to be more than one per
                    cent.</p>
                <p>By the plan proposed, in fifteen years from its commencement, on the supposition
                    of the war continuing so long, the regular loan would have been twelve millions,
                    and the supplementary loan twenty millions.</p>
                <p>If the expenses of the war should <hi rend="italic">have exceeded</hi> the
                    estimate then made, provision for such excess was to <hi rend="italic">have
                    been</hi> made by other means.</p>
                <p>The ministry who proposed this plan not continuing in office, it was acted upon
                    only for one year. “In comparing the merit of different systems," says Dr
                    Hamilton, “the only points necessary to be attended to are the amount of the
                    loans contracted—the part of these loans redeemed—the interest incurred—and the
                    sums raised by taxes. The arrangements of the loan under different branches, and
                    the appropriation of particular funds for payment of their respective interests,
                    are matters of official regulation; and the state of the public finance is
                    neither the better nor the worse, whether they be conducted one way or other. A
                    complicated system may perplex and mislead, but it can never ameliorate.”
                    Accordingly, Dr Hamilton has shown, that the whole amount of taxes that would
                    have been paid in twenty years, for an annual loan of eleven millions on the old
                    plan of a sinking fund of one per cent., would be 154 millions. On Lord Henry
                    Petty’s plan, these taxes would, in the same time, have been ninety-three
                    millions,—a difference in favour of Lord Henry Petty’s plan, of fifty-one
                    millions; but to obtain this exemption we should have been encumbered with an
                    additional debt ofL.119,489,788of money capital, which, if raised in a three per
                    cent, stock at 60, would be equal to a nominal capital of L.199,149,646.</p>
                <p>The sinking fund was established with a view to diminish the national debt during
                    peace, and to prevent its rapid increase during war. The only wise and good
                    object of war-taxes is also to prevent the accumulation of debt. A sinking fund
                    and war-taxes are only useful while they are strictly applied to the objects for
                    which they are raised; they become instruments of mischief and delusion when
                    they are made use of for the purpose of providing the interest on a new debt</p>
                <p>In 1809, Mr Perceval, who was then chancellor of the exchequer, mortgaged
                    L.l,040,000 of the war-taxes for the interest and sinking fund of the stock he
                    funded in that year.</p>
                <p>By taking more than a million from the war-taxes, not for the annual expenditure,
                    but for the interest of a loan, Mr Perceval rendered it necessary to add one
                    million to the loan of the next and all following years; so that the real effect
                    of this measure differed in no respect from one which should have taken the same
                    sum annually from the sinking fund.</p>
                <p>In 1813, the next and most important alteration was made in the sinking fund. Mr
                    Vansittart was then chancellor of the exchequer. It has been already observed,
                    that the national debt amounted toL.238,231,248 in 1786, when Mr Pitt
                    established his sinking fund of one million. By the act of 1786, as soon as the
                    sum of one million amounted, by the aid of the dividends on the stock which was
                    to be purchased by it, to four millions, its accumulation was to cease, and the
                    dividends on the stock purchased were to be available for the public service. If
                    the three per cents were at sixty when this million had accumulated to four
                    millions, the public would have had a disposable fund of L.20,000 per annum; if
                    at eighty, of L.15,000 per annum; and no other relief was to be given to the
                    public till the four millions had purchased the whole sum of 238 millions, the
                    then amount of the debt. In 1792, Mr Pitt added L.200,000 per annum to the
                    sinking fund, and accompanied it by the following observations: “When the sum of
                    four millions was originally fixed as the limit for the sinking fund, it was not
                    in contemplation to issue more annually from the surplus revenue than one
                    million; consequently, the fund would not rise to four <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193517178" xml:id="kp-eb0710-7178-0247"/>millions till a proportion of
                    debt was paid off, the interest of which, together with the annuities which
                    might fall in in the interval, should amount to three millions. But as, on the
                    present supposition, additional sums beyond the original million are to be
                    annually issued from the revenue, and applied to the aid of the sinking fund,
                    the consequence would be, that if that fund, with these additions carried to it,
                    were still to be limited to four millions, it would reach that amount, and cease
                    to accumulate, before as great a portion of the debt is reduced as was
                    originally in contemplation.” “In order to avoid this consequence, whicłi would,
                    as far as it went, be a relaxation in our system, I should propose, that
                    whatever may be the additional annual sums applied to the reduction of debt, the
                    fund should not cease to accumulate till the interest of the capital discharged,
                    and the amount of the expired annuities, should, together with the annual
                    million only, and exclusive of any additional sums, amount to four
                    millions.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr Pitt’s
                    Speech, 17th February 1792.</p></note></p>
                <p>It will be recollected, that in 1792 a provision was made for attaching a sinking
                    fund of one per cent, to each loan separately, which was to be exclusively
                    employed in the discharge of the debt contracted by that loan; but no part of
                    these one per cents were to be employed in the reduction of the original debt of
                    L.238,000,000. The act of 1802 consolidated all these sinking funds, and the
                    public were not to be exempted from the payment of the sinking fund itself, nor
                    of the dividends on the stock to be purchased by the commissioners, till the
                    whole debt existing in 1802 was paid off. Mr Vansittart proposed to repeal the
                    act of 1802, and to restore the spirit of Mr Pitt’s act of 1792. He acknowledged
                    that it would be a breach of faith to the national creditor, if the fair
                    construction of that act, the act of 1792, were not adhered to. It was, in Mr
                    Vansittart’s opinion, no breach of faith to do away the conditions of the act of
                    1802. Supposing, however, that the act of 1802 had been really more favourable
                    to the stockholder than that of 1792, it is not easy to comprehend by what
                    arguments it can be proved not to be a breach of faith to repeal the one and
                    enact the other. Were not all the loans from 1802 to 1813 negotiated on the
                    faith of that act? Were not all bargains made between the buyer and seller of
                    stock made on the same understanding? Government had no more right to repeal the
                    act of 1802, and substitute another less favourable to the stockholder, and
                    acknowledged to be so by the minister himself, than it would have had to get rid
                    of the sinking fund altogether. But what we are at present to inquire into is,
                    whether Mr Vansittart did as he professed to do? Did he restore the stockholder
                    to all the advantages of the act of 1792? In the first place, it was declared by
                    the new act, that as the sinking fund consolidated in 1802, had redeemed
                    L.238,350,143.18s. Id. exceeding the amount of the debt in 1786 by L.l 18,895. J
                    2s. 10⅜d∙, a sum of capital stock equal to the total capital of the public debt
                    existing on the 5th January 1786, viz. L.238,231,248. 5s. 2fd. had been
                    satisfied and discharged; “and that in like manner an amount of public debt
                    equal to the capital and charge of every loan contracted since the said 5th
                    January 1786, shall successively, and in its proper' order, be deemed and
                    declared to be wholly satisfied and discharged, when and as soon as a further
                    amount of capital stock, not less than the capital of such loan, and producing
                    an interest equal to the dividends thereupon, shall be so redeemed or
                    transferred.”</p>
                <p>It was also resolved, “that after such declaration as aforesaid, the capital
                    stock purchased by the commissioners for the reduction of the national debt
                    shall from time to time be cancelled; at such times, and in such proportions, as
                    shall be directed by any act of parliament to be passed for such purpose, in
                    order to make provision for the charge of any loan or loans thereafter to be
                    contracted.”</p>
                <p>It was further resolved, that in order to carry into effect the provisions of the
                    acts of the 32d and 42d of the king, for redeeming every part of the national
                    debt within the period of forty-five years from the time of its creation, it is
                    expedient that in future, whenever the amount of the sum to be raised by loan,
                    or by any other addition to the public funded debt, shall in any year exceed the
                    sum estimated to be applicable in the same year to the reduction of the public
                    debt, an annual sum equal to one half of the interest of the excess of the said
                    loan, or other addition, beyond the sum so estimated to be applicable, shall be
                    set apart out of the monies composing the consolidated fund of Great Britain,
                    and shall be issued at the receipt of the exchequer to the governor and company
                    of the Bank of England, to be by them placed to the account of the commissioners
                    for the reduction of the national debt;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The effect of this clause was to give a sinking fund of one

                    and as it was considered by the proposer of the new regulation in 1813, that he
                    was reverting to the principle of Mr Pitt’s act of 1792, he provided that
                    L.867,963 should be added to the sinking fund for the one per cent, on the
                    capital stock created, and which was omitted to be provided for in 1802.<note

                <p>This was the substance of Mr Vansittart’s new plan, and which, he contended, was
                    not injurious to the stockholder, as it strictly conformed to the spirit of Mr
                    Pitt’s act of 1792.</p>
                <p>1st, By Mr Pitt’s act, no relief could be afforded to the public from the burdens
                    of taxation, till the stock redeemed by the original sinking fund of one million
                    amounted to such a sum as that the dividends on the capital stock redeemed
                    should amount to three millions, making the whole sinking fund four millions;
                    from thenceforth the four millions were to discharge debt as before, but the
                    interest of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193517191" xml:id="kp-eb0710-7191-0248"
                    />debt so discharged was to be available for the public service, and the public
                    was not to be relieved from the charge on the remainder of the debt of 238
                    millions till the four millions at simple interest, and the further sinking fund
                    which might arise from the falling in of terminable annuities, together with the
                    additional sum of L.200,000 per annum, voted in 1792, with their accumulations,
                    had redeemed the capital of 238 millions. The sinking fund arising from the one
                    per cent, on each loan was directed, by the act of 1792, to be applied to each
                    separate loan for which it was raised. Mr Vansittart thought himself justified,
                    and free from any breach of faith to the stockholder, in taking for the public
                    service, not the interest of four millions, which is all that Mr Pitt’s bill
                    would allow him to take, but the interest on 238 millions; and on what plea?
                    because the whole consolidated sinking funds, comprising the one per cent, on
                    every loan raised since 1793, had purchased 238 millions of stock. On Mr Pitt’s
                    plan he might have taken L.20,000 per annum from the sinking fund; on his own
                    construction of that act, he took from it more than seven millions per
                    annum.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">2dty,</hi> Mr Vansittart acknowledged that the stockholder, in
                    1802, was deprived of the advantage of one per cent, sinking fund on a capital
                    of L.86,796,300; and therefore, to be very just, he gives in 1813 one per cent,
                    on that capital; but should he not have added the accumulation which would have
                    been made in the eleven years from 1802 to 1813, on L.867,963, at compound
                    interest, and which would have given a further addition to the sinking fund of
                    more than L .360,000 per annum?</p>
                <p>3rfZy, On Mr Pitt’s plan, every loan was to be redeemed by its sinking fund,
                    under the most unfavourable circumstances, in forty-five years. If the loan was
                    raised in a three per cent, fund at sixty, and the stock was uniformly to
                    continue at that price, a one per cent, sinking fund would redeem the loan to
                    which it was attached in twenty-nine years; but then no relief would be given to
                    the public from taxation till the end of twenty-nine years; and if there had
                    been loans of ten millions every year for that period, when the first loan was
                    paid off, the second would require only one year for its final liquidation; the
                    third two years, and so on. On Mr Vansittart’s plan, under the same
                    circumstances, the sinking fund of each and every loan was to be applied, in the
                    first instance, to the redemption of the first loan; and when that was redeemed
                    and cancelled, the whole of the sinking funds were to be applied to the payment
                    of the second, and so on successively. The first loan of ten millions would be
                    cancelled in less than thirteen years, the second in less than six years after
                    the first, the third in a less time, and so on. At the end of the thirteenth
                    year, the public would be relieved from the interest on the first loan, or,
                    which is the same thing, from the necessity of finding fresh taxes for a new
                    loan at the end of thirteen years, for two new loans at the end of nineteen
                    years; but what would be the state of its debt at either of these periods, or at
                    the end of twenty-nine years? Could this advantage be obtained without a
                    corresponding disadvantage? No; the excess of debt on Mr Vansittart’s plan would
                    be exactly equal to these various sums, thus prematurely released by cancelled
                    stock, accumulated at compound interest. How could it be otherwise? Is it
                    possible that we could obtain a present relief from the charge of debt without
                    either directly or indirectly borrowing the fund necessary to provide that
                    relief at compound interest? “By this means,” says Mr Vansittart, “the loan
                    first contracted would be discharged at an earlier period, and the funds charged
                    with the payment of its interest would become applicable to the public service.
                    Thus, in the event of a long war, a considerable resource might accrue during
                    the course of the war itself, as every successive loan would contribute to
                    accelerate the redemption of those previously existing; and the total amount of
                    charge to be borne by the public, in respect of the public debt, would be
                    reduced to a narrower compass than in the other mode, in which a greater number
                    of loans would be co-existing. At the same time the ultimate discharge of the
                    whole debt would be rather accelerated than retarded.”—“It is now only necessary
                    to declare that an amount of stock equal to the whole of the debt existing in
                    1786 has been redeemed; and that, in like manner, whenever an amount of stock
                    equal to the capital and charge of any loan raised since 1792 shall be redeemed,
                    in its proper order of succession, such loan shall be deemed and taken to be
                    redeemed and satisfied. Every part of the system will then fall at once into its
                    proper place; and we shall proceed with the future redemption with all the
                    advantages which would have been derived from the original adoption of the mode
                    of successive instead of simultaneous redemption. Instead of waiting till the
                    purchase of the whole of the debt consolidated in 1802 shall be completed, that
                    part of it which existed previously to 1792 will be considered as already
                    redeemed, and the subsequent loans will follow in succession, whenever equal
                    portions of stock shall have been purchased. It is satisfactory to observe, that
                    by a gradual and equal progress, we shall have the power of effecting the
                    complete repayment of the debt more speedily than by the present course.” Is it
                    possible that Mr Vansittart could so deceive himself as to believe that, by
                    taking five millions from the sinking fund, which would not have been taken by
                    the provisions of the act of 1802, which would not have been taken by the act of
                    1792, and other sums successively, in shorter times than could have been
                    effected by the provisions of those two acts, he would be enabled to complete
                    the repayment of the debt more speedily? Is it possible that he could believe
                    that, by diminishing the sinking fund, that is, the amount of revenue as
                    compared with expenditure, he would effect the payment of our debt more
                    speedily? It is impossible to believe this. How then are his words to be
                    accounted for? In one way he might have a meaning. It might be this,—I know we
                    shall be more in debt in ten, twenty, and thirty years, on my plan, than we
                    should have been on that of Lord Sidmouth or on that of Mr Pitt; but we shall
                    have effected a greater payment in that time of <hi rend="italic">the stock now
                    existing,</hi> as the sinking funds attached to future loans will be employed in
                    paying our present debt. On Mr Pitt’s plan, those sinking funds would be used
                    for the payment of the new debt to be created; that is to say, of the loans to
                    which they are respectively attached. We shall be more in debt at every
                    subsequent period, it is true; but as our debt may be divided into old stock and
                    new stock, I am correct when I say that we shall have the power of completing
                    the repayment of the debt, meaning by the debt the stock now existing, sooner
                    than by the present course.</p>
                <p>This plan of Mr Vansittart was opposed with great ability, both by Mr Huskisson
                    and Mr Tierney. The former gentleman said, “The very foundation of the
                    assumption that the old debt has been paid off, is laid in the circumstance of
                    our having incurred a new debt of a much larger amount; and even allowing that
                    assumption, Mr Vansittart would not have been able to erect his present scheme
                    upon it, if the credit of the country had not been, for the last twenty years,
                    materially impaired by the pressure of that new debt. On the one hand, had the
                    sinking fund been operating at three per cent, during that period, he would not
                    have touched it, even under his own construction of the act of 1792. On the
                    other hand, had the price of the stocks been still lower than it has been, he
                    would have taken from that sinking fund still more largely than he is qpw,
                    according to his own rule, enabled to take. This then is the new doctrine of the
                    sinking fund ;—that, having been originally established * to prevent the
                    Lncon-venient<pb break="no" facs="nls:193517204" xml:id="kp-eb0710-7204-0249"/>
                    and dangerous accumulation of debt hereafter* (to borrow the very words of the
                    act), and for the support and improvement of public credit, it is in the
                    accumulation of new debt that Mr Vansittart found at once the means and the
                    pretence for invading that sinking fund; and the degree of depression of public
                    credit was, with him, the measure of the extent to which tl⅛at invasion might be
                    carried. And this is the system of which it is gravely predicated, that it is no
                    departure from the letter, and no violation of the spirit, of the act of 1792;
                    and of which we are desired seriously to believe, that it is only the following
                    up and improving upon the original measure of Mr Pitt !—of which measure the
                    clear and governing intention was, that every future loan should, from <hi
                    rend="italic">the moment of its creation,</hi> carry with it the seeds of its
                    destruction; and that the course of its reimbursement should <hi rend="italic"
                    >that moment</hi> be placed beyond the discretion and control of parliament.”
                    (Mr Huskisson’s <hi rend="italic">Speech,</hi> 25th March 1813.)</p>
                <p>This is the last alteration that has taken place in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >machinery</hi> of the sinking fund. Inroads more fatal than this which we have
                    just recorded have been made on the fund itself; but they have been made
                    silently and indirectly, while the machinery has been left unaltered.</p>
                <p>It has been shown by Dr Hamilton, that no fund can be efficient for the reduction
                    of debt but such as arises from an excess of revenue above expenditure.</p>
                <p>Suppose a country at peace, and its expenuιture, including the interest of its
                    debt, to be forty millions, its revenue to be forty-one millions, it would
                    possess one million of sinking fund. This million would accumulate at compound
                    interest; for stock would be purchased with it in the market, and placed in the
                    names of the commissioners for paying off the debt. These commissioners would be
                    entitled to the dividends before received by private stockholders, which would
                    be added to the capital of the sinking fund. The fund thus increased would make
                    additional purchases the following year, and would be entitled to a larger
                    amount of dividends, and thus would go on accumulating, till in time the whole
                    debt would be discharged.</p>
                <p>Suppose such a country to increase its expenditure one million, without adding to
                    its taxes, and to keep up the machinery of the sinking fund; it is evident that
                    it would make no progress in the reduction of its debt; for though it would
                    accumulate a fund in the same manner as before in the hands of the
                    commissioners, it would, by means of adding to its funded or unfunded debt, and
                    by constantly borrowing, in the same way, the sum necessary to pay the interest
                    on such loans, accumulate its million of debt annually at compound interest, in
                    the same manner as it accumulated its million annually of sinking fund.</p>
                <p>But suppose that it continued its operations of investing the sinking fund in the
                    purchase of stock, and made a loan for the million which it was deficient in its
                    expenditure, and that, in order to defray the interest and sinking fund of such
                    loan, it imposed new taxes on the people to the amount of L.60,000, the real and
                    efficient sinking fund would, in that case, be L.60,000 per annum, and no more;
                    for there would be L.l,060,000, and no more, to invest in the purchase of stock,
                    while one million was raised by the sale of stock, or, in other words, the
                    revenue would exceed the expenditure by L.60,000.</p>
                <p>Suppose a war to take place, and the expenditure to be increased to sixty
                    millions, while its revenue continued, as before, forty-one millions, still
                    keeping on the operation of the commissioners with respect to the investment of
                    one million. If it were to raise war-taxes for the payment of the twenty
                    millions additional expense, the million of sinking fund would operate to the
                    reduction of the national debt at compound interest as it did before. If it
                    raised twenty millions by loan in the stocks or in exchequer bills, and did not
                    provide for the interest by new taxes, but obtained it by an addition to the
                    loan of the following year, it would be accumulating a debt of twenty millions
                    at compound interest; and while the war lasted, and the same expenditure
                    continued, it would not only be accumulating a debt of twenty millions at
                    compound interest, but a debt of twenty millions per annum; and consequently the
                    real increase of its debt, after allowing for the operation of the million of
                    sinking fund, would be at the rate of nineteen millions per annum at compound
                    interest. But if it provided by new taxes five per cent, interest for this
                    annual loan of twenty millions, it would on the one hand simply increase the
                    debt twenty millions per annum; on the other it would diminish it by one million
                    per annum, with its compound interest. If we suppose that, in addition to the
                    five per cent, interest, it raised also by annual taxes L.200,000 per annum as a
                    sinking fund for each loan of twenty millions, it would, the first year of the
                    war, add L.200,000 to the sinking fund, the second year L.400,000, the third
                    year L.600,000, and so on, L.200,000 for every loan of twenty millions. Every
                    year it would add, by means of the additional taxes, to its annual revenue,
                    without increasing its expenditure. Every year, too, that part of this revenue
                    which was devoted to the purpose of purchasing debt, would increase by the
                    amount of the dividends on the stock purchased; and thus would its revenue still
                    further increase, till at last the revenue would overtake the expenditure, and
                    then once again it would have an efficient sinking fund for the reduction of
                    debt.</p>
                <p>It is evident that the result of these operations would be the same, the rate of
                    interest being sun∣&gt;osed to be always at five per cent, or any other rate,
                    if, during the excess of expenditure above revenue, the operation of the
                    commissioners in the purchase of stock were to cease. The real increase of the
                    national debt must depend upon the excess of expenditure above revenue, and that
                    would be noways altered by a different arrangement. Suppose that, instead of
                    raising twenty millions the first year, and paying off one million, only
                    nineteen millions had been raised by loan, and the same taxes had been raised,
                    namely, L.l,200,000. As five per cent, would be paid on nineteen millions only,
                    instead of on twenty millions, or L.950,000 for interest instead of one million,
                    there would remain, in addition to the original million, L.250,000 towards the
                    loan of the following year, consequently the loan of the second year would be
                    only for L.18,750,000; but as L.l,200,000 would be again raised by additional
                    taxes, or L.2,400,000 in the whole the second year, besides the original
                    million, there would be a surplus, after paying the interest of both loans, of
                    L. 1,512,500, and therefore the loan of the third year would be for L.
                    18,487,500. The progress during five years is shown in the following table

                <p>If, instead of thus diminishing the loan each year, the same amount of taxes
                    precisely had been raised, and the sinking fund had been applied in the usual

                <p>A full consideration of this subject in all its details has led Dr Hamilton to
                    the conclusion that this first mode of raising the supplies during war, viz. by
                    diminishing the amount of the annual loans, and stopping the purchases of the
                    commissioners in the market, would be more economical, and that it ought
                    therefore to be adopted. In the first place, all the expenses of agency would be
                    saved; in the second, the premium usually obtained by the contractor for the
                    loan would be saved on that part of it which is repurchased by the commissioners
                    in the open market. It is true that the stocks may fall as well as rise between
                    the time of contracting for the loan and the time of the purchases made by the
                    commissioners; and therefore, in some cases, the public may gain by the present
                    arrangement; but as these chances are equal, and a certain advantage is given to
                    the loan contractor to induce him to advance his money, independently of all
                    contingency of future price, the public now give this advantage on the larger
                    sum instead of on the smaller. On an average of years, this cannot fail to
                    amount to a very considerable sura. But both these objections would be obviated,
                    if the clause in the original sinking fund bill, authorizing the commissioners
                    to subscribe to any loan for the public service, to the amount of the annual
                    fund which they have to invest, were uniformly complied with. This is the mode
                    which was for several years strongly urged by Mr Grenfell; and it is far
                    preferable to that which Dr Hamilton recommends. Dr Hamilton and Mr Grenfell
                    both agree, that in time of war, when the expenditure exceeds the revenue, and
                    when therefore we are annually increasing our debt, it is a useless operation to
                    buy a comparatively small quantity of stock in the market, while we are at the
                    same time under the necessity of making large sales: but Dr Hamilton would not
                    keep the sinking fund as a separate fund; Mr Grenfell would, and would have it
                    increased with our debt by some known and fixed rules. We agree with Mr
                    Grenfell. If a loan of twenty millions is to be raised annually, while there is
                    in the hands of the commissioners ten millions which they annually receive, the
                    obvious and simple operation should be really to raise only ten millions by
                    loan; but there is a convenience in calling it twenty millions, and allowing the
                    commissioners to subscribe ten millions. All the objections of Dr Hamilton are
                    by these means removed “there will be no expense for agency; there will be no
                    loss on account of any difference of price at which the public sell and buy. By
                    calling the loan twenty millions, the public will be induced more easily to bear
                    the taxes which are necessary for the interest and-sinking fund of twenty
                    millions. Call the loan only ten millions, abolish during the war the very name
                    of the sinking fund in all your public accounts, and it would be difficult to
                    show to the people the expediency of providing L.l,200,000 per annum by
                    additional taxation tor the interest of a loan of ten millions. The sinking fund
                    is therefore useful as an engine of taxation; and if the country could depend on
                    ministers that it would be faithfully devoted to the purposes for which it was
                    established, namely, to afford at the termination of war a clear additional
                    surplus revenue beyond expenditure, in proportion to the Edition made to the
                    debt, it would be wise and expedient to keep it as a separate fund, subject to
                    fixed rules and regulations.</p>
                <p>We shall presently inquire whether there can be any such dependence; and
                    therefore whether the sinking fund is not an instrument of mischief and
                    delusion, and really tending rather to increase our debt and burdens than to
                    diminish them.</p>
                <p>It is objected both to Dr Hamilton’s and Mr Grenfell’s projects, that the
                    disadvantages which they mention are trifling in degree, and are more than
                    compensated by the steadiness which is given to the market by the daily
                    purchases of the commissioners; that the money which those purchases throw into
                    the market is a resource on which bankers and others, who may suddenly want
                    money, with certainty rely.</p>
                <p>Those who make this objection forget, that if, by the adoption of this plan, a
                    daily purchaser is withdrawn from the market, so also is a daily seller. The
                    minister gives now to one party ten millions of money to invest in stock, and to
                    another party as much stock as ten millions costs to sell; and as the
                    instalments on the loan are paid monthly, it may fairly be said that the supply
                    is as regular as the demand. It cannot be doubted too, that a loan of twenty
                    millions is negotiated on worse terms than one of ten. It is true that no more
                    stock will remain in the market at the end of the year, whether the one or the
                    other sum be raised by loan; but for a time the contractor must make a large
                    purchase, and he must wait before he can make his sale of ten millions to the
                    commissioners. He is induced then to sell much more largely before the contract,
                    which cannot fail to affect the market price; and it must be recollected, that
                    it is the market price on the day of bidding for the loan which governs the
                    terms on which the loan is negotiated. It is looked to both by the minister who
                    sells and the contractor who purchases. The experiment on Mr Grenfell’s
                    suggestion was tried for the first time in 1819; the sum required by government
                    was twenty-four millions, to which the commissioners subscribed twelve millions.
                    In lieu of a loan of twenty-four millions from the contractor, there was one
                    only of twelve millions; and as soon as this arrangement was known, previous to
                    the contract, the stocks rose to four or five per cent., and influenced the
                    terms of the loan in that degree. The reason was, that a preparation had been
                    made for twenty-four or thirty millions loan; and as soon as it was known that
                    it would be for twelve millions only, a part of the stock sold was repurchased.
                    Another advantage attending the smaller loan is, that eight hundred per million,
                    which is paid to the bank for management of the loan, is saved on the sum
                    subscribed by the commissioners.</p>
                <p>Dr Hamilton, in another part of his work, observes, “If <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193517230" xml:id="kp-eb0710-7230-0251"/>the sinking fund could be
                    conducted without loss to the public, or even if it were attended with a
                    moderate loss, it would not be wise to propose an alteration of a system which
                    has gained the confidence of the public, and which points out a rule of taxation
                    that has the advantage at least of being steady. If that rule be laid aside, our
                    measures of taxation might become entirely loose.”</p>
                <p>“The means, and the only means, of restraining the progress of national debt, are
                    saving of expenditure and increase of revenue. Neither of these has a necessary
                    connection with a sinking fund. But if they have an eventual connection, and if
                    the nation, impressed with a conviction of the importance of a system
                    established by a popular minister, has, in order to adhere to it, adopted
                    measures, either of frugality in expenditure, or exertion in raising taxes,
                    which it would not otherwise have done, the sinking fund ought not to be
                    considered as inefficient, and its effects may be of great importance.”</p>
                <p>It will not, we think, admit of a doubt, that if Mr Pitt’s sinking fund, as
                    established in 1792, had been always fairly acted upon,—if, for every loan, in
                    addition to the war-taxes, the interest, and a one per cent, sinking fund, had
                    been invariably supplied by annual taxes,—we should have made rapid progress in
                    the extinction of debt. The alteration in principle which was made in the
                    sinking fund by the act of 1802, was, in our opinion, a judicious one: it
                    provided that no part of the sinking fund, neither that which arose from the
                    original million, with its addition of L.200,000 per annum, nor that which arose
                    from the one per cent, raised for the loans since 1792, should be applicable to
                    the public service, till the whole of the debt then existing was redeemed. We
                    should have been disposed to extend this principle further, and to make a
                    provision, that no part of the sinking fund should be applicable to the public
                    service until the whole of the debt then existing, <hi rend="italic">and
                    subsequently to be created,</hi> should be redeemed. We do not think that there
                    is much weight in the objection to this clause which was made to it by Lord
                    Henry Petty in 1807, and referred to and more strongly urged by Mr Vansittart in
                    1813. The noble Lord said, “1 need hardly press upon the consideration of the
                    committee, all the evils likely to result from allowing the sinking fund to
                    accumulate without any limit; for the nation would be exposed by that
                    accumulation to the mischief of having a large portion of capital taken at once
                    out of the market, without any adequate means of applying it, which would of
                    course be deprived of its value.</p>
                <p>“This evil must appear so serious to any man who contemplates its character, that
                    I have no doubt it will be felt, however paradoxical it may seem, that the
                    redemption of the whole national debt at once would be productive of something
                    like-national bankruptcy; for the capital would be equivalent almost to nothing,
                    while the interest he had before derived from it would be altogether
                    extinguished. The other evils which would arise from, and which must serve to
                    demonstrate the mischievous conse-Suence of, a prompt discharge of the national
                    debt, I will ιow presently. Different arrangements were adopted in the further
                    provisions made on the subject of the sinking fund in 1792 and in 1802. By the
                    first the sinking fund of one per cent., which was thenceforward to be provided
                    for every new loan, was made to accumulate at compound interest until the whole
                    of the debt created by such new loan should be extinguished. And, by the second
                    arrangement, all the various sinking funds existing in 1802 were consolidated,
                    and the whole were appropriated to accumulate at compound interest until the
                    discharge of the whole of the debt also existing in 1802. But the debt created
                    since 1802, amounting to about one hundred millions of nominal capital, is still
                    left subject to the act of 1792, which provides for each separate loan a sink
                    ing fund of only one per cent, on the nominal capital. The plan of 1802,
                    engrafted on the former acts of 1786 and 1792, provided for the still more
                    speedy extinction of the debt to which it applied. But it would postpone all
                    relief from the public burdens to a very distant period (computed in 1802 to be
                    from 1834 to 1844); and it would throw such large and disproportionate sums into
                    the money market in the latter years of its operation, as might produce a very
                    dangerous depreciation of the value of money. Many inconveniences might also
                    arise from the sudden stop which would be put to the application of those sums
                    when the whole debt should have been redeemed, and from the no less sudden
                    change in the price of all commodities, which must follow from taking off at one
                    and the same moment taxes to an extent probably then much exceeding thirty
                    millions. The fate of merchants, manufacturers, mechanics, and every description
                    of dealers, in such an event, must be contemplated by every· thinking man with
                    alarm; and this applies to my observation respecting a national bankruptcy; for,
                    should the national debt be discharged, and such a weight of taxation taken off
                    at once, all the goods remaining on hand would be, comparatively speaking, of no
                    value to the holders, because, having been purchased or manufactured while such
                    taxation prevailed, they must be undersold by all those who might manufacture
                    the same kind of goods after such taxation had ceased. These objections were
                    foreseen, and to a certain degree acknowledged, at the time when the act of 1802
                    was passed; and it was then answered, that whenever the danger approached, it
                    might be obviated by subsequent arrangements.” A great many of these objections
                    appear to us to be chimerical; but, if well founded, we agree with the latter
                    part of the extract, “whenever the danger approached, it might be obviated by
                    subsequent arrangements.” It was not necessary to legislate in 1807 or in 1813,
                    for a danger which could not happen till between 1834 and 1844. It was not
                    necessary to provide against the evils which would arise from a plethora of
                    wealth at a remote period, when our real difficulty was how to supply our
                    immediate and pressing wants.</p>
                <p>What are the evils apprehended from the extravagant growth of the sinking fund
                    towards the latter years of its existence? Not that taxation will be increased,
                    because the growth of the sinking fund is occasioned by dividends on stock
                    purchased; but, first, that capital will be returned too suddenly into the hands
                    of the stockholder, without his having any means of deriving a revenue from it;
                    and, secondly, that the remission of taxes, to the amount probably of thirty
                    millions, will have a great effect on the prices of particular commodities, and
                    will be very pernicious to the interest of those who may deal in or manufacture
                    such commodities.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that the commissioners have no capital. They receive quarterly or
                    daily certain sums, arising from the taxes, which they employ in the redemption
                    of debt. One portion of the people pay what another portion receive. If the
                    payers employed the sums paid as capital, that is to say, in the production of
                    raw produce, or manufactured commodities, and the receivers, when they received
                    it, employed it in the same manner, there would be little variation in the
                    annual produce. A part of that produce might be produced by A instead of by B:
                    not that even this is a necessary consequence; for A, when he received the money
                    for his debt, might lend it to B, and might receive from him a portion of the
                    produce for interest, in which case B would continue to employ the capital as
                    before. On the supposition, then, that the sinking fund is furnished by capital
                    and not by revenue, no injury would result to the community, however large that
                    fund might be; there might or might not be a transfer of employments, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193517243" xml:id="kp-eb0710-7243-0252"/> but the annual
                    produce, the real wealth of the country, would undergo no deterioration, and the
                    actual amount of ' capital employed would neither be increased nor diminished.
                    But if the payers of taxes, for the interest and sinking fund of the national
                    debt, paid them from revenue, then they would retain the same capital as before
                    in active employment; and as this revenue, when received by the stockholder,
                    would be by him employed as capital, there would be, in consequence of this
                    operation, a great increase of capital; every year an additional portion of
                    revenue would be turned into capital, which could be employed only in furnishing
                    new commodities to the market. Now, the doubts of those who speak of the
                    mischievous effects of the great accumulation of the sinking fund, proceed from
                    an opinion they entertain that a country may possess more capital than it can
                    beneficially employ, and that there may be such a glut of commodities that it
                    would be impossible to dispose of them on such terms as to secure to the
                    producers any profits on their capitals. The error of this reasoning has been
                    made manifest by Μ. Say, in his able work <hi rend="italic">Economic</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Politique,</hi> and afterwards by Mr Mill, in his excellent reply
                    to Mr Spence, the advocate of the doctrine of the Economistes. They show that
                    demand is only limited by production; whoever can produce has a right to
                    consume, and he will exercise his privilege to the greatest extent. They do not
                    deny that the demand for particular commodities is limited, and therefore they
                    say there may be a glut of such commodities; but, in a great and civilized
                    country, wants, either for objects of necessity or of luxury, are unlimited, and
                    the employment of capital is of equal extent with our ability of supplying food
                    and necessaries for the increasing population, which a continually augmenting
                    capital would employ. With every increased difficulty of producing additional
                    supplies of raw produce from the land, corn, and the other necessaries of the
                    labourer, would rise. Hence wages would rise. A real rise of wages is
                    necessarily followed by a real fall of profits; and therefore, when the land of
                    a country is brought to the highest state of cultivation, when more labour
                    employed upon it will not yield in return more food than what is necessary to
                    support the labourer so employed, that country is come to the limit of its
                    increase both of capital and population.</p>
                <p>The richest country in Europe is yet far distant from that degree of improvement;
                    but if any had arrived at it, by the aid of foreign commerce, even such a
                    country could go on for an indefinite time increasing in wealth and population;
                    for the only obstacle to this increase would be the scarcity, and consequent
                    high value, of food and other raw produce. Let these be supplied from abroad in
                    exchange for manufactured goods, and it is difficult to say where the limit is
                    at which you would cease to accumulate wealth, and to derive profit from its
                    employment. This is a question of the utmost importance in political economy. We
                    hope that the little we have said on the subject will be sufficient to induce
                    those who wish clearly to understand the principle, to consult the works of the
                    able authors whom we have named, to which we acknowledge ourselves so much
                    indebted. If these views are correct, there is then no danger that the
                    accumulated capital which a sinking fund under particular circumstances might
                    occasion, would not find employment, or that the commodities which it might be
                    made to produce would not be beneficially sold, so as to afford an adequate
                    profit to the producers. On this part of the subject it is only necessary to
                    add, that there would be no necessity for stockholders to become farmers or
                    manufacturers. There are always to be found in a great country a sufficient
                    number of responsible persons, with the requisite skill, ready to employ the
                    accumulated capital of others, and to pay to them a share of the profits, and
                    which in all countries is known by the name of interest for borrowed money.</p>
                <p>The second objection to the indefinite increase of the sinking fund remains now
                    to be noticed. By the remission of taxes suddenly to the amount probably of
                    thirty millions per annum, a great effect would be produced on the price of
                    goods. “The fate of merchants, manufacturers, mechanics, and every description
                    of dealers, in such an event, must be contemplated by every thinking man with
                    alarm; for should the national debt be discharged, and such a weight of taxation
                    taken off at once, all the goods remaining on hand would be, comparatively
                    speaking, of no value to the holders, because, having been purchased or
                    manufactured while such taxation prevailed, they must be undersold by all those
                    who might manufacture the same kind of goods after such taxation had ceased.” It
                    is only, then, on the supposition that merchants, manufacturers, and dealers,
                    would be affected as above described, that any evil would result from tire
                    largest remission of taxes. It would not of course be said, that by remitting a
                    tax of L.5 to A, L.10 to B, L.100 to C, and so on, any injury would be done to
                    them. If they added these different sums to their respective capitals, they
                    would augment their permanent annual revenue, and would be contributing to the
                    increase of the mass of commodities, thereby adding to the general abundance. We
                    have already, we hope, successfully shown that an augmentation of capital is
                    neither injurious to the individual by whom it is saved, nor to the community at
                    large; its tendency is to increase the demand for labour, and consequently the
                    population, and to add to the power and strength of the country. But they will
                    not add these respective sums to their capitals; they will expend them as
                    revenue 1 The measure cannot be said to be either injurious to themselves or to
                    the community on that account. They annually contributed a portion of their
                    produce to the stockholder in payment of debt, who immediately employed it as
                    capital; that portion of produce is now at their own disposal; they may consume
                    it themselves if they please. A farmer who used to sell a portion of his corn
                    for the particular purpose of furnishing this tax, may consume this corn
                    himself; he may get the distiller to make gin of it, or the brewer to turn it
                    into beer, or he may exchange it for a portion of the cloth which the clothier,
                    who is now released from the tax as well as the farmer, is at liberty to dispose
                    of for any commodity which he may desire. It may indeed be said, where is all
                    this cloth, beer, gin, &amp;c. to come from; there was no more than necessary
                    for the general demand before this remission of taxes; if every man is now to
                    consume more, from whence is this supply to be obtained? This is an objection of
                    quite an opposite nature to that which was before urged. Now, it is said there
                    would be too much demand and no additional supply; before, it was contended that
                    the supply would be so great that no demand would exist for the quantity
                    supplied. One objection is no better founded than the other. The stockholders,
                    by previously receiving the payment of their debt, and employing the funds they
                    received productively, or lending them to some other persons who would so employ
                    them, would produce the very additional commodities which the society at large
                    would have it in their power to consume. There would be a general augmentation
                    of revenue, and a general augmentation of enjoyment; and it must not for a
                    moment be supposed that the increased consumption of one part of the people
                    would be at the expense of another part. The good would be unmixed, and without
                    alloy. It remains then only to consider the injury to traders from the fall in
                    the price of goods; and the remedy against this appears to be so very simple,
                    that it surprises us that it should ever have been urged as an objection. In
                    laying on a new tax, the stock in hand of the article taxed is commonly
                    ascertained; and, as a measure of justice, the dealer in such article is
                    required to pay the imposed tax on his stock. Why may not the reverse of this be
                    done? Why may not <pb break="no" facs="nls:193517256"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-7256-0253"/>the tax be returned to each individual on his
                    stock in hand, whenever it shall be thought expedient to take off the tax from
                    the article which he manufactures, or in which he deals? It would only be
                    necessary to continue the taxes for a very short time for this purpose. On no
                    view of this question can we see any validity in the arguments which we have
                    quoted, and . which were so particularly insisted on by Mr vansittart.</p>
                <p>There are some persons who think that a sinking fund, even when strictly applied
                    to its object, is of no national benefit whatever. The money which is
                    contributed, they say, would be more productively employed by the payers of the
                    taxes than by the commissioners of the sinking fund. The latter purchase stock
                    with it, which probably does not yield five per cent.; the former would obtain
                    from the employment of the same capital much more than five ner cent,
                    consequently the country would be enriched by the difference. There would be in
                    the latter case a larger nett supply of the produce of our land and labour, and
                    that is the fund from which ultimately all our expenditure must be drawn. Those
                    who maintain this opinion do not see that the commissioners merely receive money
                    from one class of the community, and pay it to another class, and that the real
                    question is, Which of these two classes will employ it most productively? Forty
                    millions per annum are raised by taxes, of which twenty millions, we will
                    suppose, is paid for sinking fund, and twenty millions for interest of debt.
                    After a year’s purchase is made by the commissioners, this forty millions will
                    be divided differently; nineteen millions will be paid for interest, and
                    twenty-one millions for sinking fund; and so from year to year, though forty
                    millions is always paid on the whole, a less and less portion of it will be paid
                    for interest, and a larger portion for sinking fund, till the commissioners have
                    purchased the whole amount of stock, and then the whole forty millions will be
                    in the hands of the commissioners. The sole question then with regard to profits
                    is, whether those who pay this forty millions, or those who receive it, will
                    employ it most productively; the commissioners, in fact, never employing it at
                    all, their business being to transfer it to those who will employ it. Now, of
                    this we are quite certain, that all the money received by the stockholder in
                    return for his stock must be employed as capital; for if it were not so
                    employed, he would be deprived of his revenue, on which he had habitually
                    depended. If then the taxes which are paid towards the sinking fund be derived
                    from the revenue of the country, and not from its capital, by this operation a
                    portion of revenue is yearly realized into capital, and consequently the whole
                    revenue of the society is increased; but it might have been realized into
                    capital by the payer of the tax if there had been no sinking fund, and he had
                    been allowed to retain the money to his own use. It might so, and if it had been
                    so disposed of, there can be no advantage in respect to the accumulation of the
                    wealth of the whole society by the establishment of the sinking fund; but it is
                    not so probable that the payer of the tax would make this use of it as the
                    receiver. The receiver, when he gets paid for his stock, only substitutes one
                    capital for another; and he is accustomed to look to his capital for all his
                    yearly income. The payer will have all that he paid in addition to his former
                    revenue; if the sinking fund be discontinued he may indeed realize it into
                    capital, but he may also use it as revenue, increasing his expenditure on wine,
                    houses, horses, clothes, &amp;c. The payer might too have paid it from his
                    capital; and therefore the employment of one capital might be substituted for
                    another. In this case, too, no advantage arises from the sinking fund, as the
                    national wealth would accumulate as rapidly without it as with it; but if any
                    portion of the taxes paid expressly for the sinking fund be paid from revenue,
                    and which, if not so paid, would have been expended as revenue, then there is a
                    manifest advantage in the sinking fund, as it tends to increase the annual
                    produce of our land and labour; and as we cannot but think that this would be
                    its ' operation, we are clearly of opinion that a sinking fund, honestly
                    applied, is favourable to the accumulation of wealth.</p>
                <p>Dr Hamilton has followed Dr Price in insisting much on the disadvantage of
                    raising loans during war in a three per cent, stock, and not in a five per cent,
                    stock. In the former, a great addition is made to the nominal capital, which is
                    generally redeemed during peace at a greatly advanced price. Three per cents
                    which were sold at sixty will probably be repurchased at eighty, and may come to
                    be bought at 100; whereas in five per cents there would be little or no increase
                    of nominal capital, and as all the stocks are redeemable at par, they would be
                    paid off with very little loss. The correctness of this observation must depend
                    on the relative prices of these two stocks. During the war in 1798, the three
                    per cents were at fifty, while the five per cents were at seventy-three; and at
                    all times the five per cents bear a very low relative price to the three per
                    cents. Here then is one disadvantage to be put against another, and it must
                    depend upon the degree in which the prices of the three per cents and five per
                    cents differ, whether it be more desirable to raise the loan in the one or in
                    the other. We have little doubt, that during many periods of the war, there
                    would have been a decided disadvantage in making the loan in five per cent,
                    stock in preference to three per cent, stock. The market in five per cent,
                    stock, too, is limited; a sale cannot be forced in it without causing a
                    considerable fall, a circumstance known to the contractors, and against which
                    they would naturally take some security in the price which they bid for a large
                    loan if in that stock. A premium of two per cent, on the market price may appear
                    to them sufficient to compensate them for their risk in a loan in three per
                    cent, stock; they may require one of five per cent to protect them against the
                    dangers they apprehend from taking the same loan in a five per cent, stock.</p>
                <p>II. After having duly considered the operation of a sinking fund derived from
                    annual taxes, we come now to the consideration of the best mode of providing for
                    our annual expenditure, both in war and peace; and further, to examine whether a
                    country can have any security that a fund raised for the purpose of paying debt
                    will not be misapplied by ministers, and be really made the instrument for
                    creating new debt, so as never to afford a rational hope that any progress
                    whatever will permanently be made in the reduction of debt.</p>
                <p>Suppose a country to be free from debt, and a war to take place which should
                    involve it in an annual additional expenditure of twenty millions—there are
                    three modes by which this expenditure may be provided; first, taxes may be
                    raised to the amount of twenty millions per annum, from which the country would
                    be totaUy freed on the return of peace; or, secondly, the money might be
                    annually borrowed and funded, in which case, if the interest agreed upon was
                    five per cent, a perpetual charge of one million per annum taxes would be
                    incurred for the first year’s expense, from which there would be no relief
                    during peace, or in any future war,—of an additional million for the second
                    year’s expense, and so on for every year that the war might last. At the end of
                    twenty years, if the war lasted so long, the country would be perpetually
                    encumbered with taxes of twenty millions per annum, and would have to repeat the
                    same course on the recurrence of any new war. The third mode of providing for
                    the expenses of the war would be to borrow annually the twenty millions required
                    as before, but to provide by taxes a fund, in addition to the interest, which,
                    accumulating at compound interest, should finally be equal to the debt. In the
                    case supposed, if money was raised at five per cent, and a sum of L.200,000 per
                    annum <pb break="no" facs="nls:193517269" xml:id="kp-eb0710-7269-0254"/>in
                    addition to the million for interest were provided, it would accumulate to
                    twenty millions in forty-five years; and, by consenting to raise L.l,200,000 per
                    annum by taxes for every loan of twenty millions, each loan would be paid off in
                    forty-five years from the time of its creation; and in forty-five years from the
                    termination of the war, if no new debt were created, the whole would be
                    redeemed, and the whole of the taxes would be repealed.</p>
                <p>Of these three modes, we are decidedly of opinion that the preference should be
                    given to the first. The burdens of the war are undoubtedly great during its
                    continuance, but at its termination they cease altogether. When the pressure of
                    the war is felt at once, without mitigation, we shall be less disposed wantonly
                    to engage in an expensive contest; and, if engaged in it, we shall be sooner
                    disposed to get out of it, unless it be a contest for some great national
                    interest. In point of economy, there is no real difference in either of the
                    modes; for twenty millions in one payment, one million per annum for ever, or
                    L.l,200,000 for forty-five years, are precisely of the same value; but the
                    people who pay the taxes never so estimate them, and therefore do not manage
                    their private affairs accordingly. We are too apt to think that the war is
                    burdensome only in proportion to what we are at the moment called to pay f&lt;Jr
                    it in taxes, without reflecting on the probable duration of such taxes. It would
                    be difficult to convince a man possessed of L.20,000, or any other sum, that a
                    perpetual payment of L.50 per annum was equally burdensome with a single tax of
                    L.1000. He would have some vague notion that the L.50 per annum would be paid by
                    posterity, and would not be paid by him; but if he leaves his fortune to his
                    son, and leaves it charged with this perpetual tax, where is the difference
                    whether he leaves him L.20,000 with the tax, orL.19,000 without it? This
                    argument of charging posterity with the interest of our debt, or of relieving
                    them from a portion of such interest, is often used by otherwise well-informed
                    people; but we confess we see no weight in it. It may indeed be said that the
                    wealth of the country may increase, and as a portion of the increased wealth
                    will have to contribute to the taxes, the proportion falling on the ∣ present
                    amount of wealth will be less, and thus posterity will contribute to our present
                    expenditure. That this may be so, is true: but it may also be otherwise; the
                    wealth of the country may diminish; individuals may withdraw from a country
                    heavily taxed; and therefore the property retained in the country may pay more
                    than the just equivalent, which would at the present time be received from it.
                    That an annual tax of L.50 is not deemed the same in amount as L.1000 ready
                    money, must have been observed by every body. If an individual were called upon
                    to pay L.1000 to the income-tax, he would probably endeavour to save the whole
                    of it from his income; hewould do no more if, in lieu of this war-tax, a loan
                    had been raised, for the interest of which he would have been called upon to pay
                    only L.50 income-tax. The war-taxes, then, are more economical; for when they
                    are paid, an effort is made to save to the amount of the whole expenditure of
                    the war, leaving the national capital undiminished., In the other case, an
                    effort is only made to save to the amount of the interest of such expenditure,
                    and therefore the national capital is diminished in amount. The usual objection
                    made to the payment of the larger tax is, that it could not be conveniently paid
                    by manufacturers and landholders, for they have not large sums of money at their
                    command. We think that great efforts would be made to save the tax out of their
                    income, in which case they could obtain the money from this source; but suppose
                    they could not, what should hinder them from selling a part of their property
                    for money, or of borrowing it at interest? That there are persons disposed to
                    lend, is evi-</p>
                <p>; dent from the facility with which government raises its i loans. Withdraw this
                    great borrower from the market, and private borrowers would be readily
                    accommodated.</p>
                <p>! By wise regulations and good laws, the greatest facilities and security might
                    be afforded to individuals in such transactions. In the case of a loan, A
                    advances the money, and B pays the interest, and every thing else remains as
                    before. In the case of war-taxes, A would still advance the money and B pay the
                    interest, only with this difference, he would pay it directly to A; now he pays
                    it to government, and government pays it to A.</p>
                <p>These large taxes, it may be said, must fall on property, which the smaller taxes
                    now do not exclusively do. Those who are in professions, as well as those who
                    live from salaries and wages, and who now contribute annually to the taxes,
                    could not make a large ready money payment; and they would therefore be
                    benefited at the expense of the capitalist and landholder. We believe that they
                    would be very little, if at all, benefited by the system of war-taxes. Fees to
                    professional men, salaries, and wages, are regulated by the prices of
                    commodities, and by the relative situation of those who pay and of those who
                    receive them. A tax of the nature proposed, if it did not disturb prices, would,
                    however, change the relation between these classes, and a new arrangement of
                    fees, salaries, and wages, would take place, so that the usual level would be
                    restored.</p>
                <p>The reward that is paid to professors, &amp;c. is regulated, like every thing
                    else, by demand and supply. What produces the supply of men, with certain
                    qualifications, is not any particular sum of money, but a certain relative
                    position in society. If you diminish, by additional taxes, the incomes of
                    landlords and capitalists, leaving the pay of professions the same, the relative
                    position of professions would be raised; an additional number of persons would
                    therefore be enticed into those lines, and the competition would reduce the
                    pay.</p>
                <p>The greatest advantage that would attend war-taxes would be the little permanent
                    derangement that they would cause to the industry of the country. The prices of
                    our commodities would not be disturbed by taxation; or if they were, they would
                    only be so during a period when every thing is disturbed by other causes during
                    war. At the commencement of peace every thing would be at its natural price
                    again, and no inducement would be afforded to us by the direct effect, and still
                    less by the indirect effect, of taxes on various commodities, to desert
                    employments in which we have peculiar skill and facilities, and engage in others
                    in which the same skill and facilities are wanting. In a state of freedom every
                    man naturally engages himself in that employment for which he js best fitted,
                    and the greatest abundance of products is the result. An injudicious tax may
                    induce us to import what we should otherwise have produced at home, or to export
                    what we should otherwise have received from abroad; and in both cases wè shall
                    receive, besides the inconvenience of paying the tax, a less return for a given
                    quantity of our labour than what that labour would, if unfettered, have
                    produced. Under a complicated system of taxation, it is impossible for the
                    wisest legislature to discover all the effects, direct and indirect, of its
                    taxes; and if it cannot do this, the industry of the country will not be exerted
                    to the greatest advantage. By war-taxes, we should save many millions in the
                    collection of taxes. We might get rid of at least some of the expensive
                    establishments, and the army of officers which they employ would be dispensed
                    with. There would be no charges for the management of debt. Loans would not be
                    raised at the rate of L.50 or L.60 for a nominal capital of L.100, to be repaid
                    at L.70, L.Θ0, or possibly at L.IOO; and perhaps, - what is of more importance
                    than all these together, we <pb break="no" facs="nls:193517282"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-7282-0255"/>might get rid of those great sources of the
                    demoralization , of the people, the Customs and Excise. In every view of this
                    question we come to the same conclusion, that it would be a great improvement in
                    our system for ever to get rid of the practice of funding. Let us meet our
                    difficulties as they arise, and keep our estates free from permanent
                    encumbrances, of the weight of which we are never truly sensible till we are
                    involved in them past remedy.</p>
                <p>We are now to compare the other two modes of defraying the expenses of a war, one
                    by borrowing the capital expended, and providing annual taxes permanently for
                    the payment of the interest; the other by borrowing the capital expended, and,
                    besides providing the interest by annual taxes, raising, by the same mode, an
                    additional revenue (and which is called the sinking fund), with a view, within a
                    certain determinate time, to redeem the original debt, and get rid entirely of
                    the taxes.</p>
                <p>Under the firm conviction that nations will at last adopt the plan of defraying
                    their expenses, ordinary and extraordinary, at the time they are incurred, we
                    are favourable to every plan which shall soonest redeem us from debt; but then
                    we must be convinced that the plan is effective for the object. This, then, is
                    the place to examine whether we have or can have any security for the due
                    application of the sinking fund to the payment of debt.</p>
                <p>When Mr Pitt, in 1786, established the sinking fund, he was aware of the danger
                    of intrusting it to ministers and parliament; and therefore provided that the
                    sums applicable to the sinking fund should be paid by the exchequer into the
                    hands of commissioners, by quarterly payments, who should be required to invest
                    equal sums of money in the purchase of stock, on four days in each week, or
                    about fifty days in each quarter. The commissioners named were, the Speaker of
                    the House of Commons, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Master of the Rolls,
                    the Accountant-General of the Court of Chancery, and the Governor and
                    Deputy-Governor of the Bank. He thought that, under such management, there could
                    be no misapplication of the funds, and he thought correctly, for the
                    commissioners have faithfully fulfilled the trust reposed in them. In proposing
                    the establishment of a sinking fund to parliament in 1786, Mr Pitt said, “With
                    regard to preserving the fund to be invariably applied to the diminution of the
                    debt inalienable, it was the essence of his plan to keep that sacred, and most
                    effectually so in time of war. He must contend, that to suffer the fund at any
                    time, or on any pretence, to be diverted from its proper object, would be to
                    ruin, defeat, and overturn his plan. He hoped, therefore, when the bill he
                    should introduce should pass into a law, that house would hold itself solemnly
                    pledged not to listen to a proposal for its repeal on any pretence
                    whatever.”</p>
                <p>“If this million, to be so applied, is laid out with its growing interest, it
                    will amount to a very great sum in a period that is not very long in the life of
                    an individual, and but an hour in the existence of a great nation; and this will
                    diminish the debt of this country so much as to prevent the exigencies of war
                    from raising it to the enormous height it has hitherto done. In the period of
                    twenty-eight years, the sum of a million, annually improved, would amount to
                    four millions per annum; but care must be taken that this fund be not broken in
                    upon: <hi rend="italic">this has hitherto been the bane of this country</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> for if the original sinking fund had been properly
                    preserved, it is easy to be proved that our debts, at this moment, would not
                    have been very burdensome: <hi rend="italic">this has hitherto been</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">vain endeavoured to be prevented by acts of parliament J</hi> the
                    minister has uniformly, when it suited his convenience, gotten hold of this sum,
                    which ought to have been regarded as most sacred. What then is the way of
                    preventing this? The plan I mean to propose is this, that this sum be vested in
                    certain commissioners, to be by them applied quarterly to buy up stock; by this
                    means, no sum so great will ever be ready to be seized upon on any occasion, and
                    the fund will go on without interruption. Long and very long has this country
                    struggled under its heavy load, without any prospect of being relieved; but it
                    may now look forward to an object upon which the existence of this country
                    depends; it is therefore proper it should be fortified as much as possible
                    against alienation. By this manner of paying L.250,000 quarterly into the hands
                    of commissioners, it would make it impossible to take it by stealth; and the
                    advantage would be too well felt ever to suffer a public act for that purpose. A
                    minister could not have the confidence to come to this house and desire the
                    repeal of so beneficial a law, which tended so directly to relieve the people
                    from burden.”</p>
                <p>Mr Pitt flattered himself most strangely, that he had found a remedy for the
                    difficulty which “had hitherto been the bane of this country he thought he had
                    discovered means for preventing “ministers, when it suited their convenience,
                    from getting hold of this sum, which ought to be regarded as most sacred.” With
                    the knowledge of parliament which he had, it is surprising that he should have
                    relied so firmly on the resistance which the House of Commons would offer to any
                    plan of ministers for violating the sinking fund. Ministers have never desired
                    the partial repeal of this law, without obtaining a ready compliance from
                    parliament.</p>
                <p>We have already shown, that in 1807, one chancellor of the exchequer proposed to
                    relieve the country from taxation, with a very slight exception, for several
                    years together, while we were, during war, keeping up, if not increasing, our
                    expenditure, and supplying it by means of annual loans. What is this but
                    disposing of a fund which ought to have been regarded as most sacred?</p>
                <p>In 1809, another chancellor of the exchequer raised a loan, without raising any
                    additional taxes to pay the interest of it, but pledged a portion of the
                    war-taxes for that purpose, thereby rendering an addition to that amount
                    necessary to the loan of the following and every succeeding year. Was not this
                    disposing of the sinking fund by stealth, and accumulating debt at compound
                    interest? Another chancellor of the exchequer, in 1813, proposed a partial
                    repeal of the law, by which seven millions per annum of the sinking fund was
                    placed at his disposal, and which he has employed in providing for the interest
                    of new debt. This was done with the sanction of parliament, and, as we
                    apprehend, in direct violation of all the laws which had before been passed
                    regarding the sinking fund. But what has become of the remainder of this fund,
                    after deducting the seven millions taken from it by the act of 1813?<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some of the following
                    observations refer to the period when this article was originally composed.
                    En.</p></note> It should now be sixteen millions, and at that amount it was
                    returned in the annual finance accounts last laid before parliament. The finance
                    committee appointed by the House of Commons did not fail to see that nothing can
                    be deemed an efficient fund for the redemption of debt in time of peace, but
                    such as arises from an excess of revenue above expenditure; and as that excess,
                    under the most favourable view, was not quite twe millions, they considered that
                    sum as the real efficient sinking fund, which was now applicable to the
                    discharg« of debt. If the act of 1802 had been complied with, it the intentions
                    of Mr Pitt had been fulfilled, we shouk now have had a clear excess of revenue
                    of above twenty <pb break="no" facs="nls:193517295" xml:id="kp-eb0710-7295-0256"
                    />millions, applicable to the payment of the debt; as it is, we have two
                    millions only, and if we ask ministers what has become of the remaining eighteen
                    millions, they show us an expensive peace establishment, which they have no
                    other means of defraying but by drafts on this fund, or several hundred millions
                    of three per cents, on which it is employed in discharging the interest. If
                    ministers had not had such an amount of taxes to depend on, would they have
                    ventured, year after year, to encounter a deficiency of revenue below
                    expenditure, for several years together, of more than twelve millions? It is
                    true that the measures of Mr Pitt locked it up from their immediate seizure; but
                    they knew it was in the hands of the commissioners, and presumed as much upon
                    it, and justly, with the knowledge they had of parliament, as if it had been in
                    their own. They considered the commissioners as their trustees, accumulating
                    money for their benefit, and of which they knew that they might dispose whenever
                    they should consider that the urgency of the case required it. They seem to have
                    made a tacit agreement with the commissioners, that they should accumulate
                    twelve millions per annum at compound interest, while they themselves
                    accumulated an equal amount of debt, also at compound interest. The facts are
                    indeed no longer denied. In the last session of parliament, for the first time,
                    the delusion was acknowledged by ministers, after it had become manifest to
                    every other person; but yet it is avowed to be their intention to go on with
                    this nominal sinking fund, raising a loan every year for the difference between
                    its real and nominal amount, and letting the commissioners subscribe to it. On
                    what principle this can be done, it would be difficult to give any rational
                    account. Perhaps it may be said that it would be a breach of faith to the
                    stockholder to take away the sinking fund; but is it not equally a breach of
                    faith if the government itself sells to the commissioners the greatest part of
                    the stock which they buy? The stockholder wants something substantial and real
                    to be done for him, and not any thing deceitful and delusive. Disguise it as you
                    will, if of fourteen millions to be invested by the commissioners in time of
                    peace, the stock which twelve millions will purchase is sold by the government
                    itself, which creates it for the very purpose of obtaining these twelve
                    millions, and only stock for two millions is purchased in the market, and no
                    taxes for sinking fund or interest are provided for the twelve millions which
                    government takes; the result is precisely the same to the stockholder, and to
                    every one concerned, as if the sinking fund was reduced to two millions. It is
                    utterly unworthy of a great country to countenance such pitiful shifts and
                    evasions.</p>
                <p>The sinking fund, then, has, instead of diminishing the lebt, greatly increased
                    it. The sinking fund has encouraged expenditure. If, during war, a country
                    spends twenty millions per annum, in addition to its ordinary expenditure, and
                    raises texes only for the interest, it will in twenty years accumulate a debt of
                    four hundred millions, ιnd its taxes will increase to twenty millions per annum,
                    [f, in addition to the million per annum, texes of L.200,000 were raised for a
                    sinking fund, and regularly applied to the purchase of stock, the texes, at the
                    end of twenty years, would be twenty-four millions, and its debt only three
                    hundred and forty-two millions; for fifty-eight millions will have been paid off
                    by the sinking fund; but if at the end of this period new debt shall be
                    contracted, and the sinking fund itself, with all its accumulations, amounting
                    to L.6,94-0,000, be absorbed in the payment of interest on such debt, the whole
                    amount of debt will be five hundred and thirty-eight millions, exceeding that
                    which would have existed if there had been no sinking fund by a hundred and
                    thirty-eight millions. If such an additional expenditure were necessary,
                    provision should be made for it without any interference with the sinking fund.
                    If, at the end of the war, there is not a clear surplus of revenue above
                    expenditure of L.6,940,000 on the above supposition, there is no use whatever in
                    persevering in a system which is so little adequate to its object. After all our
                    experience, however, we are again toiling to raise a sinking fund; and in the
                    last session of parliament three millions of new texes were voted, with the
                    avowed object of raising the remnant of our sinking fund, now reduced to two
                    millions, to five millions. Is it rash to prognosticate that this sinking fund
                    will share the fate of all those which have preceded it? * Probably it will
                    accumulate for a few years, till we are engaged in some new contest, when
                    ministers, finding it difficult to raise texes for the interest of loans, will
                    silently encroach on this fund; and we shall be fortunate if, in their next
                    arrangement, we shall be able to preserve out of its wreck an amount so large as
                    two millions.</p>
                <p>It is, we think, sufficiently proved that no securities can be given by ministers
                    that the sinking fund shall be faithfully devoted to the payment of debt, and
                    without such securities we should be much better without such a fund. To pay off
                    the whole, or a great portion of our debt, is, in our estimation, a most
                    desirable object, if, at the same time, we acknowledged the evils of the funding
                    system, and resolutely determined to carry on our future contests without having
                    recourse to it. This cannot, or rather will not, be done by a sinking fund as at
                    present constituted, nor by any other that we can suggest; but if, without
                    raising any fund, the debt were paid by a tex on property, once for all, it
                    would effect its object. Its operation might be completed in two or three years
                    during peace; and if we mean honestly to discharge the debt, w e do not see any
                    other mode of accomplishing it. The objections to this plan are the same as
                    those which we have already attempted to answer in speaking of wartaxes. The
                    stockholders, being paid off, would have a large mass of property, for which
                    they would be eagerly seeking employment. Manufacturers and landholders would
                    want large sums for their payments into the exchequer. These two parties would
                    not fail to make an arrangement with each other, by which one party would employ
                    their money, and the other raise it. They might do this by loan, or by sale and
                    purchase, as they might think it most conducive to their respective interests;
                    with this the state would have nothing to do. Thus, by one great effort, we
                    should get rid of one of the most terrible scourges which was ever invented to
                    afflict a nation; and our commerce would be extended without being subject to
                    all the vexatious delays and interruptions which our present artificial system
                    imposes upon it.</p>
                <p>There cannot be a greater security for the continuance of peace, than the
                    imposing on ministers the necessity of applying to the people for taxes to
                    support a war. Suffer the sinking fund to accumulate during peace to any
                    considerable sum, and very little provocation would induce them to enter into a
                    new contest. They would know that, by a little management, they could make the
                    sinking fund available to the raising of a new supply, instead of being
                    available to the payment of the debt. The argument is now common in the mouths
                    of ministers, when they wish to lay on new texes, for the purpose of creating a
                    new sinking fund, in lieu of one which they have just spent, to say, “It will
                    make foreign countries respect us; they will be afraid to insult or provoke us,
                    when they know that we are possessed of so powerful a resource.” What do they
                    mean by this argument, if the sinking fund be not considered by them as a war
                    fund, on which they can draw in support of the contest? It cannot, at one and
                    the same time, be employed in the annoyance of an enemy, and in the payment of
                    debt. If taxes are, as they ought to be, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193517308"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-7308-0257"/>raised for the expenses of a war, what facility
                    will a sinking fund give to the raising of them? none whatever. It is not
                    because the possession of a sinking fund will enable them to raise new and
                    additional taxes that ministers prize it; for they know it will have no such
                    effect; but because they know that they will be enabled to substitute the
                    sinking fund in lieu of taxes, and employ it, as they have always done, in war,
                    and providing interest for fresh debt. Their argument means this, or it means
                    nothing; for a sinking fund does not necessarily add to the wealth and
                    prosperity of a country; and it is on that wealth and prosperity that it must
                    depend, whether new burdens can be borne by the people. What did Mr Vansittart
                    mean in 1813, when he said that “the advantage which his new plan of finance
                    would hereafter give, in furnishing a hundred millions in time of peace, as a
                    fund against the return of hostilities, was one of great moment. This would
                    place an instrument of force in the hands of parliament, which might lead to the
                    most important results.” “It might be objected by some, that keeping in reserve
                    a large fund to meet the expenses of a new war, might be likely to make the
                    government of this country arrogant and ambitious, and therefore have a tendency
                    unnecessarily to plunge us in new contests not a very unreasonable objection, we
                    should think. How does Mr Vansittart answer it? “On this subject he would say,
                    from long experience and observation, that it would be better for our neighbours
                    to depend on the moderation of this country, than for this country to depend on
                    them. He should not think the plan objectionable on this account. If the sums
                    treasured up were misapplied by the arrogant or ambitious conduct of our
                    government, the blame must fall on the heads of those who misused it, not on
                    those who put it into their hands for purposes of defence. They did their duty
                    in furnishing the means of preserving the greatness and glory of the country,
                    though those means might be used for the purposes of ambition, rapine, and
                    desolation.” These are very natural observations from the mouth of a minister;
                    but we are of opinion that such a treasure would be more safe in the custody of
                    the people, and that parliament have something more to do than to furnish
                    ministers with the means of preserving the greatness and glory of the country.
                    It is their duty to take every security that the resources of the country are
                    not misapplied “by the arrogant and ambitious conduct of our government,” or
                    “used for the purposes of ambition, rapine, and desolation.”</p>
                <p>On the extraordinary assumption that there was any thing in Mr Vansittart’s plan
                    that would more effectually than the old plan allow a hundred millions hereafter
                    to be appropriated to the public service, Dr Hamilton has the following
                    observations:</p>
                <p>“We are altogether at a loss to form a distinct conception of the <hi
                    rend="italic">valuable treasure</hi> here held forth. So soon as any stock is
                    purchased by the commissioners, and stands invested in their name, a like amount
                    of the public debt is in fact discharged. Whether a parliamentary declaration to
                    the effect be made or not, is only a matter of form. If the money remain
                    invested in the name of the commissioners, no doubt it may be transferred again
                    to purchasers in the stock exchange when war broke out anew; and money may be
                    raised for the public in this manner. It is an application to the public to
                    invest their capital in the purchase of this dormant stock.” “It is true, that
                    if the taxes imposed during war for the purpose of a sinking fund be continued
                    after peace is restored, till a large sum (suppose L. 100,000,000) be vested in
                    the hands of the commissioners, the public, upon the renewal of the war, may
                    spend to that amount without imposing fresh taxes; an advantage,” observes Mr
                    Huskisson, “not only not exclusively belonging to this plan, but unavoidable
                    under any plan of a sinking fund in time of peace.” Mr Vansittart ought to have
                    said, “if our sinking fund should accumulate in time of peace to so large a sum
                    that I can take five millions per annum from it, I can spend L. 100,000,000 in a
                    new war without coming to you for fresh taxes: the disadvantages of my plan are,
                    that by now taking L.7,000,000 per annum from it, and making a provision for
                    speedily, and at regular intervals, appropriating more of this fund to present
                    objects, the sinking fund will be so much diminished that I cannot so soon, by a
                    great many years, avail myself of the five millions for the purpose which I have
                    stated.” (s. s. s.)</p>
