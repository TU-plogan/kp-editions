                    mathematician and astronomer, was born at Milan the 13th April 1728; his family
                    had formerly emigrated from Strasburg, and was established at Milan in an humble
                    station of life.</p>
                <p>At the age of fifteen he entered into the convent of the Barnabite friars, or of
                    the congregation of St Paul, where his studies were at first confined to the
                    attainment of some knowledge of geography from the contemplation of the old maps
                    that were pasted on the walls of the galleries; he soon acquired, however, a
                    taste for geometry, and made considerable progress in it without an instructor.
                    He was sent to the university of Pavia to go through a course of divinity, and
                    he did not neglect the opportunity of applying with increased diligence to the
                    mathematics, with the assistance of Professor Olivetano, He was afterwards
                    removed to Lodi, in order to give lectures there on philosophy; and he soon
                    after distinguished himself by writing a most able essay on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Figure of the Earth,</hi> which, however, he had not the means of
                    printing, as his brethren were unwilling to assist him, until ht <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193517022" xml:id="kp-eb0710-7022-0235"/>found a patron for his
                    publication in the Count de Silva, ' who undertook to be at the expense of the
                    impression.</p>
                <p>The credit which he acquired induced some other members of the society to follow
                    his example, and the convent of the Bamabites at Milan soon began to be
                    converted into a nursery of mathematics. His reputation procured him also, from
                    the king of Sardinia, the appointment of professor of philosophy in the college
                    of Casale. Here, however, he thought the conduct of his superiors unjust and
                    tyrannical, and they were also dissatisfied with him on account of his great
                    intimacy with Radicati, whose opinions were rather more liberal than they
                    thought it prudent to tolerate. This friendship was, however, so far of
                    advantage to Frisi, as it tended to improve his taste in modern literature; but
                    it was the principal cause of his being removed to Novara, where he was obliged
                    to undertake the duties of a preacher. In the mean time he was nominated a
                    correspondent of the Parisian Academy of Sciences in 1753, and received similar
                    honours from other scientific bodies. Soon after this he was recalled to Milan,
                    and made professor of philosophy in the great Barnabite College of St Alexander
                    in that city. His dissertation on the <hi rend="italic">Figure of the Earth</hi>
                    was very acrimoniously attacked by a young Jesuit, who accused him of being
                    improperly led away by English and French innovations; but it was easy for him
                    to repel so unfounded a charge. From this time he entertained much ill humour
                    against the Jesuits in general, and had written a work to depreciate the order,
                    but he was advised by his second brother to suppress it. He became, however,
                    more and more connected with the enemies of the Jesuits, and, among them, with
                    D’Alembert, Condorcet, and the other Encyclopédistes. He had before this time
                    declared himself, in his lectures, an enemy to the popular opinions of the
                    Italians respecting magic and witchcraft, though he felt himself in some danger
                    of the animadversions of the Inquisition. He was much in the habit of
                    frequenting the best societies in Milan, and even more than was thought
                    consistent with his religious character; but he was in some measure emancipated
                    from the restraints of his order, by his appointment, in 1756, to a
                    professorship in the university of Pisa, for which he was indebted to the Grand
                    Duke Leopold. This situation he retained for eight years, enjoying the highest
                    degree of credit, and receiving marked attention from all travellers of
                    distinction, and saving, at the same time, a considerable portion of his salary,
                    to which he added the amount of some prizes which he obtained from Berlin and
                    Petersburg in 1756, and from Paris in 1758. Notwithstanding his occupations as a
                    professor of moral philosophy, he had always been in the habit of devoting the
                    greater part of his attention to the mathematical sciences. In 1757 he was made
                    an associate of the Imperial Academy of Peterβhurg, and a foreign member of the
                    Royal Society of London; in 1758, a member of the Academy of Berlin; in 1766, of
                    that of Stockholm; and in 1770, of the Academies of Copenhagen and of Berne. The
                    Archduke Joseph had sent him, in 1759, a collar with a gold medal, and he
                    received similar marks of distinction from the kings of Prussia and Denmark. He
                    was also liberally rewarded by Pope Clement XIII. for his services in arranging
                    a dispute between the people of Ferrara and of Bologna on the subject of rivers
                    and torrents, which had been referred to him on the occasion of a tour that he
                    made to Naples and to Rome in 1760. The senate of Venice also made him a proper
                    acknowledgment for the assistance he gave to the commissioners whom they had
                    appointed to control the ravages of the Brenta. The Empress Maria Theresa
                    settled on him a pension of 100 sequins, or L.50 a year. He was recalled to
                    Milan in 1764, as professor of mathematics in the Palatine schools, with
                    appointments equal to those which he had enjoyed at Pisa, and with the
                    additional advantage of living near his family, and being enabled to promote
                    their interests. He was at various times much engaged in the decision of
                    controversies respecting canals and rivers, and obtained much credit for his
                    skill and ingenuity; though the peculiarities of his temper tended somewhat to
                    increase the number of enemies, which might possibly have been unavoidable.
                    Among other controversies, he was engaged in a dispute respecting the propriety
                    of adding a high pinnacle to the dome of the church at Milan, which has since
                    been raised in opposition to his opinion. In 1766 he undertook a journey into
                    France and England, and his celebrity everywhere procured him the most
                    flattering attentions. At Paris a very liberal proposal was made to him to
                    remove to Lisbon, but he preferred returning to his own country. In 1768 he went
                    to Vienna, and he was consulted by the government there upon some imnortant
                    questions of ecclesiastical policy, in which his advice was adopted. He remained
                    but little longer in the college of St Alexander, and Pope Pius VI. liberated
                    him entirely from subjection to the superiors of his order, and allowed him to
                    wear the habit of a secular priest. As one of the censors of the press, he had
                    incautiously been accessory to the publication of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lanterna</hi><hi rend="italic">Curiosa,</hi> the work of a coffee-house club in
                    Milan, which gave great offence to the government; and he afterwards still more
                    imprudently undertook to defend it. This circumstance occasioned his removal
                    from Milan for a time, but he was recalled in 1777, and was appointed director
                    of a school of architecture. He was active in introducing the employment of
                    conductors for security against lightning, and had one fixed for an example on
                    the repository of the public archives. He was equally zealous on every other
                    occasion, in the dissemination of useful novelties among his countrymen. In 1778
                    he made a tour into Switzerland, and his observations there gave rise to his
                    speculations on subterraneous rivers. He enjoyed uninterrupted health until the
                    age of forty-eight, when he was attacked by a haemorrhoidal affection, ending in
                    an abscess, which, eight years afterwards, required the performance of an
                    operation; this was unfortunately succeeded by a fatal mortification, and he
                    died the 22d November 1784, at the moment when he was about to be placed on the
                    list of the eight foreign associates of the Parisian Academy; an honour which
                    had been delayed by the preference of J. A. Euler, on the occasion of a former
                    vacancy, to the no small mortification of his vanity. He had very lately
                    obtained a prize from the Academy of Haerlem, for his memoir on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Inequality of the Satellites of Jupiter.</hi> He was buried in the
                    church of St Alexander, and a medallion with his portrait was placed over his
                    tomb by his brethren Barnabites. He had four brothers, Antony, a physician,
                    botanist, and chemist; Antony Francis, an ecclesiastic, author of some
                    antiquarian researches of merit; Louis, a canon of St Ambrose, a learned
                    theologian and mechanician; and Philip, a lawyer, author of a dissertation, <hi

                    dissertation De existentia et motu aetheřis, seu de theoria electricitatis ignis
                    et lucis, printed with J. A. Euler’s Disquisitio de causa physica electricitatis
                    praemio coronata, 1755,4to, Petersburg. This dissertation shows some ingenuity,
                    but is by no means established on firm foundations. Among some other fanciful
                    hypotheses, it suggests that light is probably an impulse transmitted by <pb

                    elegance, simplicity, and facility; leaving, however, the fact of the moon’s
                    acceleration still unexplained, and even stating doubts of its existence. 16.
