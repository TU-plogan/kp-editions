                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">FRANCISCANS</label>, <hi rend="italic">in Ecclesiastical
                    History,</hi> are the members of the religious order established by St Francis
                    in the year 1208. Francis was the son of a merchant of Assisi, in the province
                    of Umbria. After leading for some time a dissolute life, he was reclaimed by a
                    fit of sickness, and fell into the opposite extreme of devotion. Soon after this
                    event, hearing the passage repeated (Mat. x. 9, 10), in which Christ addresses
                    his apostles, <hi rend="italic">Provide neither gold, nor silver,</hi> &amp;c.
                    he was led to believe that a voluntary and absolute poverty was the essence of
                    the gospel, and to prescribe this poverty as a sacred rule both to himself and
                    to his followers. This new society, which appeared to Innocent III. extremely
                    well adapted to the state of the church at the time, and calculated to restore
                    its declining credit, was solemnly approved of and confirmed by Honorius III. in
                    1223, and had made considerable progress before the death of its founder, which
                    took place in 1226. Francis, through an excessive humility, would not suffer the
                    monks of his order to be called <hi rend="italic">fratres,</hi> brethren or
                    friars, but <hi rend="italic">fraterculi,</hi> little brethren, or friars-minor,
                    by which denomination they still continue to be distinguished. They were also
                    called <hi rend="italic">gray friars,</hi> on account of the colour of their
                    clothing, and sometimes <hi rend="italic">cordeliers.</hi> The Franciscans and
                    Dominicans were zealous and active friends of the papal hierarchy, and, in
                    return for their devotion to its interests, were distinguished by peculiar
                    privileges and honourable employments. The Franciscans, in particular, were
                    invested with ample and extensive indulgences, the distribution of which was
                    committed to them by the popes, as a means of subsistence, and a rich
                    indemnification for their voluntary poverty. In consequence of this grant, the
                    rule of the founder, which absolutely prohibited both personal and collective
                    property, so that neither the individual nor the community<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193516840" xml:id="kp-eb0710-6840-0221"/> were to possess either fund,
                    revenue, or any worldly goods, was considered as too strict and severe, and
                    dispensed with soon after his death. In 1231 Gregory IX. published an
                    interpretation of this rule, mitigating its rigour; and it was further confirmed
                    by Innocent IV. in 124&gt;5, and by Alexander IV. in 1247. But these mitigations
                    were zealously opposed by a branch of the Franciscans called the <hi
                    rend="italic">spiritual;</hi> and their complaints were attended to by Nicholas
                    III. who, in 1279, published a ∞nstitution, confirming the rule of St Francis,
                    and containing an elaborate explanation of the maxims which it recommended, and
                    the duties which it prescribed. In 1287, Matthew of Aqua Sparta, being elected
                    general of the order, discouraged the ancient discipline of the Franciscans, and
                    allowed his monks to abandon even the appearance of poverty. This conduct
                    inflamed the indignation of the spiritual Franciscans; so that from the year
                    1290 seditions and schisms arose in an order that had been distinguished, in
                    appearance at least, for its disinterestedness and humility. Such was the
                    enthusiastic frenzy of the Franciscans, that they impiously maintained that the
                    founder of their order was a second Christ, in all respects similar to the
                    first; and that their institution and discipline were the true gospel of Jesus.
                    Accordingly, in 1303, Albizi, a Franciscan of Pisa, published a book, with the
                    applause of his order, entitled <hi rend="italic">The book of the Conformities
                    of St Francis with Jesus Christ.</hi> In the beginning of the fourteenth century
                    the whole Franciscan order was divided into two parties; one of which embraced
                    the severe discipline and absolute poverty of St Francis, and were called <hi
                    rend="italic">spirituals}</hi> and the other, who insisted on mitigating the
                    austere injunctions of their founder, were denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >brethren of the community.</hi> The latter wore long and loose, but good
                    habits, with large hoods; the former were clad in a strait, coarse, and short
                    dress, pretending that their habiliments were enjoined by St Francis, and that
                    no power on earth had a right to alter them. But neither the moderation of
                    Clement V. nor the violence of John XXII. could appease the tumult occasioned by
                    their contentions; their rage, however, subsided after the year 1329. In 1368
                    these two parties were formed into two large bodies, comprehending the whole
                    Franciscan order, which subsist to this day; namely, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >conventual brethren,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">brethren of the
                    observance,</hi> from whom sprung the Capuchins and Recollects. The general
                    opinion is, that the Franciscans came into England in the year 1224, and had
                    their first house at Canterbury, and their second at London; but there is no
                    certain account of their being here until King Henry VII. built two or three
                    houses for them. On the dissolution of the monasteries, the conventual
                    Franciscans owned about fifty-five houses, which were under seven custodies or
                    wardenships, namely, those of London, York, Cambridge, Bristol, Oxford,
                    Newcastle, and Worcester. In the eighteenth century the whole number of
                    Franciscans and Capuchins amounted to 115,000 monks, who occupied 7000 convents.
                    At present, however, their number is not nearly so great, as the order has been
                    suppressed in various countries.</p>
