                <p><label type="entry">FUSELI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Henry</hi></label>, a celebrated
                    painter, was born at Zurich, in Switzerland, in the year 1741. He was the second
                    son of Gaspard Fuessli, who had obtained some distinction as a portrait and
                    landscape painter. Henry chose to alter the orthography of the family name, and
                    also to place the date of his birth in the year 1745, instead of 1741. From his
                    earliest years he was inspired with a love of painting, particularly of those
                    works which have a sublime or imaginative character. Michel Angelo was his
                    favourite artist; and he familiarized himself with his style, by making numerous
                    copies of some prints of that great master’s productions. Fuseli made rapid
                    progress in learning, and united the love of literature, particularly of the
                    poetry of Greece and Rome, with his devotion to painting. At the Humanity
                    College of Zurich he became the intimate friend of the celebrated physiognomist
                    Lavater. Here he studied the English language, and conceived such an ardent
                    admiration of Shakspeare, that he translated Macbeth into German. He was
                    induced, however, to leave his native place on account of a circumstance in
                    nowise discreditable to his character. A magistrate in one of the bailiwicks of
                    Zurich having committed some flagrant act of oppression, Lavater and he
                    published a pamphlet exposing the affair, and so effectually did the friends
                    succeed in their attempt, that the unjust ruler was compelled to leave the
                    country. His friends, however, so annoyed Fuseli, that after taking his degree
                    of master of arts, he quitted Zurich, first for Vienna and then for Berlin,
                    whither he was accompanied by Lavater. In the capital of Prussia the two friends
                    prosecuted their studies under the learned Sulzer; and here Fuseli extended his
                    acquaintance with English literature. His genius and talents attracted the
                    attention of Sir Robert Smith, British ambassador at the court of Berlin, and by
                    the advice of that gentleman<pb break="no" facs="nls:193517581"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-7581-0278"/> he was induced to visit England, where he arrived
                    in the year 1762. He had letters of introduction to several influential
                    individuals, through whose instrumentality he obtained the situation of tutor to
                    the son of a nobleman, whom he accompanied to Paris. His governorship, however,
                    was short, and after returning to England he subsisted for some time by the
                    labours of bis pen. He wrote a number of pieces, but acknowledged none save the
                    translation of Winkelman’s work on painting and sculpture. About this period an
                    angry controversy raged between Voltaire and Rousseau, and Fuseli printed a
                    pamphlet in defence of the latter; but the whole impression caught fire, much to
                    the satisfaction of the author, who afterwards felt ashamed of his production.
                    Having shown some of his sketches to Sir Joshua Reynolds, the highly favourable
                    opinion of that great painter determined the fate of our young artist, and he
                    resolved on devoting himself entirely to the pencil. His first work was Joseph
                    interpreting the Dreams of the Chief Baker and Butler; but nothing is known as
                    to the manner in which it was executed or received, and the picture is now lost.
                    In 1770 he visited Italy in company with Armstrong the poet. From his boyhood an
                    enthusiastic admirer of Michel Angelo, he had an opportunity in Rome of studying
                    that great artist in all his sublimity and grandeur, and for weeks together, as
                    he loved to repeat, he would repose on his back gazing upon the magnificent
                    ceiling of the Sistine chapel, and the lofty grandeur of the Florentine. Nor was
                    the milder radiance which sheds such an inexpressible charm over the works of
                    Raffaelle overlooked by our ardent student. But still, although he acknowledged
                    the genius of that great master, he considered him as inferior to Michel Angelo,
                    upon whom, fulfilling the injunctions of Reynolds, “he eat, he drank, he slept,
                    he waked.” From Rome he transmitted several pictures to England, two of which
                    were taken from Shakspeare; namely, the Death of Beaufort, and a scene from
                    Macbeth. After visiting his father at Zurich, he returned to London in 1779. In
                    1782 appeared his celebrated work entitled Nightmare, a subject peculiarly
                    adapted to his genius, and which at once stamped him as a great and original
                    genius. The idea of the Shakspeare gallery having been started at the table of
                    Aiderman Boydell, it was eagerly caught up by Fuseli and other painters present.
                    It was soon afterwards realized, and, as might have been expected, our artist
                    grappled with the wildest passages of • the dramatist. For this institution he
                    painted eight of his best pictures, of which the Ghost in Hamlet is considered
                    as the noblest. Other pictures followed, the subjects of which were taken from
                    Dante, Virgil, Sophocles, and other poets: and the fame of Fuseli having spread
                    far and wide, he was in 1790 elected a royal academician. In the course of the
                    next nine years he painted forty-seven pictures from Milton, which were
                    afterwards exhibited as the Milton gallery. They all more or less evince the
                    vigorous imagination of the painter. The Lazar House is most admired by men of
                    vertù; but the rising of Satan at the touch of Ithuriel’s spear is the favourite
                    of the multitude. In 1799 he succeeded Barry in the professorship of painting,
                    and, in 1804, Wilton as keeper of the Royal Academy. In the year following he
                    published an improved edition of Pilkington’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of
                    Painters,</hi> which, however, added but little to his reputation, although he
                    introduced a great number of new names as candidates for pictorial celebrity. In
                    1807 the students of the Royal Academy presented him with a silver vase designed
                    by Flaxman; and ten years afterwards he was presented with the diploma of the
                    first class in the Roman Academy of St Luke. From this period until his death
                    Fuseli exhibited twelve pictures at the academy, neither the fervour of his
                    fancy nor his skill of hand having in the least failed. Whilst on a visit to the
                    Countess of Guildford at Putney Hill, he became seriously unwell; and his
                    indisposition increasing, he expired there, on the 16th of April 1825, in the
                    eighty-fourth year of his age.</p>
                <p>As a painter, the merits of Fuseli are of a high order in the line to which he
                    applied himself. His mind was daring, and in dealing with themes of terror and
                    imagination he evinced an originality and skill not surpassed amongst English
                    artists, for to England he belongs by adoption. As a professor of painting, his
                    chief aim was to impress his audience with a sense of the nobleness of art, and
                    the high purposes to which alone it ought to be dedicated. His lectures and
                    other literary compositions evince the same characteristic attributes of mind.
                    In many of his criticisms upon painters and painting, particularly his
                    celebrated disquisition upon invention, he displays great originality of mind,
                    with a lofty and impassioned eloquence. His lectures were published in one
                    volume 4to.</p>
