                <p><label type="entry">CARRICKFERGUS</label>, a town in the province of Ulster, in
                    Ireland, which, with a small surrounding district, forms one of the eight
                    counties of towns which enjoy an exclusive jurisdiction, separate from that of
                    the county within which they are situated. It lies on the northern side of
                    Carrickfergus Bay, called also the Lough of Belfast, and is surrounded on all
                    other sides by the county of Antrim. The length and breadth of the whole county
                    are about four miles each. A ridge of high ground extends along it from east to
                    west, terminating on its western extremity by Slieve-true, a mountain which
                    rises to the height of 1100 feet above the level of the sea, and commands an
                    extensive prospect.</p>
                <p>About three miles to the north of the town of Carrickfergus, on an elevated
                    range, upwards of 550 feet above the level of the sea, is Lough Morne,
                    remarkable as being the largest sheet of fresh water at the same altitude in
                    Ireland. Though its supply of water is extremely scanty, a stream issues from it
                    containing a body of water sufficient, even during the driest seasons, to turn
                    the works of a cotton-mill situated near the sea side. The only river in this
                    district worthy of the name is the Woodburn, formed of two branches, on each of
                    which there is a fine cascade; its stream supplies several mills and
                    print-fields. The Silverstream and Copeland rivers are mere rivulets, remarkable
                    only as marking the bounds of the county to the west and east.</p>
                <p>The town of Carrickfergus itself, from which the county and the adjoining bay
                    take their names, is the only place of any consequence within the district. It
                    takes its name from a large rock, in Irish <hi rend="italic">carrich,</hi>
                    projecting into the sea, on which its castle is built; and from Fergus, one of
                    the ancient kings of Scotland, supposed to have been drowned in the
                    neighbourhood. It was <hi rend="italic">a</hi> place little known till the
                    arrival of the English; soon after which event John de Courcy, to whom Henry II.
                    had granted all the parts of Ulster he could gain possession of by his sword,
                    fixed here a colony, which soon acquired stability and importance. Yet during
                    the earlier period of its existence it was subject to many vicissitudes of
                    fortune. In the reign of Edward II. it was taken by Edward Bruce, in his
                    expedition to assert his right to the throne of Ireland. In 1386 it was burned
                    by the Scotch, and in 1400 again destroyed by the combined forces of the Scotch
                    and Irish, who had defeated an English fleet near Strangford. Subsequently it
                    suffered much by famine and by the occasional assaults of the neighbouring Irish
                    chieftains, whose favour the townsmen were at length necessitated to secure by
                    the payment of an annual tribute.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Elizabeth its value as a military and commercial position was
                    better appreciated. It obtained a charter, which confirmed its former extensive
                    privileges, and added some new rights. The town was fortified by a substantial
                    wall, strengthened with seven bastions. The corporation was also regulated. The
                    mayor enjoyed the jurisdiction of high admiral of the adjoining seas, from
                    Fairhead in the county of Antrim, to the Beerlooms, a point of land near the
                    entrance of Strangford Lough in the county of Down. This charter was confirmed
                    by James I. who added the additional right of sending two burgesses to
                    parliament. It now became a place of considerable importance. At the
                    commencement of the civil wars in 1641, an attempt to surprise it, made by Sir
                    Henry M‘Neil, was baffled by the vigilance of the governor, Colonel Arthur
                    Chichester. It then became the principal place of refuge for the Protestants
                    from the neighbouring counties. Shortly afterwards it was taken possession of by
                    General Munroe on the part of the king; but, after holding it for some time, he
                    was surprised and sent prisoner to England by Monk the parliamentary general,
                    who, as a reward for this piece of service, was made governor, and received a
                    grant of a sum of L.500. In the year 1689 it surrendered on terms to General
                    Schomberg on the part of King William, but not till its ammunition had been
                    wholly exhausted. Soon afterwards it was visited by William in person, on his
                    arrival in Ireland to head his troops previously to the battle of the Boyne. The
                    town’s people still point out the precise stone on the quay where that monarch
                    first set foot. In the beginning of the year 1760 it was unexpectedly surprised
                    by a small French squadron commanded by M. Thurot, who, after holding it for a
                    few days, evacuated it as quickly as he had entered it, in order to meet an
                    English squadron which was in pursuit of him, and in an action with which he
                    lost his life. In the year 1778 the town was again alarmed by the sudden
                    appearance of the celebrated Paul Jones, who, however, made no attempt on
                    it.</p>
                <p>The town extends along the sea-shore about a mile. It consists of three parts;
                    the town within the walls, the Irish quarter on the west, and the Scotch quarter
                    on the east. The principal building is the castle, standing on the projecting
                    rock already mentioned, and surrounded by a wall of masonry, planted with about
                    twenty pieces of artillery. The ancient keep or donjon is still in perfect
                    preservation. It is ninety feet high.</p>
                <p>The parish church, an antiquated structure, in the shape of a cross, formed by
                    the intersection of two narrow aisles, was originally a chapel or oratory
                    dependent on a Franciscan monastery in another part of the town. The entrance of
                    a subterraneous passage leading to it is still visible under the communion table
                    of the church. One of the aisles is the private property of the Chichester
                    family, who used it as a cemetery.</p>
                <p>The court-house of the county of Antrim, a neat modern building of a single
                    story, forms the termination of the principal street. Close to it is the jail of
                    the same county, built on the site of the monastery already mentioned, which,
                    after the suppression of those buildings by Henry VIII. fell into the hands of
                    the Chichester family. The corporation of Carrickfergus at present maintains no
                    court-house or prison of its own.</p>
                <p>The other public buildings in the town are meetinghouses for dissenters,
                    methodists, and independents. The town can boast of no literary institution of
                    any kind whatsoever<pb break="no" facs="nls:193349291"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-9291-0176"/>. It has, however, several of a charitable nature,
                    as Lancasterian and Sunday schools. By a bequest of Henry Gill, a freeman,
                    fourteen decayed old townsmen enjoy a residence and an annual allowance of L.10
                    each; and by another of Henry Adair, the interest of L.2000 is annually
                    distributed among poor freemen. Formerly these be* quests were seldom sought
                    after, but now the applications for them are numerous. The suburbs, called the
                    Irish and Scotch quarters, are chiefly inhabited by fishermen.</p>
                <p>The government of the corporation is vested in a mayor, seventeen aidermen, and
                    twenty-four burgesses, who together form the assembly, and exercise the right of
                    enacting bye-laws and creating freemen. The freemen have no share in the local
                    legislation. Their number amounts to about 800. The other corporate officers are
                    two sheriffs, a recorder, a treasurer, two coroners, a town-clerk, a
                    sword-bearer, and four serjeants-at-mace. The trades of the town arc formed into
                    seven guilds, each under the control of a master and two wardens; the hammermen
                    or carpenters are considered as the most respectable.</p>
                <p>The few villages within the precincts of the county are very small, the largest
                    containing only thirty-five houses. Gentlemen’s seats are frequent along the
                    coast, and add considerably to the appearance of the prospect. With the
                    exception of their plantations, there is scarcely any standing timber, although
                    strong evidence of the country having been formerly well wooded appears in the
                    number of trunks of trees raised from the bogs, in one of which, situated on the
                    shore beyond high-water mark, and therefore covered with sand and other marine
                    deposits, there have been found, together with the trees, hazel-nuts, some of
                    which were in a state of petrifaction. Petrified hazelnuts, and many other
                    scarce fossil remains, are also found on the banks of Woodburn river.</p>
                <p>The chief minerals found here are basalt and limestone. The searches for coal
                    have been uniformly unsuccessful. Gypsum is raised in large quantities, and
                    conveyed to Belfast for exportation. A mineral spring, containing a purging
                    nitrous salt, is situated in the eastern part of the town; and about a mile
                    farther east is a pure saline spring, said to be the only one of the kind in
                    Ireland. Near Lough Morne is a sulphureous chalybeate spring, once frequented,
                    but latterly totally neglected.</p>
                <p>The only manufacture carried on to a considerable extent is the cotton, which has
                    wholly superseded that of linen. It gives work to three large factories, and as
                    many print-ficlds. In the town there are a brewcry and a distillery. The farms
                    are small, except in the interior and hilly parts, where grazing is the
                    principal occupation. Wheat is little sown, the chief crops being oats and
                    potatoes, for which sea-weed, generally mixed with line and vegetable matter,
                    forms the manure. Cheese of excellent quality is made in the neighbourhood of
                    the town.</p>
                <p>According to the ecclesiastical arrangements of Ireland, this county forms a
                    single rectory in the diocese of Connor. It now constitutes part of the corps of
                    the deanery. It is rated in the king’s book at L.8 for first fruits; but its
                    actual annual value, as ascertained under the tithe composition act, is
                    L.400.</p>
                <p>A weekly market is held in the town on Saturdays, and fairs take place on the
                    12th of May and 1st of November. According to the latest observations,
                    Carrickfergus is in long. 5. 47. W. and lat. 54. 43. N.</p>
