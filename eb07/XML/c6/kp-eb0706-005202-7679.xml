                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">CAMPOMANES, D</label>. <hi rend="smallcaps">Pedro Rodrigues,
                    Conde de,</hi> a Spanish statesman, and writer of great celebrity, particularly
                    on subjects of political philosophy, was born in the Asturias towards the year
                    1710. We learn from the <hi rend="italic">Biographie Universelle</hi> that he
                    was appointed by Charles III. fiscal of the royal and supreme council of
                    Castile; that, on the accession of Charles IV. in 1788, he was appointed
                    president of this council, and afterwards minister of state; and that he was
                    expelled from the council, and deprived of all his employments, when Count
                    Florida Blanca came into power. He was director of the Royal Academy of History,
                    and an honorary member of most of the other similar establishments in Europe. He
                    supported his expulsion from office and power with firmness and dignity; and
                    died at Madrid, according to the <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire Universel,</hi>
                    in 1789, but according to the <hi rend="italic">Biographie Universelle,</hi> not
                    till after the commencement of the present century.</p>
                <p>The number of his works, and the variety of subjects which they embrace, show him
                    to have been a man of uncommon activity, as well as versatility of talent, while
                    some of them display such a depth of political knowledge, and superiority to the
                    prejudices of his country and age, as have ranked him in the first class of
                    modern writers on political economy and legislation. The following list contains
                    abridged titles of his principal works, all of which, we believe, were published
                    in the Spanish language, but none of them, as far as we know, has ever yet
                    appeared in an English dress.</p>
                <p>1. Historical Dissertations on the Order of the Knights Templars. Madrid, 1747.
                    2. A Translation of the Pe riplus of Hanno, with Notes. 1756. This translation
                    was made from Hudson’s edition of the <hi rend="italic">Periplus,</hi> and the
                    notes contain a refutation of the objections urged by Dodwell against the
                    authenticity of this celebrated journal, which is now universally admitted to be
                    one of the most curious relics of antiquity. The learning and ability which he
                    displayed in support of it procured him an unsolicited place among the
                    corresponding members of the French Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres.
                    3. A Geographical Account of the Kingdom of Portugal. 1762. 4. Two Memorials
                    relative to the means of regulating and employing Gypsies and Vagrants. 1763—4.
                    5. A Memorial on the necessity of a Free Commerce in Grain. 1764. 6. Memorial on
                    the provisioning of the city of Madrid, drawn up and published by order of the
                    supreme council. 1768, 2 vols. 8vo. 7. Discourse on the Protection of Industry.
                    1774, in 8vo. 8. Discourse on the Education of Artisans, 8vo, 1775. In 1777 he
                    gave to the world an Appendix to this work, containing a view of the causes
                    which have led to the decline of arts and manufactures in Spain, in 4 vols. 8vo.
                    Of these two great works, the <hi rend="italic">Discurso</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sobre</hi><hi rend="italic">el</hi><hi rend="italic">fomento</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de la</hi><hi rend="italic">Industria popular,</hi> and <hi

                    rend="italic">Artesanos,</hi> Dr Robertson speaks as follows: “Almost every
                    point of importance with respect to interior police, taxation, agriculture,
                    manufactures, and trade, domestic as well as foreign, is examined in the course
                    of them; and there are not many authors, even in the nations most eminent for
                    commercial knowledge, who have carried on their inquiries with more thorough
                    knowledge of those various subjects, and a more perfect freedom from vulgar and
                    national prejudices, or who have united more happily the calm researches of
                    philosophy with the ardent zeal of a public-spirited citizen.”</p>
                <p>The above seem to be the chief productions of the pen of Campomanes; but, besides
                    these, he was author of several other pieces on historical and literary
                    subjects; and he published a complete edition of the voluminous works of Feyjoo,
                    to which he prefixed an account of the life of that learned benedictine.</p>
