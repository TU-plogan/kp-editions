                <p><label type="entry">CHROMATIC</label>, a kind of music which proceeds by several
                    semitones in succession. The word is derived from the Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >γ^ο&gt;μa,</hi> which signifies <hi rend="italic">colour.</hi> For this
                    denomination several causes have been assigned, of which none appears certain,
                    and all are equally unsatisfactory. Instead, therefore, of fixing upon any, we
                    shall offer a conjecture of our own, namely, that as χjw∕xα not only signifies a
                    <hi rend="italic">colour,</hi> but also a shade of a colour by which it melts
                    into another, or what the French call <hi rend="italic">nuance,</hi> so the word
                    in this sense is highly applicable to semitones, which being the smallest
                    interval allowed in the diatonic scale, most easily run into one another. In
                    order to learn the reasons assigned by the ancients for this denomination, and
                    their various divisions of the chromatic species, the reader may consult the
                    same article in Rousseau’s Musical Dictionary. At present this species consists
                    in giving such a procedure to the fundamental bass, that the parts in the
                    harmony, or at least some of them, may proceed by semitones, as well in rising
                    as in descending, which is most frequently found in the minor mode, from the
                    alterations to which the sixth and seventh notes are subjected, by the nature of
                    the mode itself.</p>
                <p>The successive semitones used in the <hi rend="italic">chromatic</hi> species are
                    rarely of the same kind, but alternately major and minor, that is to say,
                    chromatic and diatonic; for the interval of a minor tone contains a minor or
                    chromatic semitone, and another which is major or diatonic, a measure which
                    temperament renders common to all tones; so that we cannot proceed by two minor
                    semitones which are conjunctive in succession without entering into the
                    enharmonic species, but two major semitones twice follow each other in the
                    chromatic order of the scale.</p>
                <p>The most certain procedure of the fundamental bass to generate the chromatic
                    elements in ascent, is alternately to descend by thirds and rise by fourths,
                    whilst all the chords carry the third major. If the fundamental bass proceeds
                    from dominant to dominant by perfect cadences avoided, it produces the chromatic
                    in descending. To produce both at once, the perfect and broken cadences are
                    interwoven, but at the same time avoided.</p>
                <p>At every note in the chromatic species, the tone must be changed; that succession
                    ought to be regulated and limited, for fear of deviation. For this purpose it
                    will be proper to recollect that the space most suitable to chromatic movements
                    is between the extremes of the dominant and the tonic in ascending, and between
                    the tonic and the dominant in descending. In the major mode one may also
                    chromatically descend from the dominant upon the second note. This transition is
                    very common in Italy; and, notwithstanding its beauty, begins to be a little too
                    common amongst us.</p>
                <p>The chromatic species is admirably fitted to express grief and affliction; and
                    these sounds boldly struck in ascending are powerfully effective. Their
                    influence is no less magical in descending; it is then that the ear seems to be
                    pierced with real groans. Attended with its proper harmony, this species appears
                    proper to express every thing; but its completion, by concealing the melody,
                    sacrifices a part of its expression; and for this disadvantage, arising from the
                    fulness of the harmony, it can only be compensated by the nature and genius of
                    the movement. We may add that, in proportion to the energy of this species, the
                    composer ought to use it with greater caution and parsimony, like those elegant
                    viands which, when profusely administered, immediately surfeit us with their
                    abundance, as much as they delight us when enjoyed with temperance and
                    moderation.</p>
