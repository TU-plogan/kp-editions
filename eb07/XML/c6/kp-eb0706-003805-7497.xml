                <p><label type="entry">CAMERON, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, a theologian
                    of great erudition, was born at Glasgow about the year 1579. His parents are
                    described as respectable, but their situation in life has not been specified. He
                    received his early education in his native city, and after completing the
                    ordinary course of study, he was employed in teaching the Greek language in the
                    university. In this employment he continued for twelve months, and having then
                    felt the usual desire of visiting foreign countries, he embarked for France, and
                    arrived at Bordeaux in the year 1600. Here he immediately recommended himself to
                    the favour and friendship of two protestant clergymen, by his agreeable manners,
                    his frank and ingenuous disposition, his very promising talents, and his
                    uncommon skill in the Greek and Latin languages. It is stated by Cappel that he
                    spoke Greek with as much fluency and elegance as any other person could speak
                    Latin; and that this rare proficiency excited the admiration of Casaubon, with
                    whom he soon afterwards became intimately acquainted. One of the pastors of the
                    church of Bordeaux was his own countryman Gilbert Primrose, D. D. who was
                    himself a man of learning, and the author of several works. Through the
                    recommendation of these clergymen, he was appointed a regent in the
                    newly-founded College of Bergerac, where it was his province to teach the
                    classical languages; but from this station he was speedily withdrawn by the Due
                    de Bouillon, who appointed him a professor of philosophy in the university of
                    Sedan. In this new department he acquired new reputation; and the duke next made
                    him an offer of the Greek chair, which however he thought it dc-cent<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193347510" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7510-0039"/> to decline, as he
                    could not accept it without depriving a friend of his office.</p>
                <p>In the personal history of Cameron we find some indications of a restless
                    disposition. Having continued two years at Sedan, he resigned his professorship,
                    and, after visiting Paris, returned to Bordeaux, where he again experienced a
                    very kind reception. In the beginning of the year 1604, he was nominated one of
                    the students of divinity who were maintained at the expense of the church, in
                    order to be prepared for its ministry when their services should be required,
                    and who for the period of four years were at liberty to prosecute their studies
                    in any protestant seminary. During this term of his exhibition, he acted as
                    tutor to the two sons of Calignon, chancellor of Navarre; and one of them is
                    mentioned as having made great progress in Greek literature. They spent one year
                    at Paris, and the next two at Geneva, from whence they removed to Heidelberg,
                    and remained there nearly twelve months. In this university, on the fourth of
                    April 1608, he gave a public proof of his ability by maintaining a series of
                    theses, “De triplici Dei cum Homine Foedere,” which have been printed among his
                    works. During the same year, he was recalled to Bordeaux, where the death of his
                    friend Renaud had left a vacancy in the protestant church; and he was now
                    appointed the colleague of Dr Primrose, with whom lie lived on the most cordial
                    terms. The high reputation which he acquired by his talents and learning, opened
                    to him a new scene of professional exertion: when Gomarus was removed to Leyden,
                    Camcron was appointed professor of divinity in the university of Saumur, the
                    principal seminary of the French protestants. He commenced his lectures on the
                    thirteenth of June 1618, but he was not installed till after an interval of two
                    months. He had experienced some opposition from the synod of Poitou, under the
                    pretext of his having adopted the opinion of Piscator as to the imputed
                    righteousness of Jesus Christ; but in the national synod held at Alez in the
                    year 1620, this charge was adjudged to be groundless. The principal of the
                    college was at this time Dr Duncan, another of his learned countrymen, who were
                    then so numerous in France.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Mark Duncan, Μ. D. principal of the college, was at the same time professor
                    of metaphysics and mathematics, and a practising physician. We learn from an
                    incidental notice of Scaliger that he was born in the west of Scotland. <hi

                    mentioned with high approbation by Burgersdicius in the preface to his <hi

                    “Institutionis Logicae libri quinque, in usum Academiae Salmuriensis tertium
                    editi, ut erant ab auctore recogniti.” Salmurii, 1643, 8vo. Prefixed is a Latin
                    poem by his son Mark Duncan, who was afterwards well known by the name of Μ. de
                    Cerizante. Tomasini has classed the father among the distinguished literary
                    characters of the age. <hi rend="italic">(Parnassus Engancus,</hi> p. 8.) Menage
                    mentions a French book on the Devils of Loudun, written by Duncan, a celebrated
                    physician of Saumur. (Menag&gt;ακα, tom. ii. p. 254.) The book to which he
                    alludes is apparently an anonymous and very rare tract, published under the
                    following title: “Discovrs de la Possession des Religieuses Vrsulines de Lodun.”
                    1634, 8vo. This tract, which consists of sixty-four pages, is written with
                    talent and dexterity. The conclusion at which the author arrives is such as
                    might be expected from a man of sense and discernment; but at that period, the
                    management of a negative argument in any similar case required no small degree
                    of caution. It appears from different passages of the work that Duncan, along
                    with other physicians, had attended the sisters who were supposed to be
                    possessed with devils. “La premiere foijs que le fus present aux exorcismes,
                    Monsieur de Poictiers et l’exorciste ayans adiuré le diable Grésil, qu’on disoit

                    celebrity was in no small degree increased by his academical lectures. Such
                    indeed was his reputation in the chair, that he was frequently honoured with the
                    attendance of Du Plessis Mornay; a man distinguished by his rank, his talents,
                    and his zeal in the cause of religion.</p>
                <p>During the same year, 1620, he was engaged in a formal disputation with Daniel
                    Tilenus, a native of Silesia, who had adopted the theological opinions of
                    Arminius.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Dr
                    M‘Crie’s Life of Melville, vol. ii. 1). 444.</p></note> He had expressed a wish
                    to discuss with Cameron the doctrines of grace and free-will; the time and place
                    of meeting were duly arranged, and, according to their agreement, the professor
                    repaired, in the neighbourhood of Orleans, to the country-house of Jerome
                    Groslot, a protestant gentleman of rank and learning, who had taken refuge in
                    Scotland after the massacre of St Bartholomew, and had there been distinguished
                    by the friendship of Buchanan. Tilenus having arrived five days after Cameron,
                    their conference commenced on the twenty-fourth, and concluded on the
                    twenty-eighth of April. An account of this <hi rend="italic">Arnica</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Collatio</hi> was printed at Leyden in 1621. The theological
                    faculty of that university was not satisfied with some of Cameron’s
                    explanations; and when Rivet, as dean of the faculty, communicated to him their
                    dissent, he defended his opinions in a brief answer. Their orthodoxy was
                    likewise defended by Bochart,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    divinity, but who afterwards rose to the highest eminence among the learned men
                    of the seventeenth century.</p>
                <p>In 1620, the progress of the civil troubles in France had nearly dispersed all
                    the students of the university of Saumur, and Cameron sought in England a place
                    of refuge for himself and his family. For a short time he read private lectures
                    on divinity in London; and in 1622 the king appointed him principal of the
                    university of Glasgow, in the room of Robert Boyd, a learned man who had been
                    removed from his office in consequence of his firm adherence to the cause of
                    presbytery.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Middleton’s

                    been more favourably inclined to episcopacy; nor is it improbable that this
                    circumstance may have had a strong tendency to diminish the cordiality of his
                    reception in his native city. The following passage in Baillie’s epistle
                    dedicatory to Robert Blair, reflects some light on his sentiments respecting the
                    controversies which then agitated the church. “1 confesse, after you, to my
                    exceeding great griefe and losse, were taken away from my head, and I came to be
                    set at the feet of other masters, especially Mr Cameron and Mr Struthers, my
                    very singular friends, and excellent divines as our nation has bred, I was
                    gained by them to some parts of conformity, which, if the Lords mercy had not
                    prevented, might have led me, as many my betters, to have run on in all the
                    errours and defections of these bad times: but thanks to his glorious name, who
                    held me by the hand, and stopped me at the beginning and first entry of that
                    unlucky course; who before I had put my hand to any subscription, or was engaged
                    in any promise, or had practised any the least ceremony in my flock, did call me

                    but he resigned his office in less than twelve months. Vernevil, a Frenchman,

                    given the subsequent <pb break="no" facs="nls:193347523"

                    there any other cause thereof then his great learning, the Iesuites in their
                    conferences being not able to withstand him. <hi rend="italic">Quoniam</hi><hi

                    where by the speciall care of that great fauourer of learning K. Iames (of
                    blessed memory) he was provided for in Scotland, his natiue country, but so
                    great was his harty lone to France, that by the effectual mediation of those
                    honourable am· bassadors then in France, he gat that envious sentence reversed,
                    which being done he immediately conveighed himselfe to Montauban, to bee
                    professour there, where he ended his dayes, to the great losse of Gods church,
                    and that vniversity.” Calderwood has however assigned another reason for his
                    quitting Glasgow: “Cameron was so misliked by the people, that he was forced to
                    quite his place soon afterwards.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>On returning to France, he fixed his residence at Saumur, where he was only
                    permitted to read private lectures; and after an interval of a year, he was
                    appointed professor of divinity in the university of Montauban, whither he
                    removed about the close of the year 1624. The country was still torn by civil
                    and religious dissensions; and as Cameron maintained the doctrine of passive
                    obedience, he excited the indignation of the more strenuous adherents of his own
                    party. Nor was the expression of this indignation confined to mere reproaches;
                    one individual treated him with such outrageous violence, that his life was
                    exposed to jeopardy. Indisposed in body, and afflicted in mind, he sought for
                    relief by a change of scene, and withdrew to the neighbouring town of Moissac:
                    but what he thus sought was not to be found; he speedily returned to Montauban,
                    and there in the space of a few days terminated life earthly career. He died in
                    the year 1625, tvhen he had only attained the age of about forty-six, and left a
                    widow and several children to bewail his loss. His first wife, Susan Bernard of
                    Tonneins on the Garonne, he had married in 1611, and by her had a son and four
                    daughters; but the son and eldest daughter died before their father. The son was
                    born at London on the 10th of May 1622, and died at Saumur in the month of July
                    1624. His mother had died of consumption in the preceding March; and after the
                    decent interval of a year, Cameron married at Montauban a second wife named
                    Susan Thomas, with whom he only lived a few months, and who had no child. The
                    maintenance of his surviving family was undertaken by the protestant churches of
                    France, in which he left an illustrious name.</p>
                <p>With respect to his person, he was of the middle size, somewhat inclining to a
                    spare habit, sound but not robust in his constitution. His hair was yellow, his
                    eyes were brilliant, and the expression of his countenance was lively and
                    pleasant. He appeared to be always immersed in deep meditation, and was somewhat
                    negligent in his apparel, and careless in his gait; but in his manners he was
                    very agreeable, and although he was not without a considerable share of
                    irritability, his anger was easily appeased, and he was very ready to
                    acknowledge his own faults. One writer, of doubtful authority, has represented
                    him as a person of consummate vanity, as a tedious preacher, and an endless
                    talker: but this account is evidently to be received with a considerable degree
                    of caution;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Bayle’s

                    distinguished pupil Cappel has exhibited his character in a most favourable
                    light. According to his impression, he was a man of eminent integrity and piety,
                    open, candid, and incapable of guile; faithful to his friends, and not spiteful
                    to his enemies; of so liberal a turn of mind, that his generosity made some

                <p>Cameron died before he had reached what may be considered as the prime of a
                    literary life, and too many of his years had been spent at a distance from that
                    tranquillity which is so essential to the pursuits of literature. He was fond of
                    study, but not of writing, and yet he wrote with great facility; he required to
                    be incited by his friends, or roused by his adversaries. The most considerable
                    of his works he did not himself commit to the press; they were published by the
                    friendly care of others, from such copies as had been taken by his pupils. He
                    composed many Latin poems which have not been preserved, and, in the opinion of
                    Cappel, they possessed uncommon merit. An ample collection of his theological
                    works has however been transmitted to our times, and he occupies a conspicuous
                    place among the learned writers of the seventeenth century.</p>
                <p>Sir Thomas Urquhart has extolled Cameron in his usual style. “There was another
                    Scotish man, named Cameron, who within these few yeers was so renowned for
                    learning overall the provinces of France, that, besides his being esteemed for
                    the faculties of the minde the ablest man in all that country, he was commonly
                    designed (because of his universal reading) by the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >the walking Liberary</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> by which he being no less
                    known then by his own name, he therefore took occasion to set forth an excellent
                    book in Latine, and that in folio, intituled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliotheca</hi><hi rend="italic">movens,</hi> which afterwards was translated
                    into the English language.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    with some others which appear to have belonged exclusively to the knight of
                    Cromarty’s library. In the opinion of Dempster, Cameron wanted nothing to make
                    him a great man but the profession of the catholic faith;<note anchored="true"

                    variousother authors, of higher authority in matters of theology. Milton, in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Tetrachordon,</hi> mentions Cameron as “a late writer, much
                    applauded, an ingenious writer, and in high esteem.” His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Myrothecium Evangelicum</hi> has received no slight commendation from a writer
                    who cannot be suspected of partiality to his sect. In this work, says Simon, he
                    discovers an intimate acquaintance with the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193347536"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-7536-0041"/>principles of criticism, and an exact knowledge of
                    the Greek and Hebrew languages. These qualifications have enabled him to exhibit
                    a learned elucidation of the literal and grammatical sense of many passages in
                    the sacred books which he professes to illustrate.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Soon after the death of Cameron, his friends published his “Praelectiones in
                    selectiora Loca Novi Testamenti.” Salmurii, 1626-8, 3 tom. 4to. The editor was
                    his learned pupil Louis Cappel, professor of Hebrew, and afterwards of divinity,
                    in the university of Saumur; to whom we are likewise indebted for an interesting
                    sketch of the author’s life and character. A collection of his theological works
                    appeared under the title of “Joannis Cameronis, Scoto-Britanni, Theologi eximii,
                    <hi rend="italic">ra ffωξομsva,</hi> sive Opera partim ab auctore ipso edita,

                    Joh. Cameronis</hi> is here reprinted. The writer of the preface to the volume
                    was Frederic Spanheim, at that time professor of divinity in the university of
                    Geneva.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Colomiĕs,
                    Bibliothèque Choisie, p. 73.</p></note> The author of the anonymous “Epistola
                    docti Viri ad Amicum,” refuted by Cameron, was Episcopius, a learned follower of
                    Arminius. Cappel had published another work of his preceptor, which is not
                    included in this collection. “Myrothecium Evangelicum, in quo aliquot Loca Novi
                    Testamenti explicantur: una cum Spicilegio Ludovici Cappelli de eodem argumento,
                    cumque 2 Diatribis in Matth, xv. 5 de Voto Jcphtae.” Genevae, 1632, 4to. Another
                    edition appeared under the subsequent title: “Myrothecium Evangelicum; hoc est,
                    Novi Testamenti Loca quamplurima ab eo, post aliorum labores, apte et commode

                    Salmurii, 1677, 4to.</p>
                <p>Two of Cameron’s French tracts were at an early period translated into English,
                    “An Examination of those plav-sible Appearances which seeme most to commend the
                    Romish Church, and to preiudice the Reformed: discovering them to be but meere
                    shifts, purposely invented to hinder an exact triall of doctrine by the
                    Scriptures. By Mr Iohn Cameron. Englished out of French.” Oxford, 1626, 4to. “A
                    Tract of the soveraigne Ivdge of Controversies in matters of Religion. By Iohn
                    Cameron, Minister of the Word of God, and Divinity Professour in the Academie of
                    Montauban. Translated into English by Iohn Vernevil, Μ. A.” Oxford, 1628, 4to.
                    The translator of the first tract subscribes his dedication with the initials W.
                    P. Vernevil’s dedication is dated “from the publique Library in Oxford.”
                    (x.)</p>
                <p>The name of this distinguished person furnished a denomination to a party of
                    Calvinists in France, who asserted that the will of a man is only determined by
                    the practical judgment of the mind; that the cause of men’s doing good or evil
                    proceeds from the knowledge which God infuses into them; and that God does not
                    move the will physically, but only morally, by virtue of its dependence on the
                    judgment of the mind. This peculiar doctrine of grace and free will was adopted
                    by Amyraut, Cappel, Bochart, Daillé, and others of the more learned among the
                    reformed ministers, who judged Calvin’s doctrines on these points too harsh. The
                    Cameronites are a sort of mitigated Calvinists, and approach to the opinion of
                    the Arminians. They are also called Universalists, as holding the universality
                    of Christ’s death; and sometimes Amyraldists. The rigid adherents to the synod
                    of Dort accused them of Pe-lagianism, and even of Manicheism; and the
                    controversy between the parties was carried on with a zeal and subtilty scarcely
                    conceivable; yet the whole question between them was only, whether the will of
                    man is determined by the immediate action of God upon it, or by the intervention
                    of a knowledge which God impresses on the mind. The synod of Dort had defined
                    that God not only illuminates the understanding, but gives motion to the will by
                    making an internal change therein; whereas Cameron only admitted the
                    illumination by which the mind is morally moved, and explained the sentiment of
                    the synod of Dort so as to make the two opinions consistent.</p>
