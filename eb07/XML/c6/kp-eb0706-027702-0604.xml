                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">CEMENT</label>. Any substance which is employed in uniting
                    together things of the same or of different kinds may be termed a cement. The
                    following are some of the principal of those used for various purposes.</p>
                <p>To unite pieces of Derbyshire spar, or other stone, take seven or eight parts of
                    resin and one of wax; then melt them together, and mix them with a small
                    quantity of plaster of Paris. The stone should be made sufficiently hot to melt
                    the cement, and the pieces should be pressed so closely together, that the
                    smallest quantity possible of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193350617"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-0617-0278"/>the cement may remain between them. It is a rule
                    of general application, that the thinner the stratum interposed, the firmer the
                    hold will be.</p>
                <p>Jewellers unite precious stones which have been accidentally broken, by means of
                    gum-mastic. The parts of the gem must be previously heated to a degree
                    sufficient to melt the cement. Cameos of white enamel or coloured glass are also
                    in this way joined to a real stone as a ground. Mastic is likewise employed by
                    jewellers in various ways as a cement. The jewellers in Turkey ornament trinkets
                    and weapons with gems, by uniting them together with the following composition
                    :—Isinglass soaked in water till it swells up and becomes soft is dissolved in
                    Frcnch brandy or rum, so as to form a strong glue; then two small bits of gum
                    galbanum, or gum ammoniacum, are dissolved in two ounces of this by trituration;
                    and five or six pieces of mastic about the size of peas, being dissolved in as
                    much alcohol as will render them fluid, are to be mixed with the compound by
                    means of a gentle heat. This cement must be kept in a phial closely stopped; and
                    when used it must be liquefied by immersing the phial in warm water. It will be
                    found to resist moisture.</p>
                <p>If clay and oxide of iron be mixed with oil, they will form a cement which
                    hardens under water. A cement insoluble in water is prepared from skimmed milk
                    cheese. The cheese is cut into slices, the rind being thrown away, and boiled
                    till it becomes a strong glue, which, however, does not dissolve in the water.
                    It is to be afterwards washed in cold, and then kneaded in warm water. This
                    process must be several times repeated. The glue is then to be put warm on a
                    levigating stone, and kneaded with quicklime. Though this cement may be used
                    cold, it is best to warm it ;,and it will unite marble, stone, or earthenware,
                    so as to render the joining scarcely discernible.</p>
                <p>Boiled linseed oil, litharge, red lead, and white lead, mixed together and laid
                    on both sides of a piece of flannel, or even linen or paper, and then put
                    between two pieces of metal before they are brought home or close together, will
                    make a durable joint, capable of resisting boiling water, or even a considerable
                    pressure of steam. The proportions of the ingredients are not material; but the
                    more the red lead predominates the sooner the cement will dry, and the more of
                    the white lead the contrary. This cement joins stones of any dimensions.</p>
                <p>The following is an excellent cement for iron, as it ultimately unites with it
                    into one mass :—Take two ounces of muriate of ammonia, one of flowers of
                    sulphur, and sixteen of cast-iron filings; mix them well in a mortar, and keep
                    the powder dry. When the cement is to be used, take one part of this mixture,
                    twenty parts of clear iron borings or filings, pound them together in a mortar,
                    mix them with water to a proper consistence, and apply the compound between the
                    joints.</p>
                <p>A cement often used by coppersmiths to lay over the rivets and edges of the
                    sheets of copper in large boilers, in order to serve as an additional security
                    to the joinings, and to secure eocks and the like from leaking, is made by
                    mixing powdered quicklime with ox’s blood. This cement dries soon, and
                    accordingly must be used fresh.</p>
                <p>Temporary cements are required in cutting, polishing, or grinding optical
                    glasses, and various articles of jewellery, as these must be fixed to blocks or
                    handles for the purpose. Four ounces of resin, a quarter of an ounce of wax, and
                    four ounces of whitning, made previously red hot, forms a good cement of this
                    kind, as the articles may be united or separated by heat, though they adhere
                    with great tenacity when cold.</p>
                <p>The following composition is recommended as a good cement for electrical
                    apparatus:—Five pounds of resin, one of bees’ wax, one of red ochre, and two
                    table-spoonfuls of plaster of Paris, all melted together. The following is an
                    analysis by Sir Humphry Davy, of Parker’s patent water cement.</p>

                <p>An excellent artificial water cement is obtained by heating for some hours to
                    redness a mixture of three parts clay and one part slaked lime, by measure. As a
                    cement for broken china, take quicklime and white of eggs, or old thick varnish;
                    pound and temper them well together, and the composition is ready for use.
                    Broken glass may be cemented in the following manner: Let glass which is more
                    easy of fusion than the parts to be united, be ground up like a pigment, and
                    interposed between the pieces; then let these be subjected to a heat which will
                    melt the cementing medium, and make the parts agglutinate without being
                    themselves fused. Any thing thus united will be found as strong as ever. (Ure’s
