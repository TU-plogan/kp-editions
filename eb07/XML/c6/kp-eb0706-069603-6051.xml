                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">CIMAROSA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Domenico</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated composer of music, was born at Naples in 1754. He first studied under
                    Aprile, but afterwards in the conservatory of Loretto, under Fenaroli, a pupil
                    of Durante, who communicated to him the principles of that great master. As
                    indications of his extraordinary assiduity here, several stories arc told of his
                    ingenious contrivances to study during the night, without awakening his
                    schoolfellows who slept in the same dormitory. Having completed his education,
                    and evinced decided proofs of musical genius, he was invited to Petersburg by
                    Catherine IL, which was considered as highly honourable to the young artist, the
                    empress being then ambitious to collect only the rarest talent, and had
                    previously received Trajetta and Paesiello, the two first composers of the age,
                    at her court. Before reaching Russia, Cimarosa brought out several of his operas
                    in the chief cities of Italy, through which he passed, and acquired a renown
                    that paved the way for a most flattering reception in Petersburg. He
                    subsequently visited several of the German courts, but seems to have delighted
                    most in pouring out the creations of his fancy to his own countrymen, who
                    received them with inconceivable enthusiasm.</p>
                <p>His operas are very numerous, and the greater part of them excellent. He did
                    ample justice to serious subjects; but the <hi rend="italic">opera buffd</hi>
                    was his <hi rend="italic">forte.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Matrimonio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Segre-to</hi> is accounted the <hi rend="italic">chef d</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">oeuvre,</hi> not only of
                    Cimarosa, but of the Italian school. It continues to be performed in all the
                    cities of Europe where operas arc established, and even to this day charms the
                    Neapolitans, the most insatiable thirst-crs for musical novelty. His best <hi
                    rend="italic">opera</hi><hi rend="italic">seria,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >C)raz; e Curiazj,</hi> is written with elegance and truth of expression. The
                    oratorio of the <hi rend="italic">Sacrifice of Abraham</hi> is no less admirable
                    for its sacred and impressive character.</p>
                <p>The style of Cimarosa is characterized by the most striking originality. His
                    melodies are copious and flowing; his harmonics abound with attractive and
                    pleasing modulations, He has completely hit the <hi rend="italic">beau
                    ideal</hi> of the comic opera. So intimately are sense and sound in accordance,
                    that the imagination is at once fascinated, amused, and delighted. He is full of
                    vigour, tenderness, and graceful vivacity, always evincing the most correct and
                    refined taste and judgment. He has scattered the flowers of his fancy so
                    lavishly, that one of his <hi rend="italic">finales</hi> alone would furnish
                    matter for a whole opera.</p>
                <p>Cimarosa contributed in no small degree to preserve, and even add to, the graces
                    of that pure and chaste species of composition which is so peculiar to the
                    Italians, and distinguishes their music from that of every other nation. From
                    the principles of taste on which this style is based, it will probably have a
                    more lasting endurance than the vapid and frittered music of the Rossinian
                    school, which, dwindling into inordinate insipidity, seems destined to enjoy
                    only an ephemeral popularity. The revival of the sterling compositions of the
                    older masters will be an cra in musical history, from which the true lovers of
                    art may expect the best possible results.</p>
                <p>Independently of his professional worth, Cimarosa was much esteemed for his
                    private virtues. Although the rival of Paesiello and Guglielmi, he was always a
                    favourite with their warmest partizans. He was kindly and sociable in his
                    disposition, and composed his finest subjects in the midst of his friends. It
                    was after spending a fortnight in doing nothing but walking about the environs
                    of Prague, that the air <hi rend="italic">Pria</hi><hi rend="italic">che</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">spunti in</hi><hi rend="italic">ciel</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >l’Aurora</hi> suddenly entered his mind, when he was thinking nothing about it.
                    Like most men of genius, he was remarkably modest, and replied to a painter who
                    flatteringly told him he was superior to Mozart, “I, sir! What would you say to
                    the man who assured you that you were superior to Rafaellc?” A division of
                    opinion existed for a long time as to which was the greater composer, Mozart or
                    Cimarosa. Napoleon asked the musician Gretry, who answered,—“Sire, Cimarosa
                    places the statue on the stage, and the pedestal in the orchestra; whereas
                    Mozart puts the statue in the orchestra, and the pedestal on the stage.” The
                    statue being song, and the pedestal accompaniment, explains the allegorical
                    comparison; but if Gretry meant to disparage the vocal melodies of Mozart, he
                    went too far, the world having unqualifiedly assigned to them the palm of
                    unrivalled beauty.</p>
                <p>Cimarosa gave offence to the Neapolitan court by his partiality to the French
                    government, and narrowly escaped an ignominious death. He was permitted,
                    however, to die peaceably at Venice in 1801, deplored by all lovers of the
                    musical art, which lost one of its highest ornaments in the full vigour of life
                    and intellect. <hi rend="italic">(f)iet.</hi><hi rend="italic">Historique des
