                    bishop of Chiapa, in Mexico was descended of a noble Spanish family, and born at
                    Seville in 1474. At the age of nineteen he went to St Domingo with his father,
                    Antonio de Las Casas, who had accompanied Christopher Columbus in his first
                    voyage to the New World. On his return to Spain he became an ecclesiastic, and
                    afterwards entered the order of Dominicans with the view of being employed as a
                    missionary for the conversion of the Indians. In 1533 we find him residing in
                    the monastery of St Dominic, in the island of St Domingo, where lie passed his
                    time in preaching the gospel to the Indians and negroes, and in inculcating
                    humanity on their oppressors. The most faithful historian of this epoch, Oviedo
                    Valdes, a Spanish officer, who had passed the greater part of his life in the
                    New World, informs us that ever since the year 1519 the Indians had been in a
                    state of insurrection, in consequence of an outrage which had been offered by a
                    Spanish officer to the wife of the cacique, Don Henry, who had embraced
                    Christianity. Having in vain demanded justice, this cacique retired with his
                    people to the mountains of Beoruko, whence, during nearly fourteen years, he
                    made war upon the Spaniards. Peace was, however, re-established in 1533,
                    principally through the influence of Las Casas. Oviedo, conquistador though he
                    was, and as such almost the natural enemy of a man like <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193349733" xml:id="kp-eb0706-9733-0210"/>Las Casas, concludes the
                    twelfth chapter of his work with a tribute to the virtues and zeal of the
                    missionary, who scrupled not to betake himself to the forests and the mountains
                    in order to reconcile the offended cacique and the Indians with the Spaniards,
                    and who mainly contributed to bring about the peace which, unhappily, proved of
                    but short duration, and was followed by the extermination of nearly the whole of
                    the natives.</p>
                <p>Before entering the order of St Dominic, Las Casas had presented to Charles V.
                    several memoirs in favour of the Indians. But the efforts which he made to
                    alleviate their sufferings proving fruitless, he proposed to found a colony, on
                    principles very different from those which were then followed by his countrymen;
                    and with this view he prevailed on the emperor to send him to Cumana in the
                    capacity of governor. On his arrival at Porto Ricco in 1519, with three hundred
                    Castilian emigrants, he immediately set out for Cumana, in order to establish
                    his colonists in that territory; and being aware that his countrymen were
                    regarded with horror by the natives, he found it necessary to distinguish his
                    settlers by a particular dress, ornamented with a white cross, in order that
                    they might not be confounded with the other Spaniards. To conquer the affection
                    of the natives, by acting in conformity to the benevolent spirit of the gospel,
                    and by respecting their liberty and their property, was the plan adopted by Las
                    Casas and the men who accompanied him. Unfortunately, some time before his
                    arrival, Spanish pirates, who took the name of Conquistadores, having made
                    several descents on the coasts of Trinidad, Venezuela, and Cumana, and seized
                    and carried away Indians while in the act of trading with and even entertaining
                    them, the natives, exasperated at this inhuman perfidy, revenged themselves by
                    putting to death every Spaniard who fell into their hands. When Las Casas
                    arrived at Cumana with his people, Gonzalo Ocampo, who had been dispatched
                    thither by the governor of St Domingo in quality of commandant, refused to
                    recognise his authority; upon which Las Casas, having lodged his settlers in a
                    fort surrounded with pallisades, repaired to St Domingo, in order to make known
                    to the governor-general of the Indies the rebellion of Ocampo. Meanwhile the
                    latter, by his exactions and his cruelties, goaded the Indians into
                    insurrection; and as they could not believe that there were individuals of
                    respectability and humanity among the Spaniards, they fell indiscriminately on
                    the colonists of Las Casas and the satelites of Ocampo, and massacred all who
                    were unable to effect their escape to the small island of Cubagua.</p>
                <p>But Las Casas was not discouraged nor disheartened. In fact, we find him
                    continually going from America to Spain, and returning from Spain to America, in
                    order to plead the cause of the oppressed Indians. So much zeal and virtue,
                    however, exasperated against him the oppressors of this unhappy race; and
                    another ecclesiastic, Sepulveda, canon of Salamanca, and historiographer to
                    Charles V., composed a work, entitled “Democrates Secundus, seu de justis belli
                    causis: an liceat bello Indos prosequi, auferendo ab eis dominia possessionesque
                    et bona temporalia, et occidendo eos si resistentiam opposuerint, ut sic
                    spoliati et subjecti, facilius per praedicatores suadeatur iis fides.” Charles
                    V. prohibited the publication of this memoir; but it was nevertheless printed at
                    Rome, and circulated throughout Spain by the monks, in contempt of the sovereign
                    authority. Las Casas, now bishop of Chiapa, answered this abominable libel, in a
                    work which bears the impress of his character, and is entitled “Brevissima
                    Relacion de la Destruccion de las Indias.” But Sepulveda did not consider
                    himself as confuted. He demanded a public conference with Las Casas, and
                    continued to maintain, in his discourses and his writings, that, according to
                    political law, Charles V. might compel the Indians to recognise him as their
                    sovereign; and that, according to the laws of the church, it was a duty to
                    exterminate every one who refused to embrace the Christian religion. Charles V.
                    appointed his confessor, DominicoSoto, to examine and report on the merits of
                    this dispute; but being overwhelmed with more urgent affairs, the emperor never
                    found time to pronounce any decision. Meanwhile the Indians were hunted down and
                    exterminated, or crowded into the mines; and it is even alleged that fifteen
                    millions of them perished in less than ten years.</p>
                <p>The devotion of Las Casas to the cause of the poor oppressed Indians gave rise,
                    according to Herrera, to a very remarkable accusation; namely, that it was he
                    who recommended to the Spaniards the trade in negroes, in order to substitute
                    the blacks for the Indians in the labours of the colonies. But Μ. Gregoire, in a
                    memoir entitled <hi rend="italic">Apologie</hi><hi rend="italic">de E. de Las
                    Casas,</hi> inserted in the fourth volume of the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires de
                    la Classe</hi><hi rend="italic">des Seiences Morales</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                    Politiques</hi><hi rend="italic">de l’</hi><hi rend="italic">Institut,</hi> has
                    refuted this calumnious imputation. On referring to the Spanish and Portuguese
                    writers of that period, as well as to the works of English authors who have
                    written on commerce, it will in fact be found, first, that all the historians,
                    as Raynal, Pauw, and even Robertson, who have accused the bishop of Chiapa of
                    this barbarous inconsistency, have followed either Herrera, an elegant but
                    partial historian, or Charlevoix, who, when he speaks of the Spanish colonies,
                    merely translates Herrera; and, secondly, that the Spaniards were in the habit
                    of purchasing negro slaves from the Portuguese long before the discovery of the
                    New World, and that, from the commencement of their establishment in St Domingo,
                    negroes were regularly imported into that island. Nor is this the only evidence
                    which maybe adduced’to disprove the calumny in question. There are still extant
                    three manuscript volumes in folio, from the pen of Las Casas, containing his
                    memoirs, official and familiar letters, and political and theological works;
                    which, so far from countenancing the charge brought against his memory, not only
                    breathe the most ardent spirit of philanthropy, but, in many passages, show that
                    the admirable author deeply compassionated the wrongs and sufferings of the
                    injured Africans.</p>
                <p>Las Casas was distinguished both as a theologian and an historian. He has been
                    accused of exaggeration in the recital which he has given of the crimes and
                    murders committed by the Spaniards in the New World. But he is borne out by
                    Clavigero, who reluctantly admits the iniquities and cruelties of Cortes,
                    Alvaredo, and the other Spanish chiefs, and represents Mexico Elascala, and the
                    other neighbouring states, as exceedingly populous at the time of the conquest;
                    a point, we may add, on which Cortes himself is perfectly at one with the good
                    bishop. After having passed half a century in the New World, and twelve times
                    crossed the ocean to plead in Spain the cause of the Indians, Las Casas
                    renounced his bishopric, and returned, in 1554, to his native country, where,
                    having immortalized himself by his beneficence, and the practice of all the
                    virtues, he died at Madrid in 1566. The works of Las Casas are, 1. <hi
