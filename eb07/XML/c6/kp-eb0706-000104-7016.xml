                <p><label type="entry">CALEDONIA</label>, the ancient name of Scotland. From the
                    testimonies of Tacitus, Dio, and Solinus, we find that the ancient Caledonia
                    comprehended all that country situated to the north of the rivers Forth and
                    Clyde. In proportion as the Silures or Cimbri advanced northwards, the
                    Caledonians, circumscribed within narrower limits, were forced to pass over into
                    the islands which fringe the western coasts of Scotland. It is about this
                    period, probably, that we ought to fix the first great migration of the British
                    Gael into Ireland; that kingdom being much nearer to the promontory of Galloway
                    and Cantyre than many of the Scottish isles are to the continent of North
                    Britain.</p>
                <p>To the country which the Caledonians possessed they gave the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Gael-doch,</hi> which is the only appellation the Scots, who speak
                    the Gaelic language, know for their own division of Britain. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gael-doch</hi> is a compound formed from <hi rend="italic">Gael,</hi> the first
                    colony of the ancient Gauls who transmigrated into Britain, and <hi
                    rend="italic">doch,</hi> a district or division of a country. The Romans, by
                    transposing the letter <hi rend="italic">l</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Gael,</hi>
                    and by softening into a Latin termination the <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> of <hi
                    rend="italic">doch,</hi> formed, it is supposed, the well-known name of
                    Caledonia.</p>
                <p>At the period when Agricoa invaded North Britain, A. D. 81, that portion of the
                    island appears to have been possessed by twenty-one tribes of aboriginal
                    inhabitants having little or no political connection with one another, although
                    evidently identical in origin, in language, in customs, and in manners. The
                    names and topographical positions of these Caledonian tribes or clans have been
                    preserved and pretty accurately ascertained. They were, 1. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ottadini,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ottadeni,</hi> who occupied the south-east
                    boundary of North Britain, extending along the whole line of coast from the
                    southern Tyne to the Frith of Forth, and including the half of Northumberland,
                    the eastern part of Roxburghshire, and the whole of Berwickshire and of East
                    Lothian; 2. The <hi rend="italic">Gadeni,</hi> who inhabited the interior of the
                    country, to the west of the <hi rend="italic">Ottadini,</hi> including the
                    western part of Northumberland, a small part of Cumberland to the north of the
                    Irthing, the western part of Roxburghshire, the whole of Selkirkshire,
                    Tweeddale, a considerable part of Mid-Lothian, and nearly all West-Lothian;
                    their possessions extending from the Tyne on the south to the Frith of Forth on
                    the north; 3. The <hi rend="italic">Selgovae,</hi> who inhabited Annandale,
                    Nithsdale, and Eskdale in Dumfriesshire, and the eastern part of Galloway as far
                    as the river Deva or Dee, which was their western boundary; 4. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Novantae,</hi> who possessed the middle and western parts of
                    Galloway, from the Dee on the east to the Irish Sea on the west; on the south
                    they were bounded by the Solway Frith and the Irish Sea, and on the north by the
                    chain of hills which separates Galloway from Carrick; 5. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Damnii,</hi> the most important of the southern tribes, who inhabited the whole
                    extent of country from the ridge of hills which separates Galloway frem Ayrshire
                    on the south, to the river Erne on the north, and possessed all Strathclyde, the
                    shires of Ayr, Renfrew, and Stirling, and a small part of those of Dumbarton and
                    Perth; 6. The <hi rend="italic">Horestii,</hi> who inhabited the country between
                    <hi rend="italic">Eodotria</hi> or Forth on the south, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tavus</hi> or Tay on the north, comprehending the shires of Clackmannan,
                    Kinross, and Fife, with the eastern part of Strathern, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193347029" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7029-0002"/> the country westward of the
                    Tay as far as the river Brann; 7. The <hi rend="italic">Venricoes,</hi> who
                    possessed the territory between the Tay on the south and the Carron on the
                    north, comprehending Gowrie, Strathmore, Stormont, and Strathardle in
                    Perthshire, together with the whole of Angus, and the larger part of
                    Kineardineshire; 8. The <hi rend="italic">Taixali,</hi> who inhabited the
                    northern part of the Mearns, and the whole of Aberdeenshire as far as the
                    Doveran; 9. The <hi rend="italic">Vacomagi,</hi> who inhabited the country on
                    the south side of the Moray Frith, from the Doveran on the east to the Ness on
                    the west, comprehending the shires of Banff, Elgin, Nairn, the eastern part of
                    Inverness, and Braemar in Aberdeenshire; 10. The <hi rend="italic">Albani,</hi>
                    afterwards called <hi rend="italic">Damnii-Albani,</hi> who possessed the
                    interior districts between the lower ridge of the Grampians, which skirts the
                    southern side of the loch and river Tay on the south, and the chain of mountains
                    which forms the southern limit of Inverness-shire on the north; 11. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Attacoti,</hi> who inhabited the whole of the country from
                    Lochfyne on the west to the eastward of the river Leven and Loehlomond,
                    comprehending the whole of Cowal in Argyleshire and the greater part of
                    Dumbartonshire; 12. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Caledonii</hi> proper,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This name, according to
                    Chalmers, is merely the latinized form of <hi rend="italic">Celyddonl,</hi> from
                    <hi rend="italic">Celyddon,</hi> the descriptive appellation given to the
                    country by the British colonists, and signifying literally <hi rend="italic">the
                    Coverts.</hi></p></note> who inhabited the whole of the interior of the country
                    from the ridge of mountains which separates Inverness and Perth on the south, to
                    the range of hills which forms the forest of Balnagowan in Ross on the north,
                    comprehending all the middle parts of Inverness and Ross; 13. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Cantoe,</hi> who possessed the east of Ross from the Moray Frith

                    rend="italic">Cattini,</hi> a small tribe, who inhabited the north-western

                    having the river Naver, the <hi rend="italic">Navarijluvius</hi> of Ptolemy, for
                    their western boundary; 17. The <hi rend="italic">Mertae,</hi> who occupied the

                    bay on the south-west; 19. The <hi rend="italic">Creones,</hi> who inhabited the
                    western coast of Ross, from the <hi rend="italic">Volsas</hi> bay on the north
                    to Loehduich on the south; 20. The <hi rend="italic">Cerones,</hi> who inhabited
                    the whole western coast of Inverness, and the districts of Ard-namurchan,
                    Morvern, Sunart,and Ardgower in Argyleshire, having Loehduich on the north, and
                    the Linne-loch on the south; and, 21. The <hi rend="italic">Εpidii,</hi> who
                    inhabited the south-west of Argyleshire, from Linne-loch on the north, to the
                    Frith of Clyde and the Irish Sea on the south, including Cantyre, and were
                    bounded on the east by the country of the <hi rend="italic">Albani,</hi> and by
                    Loehfyne. Such, according to the best authorities, were the names and
                    geographical positions of the twenty-one tribes which, at the time of the Roman
                    invasion, occupied the whole of North Britain.</p>
                <p>When the tribes of North Britain were attacked by the Romans under Agricoa (see
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Britain,</hi> chap. i.), they entered into
                    associations, in order that, by uniting their strength, they might be more able
                    to repel the common enemy. But the particular name of the tribe which either its
                    superior power or military reputation placed at the head of the association, was
                    the general name given by the Romans to all the confederates. Hence it is that
                    the <hi rend="italic">Moeatoe,</hi> who inhabited the districts of Scotland
                    lying southward of the frith, and the <hi rend="italic">Caledonians,</hi> who
                    inhabited the west and north-west parts, engrossed the glory which belonged in
                    common, though in an inferior degree, to the other tribes settled of old in
                    North Britain.</p>
                <p>The origin of the appellations <hi rend="italic">Scoti</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Picti,</hi> introduced by the later Roman authors, has occasioned much
                    controversy among antiquaries in modern times. It seems tolerably certain,
                    however, that the Scots and Piets were one and the same people; or rather, that
                    the term <hi rend="italic">Picti</hi> or Picts was the generic, and that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Scoti,</hi> or Scots, only a specific appellation. Eumenius the
                    orator, who first mentions the Picts, alludes to the <hi rend="italic">Caledones
                    aliique Picti</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> an expression which implies that the
                    <hi rend="italic">Caledones</hi> and <hi rend="italic">other</hi> tribes were
                    considered as Picts. Again, with reference to the question whether the Scots
                    were aboriginal Britons, or merely emigrants from Ireland, it has been shown by
                    arguments which appear to Be invincible, that they came originally from Ireland;
                    but,on the other hand, it seems equally certain, that the Scots of Ireland, or
                    the <hi rend="italic">Scoticae</hi><hi rend="italic">gentes</hi> of Porphyry, a
                    branch of the great Celtic family, passed over, at a very remote period, from
                    the shores of Britain into Ireland, and before the beginning of the fifth
                    century had given their name to the whole of that country. Their name, however,
                    does not occur in the Roman annals till <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 360; but
                    all the authors of the fourth century agree that Ireland was the proper country
                    of the Scots, and that they invaded the Roman territories in North Britain about
                    the period above mentioned. They are described as an erratic or wandering race,
                    who earned on a predatory system of warfare, and also as a transmarine people,
                    who came from Ireland, their native island. Under the denomination of Picts were
                    included the Caledonians and Scots, and probably also the Attacots, a warlike
                    clan, settled on the shores of Dumbarton and Cowal. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Scotland.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Caledonia,</hi> the name of a settlement made by the Scots
                    on the western side of the Gulf of Darien in 1698, out of which they were
