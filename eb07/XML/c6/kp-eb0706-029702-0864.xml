                <p><label type="entry">CESAROTTI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Melchior</hi></label>, an
                    Italian poet, was born at Padua in the year 1730, of a family of considerable
                    rank but small fortune. He was educated at the academy of Padua, where he early
                    showed a strong inclination for literary pursuits, and made such progress in
                    study that he was raised to the chair of rhetoric in the academy where he had
                    been brought up,' at a period of life when others were yet attending the
                    lectures* Having been appointed to this charge, he devoted himself with the
                    utmost zeal to the duties of his situation. He introduced several useful reforms
                    into the system of education which was then practised, and endeavoured by
                    incessant study to render his instructions as useful as possible to the youth
                    committed to his care. The first fruits of his studies were Italian translations
                    of the Prometheus of Aeschylus, and three tragedies of Voltaire, the merit of
                    which, and the reputation he had acquired for learning and persevering
                    application, successively procured him a distinguished employment at Venice, and
                    the professorship of Greek and Hebrew in the university of Padua. Cesarotti had
                    held this situation for nearly thirty years at the date of the first French
                    invasion of Italy. This poct did not, like Alfieri, scorn the pecuniary favours
                    of the republican government, nor shun the acquaintance of its chiefs. He
                    published several political tracts and essays by their order; and when the
                    general of the invading army assumed the title of King of Italy, he was rewarded
                    with two pensions of considerable amount, and distinguished by various honours.
                    He continued to reside partly at Padua, and partly at his country house of
                    Selvaggiano, chiefly occupied with the composition of laudatory poems in return
                    for the favours he had received, and with the superintendence of a complete
                    edition of his works, when he was suddenly arrested by the hand of death on the
                    3d of November 1808.</p>
                <p>Though held by Sismondi to be the first in point of celebrity of the modern
                    Italian poets, Cesarotti is better known as a translator than as an original
                    author. The Italians have always been distinguished for the elegance and spirit
                    of their translations from the classics; the Lucretius of Marchetti, the Aeneid
                    of Annibal Caro, and Anguillara’s free version of the Metamorphoses of Ovid,
                    have deservedly exalted their reputation to the utmost height in this department
                    of literature. Anguillara’s translation of Homer, however, had been less popular
                    and successful than his Metamorphoses, and there still remained room in Italy
                    for a translation of the prince of poets. The work of Cesa-rotti, however, is
                    far from being literal; he has modernized and accommodated the Iliad to the
                    prevailing taste of the age; he has abridged it in some places, and added to it
                    in others, according to his taste or fancy; and he has often been reproached
                    with having given to the Greek bard the style and language of his favourite
                    Ossian. In the late edition of the works of Cesarotti, the poetical version is
                    followed by a literal prose one, accompanied with critical notes and
                    dissertations, partly translated from Pope and Dacier.</p>
                <p>Cesarotti acquired more fame by his version of Ossian than by that of Homer; and
                    certainly no translation had ever more appearance of originality and
                    inspiration. He has completely preserved the spirit of the supposed bard of
                    Morven—his gigantic and gloomy grandeur; and, at the same time, has given us
                    that harmony of versification which we desiderate in the work of Macpherson. The
                    Italian Ossian was first published at Padua in 1763, 2 vols. 8vo, at the expense
                    of an English traveller, with whom Cesarotti had contracted a friendship. This
                    edition was necessarily incomplete, as the translation of Macpherson at that
                    time was so also; but the whole poems were printed at the same place about ten
                    years afterwards, in 4 vols. small 8vo. The Poems of Ossian also occupy four
                    volumes in the recent complete edition of the works of Cesarotti, where they are
                    accompanied by an examination of the question so much agitated in this country
                    with regard to the authenticity of these celebrated productions. Their
                    appearance in this new form attracted much attention in Italy, and raised up
                    many imitators of the Ossianic style, so different from the warm and glowing
                    imagery of the earlier Italian poets.</p>
                <p>His country was also indebted to Cesarotti for a number of valuable prose works.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Course of Greek Literature</hi> was his chief undertaking;
                    but the plan on which he had commenced was too vast to be completed. His essays
                    on the <hi rend="italic">Sources of the Pleasure derived from Tragedy,</hi> and
                    on the <hi rend="italic">Origin and Progress of the Poetic Art,</hi> are
                    distinguished by elegant and ingenious criticism; while his treatises <hi
                    rend="italic">Sulla Filosofia</hi><hi rend="italic">delle</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Lingue, et</hi><hi rend="italic">Sulla Filosojia dc Gusto</hi> (the last of
                    which is principally intended as an apology for the peculiarities of his own
                    style), show considerable acuteness and strength of understanding. In 1797 an
                    Academy of Sciences and Belles Lettres had been established at Padua, of which
                    Cesarotti was nominated perpetual secretary. It was part of the duties of this
                    situation to read, at the stated meetings of the academy, the various essays
                    which had been prepared by its members. Frequently, however, these were of such
                    extent that the secretary found it expedient merely to give, in his own
                    language, a general account of the object of the author, and the result of his
                    investigations. These readings produced his reports, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pelazioni Academiche,</hi> each of which reports is divided into three parts;
                    the first containing the essays on Experimental Philosophy, the second on
                    Mathematics, and the third on Belles Lettres. The whole, however, may be
                    regarded as a literary composition, since the departments of mathematics and
                    philosophy exhibit only general views of the subject of inquiry. Almost all the
                    prose works of Cesarotti are distinguished by extensive erudition and a
                    philosophical spirit, while his style is for the most part lively and forcible.
                    But the Italian prose of the eighteenth century was very different from that
                    written by Giovanni Della Casa, Machiavel, and their contemporaries in the
                    sixteenth; and those critics who have deplored the recent innovations on the
                    ancient purity of the Tuscan tongue, chiefly attribute to Cesarotti the
                    introduction of those Gallicisms and new modes of expression which have so
                    greatly corrupted the language of the golden age of Leo.</p>
                <p>All the works of Cesarotti above mentioned, including several volumes of
                    correspondence, have been published in a complete edition, which was commenced
                    at Padua in the year 1800, under the author’s own direction. It has been
                    continued since his death by Joseph Barbieri, who was his successor in the chair
                    of Greek and Hebrew at Padua, and who has also published Memoirs of the Life and
                    Writings of his deceased friend, printed at Padua, 1810, 8vo.</p>
                <p>It has been the fate of most literary men to be ranked <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193350877" xml:id="kp-eb0706-0877-0298"/>either higher or lower by
                    their own age than by posterity. Cesarotti will probably belong to the former
                    class, who perhaps, after all, enjoy the pleasanter sort of reputation. But,
                    though the praise of great and original genius may in future times be denied
                    him, every age will admit his learning and talents, and the meritorious
                    assiduity of his literary researches. <hi rend="smallcaps">(q.)</hi></p>
