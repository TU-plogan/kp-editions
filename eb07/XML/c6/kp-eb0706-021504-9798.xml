                <p><label type="entry">CASPIAN SEA</label>, a great inland sea of Asia, bounded on
                    the north by the Russian government of Astracan; on the east by the great sandy
                    deserts of Tartary; on the south by the Persian province of Mazanderan; and on
                    the west by the Persian province of Ghilan, the ridges of Caucasus, the
                    principalities of Baku, Derbend, and Circassia, together with part of the
                    government of Astracan. According to the most accurate surveys that have been
                    made by Russian navigators, under the orders of Peter I., this sea extends in
                    length from north to south 646 miles, in breadth 265 miles in the northern part,
                    and 235 in the southern; and the total circuit of the coast, including gulfs and
                    bays, is 2350 miles. The shore is flat all around, and there is no depth of
                    water; but beyond this the depth is very great; and Hanway mentions that he
                    could not find the bottom with <hi rend="italic">a</hi> line of 480 fathoms. It
                    is of very dangerous navigation on account of its frequent shallows along the
                    shore, and many disasters occur to mariners. Fierce tempests occasionally burst
                    forth from the high mountains which inclose it on different sides. There are
                    certain winds that domineer over it with such absolute sway, that vessels are
                    often deprived of every resource; and in the whole extent of it there is not a
                    port that can truly be called safe. The north, north-east, and east winds, blow
                    most frequently, and occasion the most violent tempests. Along the eastern shore
                    the east winds prevail; for which reason vessels bound from Persia to Astracan
                    always direct their course along this shore.</p>
                <p>The waters of the Caspian are as salt as those of the ocean, and very impure; the
                    vast number of rivers that run into it, and the nature of its bottom, affecting
                    it greatly. It is true, that in general the waters are salt; but though the
                    whole western shore extends from the 46th to the 35th degree of north latitude,
                    and though one might conclude from analogy that these waters would contain a
                    great deal of salt, yet experiments prove the contrary; and it is certain that
                    the saltness of this sea is diminished by the north, north-east, and north-west
                    winds, although we may with equal reason conclude that it owes its saltness to
                    the mines of salt which lie along its two banks, and which are either already
                    known or will be known to posterity. The depth of these waters also diminishes
                    gradually as you approach the shores, and their saltness in the same way grows
                    less in proportion to their proximity to the land; the north winds not
                    unfrequently causing the rivers to discharge into it vast quantities of troubled
                    water impregnated with clay. These variations which the sea is exposed to are
                    more or less considerable, according to the nature of the winds; and they affect
                    the colour of the river waters to a certain distance from the shore, till these
                    mix with that of the sea, which then resumes the ascendency, and the fine green
                    colour appears which is natural to the ocean, and to all those bodies of water
                    that communicate with it.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193349811" xml:id="kp-eb0706-9811-0216"/>
                <p>It is well known that, besides its salt taste, all sea-water has a sensible
                    bitterness, which must be attributed not only to the salt itself, but to the
                    mixture of different substances that unite with it, particularly to different
                    sorts of alum, and is the ordinary effect of different combinations of acids.
                    Besides this, the waters of the Caspian have another taste, bitter too, but
                    quite diśtinct, which affects the tongue with an impression similar to that made
                    by the bile of animals; a property which ⅛ peculiar to this sea, though not
                    equally sensible at all seasons. When the north and northwest winds have raged
                    for a considerable time, this bitter taste is sensibly felt; but when the wind
                    has been south, very imperfectly. We shall endeavour to account for this
                    phenomenon.</p>
                <p>The Caspian is bounded on its western side by the mountains of Caucasus, which
                    extend from Derbend to the Black Sea. These mountains make a curve near
                    Astracan, and directing their course towards the eastern shore of the Caspian,
                    lose themselves near the mouth of the Yaik, where they become secondary
                    mountains, being disposed in strata. As Caucasus is an inexhaustible magazine of
                    combustible substances, it consequently lodges an astonishing quantity of metals
                    in its bowels. Accordingly, along the foot of this immense chain of mountains,
                    we sometimes meet with warm springs, sometimes springs of naphtha of different
                    quality; sometimes we find native sulphur, mines of vitriol, or lakes heated by
                    internal fires. Now the foot of Mount Caucasus forming the immediate western
                    shore of the Caspian Sea, it is very easy to imagine that a great quantity of
                    the constituent parts of the former must be communicated to the latter; but it
                    is chiefly to the naphtha, which abounds so much in the countries which surround
                    this sea, that we must attribute the true cause of the bitterness peculiar to
                    its waters; for it is certain that this bitumen flows from the mountains,
                    sometimes in all its purity, and sometimes mixed with other substances which it
                    acquires in its passage through subterranean channels, from the most interior
                    parts of these mountains to the sea, where it falls to the bottom by its
                    specific gravity. It is certain, too, that the north and north-west winds detach
                    the greatest quantities of this naphtha, whence it is evident that the bitter
                    taste must be most sensible when these winds prevail. We may also comprehend why
                    this taste is not so strong at the surface or in the neighbourhood of the shore,
                    the waters there being less impregnated with salt, and the naphtha, which is
                    united with the water by the salt, being then either carried to a distance by
                    the winds, or precipitated to the bottom. But it is not a bitter taste alone
                    that the naphtha communicates to the waters of the Caspian. These waters were
                    analysed by M. Gmelin, and found to contain, besides the common sea salt, a
                    considerable proportion of Glauber salt, intimately united with the former, and
                    which is evidently a production of the naphtha.</p>
                <p>The Caspian Sea receives the contents of numerous rivers, which give a tinge to
                    its waters; and it is only at a distance from their mouths that it presents the
                    deep azure hue of the ocean. It is probably also owing to the quantity of
                    extraneous substances carried down by these rivers that there are so many
                    dangerous shoals and so few good harbours within its compass; and, considering
                    the number and size of its numerous rivers, it is not easy to conceive how so
                    vast a quantity of water can be carried off by evaporation. On the north is the
                    Yaik, 100 fathoms wide and eighteen feet deep at the mouth; next the Yemba, or
                    Jemba, at the distance of sixty-one miles; the great Oxus flows in at the west
                    side, seventy miles north of the Gulf of Karabogaskoi. Ninety-three miles south
                    of this gulf the river Doria flows into the Caspian, forty miles farther south
                    the Ossa or the Orzantes, the Naren and Asterabad on the south-east extremity,
                    and the Kizitozein on the south-west. From the vast Caucasian chain of mountains
                    which forms the western coast descend numerous rivers, the chief of which is the
                    Thur, which, after receiving the Araxes, is discharged into the Caspian by five
                    different mouths; and at the higher extremity is the Wolga, which pours an
                    immense volume of water into the same sea by thirty-two different channels. Many
                    of these rivers run with a furious course into the Caspian, and in travelling
                    along its shores experienced guides are necessary to find out the practicable
                    fords in these torrents, which frequently sweep, by the irresistible fury of
                    their stream, both man and horse into the ocean. Fraser, who travelled in Persia
                    in 1822, mentions, that the day before he passed the river of Chahloos, a woman
                    on horseback was carried away in this manner and perished.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Fraser’s <hi rend="italic">Travels and
                    Adventures on the Southern Banks of the Caspian Sea</hi>, chap,
                    viii.</p></note></p>
                <p>There are numerous islands in the Caspian, some of them of great extent. Towards
                    the north-east is the island of Kulaha, with a good harbour; and on the same
                    side, between lat. 39. and 40., Idak, Deverish, Naphthonia, which extends about
                    twenty miles in length from north to south, and contains several wells of
                    naphtha, and abundance of good water; Dargan, Dagadaw, and Ogrujinskoi in the
                    Gulf of Balkan, or near its mouth. Chitcheena, called Czeczeni by D’Anville, and
                    Trenzeni by others, is the most important of all the islands in the Caspian. It
                    is situated on the western coast, opposite to the city of Yerki in Circassia. On
                    the same side, and much farther south, are the islands of Swetoizeloi, Toolen,
                    and Kura. Between 42. and 43. north latitude a sand extends sixty miles in
                    length by twenty-seven or thirty in breadth, with twenty fathoms depth of water,
                    which is always discoloured. There are several islands on this bank, which are
                    generally of inconsiderable size, and for the most part near the shore.</p>
                <p>A great proportion of the northern coast of the Caspian is low and marshy, or
                    composed of sandy flats; and there is no depth of water to float a vessel
                    several miles from the shore. There are here also many dangerous quicksands, in
                    which travellers are frequently swallowed up; and Fraser, the enterprising
                    traveller already mentioned, had a narrow escape. His horse sunk in a shallow so
                    deep that the water flowed over his back, and it was only by turning short and
                    floundering backwards until he got his fore-feet on solid ground that he was
                    enabled to regain the shore. In other parts the coast is rocky, or high and
                    mountainous, and has several spacious bays, which are calculated to afford
                    shelter to shipping. The Gulf of Is-kawder, or Alexander, towards the northern
                    extremity, is a fine harbour, twenty miles long and twelve broad. The Gulf of
                    Karabogaskoi, or Carabuga, in lat. 4L 21., extends fifty-five miles by
                    fifty-three in an elliptical form, with very deep water. The Gulf of Balkan lies
                    at the base of the mountain of that name; and in the south-east extremity is the
                    Bay of Astrabad, which is formed by a neck of land varying in breadth from four
                    to twelve miles, and running from a point near Astrabad, and dividing a strip of
                    water, from eight to forty miles broad, from the main body of the Caspian. The
                    Caspian Sea has many ports, but of these, as already stated, there are few which
                    afford any secure haven for shipping, owing to the nature of the bottom, or to
                    the prevalence of certain winds. On the south there was formerly a port in
                    Asterabad Bay, but it is now in ruins. There are still the harbours of Langarood
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193349824" xml:id="kp-eb0706-9824-0217"/> and Euzelli;
                    and on the west are those of Baku, Derbend, and Yerki.</p>
                <p>The Caspian Sea, in proportion to the great extent of its surface, produces but
                    few varieties of fish; and not communicating with the ocean, it cannot receive
                    from it any portion of its inexhaustible stores. But the fish which are found in
                    this lake multiply to such a degree that the Russians, by their industry,
                    convert them into a never-failing source of wealth. The fisheries of the Caspian
                    form the sole occupation and principal trade of the various tribes inhabiting
                    the banks of the Wolga and the Yaik. These fisheries are divided into the great
                    and small; the former comprehending the sturgeon, beluga, and sterlet; the
                    latter the salmon, carp of various species, tench, and others.</p>
                <p>Seals are the principal quadrupeds that inhabit the Caspian; but they are there
                    in such numbers as to afford the means of subsistence to many people in that
                    country, as well as in Greenland. The varieties of the species are numerous,
                    diversified however only by the colour. Some are quite black, others quite
                    white; there are some whitish, some yellowish, some of a mouse colour, and some
                    streaked like a tiger. They crawl by means of their fore feet upon the islands,
                    where they become the prey of the fishermen, who kill them with long clubs. As
                    soon as one is dispatched, he is succeeded by several who come to the assistance
                    of their unhappy companion, but come only to share his fate. They are
                    exceedingly tenacious of life, and endure more than thirty hard blows before
                    they die. They will even live for several days after having received many mortal
                    wounds. They are most terrified by fire and smoke, and as soon as they perceive
                    them, retreat with the utmost expedition to the sea. These animals grow so very
                    fat that they look rather like oil bags than animals. At Astracan is made a sort
                    of gray soap with their fat mixed with pot-ashes, which is much valued for its
                    property of cleansing and taking grease from woollen stuffs. The greatest
                    numbers of seals are killed in spring and autumn. Many small vessels go from
                    Astracan merely for the purpose of catching them. A species of otter is also
                    found in the waters, and on the shores of the Caspian Sea. It is about three and
                    a half feet long, including a short tail; it has four webbed feet; its head
                    resembles that of an otter, and its body is covered with thick and fine brown
                    hair.</p>
                <p>If the Caspian has few quadrupeds, it has in proportion still fewer of those
                    natural productions which are looked upon as proper only to the sea. There have
                    never been found in it any zoophytes, nor any animal of the order of mollusea.
                    The same may almost be said of shells, the only ones found being three or four
                    species of cockle, the common muscle, some species of snails, and one or two
                    others. But to compensate this sterility, it abounds in birds of different
                    kinds. Of those that frequent the shores there are many species of the goose and
                    duck kind, of the stork and heron, and others of the water tribe. Of birds
                    properly aquatic, it contains the grebe, the crested diver, the pelican, the
                    cormorant, and almost every species of gull. Crows are so fond of fish that they
                    haunt the shores of the Caspian in prodigious multitudes.</p>
                <p>Many suppose (and there are strong presumptions in favour of the supposition),
                    that the shores of the Caspian were much more extensive in ancient times than
                    they are at present, and that it once communicated with the Black Sea, and also,
                    as Pallas supposes, with the Sea of Azof. It is probable, too, that the level of
                    the Black Sea was once much higher than it is at present. If, then, it be
                    allowed that the waters of the Black Sea, before it procured an exit by the
                    straits of Constantinople, rose several fathoms above their present level, which
                    from many concurring circumstances may easily be admitted, it will follow, that
                    all the plains of the Crimea, of the Kuman, of the Wolga, and of the Yaik, and
                    those of Great Tartary beyond the Lake of Aral, in ancient times formed but one
                    sea, which embraced the northern extremity of Caucasus by a narrow strait of
                    little depth, the vestiges of which are still obvious in the river Mantysch.</p>
