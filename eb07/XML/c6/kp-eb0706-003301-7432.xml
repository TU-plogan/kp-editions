                <p><label type="entry">CAMBRIDGESHIRE</label> is divided into two parts by the river
                    Ouse. Its most northerly division, which is principally composed of the Isle of
                    Ely, is bounded by rivers and their communicating branches. The limits thus
                    formed are so intermixed as with difficulty to be traced. The southern half has
                    an indented and undistinguished boundary-line on the adjacent counties. The form
                    of Cambridgeshire bears some resemblance to that of the human ear, the county of
                    Huntingdon cutting deeply into its western side by a circular projection. The
                    number of acres assigned to it by Dr Becke is 530,000; but from the agricultural
                    report, and in the returns of the poor-rates in 1803, the number is stated to be
                    443,300 and 439,040 respectively. When the original agricultural report was made
                    in 1794 by Mr Vancouver, he calculated that, of the 443,000 acres, there were
                    132,000 open field, and 150,000 waste and unimproved fen; but since that time
                    both these descriptions of land have been very considerably reduced by inclosure
                    and cultivation.</p>
                <p>The surface of this county presents considerable variety. The northern part,
                    including the Isle of Ely, is chiefly fen land, and perfectly level, intersected
                    with numerous canals and ditches, and abounding with windmills, for the purpose
                    of carrying the water from the lands. This district is naturally a bog, formed
                    by the stagnation of the water from the overflowing rivers. It comprises nearly
                    half of that extensive tract called the Bedford Level, the whole extent of which
                    is 400,000 acres. This great level has been from an early period divided into
                    three parts, the north level, the middle level, and the south level. The largest
                    portion of the middle level, and a considerable part of the south level, are in
                    Cambridgeshire, comprehending the Isle of Ely, and a few parishes to the
                    south-east of the isle. The principal of the drains by means of which this
                    immense fenny district has been in a great measure rendered either rich meadow
                    or arable land, are the Bedford Old and New Rivers, which are navigable in a
                    straight line upwards of twenty miles across the county, from the Great to the
                    Little Ouse. There are some rising grounds in this part of the county, on the
                    most considerable of which the city of Ely stands. Those parts of Cambridgeshire
                    which lie adjacent to Suffolk, Essex, and Hertfordshire, have their surface
                    varied by gently rising hills and downs. The Gogmagog Hills, which begin about
                    four miles to the south-east of Cambridge, and which are one of the terminations
                    of the range of chalk hills that commence in the south-west of England, are the
                    highest in the county; but their height is very inconsiderable. The district
                    which extends from these hills to Newmarket is bleak and thinly inhabited. This
                    district is connected with that vast tract of land which, extending southwards
                    into Essex, and northwards through Suffolk into Norfolk, forms one of the
                    largest plains in the kingdom.</p>
                <p>The substrata of this county are chalk, <hi rend="italic">clunch,</hi> gravel,
                    <hi rend="italic">gault,</hi> sand, <hi rend="italic">silt,</hi> and peat-earth.
                    The chalk extends through the hilly part of the county from Royston to
                    Newmarket. The <hi rend="italic">clunch,</hi> an impure limestone, chiefly
                    abounds in the parishes of Burwell and Iselham. On the east and west sides of
                    the upland division of the county, <hi rend="italic">gault,</hi> a stiff blue
                    clay, chiefly prevails. The sand enters Cambridgeshire from Bedfordshire, in the
                    parish of Gamlingay. In the northern extremity of the county <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi>, near Wisbeach, <hi rend="italic">silt,</hi> a fine
                    sea-sand, is found. The peat-earth extends through the whole of the
                    fen-land.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers are the Ouse, and Granta or Cam. The Ouse enters the county
                    between Fen Drayton and Erith, and thence runs eastward through the fens, till,
                    at some distance above Denny Abbey, it takes a northerly course, and, passing
                    Streatham, Ely, and Littleport, flows into Norfolk. From this river are many
                    cuts, called <hi rend="italic">loads.</hi> The Cam enters the county to the west
                    of Gilden Morden, and thence flowing to the east, it receives several rivulets.
                    Near Grantchester its stream is enlarged by the united waters of several
                    rivulets from Essex. After their junction it takes a northerly direction, and
                    having passed Cambridge and several villages, it falls into the Ouse in the
                    parish of Streatham.</p>
                <p>Besides the numerous canals in the fenny district, principally for the purposes
                    of draining the land, there are the Cambridgeshire Canal, which commences in the
                    Ouse at Harrimcre, and terminates at Cambridge. A cut of three miles extends to
                    Reche, and another of three and a half miles to Burwell; and the Wisbeach Canal,
                    which joins the Wisbeach river at the old sluice in the town, opening a
                    communication with Norfolk, Suffolk, and other places.</p>
                <p>The climate of Cambridgeshire differs considerably in different parts. In the
                    south-east it is cold and bleak; in the fenny district damp and unhealthy,
                    though much less so than formerly; in the south and south-western districts the
                    climate is mild, agreeable, and healthy.</p>
                <p>Estates vary much in size. There are many large ones, especially those of the
                    Earl of Hardwicke and the Dukes of Bedford and Rutland. College tenures are
                    numerous. There are some farms of a thousand acres or more, but the general size
                    is from a hundred to five hundred acres.</p>
                <p>Cambridgeshire is not celebrated as an agricultural county. It may be considered
                    as chiefly arable. Wheat is grown principally in some parts of the fenny
                    district, and in the south and south-western parts of the county. Barley is
                    cultivated in these parts, and in some of the more fertile portions of the
                    south-east district. Immense crops of oats, of good quality, are grown in the
                    fenny district, and also in most ether parts of the county. It is supposed that
                    about one fourth of the fen-lands is cropped with cole, which is principally
                    sown to be eaten green by sheep, very little being now cultivated for the seed.
                    The cultivation of hemp and flax is carried on to a considerable extent in that
                    part of the county which borders on Norfolk, particularly in the parishes of
                    Upwell and Wolney. Saffron has been very little, if at all cultivated, for
                    upwards of forty years. In some parts mustard is a favourite and valuable crop.
                    Sedge is cultivated near Chippenham; but the cultivation of the reed is rapidly
                    deereasing, in consequence of the improvement of the fens. White seed, or
                    fen-hay, is grown abundantly in several places. It increases the milk of cows.
                    Oziers are grown in the Wash, as well as in many parts of the fen, and are a
                    profitable crop in these districts. So great is the value of turf, that the land
                    producing it has been sold at from L.50 to L.80 per aere. At Ely, Soham,
                    Wisbeach, &amp;c. are many large gardens, producing vegetables and common kinds
                    of fruit so abundantly, as to supply not only the neighbouring towns and
                    counties, but even London. Great quantities of strawberries arc grown in the
                    vicinity of Ely, and are chiefly conveyed in barges to Lynn, and carried thence
                    to Newcastle and other places in the north of England. There are numerous and
                    large orchards in the same districts as the gardens; and their chief produce
                    consists of apples and cherries. Soham is remarkable for the latter.</p>

                <p>That district of the county which by old authors is termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dairies,</hi> comprehends the parishes of Shengay, Wengy, Whaddon, &amp;c.; but
                    the dairy farms in this district are at present much less considerable than
                    those in the parishes of Chattris, Mepal, Sutton, Cottenham, Soham, Ely, and
                    Streatham. The whole number of cows kept in this district is supposed to be
                    between 9000 and 10,000; in the parish of Cottenham alone about 1500 are usually
                    kept; in Willingham about 1200. These two parishes make the cheesc, so much
                    esteemed, which goes by the name of Cottenham cheese; the parish of Soham is
                    also esteemed for good cheese. Little cheese is made in other parts of the
                    county, the rearing of calves and making of butter being the chief dairy
                    management. The butter is sold, rolled up in pieces of a yard long, and about
                    two inches in circumference. This is done for the convenience of the colleges,
                    where it is cut into pieces called parts, and so sent to table. Its quality is
                    excellent. The cows kept on the dairy farms are mostly of the breed of the
                    county. Most of the calves that are suckled arc sent to the London market.
                    Immense numbers of sheep are pastured on the heaths and commons with which the
                    south and south-western districts of this county are intersected. The downs in
                    the vicinity of the Gogmagog Hills are also chiefly used as sheep-walks. The
                    principal breeds kept here are the Norfolk and west country; in the fens the
                    most prevalent sort is a cross between the Leicester and Lincoln. The
                    Cambridgeshire farmers think themselves unrivalled in cart-horses, which are of
                    the large black breed. In the fens they are a source of great profit. In
                    Cambridgeshire there is also a peculiar breed of hogs, some of which are so
                    large as to fatten to forty stones, fourteen pounds to the stone, at two years
                    old.</p>
                <p>From the nature of the northern division of the county, great attention has
                    necessarily been paid to draining; and in some places advantage has been taken
                    of the numerous rivers to irrigate and warp land. The interior drainage of the
                    fens is performed principally by mills. One or two steam-engines have been
                    erected for that purpose, and will probably answer better. There is a large
                    tract of meadow land at Babraham, which has been irrigated from the time of
                    Queen Elizabeth, and is supposed to be one of the oldest instances of this mode
                    of improving land in the kingdom. It was first irrigated by Pallavicino, who was
                    collector of Peter’s Pence at the death of Queen Mary, and who, turning
                    Protestant, applied the money thus obtained to the purchase and irrigation of
                    this estate. The practice, however, though evidently beneficial, has extended
                    very little. Near Denver Sluice, on the Ouse, some land has been warped by
                    letting the muddy water of that river upon it, and then throwing it back by
                    means of a wind-mill.</p>
                <p>This is by no means a manufacturing county. At Ely there is a pottery for coarse
                    ware; and at this city, Chatteris, and Cambridge, excellent white bricks are
                    made. Lime and chalk are a source of considerable trade and profit; the lime in
                    the greatest estimation is that which is burnt at Reach. At Cherryhinton, at the
                    foot of the Gogmagog Hills, are great chalk pits, noted for the marine
                    productions they contain, and for the many rare plants growing in their
                    vicinity. Elephants’ grinders, and other animal remains, have been found in a
                    gravel pit near ’ Chesterford, and a small tortoise in flint at Miltón. On the
                    borders of Norfolk a little yarn is spun for the Norwich weavers. Malt is made
                    to a considerable amount in the north-west part of the county. There'are" ⅛veral
                    mills for preparing oil from cole and rapc-seed at Witties-ford, Şawston,
                    &amp;c., and a pretty extensweφaper manufactory at the latter place. Near
                    Cambridge· isannualłý held one of the greatest fairs in England; it is called
                    Stourbridge or Sturbich Fair, and is under the jurisdiction of the university.
                    It begins on the 18th September, and lasts a fortnight; it has, however, been
                    declining for many years.</p>
                <p>A very curious example, and unquestionably one of the oldest in the kingdom, of
                    Saxon architecture, occurs in the remains of the conventual church of Ely. This
                    building is undoubtedly of as early a date as the tenth century, having been
                    erected in the reign of King Edgar. The two transepts of Ely Cathedral afford
                    specimens of the more massive kind of architecture introduced by the Normans.
                    They were built towards the end of the eleventh century. St Sepulchre’s Church
                    at Cambridge affords a curious specimen of that species of architecture which
                    was introduced into this country in imitation of the church of the Holy
                    Sepulchre at Jerusalem; it is supposed to be the oldest of this form in England,
                    and to have been built in the reign of Henry I. There are some instances in this
                    county of the pointed arch, enriched with Saxon mouldings; a style which was the
                    immediate forerunner of the Gothic. Soham Church, the south doorway of St Giles
                    in Cambridge, and the north and south doorways of St Mary’s Church in Ely, are
                    specimens of this species of architecture. One of the most ancient buildings in
                    the county, in which the pointed arch makes its appearance, is the great Tower
                    at the west end of Ely Cathedral, and the south transept adjoining; they were
                    erected between 1174 and 1189. Some traces of Saxon architecture may be observed
                    in this part of the cathedral. The early or simple Gothic may be seen in the
                    vestibule at the west end of Ely Cathedral, in Jesus College Chapel, Cambridge,
                    and in the chancels of Foxton, Kennett, and Cherryhinton churches. Of the Gothic
                    architecture of the fifteenth century, especially in the reign of King Henry
                    VII. which was distinguished by the abundance of its rich tracery, the finest
                    and most perfect example is found in the magnificent chapel of King’s College in
                    Cambridge.</p>
                <p>There are not many remains of antiquity in this county. The most remarkable are
                    the ditches, which formerly extended from the woods on the east side of the
                    county to the fens. The most entire is called the <hi rend="italic">DevU</hi> ’
                    <hi rend="italic">s Ditch,</hi> and extends from Wood-ditton or Ditch-town to
                    Reach. Near this latter place it is most perfect, the works consisting of a deep
                    ditch with an elevated <hi rend="italic">vallum,</hi> the slope of which
                    measures fifty-two feet on the west and twenty-six on the east side. The whole
                    of the works are about 100 feet in width. The origin and intention of these
                    ditches are not known; they are certainly very ancient, and were probably formed
                    for the purpose of defence.</p>
                <p>By returns made to the Board of Agriculture in the year 1804, it appears that the
                    poors’ rates rose, between 1790 and 1803, from 4s. lid. to 5s. 8įd. in the
                    pound; while the expense of maintaining them from Easter 1802 to Easter 1803
                    amounted to the sum of L.55,954. 14s. 1 Id. In the year ending the 25th of March
                    1815 the parochial rates in 131 parishes amounted to the sum of L.63,354. !3s.
                    1⅜d.; forty-four parishes had made no returns.</p>
                <p>In the year 1377 the number of persons charged in this county to a poll tax, from
                    which the clergy, children, and paupers were exempted, was 27,350; but it seems
                    doubtful whether it was exclusive ’of the 'town of Cambridge and city of Ely, in
