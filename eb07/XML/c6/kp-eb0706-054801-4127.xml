                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> conterminous empires of Russia and China occupy
                    between them about one fifth part of the habitable globe, in pretty nearly equal
                    portions; but the population of the latter is about four times greater than that
                    of the former, even after including its recent annexation of Poland. We can
                    easily trace the boundaries and mark the extreme limits of these two great
                    empires, by parallels of latitude and meridional lines of longitude; but when we
                    come to reduce them to square miles, or speak of their contents in acres, the
                    mind is bewildered by the magnitude of the numbers required to express them, and
                    forms but an indistinct idea of their superficial extent. For this reason we
                    shall content ourselves by merely tracing the boundary lines.</p>
                <p>The frontier of China on the side of Russia, including every part of Tartary
                    under its immediate protection, and from which it derives a tribute, is as
                    follows: Commencing at the north-eastern extremity, where the Uda falls into the
                    sea of Otehotsk, in the 55th parallel of northern latitude, it stretches west
                    and west-south-west along the limits of the Tungousi Tartars, the Duourian
                    Mountains, and along the Kerlon, which divides it from the Russian province of
                    Nertchinsk, till it meets the 50th parallel. It then continues along that
                    parallel from 117° to 70° of east longitude, separated from Tobolsk and Irehutsk
                    by the Sawansk, the Altaï, and the Bercha Mountains. On this line, and about the
                    106th meridian, on the river Selinga, are situated the two frontier trading
                    towns of Kiackta and Mai-mai-tchin, the only two points in the long conterminous
                    line of boundary where Russians and Chinese have any communication. From hence,
                    descending south along the Kirghis Tartars, Western Toorkistaun, and Little
                    Thibet, it is'terminated in this direction by the Hindu Coosh; and, turning to
                    the south-east along the Himalaya Mountains, Bootan, Assam, the Burman empire,
                    and Tunquin, it again skirts the sea in the parallel of 21°, as far to the
                    eastward as 123°, or, including Corea, to 130°, and near the Uda, from whence we
                    set out, to 143° of cast longitude. Yet in all this extent of frontier, which
                    cannot be less than 10,000 geographical miles, the Chinese territory has
                    hitherto preserved itself so invulnerable, and even inaccessible to foreigners,
                    that not a Russian, a Turcoman, an Afghaun, a Hindu, Burman, or Tunquinese, by
                    land, nor a European nor an American, among the numbers that annually proceed to
                    Canton for the purposes of trade, have at any time been able to transgress any
                    part of this most extensive boundary, without the knowledge and permission of
                    its vigilant and jealous government; aided, however, by a moral barrier, of
                    itself perhaps insuperable, namely, the impossibility of communication, owing to
                    the total ignorance which prevails, from the highest to the lowest of the
                    people, of every language but their own, and the unaccountable ignorance of
                    other nations <hi rend="italic">οi'dιeir</hi> language. A singular instance may
                    here be mentioned of the inviolability of the frontier, notwithstanding the
                    perseverance of the individual who attempted it, owing to tb.e unwearied
                    vigilance of the government. Mr Manning, an English gentleman of property and
                    education, went to Canton many years ago, with the view of proceeding into the
                    interior of China, and of domesticating himself for some time among the people.
                    On his arrival there, he adopted the Chinese dress, suffered his beard to grow,
                    and sedulously applied himself to the study of the language, both written and
                    spoken. When the time approached that his appearance, manners, and language were
                    considered to be sufficiently Chinese to escape detection, it was communicated
                    to him, by a sort of demi-official message, that his intentions were known, and
                    that it would be in vain for him to make the attempt, as measures had been taken
                    to make it impossible for him to enter the Chinese territories beyond the limits
                    of the English factory. He alleged that his views were innocent, that he was
                    simply an individual, urged solely by curiosity and a desire to mix among the
                    people, and to witness the happy condition of this far-famed nation, and wholly
                    unconnected with any political, commercial, or religious views; and he
                    particularly urged that he was no missionary of any kind, as those of that
                    character had of late given uneasiness to the government. But he urged his suit
                    in vain. He next tried Cochin-China, but with no better success,—the same kind
                    of political jealousy prevailing in that country as in China. Determined,
                    however, not to be thwarted in his object, he proceeded to Calcutta, travelled
                    to the northern frontier of Bengal, found means to penetrate through Bootan to
                    Lassa in Thibet, and was on the point of realizing his long deferred hope by a
                    journey along the Tartar frontier to the capital of China, when he was detected
                    by the Chinese authorities, and ordered immediately to quit the country—so
                    utterly impossible is it to deceive this watchful government. With regard to
                    their own people, the laws are strict and remarkably severe against any one who
                    shall secretly or fraudulently pass the barrier; and if any individual
                    communicate with foreign nations beyond the boundaries, the penalty is death by
                    strangulation.</p>
                <p>This interdiction of intercourse with a people who have nothing in common with
                    the rest of the world, will account for the total ignorance which so long
                    prevailed, and the little knowledge we yet possess, respecting this singular and
                    original people; for that they are an original and unmixed race we conceive no
                    reasonable doubt can be entertained, though a different hypothesis has been held
                    by learned and ingenious men. By De Guignes and Fréret, arguing from the
                    communications of the Jesuits, they were supposed to be derived from a colony of
                    Egyptians; by the earlier Jesuits they were set down as a tribe of the Jews; and
                    by Sir William Jones as the descendants of the Cshantrya or Military Caste of
                    Hindus, called Chinas, “who,” say the Pundits, “abandoned the ordinances of the
                    Veda, and lived in a state of degradation.” With submission to such high
                    authorities, we should as soon think of deriving the trunk of a tree from its
                    branches, as the people of China from any of these. That they are not Egyptians,
                    the ingenious Pauw has most clearly and satisfactorily demonstrated, by proving
                    that, in no one iota, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354140"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-4140-0549"/>does there, or ever did there, exist one single
                    resemblance. As little similarity is there between them and the Hindus: no two
                    people, indeed, could possibly differ more than they do in their physical and
                    moral character, in their language, and in their political and religious
                    institutions. The colour of the Hindu is ebon black or a deep bronze, that of a
                    Chinese a sickly white, or pale yellow, like that of a faded leaf, or the root
                    of rhubarb; the features of a Hindu are regular and placid, those of a Chinese
                    wild, irregular, constant only in the oblique and elongated eye, and the broad
                    root of the nose; the Hindus are slaves and martyrs to religious ordinances, the
                    Chinese have superstitions enough, but, strictly speaking, no religious
                    prejudices; the Hindus are divided into castes, the Chinese know of no such
                    division; the historical records of China go far beyond the time that these
                    supposed Chinas of Sir William Jones peopled the country, the Hindus have not a
                    page of history; the language of Hindustan is alphabetic, that of China a
                    transition from the hieroglyphic to the symbolic, and there is not the slightest
                    analogy in the colloquial languages of the two countries. But Sir William Jones
                    had a theory to support, which made him overlook many inconsistencies; and he
                    had no knowledge of the Chinese language. The name of Chinas seems to have
                    caught him; a name, however, utterly unknown to the Chinese themselves. The
                    madman who, in the third century before Christ, is accused of burning all their
                    books, but who conquered the revolted provinces, and re-united them to the
                    empire, endeavoured to give to China the name of his own dynasty, <hi
                    rend="italic">Tsin,</hi> which might have been known to the Hindus, and through
                    them to the Arabs, from whom Europeans had their <hi rend="italic">Sina</hi> and
                    China; but this dynasty, if we take Sir William Jones’s dates, reigned a full
                    thousand years subsequently to the supposed emigration of the Chinas. The most
                    ancient name for China, which is still in use, is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tien-sha,</hi> under heaven, or inferior only to heaven; but the most common
                    appellation is <hi rend="italic">Τehung-quo,</hi> the middle kingdom: and here
                    it may be proper to observe, that this name is not given, as the French
                    missionaries would lead us to suppose, from a notion among this people that
                    China is placed on the middle of the earth’s square surface, but from the
                    circumstance of the emperor Tching-whang having fixed his court at Loyang, in
                    the province of Ho-nan, when he gave to this capital the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Cliung-quο,</hi> the middle of the kingdom, which, in fact, is
                    nearly the truth; and this name was afterwards transferred to the whole
                    empire.</p>
                <p>Dr Marshman has set the question, as to any similarity between the Sanscrit and
                    Chinese languages, completely at rest. The priests of Buddh, who were permitted
                    to enter China in the first century of the Christian era, endeavoured, with
                    their religion, to introduce the Sanscrit alphabet, or series of sounds
                    represented by the Devanagari character; and this series being placed at the
                    head of Canghe’s Dictionary^ induced Dr Marshman to suppose that there might be
                    some connection between the Chinese and the Sanscrit languages. Had he, however,
                    read the preface to that dictionary, he would have seen that the compilers
                    announce it as a system brought from the West, which the learned of China could
                    never be prevailed on to adopt. This Hindu series of alphabetic sounds did not,
                    however, mislead him; he was fully aware that a pure, unchangeable, monosyllabic
                    language could not arise out of a polysyllabic one; that a language which
                    admitted of no change from its original monosyllabic root, but retained it in
                    its primitive form, whether employed as a noun, a verb, or a participle, could
                    not have been derived from another language whose dhatoos or roots, by a
                    complicated mechanism, assumed a hundred different shapes; nay, whose
                    inflections, in some instances, are so numerous, as to produce more than a
                    thousand modifications of an idea from one radical word. In addition to all
                    this, when he reflected that there were in the Sanscrit alphabet four or five
                    sounds which the organs of a Chinese could not by any possibility enumerate, he
                    found it utterly incompatible to associate the two languages together, and was
                    confirmed in his idea by the test of facts. He took the Ramayuna, which is
                    supposed to be the most ancient poetry in the Sanscrit language, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Shee-hing</hi> of the Chinese. In ten pages of the former,
                    containing four hundred and fifty-nine words, he found only thirteen
                    monosyllables, and of these thirteen, seven do not occur in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Slice,</hi> nor are any two of them used to express the same idea
                    in both languages. He next took four pages of the Mahabharu, in the Bengalee
                    dialect, containing two hundred and sixty-five words, in which he found only
                    seven monosyllables, and of these, <hi rend="italic">three</hi> only were
                    Chinese.</p>
                <p>Proceeding in the same manner, he proves, what was scarcely necessary, that there
                    exists not the most distant resemblance between the Chinese and the Hebrew
                    languages. In examining the speech of Judah to Joseph, in the 44th chapter of
                    Genesis, he finds it to contain two hundred and six words, in which there occur
                    sixteen monosyllables; but of these, seven only are Chinese words. In Abraham’s
                    intercession for Sodom, out of two hundred and thirty words, ten only are
                    monosyllables, and of these, four are Chinese. Again, in the maledictory
                    prophecy of Noah, relative to his grandson Canaan, in twenty-six words there is
                    but one monosyllable. ∙ It would be most absurd, therefore, to conclude that the
                    Chinese derived their language from the Hebrew, when one word only occurs out of
                    twenty-nine, as in the first example, one out of fifty, as in the second, or one
                    in twenty-six, as in the third; and he thinks it more rational to infer, that as
                    it is neither derived from the Sanscrit nor the Hebrew, it is an original
                    language invented by themselves. Neither is there any resemblance to be found in
                    the manners, customs, physical character, or religious creeds, of the two
                    people. There arc, in fact, a colony of Jews in China, whose entrance can be
                    traced beyond the Christian era; who use the Hebrew language; who abstain from
                    swine’s flesh, the great article of Chinese food; use circumcision, and
                    celebrate the passover, neither of which the Chinese know anything about; and it
                    may, therefore, fairly be concluded that they are neither Jews, Hindus, nor
                    Egyptians, but an original people, who have kept themselves more unmixed with
                    other nations than any people existing on the face of the earth. (Barrow’s <hi

                <p>Pauw, and some other writers, are of opinion that they proceeded originally from
                    the heights of Tartary. It is, in fact, obvious enough that the Tartars and
                    Chinese are one and the same race; and the only question seems to be, whether
                    the latter, guided by the mountain-streams, descended from the bleak and barren
                    elevations of Tartary, which, bulging out of the general surface of the earth,
                    have been compared with the boss of a shield, to the fertile plains and
                    temperate climate of China; or, whether the former arc swarms sent off by an
                    over-abundant population, and driven into the mountains. The former supposition
                    will be regarded, perhaps, as the more probable of the two. In all the
                    institutions which the change from a pastoral to an agricultural state would
                    necessarily require, the ancient manners and customs of the Hyperborean
                    Scythians, as described by Herodotus, are still discernible among the Chinese. A
                    Chinese city is nothing more than a Tartar camp, surrounded by mounds of earth,
                    to preserve themselves and cattle from the depredations of neighbouring tribes,
                    and the nocturnal attacks of wolves and other wild beasts; and a Chinese
                    habitation, the Tartar tent, with its sweeping roof supported by poles,
                    excepting <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354153" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4153-0550"/>that
                    the Chinese have cased their walls with brick, and tiled the roofs of their
                    houses. When the famous barbarian Gengis-khan made an irruption into the fertile
                    plains of China, and took possession of a Chinese city, his soldiers immediately
                    set about pulling down the four walls of the houses, leaving the overhanging
                    roofs supported on the wooden columns, by which they were converted into
                    excellent tents for themselves and horses. Yet such is the facility with which
                    Chinese and Tartars amalgamate, that although this celebrated barbarian could
                    neither read nor write any language, he listened to the advice of the conquered,
                    became sensible of the change of situation in which he found himself, did every
                    thing he could to repair the errors he had committed, and both he and his
                    successors left good names behind them in the annals of the country. In like
                    manner, the present Mantchoo Tartars, who lived in tents, and subsisted on their
                    cattle and by hunting, immediately accommodated themselves to the manners, the
                    customs, and the institutions of China, preserving nothing of their own, not
                    even their religion, and scarcely a vestige of ancient superstitions, that does
                    not coincide with those of the Chinese—one of the most singular of which is,
                    their agreement in the birth of man and of the serpent-woman, and the universal
                    use and estimation of the ancient Scythian emblem of the dragon. Next to the
                    Chinese, the Turks seem to have preserved most of the character and customs of
                    the ancient Scythians from whom they sprung; and the Turks are Tartars. Some
                    German author has pointed out a similarity between the Turks and Chinese in
                    seventeen different customs; he might have extended the parallel to more than
                    twice that number. <hi rend="italic">(Recherches sur les Chinois,</hi> par Μ. de

                <p>It has long been objected in Europe against the authenticity of the early part of
                    Chinese history, that it abounds with absurd fictions and irreconcilable
                    contradictions, and that it sets up a chronology and cosmogony at variance with
                    the sacred writings, and the generally received opinions of mankind. This,
                    however, is not the fact with regard to Chinese history in its pure and original
                    state, divested of the reveries of Fo or Buddh, which the priests of this sect
                    imported with their religion, and found means to propagate among the vulgar. The
                    Hindu periods of the creation and destruction of the universe,— the miraculous
                    conceptions, and all the absurd stories of gods, demi-gods, and heroes, are
                    scouted by the learned of China. The period they assign for the commencement of
                    their civilization is perfectly consistent with the time when, according to holy
                    writ, the great catastrophe befel the earth; and though they are unable to
                    establish the truth of the early part of it by any concurring contemporaneous
                    histories of other countries, yet neither can any extraneous authority be
                    produced to contradict theirs; the probability, therefore, of the truth or
                    falsehood must rest on the internal evidence of their own history, and the
                    manner in which that history has been compiled, preserved, and handed down to
                    posterity.</p>
                <p>We may take it for granted, that when the Emperor Kaung-hee summoned to Pekin the
                    most learned men of the empire, for the purpose of translating into the Mantchoo
                    language an abridged history of China, from the earliest times, those annals
                    only were consulted which were considered as most authentic, namely, those which
                    are compiled and published by the college of <hi rend="italic">Han-liiu</hi>
                    Père Mailla was one of those missionaries who viewed the Chinese less through
                    the eye of prejudice than most of the Jesuits. He was employed by the emperor in
                    making a survey of the empire, which cost him and his colleagues the labour of
                    ten years; he passed forty-five years of his life in the country, and generally
                    about the court, during which time he made himself perfectly acquainted with the
                    Mantchoo and the Chinese languages. When, therefore, Kaung-hee undertook the
                    laudable design of giving to his Mantchoo subjects an authenticated history of
                    China in their own language, Père Mailla conceived the idea of proceeding <hi
                    rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with a translation of the same work into French;
                    and having lived to complete this Herculean labour, it was published at Paris,
                    after many difficulties and delays, by the Abbé Grozier, in fourteen large
                    quarto volumes, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Histoire Générale</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de la Chine.</hi></p>
                <p>The history of China commences, in fact, at a period not much more than 3000
                    years before the birth of Christ, by describing the little horde from which the
                    Chinese had their origin, to be in as barbarous and savage a state as can well
                    be imagined; roving among the forests of <hi rend="italic">Shen-see,</hi> just
                    at the foot of the Tartar Mountains, without houses, without any clothing but
                    the skins of animals, without fire to dress their victuals, and subsisting on
                    the spoils of the chase, on roots and insects. Their chief, of the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Yoo-tsou-she,</hi> induced them to settle on this spot, and they
                    made themselves huts of the boughs of trees. Under the next chief, <hi
                    rend="italic">Swee-gin-shee,</hi> the grand discovery of fire was effected by
                    the accidental friction of two pieces of dry wood. He taught the people to look
                    up to <hi rend="italic">Tien,</hi> the great creating, preserving, and
                    destroying power; and he invented a method of registering time and events, by
                    making certain knots on thongs or cords twisted out of the bark of trees. Next
                    to him followed ∕ ’ b- <hi rend="italic">hee,</hi> who separated the people into
                    classes or tribes, giving to each a particular name; discovered iron; appointed
                    certain days to show their gratitude to heaven, by offering the first fruits of
                    the earth; and invented the <hi rend="italic">Ye-king</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Koua,</hi> which superseded the knotted cords. Fo-hee reigned 115 years, and
                    his tomb is shown at Tchin-choo, in the province of Shen-see, at this day. His
                    successor, <hi rend="italic">Chin-nong,</hi> invented the plough; and from that
                    moment the civilization of China proceeds by rapid but progressive steps.</p>
                <p>As the early history of every ancient people is more or less vitiated by fable,
                    we ought not to be more fastidious or less indulgent towards the marvellous in
                    that of China, than we are towards Egyptian, Greek, or Roman history. The main
                    facts may be true, though the details are incorrect; and though the accidental
                    discovery of fire may not have happened under Swee-gin-shee, yet it probably was
                    first communicated by the friction of two sticks, which at this day is a common
                    method among almost all savages of producing fire. Nor is it perhaps strictly
                    correct that Fo-hee made the accidental discovery of iron, by having burnt a
                    quantity of wood on a brown earth, anymore than that the Phoenicians discovered
                    the mode of making glass by burning green wood on sand; yet there is nothing
                    improbable, either in the one or the other, that these two processes first led
                    to the discovery of both. And if it be objected against the history, that the
                    rcign of a hundred and fifteen years exceeds the usual period of human
                    existence, it should be recollected, at the same time, that such an instance is
                    as nothing, when compared with those contemporaneous ones recorded in biblical
                    history. Thus, also, considerable allowances are to be deducted from the
                    scientific discoveries of Chin-nong in botany, when we read of his having in one
                    day discovered no less than seventy different species of plants that were of a
                    poisonous nature, and seventy others that were antidotes against their baneful
                    effects.</p>
                <p>The next sovereign, Hoang-tee, was an usurper; but during his reign the Chinese
                    are stated to have made a very rapid progress in the arts and conveniences of
                    civilized life; and to his lady, See-ling-shee, is ascribed the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193354166" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4166-0551"/>honour of having first
                    observed the silk produced by the worms, of unravelling their coccoons, and
                    working the fine filaments into a web of cloth. The tomb of Hoang-tee is also
                    kept up to this day in the province of Shen-see.</p>
                <p>From these few recorded facts, out of a multitude stated by Chinese historians,
                    we think it may be inferred that, at a very distant period, and at the earliest
                    dawn of civilization, a small horde of Tartars, descending from their elevated
                    regions, seated, them selves on the plains of Shen-see, at the foot of the
                    mountains; and, under the guidance of a succession of intelligent chiefs,
                    changed the pastoral and venatorial life for one more stationary, and at length
                    became cultivators of the soil, and spread themselves over the fine fertile
                    region now known by the name of China. <hi rend="italic">( Hist. Gen.</hi><hi

                <p>Some doubts have been entertained with regard to the authenticity of that nart of
                    Chinese history which relates to the reign of the first three sovereigns, <hi
                    rend="italic">Fo-hee, Chin-nong,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hoang-tee,</hi>
                    which is supposed to have been contained in a book called <hi rend="italic"
                    >San-fen</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and of the five following reigns, ending
                    with the joint government of <hi rend="italic">Yαo</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chun,</hi> as detailed in another work named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ou-tieìi.</hi> Of the first of these works the Chinese avow that nothing is
                    known; and all that remained of the second was an imperfect fragment preserved
                    by being inserted at the head of one of their most ancient and valued books,
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Shoo-king,</hi> of which we have a translation, or
                    rather a bad paraphrase, by Père Gaubil. This fragment relates chiefly to the
                    reign of <hi rend="italic">Yao</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chun.</hi> The rest of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Shoo-hing</hi> contains an abridged history of the empire,
                    from the joint reign of these two sovereigns down to the time of Confucius,
                    being a compilation by this celebrated‘sage. The authenticity of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Shoo-hing</hi> must, however, depend on two circumstances; first,
                    whether it is the same that was composed by Confucius; and, secondly, whether
                    the materials which this sage possessed were authentic. If he really had copies
                    of the <hi rend="italic">San-fen</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ou-tien,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">Shoo-hing</hi> may fairly be classed with the history of
                    Herodotus, with whom Confucius was contemporary,—the Chinese historian having
                    the additional advantage of previous written records. But, admitting this to
                    have been the case, there is still an awkward and suspicious chasm in the
                    history of China, the cause of which draws largely on our faith. The Emperor
                    Che-whang-tee, of the dynasty of <hi rend="italic">Tsin,</hi> after reducing, as
                    we before observed, the refractory provinces, conceived the mad scheme of
                    destroying all the writings of the empire, under the idea of commencing a new
                    set of annals with his own reign, in order that posterity might consider him as
                    the founder of the empire. Some sixty years after this barbarous decree had been
                    carried into execution, his successor, desirous, as far as might be possible, to
                    repair the injury, held out great rewards to those who could produce any part of
                    the annals of the empire, more especially the hundred chapters of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Shoo-hing.</hi> After some time, a copy of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shoo∙king</hi> was procured in this manner. All ancient writings, and those of
                    Confucius in particular, were comprised in short sentences, forming a kind of
                    poetry, not unlike the Proverbs of Solomon; and they were in the memory of most
                    persons then, as they are now, who had any pretensions to literature; but sixty
                    years having been suffered to elapse before any encouragement was held forth for
                    the revival of letters, most of those who had known the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shoo-hing</hi> were either dead, or so old as to have lost the recollection of
                    it. At length, however, a man named Foo-seng, of the age of ninety and upwards,
                    was discovered, who, in earlier life, could repeat the whole of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Shoo-kirig</hi> by heart. To this man the historiographers of the
                    empire were sent; but he was unable to write, and his articulation was so
                    imperfect, that the parts of it which he recollected could only be obtained
                    through the medium of his daughter, who, having received the words from her
                    father, repeated them to the historians. In this way they proceeded until
                    twenty-nine of the books or sections of the <hi rend="italic">Shoo-hing</hi> had
                    been committed to writing, which Foo-seng had comprehended in twenty-five; but
                    here they were compelled to stop, the infirmities of Foo-seng not allowing him
                    to proceed. A document thus obtained did not pass for genuine among the learned;
                    yet all were eager to procure copies of it, in order to compare such passages as
                    each might recollect to have heard their fathers repeat. The early annals of
                    China, however, do not rest solely on this record. Half a century after this, a
                    prince of Loo, in pulling down an old building (some say the house in which
                    Confucius lived), to erect on its site a temple in honour of that philosopher,
                    discovered in one of the walls an imperfect copy of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shoo-hing,</hi> with two other works of Confucius. They were much devoured by
                    the worms, and written in a character which had gone out of use. The learned men
                    were assembled to collate this newly discovered copy with that taken from
                    Foo-seng’s recollection, and it is said that they did not materially differ,
                    except in the division into chapters. They therefore proceeded in deciphering
                    the remaining part of the characters, and, after much time and labour, obtained
                    twenty-nine complete articles, in addition to the twenty-nine recollected by
                    Foo-seng, making the fifty-eight chapters of which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shoo-king</hi> at the present day is composed.</p>
                <p>The story is told by Chinese writers with some variations; but it is a common
                    saying, that “both the ancient and modern <hi rend="italic">Shoo-hing</hi> were
                    taken from the wall of a house.” According to some, the old man Foo-seng hid a
                    copy of the book within the wall of his house, and, to avoid the rigour of the
                    persecution that was carried on against men of letters, put out his own eyes and
                    affected idiotism. The whole story, however, is not very consistent, and it has
                    been conjectured that it was invented as a salvo to the mortified vanity of the
                    Chinese, who were unable to make out a connected series of annals from a high
                    antiquity; and that, in fact, Confucius was the first regular historian of the
                    empire, and probably the person who first led them on rapidly to a state of
                    civilization. One thing at least is perfectly well ascertained; no writings of
                    any description prior to those ascribed to Confucius exist in China. Where the
                    <hi rend="italic">Shoo-hing</hi> terminated, Confucius commenced his own annals,
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Tehun-iou,</hi> which carried down the history of
                    the empire to his own time; and of this work a copy had been secreted by one of
                    the historiographers. Many other manuscripts were from time to time brought in,
                    from which were selected all that belonged to the history of the empire, by a
                    commission, of which <hi rend="italic">Tse-ma-tsin</hi> was placed at the head;
                    after his death his son <hi rend="italic">Tse∙ma-tsien</hi> completed this great
                    work, which is still extant, about a century before the Christian era, and its
                    author is considered and known by the name of the <hi rend="italic">Ke-storer of
                    History.</hi> From that period to the present time there seems to be no reason
                    to doubt the authenticity of Chinese history, or to accuse it of undue
                    partiality. The history of a dynasty is not made public from authority, until
                    that dynasty has ceased to reign; and it does not appear that any injustice is
                    done or attempted by the succeeding dynasty. Some of the atrocities of
                    Gengis-khan are related on his first incursion into China, but ample justice is
                    done to him and to his successors; and the present Tartar dynasty, in publishing
                    the annals of that of <hi rend="italic">ATing,</hi> whom they displaced, does
                    not appear to have done it any violent injustice. This event occurred under the
                    eye of several European missionaries then resident in the capital; and, by their
                    concurring testimonies, the affairs of the empire were left, as the Chinese
                    state, to priests, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354179"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-4179-0552"/>and eunuchs, and jugglers; and it is favourable to
                    the character of the college of Han-lin, that, for the sake of accuracy, the
                    history of the dynasty of Ming was retarded for some time, by the Chinese
                    members refusing to allow the Tartar race, then on the throne, the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">imperial,</hi> until the last remaining prince of the family of
                    Ming should be extinct; but the Tartars insisted on dating the commencement of
                    their own dynasty from the day they were in possession of Pekin, to which at
                    length the Chinese members were reluctantly compelled to assent. In the instance
                    of Gengis-khan they were most successful. The name of this marauder does not
                    appear in the list of Chinese emperors, nor those of the two next in succession,
                    Ogdai-khan and Menko-khan, though their exploits are amply detailed in Chinese
                    history. The Mongoo dynasty commences only with Kublai-khan, who was not
                    declared emperor till the death of the last remaining branch of the family of
                    <hi rend="italic">Song.</hi> Their account of these Tartars is probably very
                    correct. They had neither treasure to pay their troops, nor magazines of
                    provisions for their subsistence. They lived by the chase and by plunder,
                    driving before them large herds of cattle, whose flesh served them for food when
                    other supplies failed, and their skins for clothing. They put to death men,
                    women, and children, without compunction, plundering the towns and villages
                    through which they passed, and carrying off the young women; and when the
                    Chinese took up a strong position in the passes of the mountains, it was the
                    practice of Gengis-khan to seize all the old men, women, and children of the
                    neighbouring country, and drive them forward at the head of his army, and thus,
                    approaching the Chinese under cover of their own friends and relations, succeed
                    in coming upon them without their being able to strike a single blow; and it is
                    added, that, had it not been for the remonstrances of a Chinese who had united
                    his fortunes to those of the invaders, Gengis-khan had determined to put to
                    death all the agriculturists, for ploughing up the ground, and destroying the
                    grass on which his numerous cavalry was to be subsisted.</p>
                <p>As their history relates solely to the internal events and transactions of the
                    empire, and as their policy has been to exclude all communication with foreign
                    nations, we have no means of verifying the facts that arc related; but it is in
                    favour of their accuracy to find a fact recorded in the progress of a revolution
                    brought about by a change of dynasty, which is also related by an European
                    traveller, who was himself a party in the transaction, and who is worthy of
                    implicit credit in all that he states to have fallen under his own knowledge and
                    observation. Marco Polo states, that <hi rend="italic">Sian-foo</hi> was taken
                    by the Mongoos after a siege of three years, chiefly by means of machines made
                    by his father and uncle, which hurled stones of three hundred pounds in weight;
                    and it is recorded in the history of China, that the city of Siang-yang held out
                    against the troops of Kublai-khan for four years, but was at length reduced by
                    means of certain machines for hurling stones of an extraordinary weight,
                    constructed by one <hi rend="italic">Alihaya,</hi> who had travelled to China
                    from the western countries.</p>
                <p>Another instance of the fidelity of the Chinese historians is affirmed by the
                    faithful traveller Marco Polo. It is recorded that Kublai-khan-adopted the
                    Chinese manners and customs, and gave encouragement to the artsand sciences,
                    commerce and manufactures; that he opened the ports of China to all foreigners;
                    that he sent embassies and expeditions to almost every part of the world, and
                    received tribute from the sovereigns of Pung-kia-la (BengaD, Soo-ma-ta-la
                    (Sumatra), and Mal-la-kia (Malacca); subdued Corea, but failed in his expedition
                    against Japan, or, as they call it, Ge-pun-quo, the kingdom of the rising sun;
                    all of which will be found related in Marco Polo, whose accuracy in relating
                    what was told him appears in another Chinese book called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fo-quo-hee,</hi> a history of the kingdom of Fo, giving an account of the
                    temples of India, visited by a Ho-chang or priest in the fourth century, in
                    which, among other things, is noticed the yells and musical strains made by
                    invisible spirits in the great desert of Sha-moo, to frighten and bewilder the
                    traveller; a fable repeated by Marco Polo, in speaking of the same desert, nine
                    hundred years afterwards. <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Gen.·,</hi> Morrison’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Dictionary</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> Marco Polo.)</p>
                <p>But whether the ancient history of China be true on false—whether Yao or Chun
                    were real or fictitious perso-ι nages, and Confucius the real author of the
                    religious, moral, and political maxims ascribed to these sovereigns, the Chinese
                    at least entertain no doubts on the subject; and on these maxims are all their
                    institutions founded, as we find them existing at the present day. In all these
                    institutions may be discovered the traces of a primeval state of society. The
                    leading features of the government still wear the stamp of the first rude
                    attempts to restrain savage man within the pale.of social life; paternal
                    solicitude and protection on the part of the chief, obedience and service on
                    that of the people. The same principles which their history states to have
                    regulated the pastoral tribes of Fo-hee on the plains of Shen-see, four thousand
                    years ago, actuate the measures of the Chinese government of the present day. A
                    few modifications of the ancient patriarchal system have served to convert
                    tribes of hunters and shepherds into a nation of agriculturists, and to keep
                    them so; for of all governments which the history of the world has made known,
                    none has had that permanency and stability which China has enjoyed. Like other
                    governments, the machine may occasionally have been enlarged; a few wheels may
                    have been added, its movements sometimes disturbed, its operations impeded, and
                    a spring or a wheel injured or destroyed; but the damage has soon been repaired,
                    and without altering or improving the principles of the construction. Rebellion,
                    revolution, and foreign conquest, have occasionally removed old families from,
                    and placed new ones on, the vacant throne, and for a moment disturbed the
                    movements of the machine; but a little time has generally restored the usual
                    harmony of its operations. It becomes, therefore, an object of interest to
                    inquire, on what principles, and by what practice, the largest mass of
                    population which in any age or country has been united under one government, has
                    been kept together in one bond of union, for a period of time extending far
                    beyond that at which the history of the earliest European nations may be said to
                    commence. It has assuredly not been owing to the superior virtues of its
                    princes, for China has had its Neros and Caligulas as well as Rome; nor to the
                    superior virtues of the people, for Chinese morality consists more in profession
                    than in practice; and yet the affectation of superior virtues in the one, and of
                    moral sentiment in the other, has gone far in giving support to the system of
                    government, and securing the permanency of the ancient institutions of the
                    country.</p>
                <p>Ancient usage, universally appealed to, is almost the only rule of conduct, and
                    the only limitation or control prescribed to the executive authority vested in
                    the monarch. The public voice is never heard, but the public opinion is
                    sedulously courted by the sovereign, and conveyed to every part of the empire
                    through the medium of the <hi rend="italic">Pehin Gazette.</hi> This vehicle of
                    imperial panegyric is published daily; it is sent forth into all the provinces,
                    and read in all the public taverns and tea-houses. It is one of the most
                    powerful engines of state; and a series of this paper would explain the nature
                    of the government <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354192"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-4192-0553"/>better than all the moral maxims of antiquity on
                    which it is supposed to be founded. Through it are all the measures of the
                    government, or rather of the sovereign, communicated to the public. If he fasts
                    or feasts, promotes or degrades, levies or remits taxes, feeds the hungry,
                    clothes the naked, rewards virtue or punishes vice, or, in short, whatever
                    laudable action he may perform, it is announced in this state paper, with the
                    motivesand the reasons that may have given rise to it. Every sentence of death,
                    with an abstract of the charges and the trial, and every mitigation of
                    punishment, are also published in this Gazette. There is now published in Canton
                    an English Gazette or Register, which contains translations of all the most
                    interesting and important notices extracted from the <hi rend="italic">Pehin
                    Gazette,</hi> and other matters connected with the commerce, the manufactures
                    and products, of this most extensive empire,—a publication which, if it should
                    go on as it commenced, will throw more light on this extraordinary people than
                    has been afforded by any of the writings of foreigners.</p>
                <p>The grand leading principle of this patriarchal government is to place the
                    sovereign at as great a distance from the people, and as far removed from
                    mortality, as human invention could suggest. They not only style him the “Son of
                    Heaven,” but believe him to be of heavenly descent; and this superstitious
                    notion appeared in a manner sufficiently remarkable, by the obstacles thrown in
                    the way of the present Mantchoo dynasty, on account of their family not being
                    able to trace their descent farther back than eight generations; a defect of
                    ancient origin which was considered by the Chinese as a great reproach.
                    Kaung-hee, aware of their prejudices, caused the genealogy of the Tartar family
                    to be published in the Gazette. It stated that “the daughter of heaven,
                    descending on the borders of the Lake Poulkouri, at the foot of the White
                    Mountain, and eating some red fruit that grows there, conceived, and bore a son,
                    partaking of her nature, and endowed with wisdom, strength, and beauty; that the
                    people chose him for their sovereign; and that from him were descended the
                    present Son of Heaven, who filled the throne of China.” And this explanation
                    wiped away the reproach, and fully satisfied the subjects of the “celestial
                    empire.”</p>
                <p>In the capacity of sovereign, the Emperor of China is supposed to sustain two
                    distinct characters. The first is that of a high priest, in which he, and he
                    alone, mediates and intercedes with heaven for all the sins and misdeeds of his
                    people. In this character he only can officiate at solemn feasts, when heaven is
                    to be propitiated by suitable oblations. He alone has the merit of all the
                    prosperity that the empire enjoys; but he also affects to consider public
                    calamity as the consequence of some act committed, or some duty neglected by
                    him. When, therefore, insurrections, famines, earthquakes, or inundations,
                    afflict the people, he affects the deepest humility, appears in the meanest
                    dress, strips the palace of its ornaments, and suspends all the court
                    amusements; but even in this state of humiliation he is held up as the peculiar
                    object of heaven’s attention, whether it be to punish or to bless.</p>
                <p>His second character as sovereign of the empire is that of“the father and mother
                    of his people.” In this character it is supposed that his subjects bear the same
                    relation to him that he stands in towards <hi rend="italic">Tien</hi> or heaven.
                    His ministers or magistrates execute his will, and are supposed to be placed as
                    agents between him and the people, in the same manner as heaven has its agents
                    to regulate the divine decrees on earth; but all power, honour, offices, and
                    emoluments, emanate from him alone, and are revocable at his pleasure. His
                    prerogative is undefined and undivided, unrestrained by any written law, and
                    checked only by ancient custom, stronger even than law. “Heaven,” says
                    Confucius, “has not two sons, earth has not two kings, a family has not two
                    masters, sovereign power has not two directors—one God, one emperor,” not for
                    China alone, but for all the earth, the rest of the sovereigns being considered
                    as his vassals. This doctrine was boldly avowed on the occasion of Lord
                    Amherst’s embassy, when the ceremony of prostration was demanded, not as a mere
                    ceremony, but as the sign and seal of vassalage, and on this ground was of
                    course resisted.</p>
                <p>This self-created universal autocrat is not only the fountain of all honour in
                    his wide dominions, but of all mercy. He is held upon all occasions as the
                    mediator for his people, stepping in between the sentence of the law and the
                    execution of it, and with a fatherly tenderness remitting a certain portion of
                    the punishment which the law awards, and which the magistrate has no power to
                    dispense with. If a magistrate instructs the people, it is in the name of the
                    emperor; if he flogs them for a misdemeanour, he remits a certain number of
                    blows as the emperor’s grace; he orders his ministers to attend at all times to
                    the complaints of the people; and, that none may be denied access to the chief
                    magistrate of the district, a gong or drum is suspended at the outer gate of his
                    dwelling,—but woe be to him who ventures to sound it without substantial reason;
                    the emperor’s grace would not save him from at least a dozen strokes of the
                    bamboo. Navarette says that the judge’s drum at Nankin is covered with the hide
                    of an elephant, and the drum-stick, a huge piece of timber, is slung by strong
                    ropes from the roof of the house. This poor Jesuit had a ready credulity to
                    receive all for truth which the Chinese told him.</p>
                <p>The name of the sovereign, however, rarely appears but in an amiable light; the
                    people hear of him only as distributing rewards, punishing oppression, relieving
                    the distresses of the poor, opening the public magazines in times of scarcity,
                    and remitting all taxes where the state of the treasury will afford it. Thus it
                    appears, that Kien-lung, having received a report from the board of revenue that
                    a balance remained in the treasury of seventy millions of ounces of silver,
                    issued an edict, by which he exempted all his people from one year’s taxes. This
                    is all very good, and so is the whole theory of this arbitrary government, as
                    delivered in the following rescript, which the minister of Timour-khan put into
                    the hands of this sovereign; indeed, were the practice but conformable with it,
                    we might call it truly Utopian. 1. Study with eager attention the will of
                    heaven. 2. Bc careful to tread in the steps of your ancestors, and to imitate
                    their virtues. 3. Cease not to show your respect and gratitude to the august
                    parents who gave you birth. 4. Watch over your people with a fatherly fondness.
                    5. In the exercise of sovereign power preserve an upright heart and an elevated
                    soul. 6. Be moderate in your pleasures. 7. Drink little wine. 8. Do not lavish
                    your treasures. 9. Extend your benefits to men of merit. 10. Make your justice
                    formidable to criminals. 11. Drive from your presence knaves and flatterers. 12.
                    Cherish upright and sincere men, and receive with temper their wise
                    remonstrances. 13. Study the character of those you employ, and proportion their
                    employments to their talents. 14. Regulate your time to your occupations, so
                    that they may suit each other. 15. Let not a day pass without studying the
                    maxims of the ancients. And he concludes by observing, that by putting in
                    practice these fifteen precepts, he would secure to himself a happy reign, and
                    to his people prosperity and the blessings of peace.</p>
                <p>In Kaung-hee’s declaration on the appointment of his successor, a short time
                    previous to his death, he observes, that “the true way for a sovereign to
                    perform his essential<pb break="no" facs="nls:193354205"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-4205-0554"/> duty towards heaven and the memory of his
                    ancestors, is to procure for his people peace and plenty; to make his own
                    happiness consist in the happiness of the people, and his own heart the heart of
                    the whole state ;” and he adds, “although since I have occupied the throne, I
                    cannot say that I have succeeded in changing the bad customs, and reforming the
                    morals of my people; although I may not have been fortunate enough to give
                    plenty to every family, or the necessaries of life to every individual; yet I
                    may venture to assert, that during my long reign I have had no other view than
                    to procure for the empire a solid peace, and to render all my people satisfied
                    in their respectiveconditions. During my whole reign 1 have caused the death of
                    no one without a sufficient reason. 1 have never ventured upon any useless
                    expense to be defrayed from the public treasury; it is the blood of the people.
                    I have drawn nothing from it that was not necessary for the subsistence of the
                    army, and for relieving the calamities of famine,” &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The ancient and established maxims of filial piety, form, however, the grand
                    basis of the Chinese government. Every son is supposed to hold the same relation
                    to his father that the people do to the sovereign; and the same unnatural and
                    unwarrantable power which is given to the father over his children could not
                    consistently be withheld from the emperor. No wickedness or unnatural treatment
                    can, on the part of the parent, relieve a son fropι his duties. The merit of
                    every good action performed by the son is ascribed to the education given to him
                    by the father, but the son bears his own disgrace. In like manner, the sovereign
                    receives the whole merit of the country’s prosperity, but his ministers incur
                    the disgrace of all its misfortunes. To be consistent in thus placing the young
                    and vigorous at the mercy of the old and feeble, the emperor affects to pay the
                    same homage and obedience to his mother that are due from children towards their
                    parents. The effect of this state morality, destructive of all real sentiment,
                    is that of rendering every man a slave to some other, and establishing a system
                    of tyranny, which descends in an uninterrupted chain from the emperor down to
                    the meanest peasant. But this is not the worst: every man distrusts his
                    neighbour; because every man is known to assume a character that does not belong
                    to him, and constantly to act the hypocrite in public.</p>
                <p>The jealousy and suspicion which prevails, from the sovereign on the throne to
                    the lowest of the magistrates, evince how little they trust to the fine maxims
                    of morality, by which, it is pretended, the throne is supported and the
                    happiness of the people secured. No magistrate, for instance, can hold an
                    employment in a district where he has relations; he cannot marry in that
                    district; he cannot purchase lands in it: if his father or his mother should
                    die, he must immediately resign his employment, to fulfil the duties which a son
                    owes to his parents, and which cease not with life; and, at all events, he is
                    removed at the end of three years. No two relations within the fourth degree can
                    sit together at the same board. In each of the six boards which sit in Pekin
                    there is a censor, who has no deliberative voice, but listens to their
                    discussions, makes his remarks, and, like our speaker in the House of Commons,
                    keeps them in order, refers to precedents, and the like. He is supposed to be
                    the confidential servant of the sovereign, whom he informs of what is going on,
                    and what are the sentiments of the several members. These six censors may be
                    considered as imperial spies, and they form an extraordinary board called <hi
                    rend="italic">Toodche-yuen</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> whose chief
                    business is that of dispatching their visitors or sub-censors to all parts of
                    the empire, to examine into and report upon tl∣e gonducf of the several
                    officers, and to discover who-th^ţ+'ny and what abuses are alleged against them;
                    and, to complete the system of espionage, persons are invited to send up
                    informations against the officers of government, all of which are registered in
                    this extraordinary tribunal.</p>
                <p>In this precarious situation, a magistrate may consider himself fortunate if he
                    escapes the shafts of private malice, or retires from office without having
                    incurred disgrace, or some more serious punishment, for the commission of some
                    fault, or the dereliction of some duty; for, where the offices of state are open
                    to the lowest of the people, when possessed of the requisite qualificatioŋs, the
                    candidates for employment become so numerous, that every trifling fault is laid
                    hold of to create a vacancy; and these frequent removals and degradations fall
                    in precisely with the system of the government, which is to break down all
                    connection between the officers and the people, and to turn the respect and
                    veneration of the latter exclusively to thesovereign. On the same principle, it
                    is supposed that the extortions and malversations of officers high in the
                    government are frequently winked at, until, at a proper season, the hand of
                    power lays hold of the treasure corruptly obtained, and gets rid, in a legal
                    manner, of the whole family of the delinquent. It is true, a magistrate in China
                    is tried by his brother magistrates; but when the sovereign is the accuser, as
                    is generally the case where an officer of state is the accused, the result is
                    pretty certain. The favourite and principal adviser of the late Kien-lung was
                    brought to trial by the present emperor, Kia-king, on charges of the most
                    frivolous nature, as that of having walked through the middle gate, which is
                    alone reserved for the emperor, having a pearl in his possession larger than any
                    belonging to the imperial family, &amp;c.; but the object was answered; he was
                    condemned to death, his whole property, which was immense, confiscated, and all
                    his relations dismissed from their employments, and banished into Tartary. We
                    may form a tolerably correct opinion of the manner in which the criminal courts
                    administer justice in cases wherein the emperor is personally concerned, from
                    the trials that took place in consequence of the attempt that was not long ago
                    made to assassinate Kia king. He announces to the public a revolt, takes blame
                    to himself, abuses his ministers for their negligence, to which he ascribes his
                    misfortune, and ends his proclamation in a strain of self-reproach and great
                    hypocritical humility. As the greater part of the handful of rebels who
                    attempted to storm the palace were killed in the act, and the rest that were
                    taken put to death, some by beheading, others by a slow and lingering process,
                    some hacked and mutilated in the public market-place, and others “cut into ten
                    thousand pieces,” it might be supposed that here the business ended. No such
                    thing. The emperor, in his proclamation, denounces a particular sect, which once
                    caused a revolt in four provinces, that took eight years to subdue; hence the
                    country magistrates, to make amends for the carelessness of the ministers,
                    persecuted all sects, and, among others, the Christians. One of the magistrates
                    had the courage to send to the capital a spirited remonstrance, in which he
                    stated that many innocent persons had been brought to trial, tortured, and
                    suffered death; that numbers were unjustly confined, or passed from court to
                    court, after being put to the torture under pretence of preparation for trial;
                    and that they were finally liberated, without trial, after their health was
                    destroyed and their property wasted. The whole document exhibits a melancholy
                    picture of abuses in the administration of the criminal jurisprudence of this
                    supposed virtuous and humane nation.</p>
                <p>The administration of the government is conducted by six departments, to each of
                    which there is a president and a certain number of members, forming so many
                    boards, similar to those of our admiralty and treasury boards; and the six
                    presidents form a distinct board of themselves, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193354218" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4218-0555"/>which, with certain princes
                    of the blood, may be called the extraordinary council of the state. Each board
                    sends out its appropriate officers to every part of the empire, with and from
                    whom it has to correspond and receive reports; abstracts of which, and of all
                    its proceedings, are daily laid before the emperor by one of the <hi
                    rend="italic">co-laos</hi> or presidents, whom he generally selects as his
                    favourite and confidential minister and adviser. The respective duties of these
                    boards arc so interwoven with the laws of the empire, that a brief view of the
                    laws will best explain the nature of the executive governments. (Grozier and Du
                    Halde’s <hi rend="italic">Hist, of China; Hem.</hi><hi rend="italic">sur les

                <p>When Pauw observed that China was governed by the whip and the bamboo, he was not
                    aware of the theoretical application of these instruments, especially the
                    latter, to the whole code of civil and criminal law. The remark was not meant to
                    extend beyond the practical application of these machines to the human body,
                    which, it must be owned, are effectual aids towards the establishment of a
                    strict police, and that they arc freely enough administered in keeping the peace
                    among the lower orders; but their use in this way is by no means so extensive as
                    is generally supposed, and as the letter of the law would seem to imply. This
                    great empire may, notwithstanding, be aptly enough compared to a great school,
                    of which the magistrates are the masters, and the people the scholars. The
                    bamboo is the ferula, and care is taken that the child shall not be spoiled by
                    sparing the rod. The bamboo, however, is not used merely for flogging the
                    people. In the fundamental laws of the empire it forms the scale by which all
                    punishments are supposed to be proportioned to the crimes committed, and which
                    are carefully dealt out by weight and measure; and here also we recognize the
                    work of an ancient people in a rude state of society. In a small family, or a
                    community consisting of a certain number of families, it may just be possible to
                    “adapt the penalties of the laws in a just proportion to the crimes against
                    which they are denounced but the continuance of such a system in an overgrown
                    commonwealth affords no proof of refined or extensive notions of jurisprudence.
                    Punishment, as an example to deter others from the commission of crimes, would
                    seem, indeed, to be less the object of Chinese legislation than that of
                    satisfying the claims of rigid justice; to wipe off a certain degree of crime by
                    the infliction of a proportionate degree of suffering.</p>
                <p>The code of laws called the <hi rend="italic">Leu-lee</hi> has undergone several
                    changes by different dynastics, but the principle of the laws has remained the
                    same. This book is to China what Burns’s <hi rend="italic">Justice</hi> is in
                    England, and is familiar to all who have any pretensions to literature. “The
                    magistrates and the people,” says the Emperor Sun-chee, “look up with awe and
                    submission to the justice of these institutions.” An European will regard them
                    with different feelings. The frequency and the severity of corporal punishments,
                    if literally inflicted, would be shocking and disgusting; but, as Sir G.
                    Staunton has observed, “there are so many grounds of mitigation, so many
                    exceptions in favour of particular classes, and in consideration of peculiar
                    circumstances, that the penal system, in fact, almost entirely abandons that
                    part of its outward and apparent character.” The same observation will apply to
                    the penalty of death, which appears to be affixed to crimes whose enormity are
                    not such as would be deemed worthy of this extreme of punishment in the most
                    sanguinary code of Europe; for if we are to judge from the very small
                    comparative number of criminals that are annually executed, one of two
                    conclusions must necessarily be drawn; either that capital offences are very
                    rare, or that the laws are very lenient.</p>
                <p>Père Amiot says, that in 1784 the list of criminals under sentence of death, and
                    ratified by the emperor, amounted to 1348 persons, which, he observes, was
                    considered to be unusually great. It is about one in 108,000, at which rate not
                    more than 160 would suffer annually in the whole population of Great Britain and
                    Ireland.</p>
                <p>The number of blows to be inflicted with the bamboo may not only be considered as
                    the measure or scale of crimes, but as regulating also the mode or practice of
                    punishment. The letter of the law, severe as it may appear to be in
                    denunciation, is more lenient in execution. Thus, ten blows of nominal
                    punishment are practically reduced to four, and 100 to 40; and, in many cases,
                    these blows are redeemable by fine.</p>
                <p>This bamboo, that makes so conspicuous a figure in the Chinese code, is limited
                    by law to two sizes; the larger 5 feet 8 inches in length, inches broad, and 2
                    inches thick, weighing 2-⅛ pounds; the smaller the same length, 2 inches broad,
                    and 1; thick, weight about l£ pound.</p>
                <p>The cangue, or more properly the <hi rend="italic">hia,</hi> is a wooden collar
                    for the neck, 3 feet long, 2 feet 9 inches broad, weighing, in ordinary cases,
                    33 pounds.</p>
                <p>The iron chain, by which all criminals are confined, is 7 feet long, weighing 6⅛
                    pounds; besides which they use wooden handcuffs and iron fetters.</p>
                <p>Various kinds of torture of the hands, feet, ancles, &amp;c. are made use of to
                    extort evidence or confession; but it is not permitted to put the question by
                    torture to those who belong to any of the eight privileged classes, in
                    consideration of the respect due to their character; nor to those who have
                    attained their seventieth year, in consideration of their advanced age; nor to
                    those who have not exceeded their fifteenth year, out of indulgence to their
                    tender youth; nor, lastly, to those who labour under any permanent disease or
                    infirmity, out of commiseration for their situation and sufferings. The eight
                    privileged orders spring out of, 1. imperial blood and connections; 2. long
                    service; 3. illustrious actions; 4. extraordinary wisdom; 5. great abilities; 6.
                    zeal and assiduity; 7. nobility of the first, second, and third rank; 8. birth;
                    all of which, excepting the first, seventh, and eighth, have not, in fact, any
                    existence. Their chief privilege consists in not being liable to be tried for
                    any offence, without a specification of the crime being laid before the emperor,
                    and his express commands issued for that purpose.</p>
                <p>There are five degrees of punishment.</p>
                <p>The first degree is a moderate correction inflicted with the lesser bamboo, “in
                    order that the transgressor of the law may entertain a sense of shame for his
                    past, and receive a salutary admonition with respect to his future conduct.”
                    This correction extends from ten to fifty blows; the first, in practice, reduced
                    to four by the emperor’s grace; the last never exceeds twenty blows.</p>
                <p>The second class of punishments extends from sixty to a hundred blows, of which
                    from twenty to forty are actually inflicted.</p>
                <p>The third division is that of temporary banishment to any distance not exceeding
                    500 <hi rend="italic">lee</hi> (about 150 miles), “with the view of affording
                    opportunity of repentance and amendment ;” and it extends from one to three
                    years’ banishment.</p>
                <p>The fourth degree of punishment is that of perpetual banishment, which is
                    reserved for the more considerable offences, and extends to the distance of
                    2000, and even 3000 <hi rend="italic">lee,</hi> with 100 blows of the
                    bamboo.</p>
                <p>The fifth and ultimate punishment which the laws ordain is death, either by
                    strangulation or decollation.</p>
                <p>At the head of the code are placed <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> offences of a <hi

                    are stated to be placed at the head of the code, from their being of so heinous
                    a kind, that, when the offence is capital, it is exempted from the benefit of

                <p>Offences committed by officers of government, which, in ordinary cases, are
                    punishable by the bamboo, are commutable for fine or degradation, according to
                    the number of blows to which they are nominally liable. Thus, if publicly
                    offending, instead of sixty blows, they forfeit a year’s salary; and instead of
                    a hundred, lose four degrees of rank, and are removed from their situation. If
                    the offence be of a private nature, the punishment is doubled. The only male
                    descendant of parents or grand-parents, who are aged and infirm men. if his age
                    exceeds seventy, and youths under sixteen, are entitled to the indulgence of
                    commuting the punishment awarded by law. Women, too, may have the sentence of
                    banishment remitted, on payment of a fine; and when convicted of offences
                    punishable with the bamboo, “they are permitted to retain a single upper garment
                    while the punishment is inflicted, except in cases of adultery, when they shall
                    be allowed the lower garment only.”</p>

                    legally excluded from the benefit of general acts of grace and pardon. They are
                    not necessarily redeemable; but, by edict of Kien-lung, may be made so upon

                <p>There is every reason to believe that these pecuniary commutations of banishments
                    bring considerable sums into the treasury.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ta-tsing-leu-lee</hi> embraces an epitome of the whole
                    system of government, and of civil and criminal jurisprudence. Besides the
                    introductory part, which contains a general view of the laws, the code consists
                    of six principal divisions, corresponding with the six supreme boards or
                    departments by which the general administration of the empire is conducted.
                    Thus, the <hi rend="italic">first division</hi> of the code relates to that part
                    of the <hi rend="italic">civil law</hi> which falls under the cognizance of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Lee-pou,</hi> or the department which examines candidates for
                    employment, and nominates to appointments, subject to the approbation of the
                    emperor. This division consists of two chapters; the first defining the duties
                    and regulating the offices of the several magistrates, the rule of hereditary
                    succession, and the penalties attached to malversation. The second book relates
                    chiefly to the conduct of the provincial magistrates. The capital offences
                    classed under this division are, great officers of state presuming to confer
                    appointments by their own authority, and without the sanction of the emperor;
                    undue solicitation of hereditary honours; all cabals and state intrigues among
                    the officers of government; collusion between the provincial magistrates and the
                    officers of the court; addressing the emperor in favour of any great officer of
                    state, which is construed into a treasonable combination, subversive of
                    legitimate government; destroying edicts or seals of office; all of which,
                    however, fall within the class of redeemable punishments, which are not excluded
                    from any general act of grace or pardon.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Υ</hi><hi rend="italic">∖∖</hi><hi rend="italic">e second
                    division</hi> of the code relates to the <hi rend="italic">fiscal laws,</hi>
                    which are placed under the cognizance of the <hi rend="italic">Hoo-pοιι,</hi> or
                    financial department. They are various, and relate, 1. To the enrolment of the
                    people, personal service, levying of taxes, punishment of persons deserting
                    their families, care of the aged and infirm. 2. The law of holding, mortgaging,
                    selling, &amp;c. lands and tenements. 3. Regulations respecting marriages and
                    divorces. 4. Respecting public property, the coinage, the revenue, the public
                    stores. 5. Duties and customs, smuggling, false manifests, &amp;c. 6.</p>
                <p>Private property, the law of usury, of trusts, &amp;c. 7. The regulations
                    concerning sales and markets; monopolizing and fraudulent traders; false
                    weights, measures, and scales; manufactures not conformable to the fixed
                    standard, &amp;c. The section concerning marriages and divorces is brought under
                    this division of the code for no other reason, it would seem, than to regulate
                    the descent and distribution of property. The law allows seven justifiable
                    causes of divorce: 1. Barrenness; 2. lasciviousness; 3. neglect of her husband’s
                    parents; 4. talkativeness; 5. thievish propensities; 6. envious and jealous
                    temper; 7. inveterate infirmity. But, in spite of any or all these causes, a
                    wife cannot be divorced if she can plead any of the three cases: 1. having
                    mourned three years for her husband’s parents; 2. her husband having become rich
                    since the time of her marriage; 3. the wife having no parents living to receive
                    her.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Le-pou,</hi> or board of rites and ceremonies, takes
                    cognizance of all offences committed under the <hi rend="italic">third
                    division</hi> of the code, which is subdivided into two sections, and relates,
                    1. To the <hi rend="italic">sacred rites</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the
                    administration of the prescribed ritual; the care of altars; sacred terraces,
                    and the tombs; unlicensed forms of worship; magicians; leaders of sects; and
                    teachers of false doctrines. 2. To miscellaneous observances respecting the
                    palaces, the emperor, his equipage, and furniture; to the public festivals and
                    days of ceremony; sumptuary laws relative to dress and habitations; celestial
                    observations and appearances; regulations for funerals and country
                    festivals.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">fourth division</hi> contains the laws by which the
                    military are governed, the direction and superintendence of which are placed
                    under the department of state called the <hi rend="italic">Ping-pou.</hi> It
                    consists of five sections. The first relates to the protection of the palace,
                    and of course to the person of the emperor; the duties of the imperial guards;
                    examination of passports, &amp;c. The second is entitled the <hi rend="italic"
                    >government of the army,</hi> and may be considered as the mutiny act, or
                    articles of war, of China. Every neglect of duty, disobedience of orders, and
                    want of discipline; fraud, embezzlement, desertion, are punished with extreme
                    severity; and many of the offences herein specified are capital. The third
                    section relates to the <hi rend="italic">protection of the frontier,</hi> a most
                    important consideration with this suspicious government; the fourth prescribes
                    regulations respecting the horses and cattle belonging to the army; the fifth
                    for the expresses and government posts, the post-horses, messengers, and horses
                    employed in the conveyance of dispatches.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">fifth division</hi> contains the code of criminal law
                    administered by the <hi rend="italic">Hing-pou</hi> or criminal tribunal, which
                    supplies the judges or assessors to all the other departments. It consists of
                    eleven sections. The first, entitled <hi rend="italic">robbery and theft,</hi>
                    awards punishments for every species of robbery or theft that could well be
                    devised; extorting property by threats; obtaining it under false pretences;
                    kidnapping and selling free persons as slaves; disturbing graves, &amp;c. The
                    second relates to <hi rend="italic">homicide,</hi> and may be considered as a
                    most singular, if not successful, attempt to discriminate the exact proportion
                    of guilt, for the same offence, in different persons, or different degrees of
                    offence in the same person, according to the situation and circumstances of the
                    offending parties. In every case of preconcerted homicide, the original
                    contriver is condemned to die by decapitation, the accessaries by strangulation;
                    accessaries to the intention, but not to the fact, are punishable with one
                    hundred blows and perpetual banishment. Those who murder, with intent to rob,
                    are beheaded, without distinction between principals and accessaries. Parricide
                    subjects all parties to suffer death by a slow and painful execution; the
                    attempt to commit parricide is death by decapitation. Slaves attempting to
                    murder, or actually murdering their masters, are liable to the same punishment.
                    A husband may kill his wife if caught in the act of adultery, and also her
                    paramour; and a thief may be put to death if taken in the act of robbing a
                    house; but, in either case, it would be murder if put to death after being
                    seized. The preparing of poisons, and rearing of venomous animals, are capital
                    offences. Practitioners of physic, or barbers (for they have no surgeons), who
                    puncture with the needle, giving drugs, or performing operations contrary to the
                    established rules and practice, and thereby killing the patient, are guilty of
                    homicide; but, if proved to have been merely an error in judgment, the offence
                    is redeemable by fine, but the doctor and the barber must quit their professions
                    for ever; if the medicines, however, were given intentionally to kill or injure
                    the patient, the practitioner must suffer death by decapitation. All persons
                    guilty of killing in an affray, though without any express or implied design to
                    kill, whether the blowbe given with the hand or the foot, with a metal weapon or
                    instrument of any kind, shall suffer death by strangulation. There is a clause,
                    however, by which any person killing another in play, by error, or purely by
                    accident, may be permitted to redeem himself from the punishment of killing or
                    wounding in an affray, by the payment of a fine to the family of the deceased
                    person; but the case of <hi rend="italic">pure accident</hi> is very carefully
                    defined and exemplified. It must be one “of which no sufficient previous warning
                    could be given, either directly, by the perception of sight and hearing, or
                    indirectly, by the inferences drawn from judgment and reflection.”</p>
                <p>In the third section, entitled “quarrelling and fighting,” there is a minute and
                    circumstantial detail of blows given under every conceivable case and situation,
                    and in every possible relation in which the parties could stand towards each
                    other. It fixes the periods of responsibility for the consequences of a wound;
                    it awards the penalty of death on a slave who shall strike his master; on a son
                    who shall strike his father or mother; on a grandson who shall strike his
                    paternal grandfather or grandmother; on a wife who shall strike her husband’s
                    father, mother, paternal grandfather or grandmother; but if a father, mother,
                    paternal grandfather, or grandmother, shall chastise a disobedient child or
                    grandchild in a severe and uncustomary manner, so that he or she dies, the party
                    so offending shall be punished only with one hundred blows, which, in reality,
                    are no more than forty; and when any of the aforesaid relations are guilty of
                    killing such disobedient child or grandchild designedly, the punishment shall be
                    extended to sixty blows and one year’s banishment. A parent may, at any time,
                    sell his children, with the exception only to strolling players and professors
                    of the magic art. This distinction which the law makes between the parent and
                    child, and the almost unlimited authority which is given to the former over the
                    latter, would lead one to conclude, that, if the crime of infanticide be not
                    sanctioned, it is at least connived at, by the government. There is every
                    reason, however, to believe that the extent of it has been grossly exaggerated,
                    and that the greater part of infants taken up in the streets of large cities by
                    the police have died in the birth, and been laid out to avoid the expense of
                    burial; or been exposed alive, with the view of their being taken care of as
                    adopted children, or conveyed to hospitals for the reception of deserted
                    children.</p>
                <p>In the cases above stated, the child murdered is supposed to have been <hi
                    rend="italic">disobedient,</hi> which is a crime of the deepest dye, as
                    affecting the principle on which the whole system of government is founded; but,
                    from section 294, it is evident that killing a son, grandson, or slave, under
                    any circumstances, with the aggravation of imputing his death to an innocent
                    person, is not a capital offence. “Whoever is guilty of killing his son, his
                    grandson, or his slave, and attributing the crime to another person, shall be
                    punished with seventy blows, and one and a half year’s banishment.” But “a child
                    or grandchild who is guilty of addressing <hi rend="italic">abusive
                    language</hi> to his or her father or mother, paternal grandfather or
                    grandmother; a wife who is guilty of addressing abusive language to her
                    husband’s father or mother, paternal grandfather or grandmother, shall, in every
                    case, suffer death, by being strangled.” They must, however, themselves
                    complain, and themselves have heard the abusive language. In like manner, a
                    slave is liable to capital punishment for addressing abusive language to his
                    master.</p>
                <p>The fifth book relates to indictments and informations of all kinds; the sixth to
                    cases of bribery and corruption, and seems to contain provisions against bribery
                    in almost every shape which it can be supposed to assume. It is not easy,
                    however, to reconcile these apparent appropriate provisions with that systematic
                    corruption which, under the less odious name of presents, is prevalent in every
                    department of the administration of public affairs and public justice in China.
                    There is a scale of punishment for the value of the bribe received, from one
                    ounce of silver to 120 and upwards; the first entailing sixty blows, the last
                    death by strangulation, when the object is in itself lawful; but, if unlawful,
                    an ounce of silver incurs seventy blows; and eighty ounces and upwards, death by
                    strangulation. That they all take bribes is well known; yet it <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193354257" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4257-0558"/>appears by a note in the
                    original <hi rend="italic">(Leu-lee),</hi> that, in the thirty-third year of
                    Kien-lung, a governor of a city in the province of the capital was tried, and
                    sentenced to suffer death, for taking a bribe of 7000 ounces of silver to stop
                    proceedings in a ease of disorderly conduct and contempt of court; though,
                    finding himself unable to accomplish the object, he had returned the money. In
                    like manner, there are so many provisions against extortions and corrupt
                    practices on the part of great officers of state and their families, that it
                    might be supposed no such practices could exist. The last section of this book
                    is curious, as affording a proof of the care with which the imperial prerogative
                    is fenced round. “All military officers of government, whether stationed at
                    court or in the provinces, are prohibited from receiving presents of gold,
                    silver, silk-stuff's, clothes, wages, or board-wages, from individuals in any of
                    the three principal ranks of hereditary nobility” (mostly related to the royal
                    family and other Tartar chieftains). Any breach of this law deprives them of
                    their rank and employment, and renders them, moreover, liable to the punishment
                    of one hundred blows, and remote perpetual banishment. The second offence of
                    this kind is capital.</p>
                <p>The seventh book awards punishment for frauds and forgeries, falsification of the
                    imperial seal or imperial almanac, counterfeiting the current coin of the realm,
                    seducing persons to transgress the laws, &amp;c. The eighth is entitled incest
                    and adultery. Criminal intercourse with an unmarried woman, though by mutual
                    consent, is punishable with seventy blows; with a married woman eighty blows;
                    deliberate intrigue with either, with one hundred blows; a rape with death by
                    strangulation; and criminal intercourse with a girl under twelve years of age is
                    punishable as a rape. Adultery with the wife of any civil or military officer is
                    death; but civil or military officers committing adultery with the wife of a
                    private individual is degradation, one hundred blows, and wearing the cangue for
                    a month. In all ordinary cases of adultery among the people, the punishment is
                    one hundred blows, and the cangue for a month. An unnatural crime forcibly
                    committed, or committed on boys, is punishable as a rape; but by mutual consent
                    the parties are punishable only with one hundred blows, and the cangue for a
                    month, In all cases of criminal intercourse, the law is more severe towards the
                    woman than the man, and towards slaves than freemen. “All civil or military
                    officers of government, and the sons of those who possess hereditary rank, who
                    shall frequent the company of prostitutes and actresses, shall be punished with
                    sixty blows which is, in fact, no punishment at all, as the blows, in reality,
                    are reduced to twenty, and redeemable for a mere nominal sum, not exceeding two
                    or three shillings.</p>
                <p>The ninth book is entitled miscellaneous offences, among which is that of
                    gaming·, any person convicted of which is punishable with eighty blows. Yet in
                    every street and corner, and in the very temples, the lowest of the people may
                    be seen daily, and every hour of the day, playing at cards, dice, or a sort of
                    game resembling chess. Accidental incendiaries are flogged and fined, according
                    to the consequences of the fire they have occasioned; and wilful incendiaries
                    are punished with death, provided it be proved that the fire was occasioned with
                    a view of plunder. Stage-players and musicians are prohibited from representing
                    emperors, empresses, famous princes, ministers, and generals of former ages, on
                    pain of receiving one hundred blows for every breach of this law. Yet, as these
                    are the favourite and most usual exhibitions, it may be presumed that this law
                    is obsolete. There is, indeed, a saving clause, which says that, “by this law,
                    it is not intended to prohibit the exhibition on the stage of fictitious
                    characters of just and upright men, of chaste wives, and pious and obedient
                    children; all which may tend to dispose the minds of the spectators to the
                    practice of virtue.”</p>
                <p>The tenth and eleventh sections contain regulations with regard to arrests and
                    escapes, imprisonment, judgment, and execution.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sixth</hi> and <hi rend="italic">last division</hi>
                    contains the laws and regulations respecting the public works, which are placed
                    under the superintendence of the department of state called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cong-poo,</hi> or board of public works. It has only two sections;
                    the first relating to public buildings, and the second to the public roads. From
                    the first it appears, that this board has also the superintendence of the public
                    manufactures of the state, such as military weapons, silks, stuffs, porcelain,
                    &amp;c.; and that if any private individual be convicted of manufacturing for
                    sale, silks, satins, gauzes, or other stuffs of this nature, according to the
                    prohibited pattern of the <hi rend="italic">lung</hi> (dragon), or the <hi
                    rend="italic">fung-whang</hi> (phoenix), he shall incur the penalty of one
                    hundred blows, and the goods so manufactured be forfeited to the state. This
                    book, and the next, concerning the keeping in repair of the public roads,
                    embankments, and bridges, contain a number of regulations and petty penalties
                    for neglect and malversation, that are beneath the dignity of legislation, and
                    fitted rather for the subjects of deliberation in a parish vestry. Indeed, the
                    whole body of Chinese law, civil and criminal, consists of such minute meddling
                    with all the common concerns of life as to be utterly unfit for any practical
                    application, except to such mere machines as the Chinese are, for whom it seems
                    to be admirably suited to answer the intended purpose. Nothing can more clearly
                    exhibit this great multitude of human beings as an inert and sluggish mass,
                    without a heart, and without one single idea of the liberty and independence of
                    the human mind, than the minute and paltry regulations under which it has
                    voluntarily submitted to be bound and shackled for so many thousand years.</p>
                <p>After all, there is reason to suspect that this minute measuring out of
                    punishments by a scale, in order to adapt them to their respective degrees of
                    criminality, is pregnant with the most gross injustice; and that, where so much
                    pains are ostentatiously displayed to deal out justice by weight and measure,
                    there is so much less of it in the execution. Many examples might be cited in
                    confirmation of this opinion, but a few will suffice. In the eleventh volume of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Chinese Memoirs,</hi> Père Amiot gives a curious account
                    of a master mason that died by an accidental blow of the bamboo, while under a
                    flogging by order of an officer of the household of a prince of the blood, whose
                    house he was rebuilding in Pekin. As culpable homicide is death by the law of
                    China, the officer bribed one of the mason’s labourers, for ten ounces of
                    silver, and the promise of a respite, to take the blame on himself, as the
                    consequence of a quarrel; and, for three ounces of silver, two or three of the
                    labourers were to give evidence to that effect. The man was tried, and condemned
                    to suffer death on the day of general execution in autumn. On the morning of
                    that day, or the evening preceding, it is the custom, it seems, to bring up all
                    the prisoners under sentence of death to be interrogated by the <hi
                    rend="italic">co-laos,</hi> or principal ministers of the crown; and, on this
                    occasion, the heart of the bricklayer’s labourer failing him, he discovered the
                    whole transaction. The offending officer was immediately tried; and, coupling
                    his original offence with the aggravated one of exposing an innocent person to
                    suffer death, was sentenced to die by a slow and painful execution. Nor was this
                    all; the judges and assessors of the court, who had originally tried the
                    offence, were each degraded one rank, and mulcted of their salary and
                    emoluments. This is given by Père Amiot as an instance of Chinese justice; <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193354270" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4270-0559"/> but it tells as
                    strongly the other way; for, if such gross iniquity, committed in open day, and
                    in the presence of a multitude, was thus connived at at the very fountain-head,
                    what may not be expected at a distance, where the stream is still more muddy?
                    That government can have no high notions of justice or morality which winks at,
                    and sometimes encourages a criminal to find a substitute, even when the
                    punishment is death. Many of the servants of the East India Company can testify,
                    from their own personal knowledge, to the truth of the severe remark of Pauw—
                    “Le juge veut faire one execution, et il lui faut un patient; or il prend celui
                    qui se présente.” In the case of an English seaman, tried for the murder of a
                    Chinese, when they failed in their endeavours to procure a black slave, or a
                    criminal of Macao, or a sick person on the point of death, to execute,—not to
                    satisfy justice, for it was an accidental death in a scuffle, but to satisfy the
                    criminal court of Pekin, to which they had unluckily for themselves appealed;
                    they had recourse to one of the meanest and most paltry expedients that ever
                    disgraced a civilized government. “All the proceedings,” says Sir G. Staunton,
                    “were founded on a story fabricated for the purpose; a story in which the
                    Europeans did not concur, though asserted to have done so; which, in fact, the
                    Chinese magistrates themselves, or the merchants under their influence,
                    invented; which the Chinese witnesses, knowing to be false, adopted; and which,
                    lastly, the sovereign himself appears to have acquiesced in without
                    examination.” Under such a government, the laws are either a dead letter, or may
                    be so perverted that, under their sanction, the innocent may be made to suffer,
                    and the guilty escape punishment.</p>
                <p>In addition to all this, that horrible system of visiting the crimes of the
                    guilty upon the heads of the innocent, which pervades all the despotic
                    governments of the East, is also practised in China, in all cases of rebellion
                    and treason; though it is not carried so far as among the Hindus, who, not
                    content with cutting off a whole family, swept away whole towns and villages in
                    which treason had appeared, as a terrible example to prevent other villages from
                    harbouring traitors. Such are the dreadful effects of despotism, and the
                    miseries inflicted on innocent families, where the people have no voice in the
                    government; such a government is always more ready to punish than to protect.

                <p>The condemned criminals for ordinary offences are kept in prison till autumn,
                    when they are all executed in every part of the empire on a particular day. In
                    general, the prisons are described as spacious, neat, and clean. Navarette, who
                    was himself confined in one of them, says that they have large airy courts for
                    the prisoners in the daytime; that overseers are always present to quell any
                    noise or disturbance; and that they contain temples for the priests to resort
                    to. The priests, he says, make a harvest in the prisons, as those whose trials
                    were pending were constantly consulting the priests as to the issue, and they
                    became the more religious, the nearer the day of trial approached. Criminals are
                    kept in chains, and always apart; so are the women kept separate from the men;
                    and the missionary observed so little gallantry on the part of the men, that
                    though there were gratings in the doors of the women’s cells, the Chinese never
                    once visited them. A very different picture, however, is given of the state of
                    the prisons, and the prostitution of the females confined in them, in the
                    province of Canton, from better authority than Navarette,—an official report to
                    the emperor on the state of the prisons. The scenes of depravity therein
                    exhibited are horrible beyond description. ’ <hi rend="italic">(MS.

                <p>The durability of a system so arbitrary, and an administration so corrupt, is not
                    a little owing to the incessant and indefatigable vigilance of the police; to
                    the absence of all political meetings or societies, and of all discussions
                    respecting public measures; to the gradation of obedience throughout every class
                    of society, inculcated by preeept, by example, and by the bamboo; and certainly
                    not a little to that spirit of national industry, which is the grand preserver
                    of national tranquillity.</p>
                <p>It is utterly impossible, from any document that has appeared of an authentic
                    nature, to form any estimation of the amount and value of the revenue. From an
                    extract of the <hi rend="italic">Y-tung-tche</hi> (Encyclopaedia), translated by
                    Dr Morrison, it appears that the annual value of the imports amounts to about
                    36,000,000 leang (of 6s. 8d. each), or L.12,000,000 sterling; but whether this
                    is exclusive of the taxes paid in kind to the public granaries and magazines, or
                    whether these are included in that sum, it is not stated; but as the value of
                    money is only about one fourth part of its value in England, fifty millions of
                    money, in an economical government like this, where the officers and magistrates
                    are so shamefully paid that they could not live without robbing the people, may
                    be considered as an ample revenue for all the necessities of the state. The
                    largest sum arises from an impost of about one tenth on the estimated produce of
                    the land; a duty on salt yields about one fourth of the land-tax; and the
                    customs and minor taxes make up a sum altogether about equal to that of the
                    salt-tax. Besides, grain, silks, cottons, and various manufactutes, are paid in
                    kind into the imperial magazines, and are distributed as clothing to the troops,
                    and in part payment to the magistrates, and also as presents to those
                    distinguished by imperial favour, and to foreign ambassadors. A forced loan,
                    never to be rcpaid, and a capitation-tax, the most unjust of all taxes, because
                    the most unequal, are the odious resources to which the Chinese government is
                    occasionally compelled to have recourse. The immense treasures supposed to have
                    been amassed in Tartary by the reigning dynasty exist only in the imagination of
                    the Chinese.</p>
                <p>Religion, as a system of divine worship, as piety towards God, and as holding
                    forth future rewards and punishments, can hardly be said to exist among the
                    people. It is here, at least, neither a bond of union nor a source of
                    dissension. They have no sabbatical institution, no congregational worship; no
                    external forms of devotion, of petition, or thanksgiving, to the Supreme Being;
                    the emperor,— and he alone, being high priest, and the only individual who
                    stands between Heaven and the people, having the same relation to the former
                    that the latter are supposed to bear to him,—performs the sacred duties,
                    according to the ancient ritual, and at certain fixed periods; but the people
                    have no concern with them. The emperor alone officiates at all the solemn
                    ceremonies, for propitiating Heaven, or expressing a grateful sense of its
                    benefits; and as “sacrifices and oblations can only be acceptable to Heaven when
                    offered up with humble reverence, and a pure and upright heart,” he prepares
                    himself for such occasions by fasting and abstinence, and acts of benevolence
                    and mercy to his subjects.</p>
                <p>The equinoxes are the periods when the grand sacrifices in the temple dedicated
                    to Heaven, within the precincts of the palace, are offered up; when every kind
                    of business in the capital, all feasts, amusements, marriages, funerals, must be
                    suspended during the ceremony, the moment of which is announced to the people by
                    the tolling of the great bell in Pekin.</p>
                <p>A ridiculous dispute was carried on with great vehemence between the Jesuits and
                    other sectaries of the Catholic religion, whether the emperor did not offer his

                    />heaven, and whether the Chinese were not atheists, at the head of whom he was
                    the officiating high priest. There is not an expression in their ancient book of
                    rites that warrants such a supposition. The <hi rend="italic">Lex-leee</hi>
                    describes the <hi rend="italic">Tien</hi> as having neither voice, nor smell,
                    nor figure, substance, nor dimensions; it gives him the attributes of
                    omnipotence, omniscience, and ubiquity, and considers him as rewarding the good
                    and punishing the bad; that public calamities are the instruments he employs to
                    excite in the sovereign, and through him in the people, a reformation of morals.
                    The names by which the sovereign power is known in their writings are, <hi

                    the Emperor Kaung-hee, whether the sacrifices were made to the Sovereign Lord of
                    heaven, the author and preserver of all things; whether the ceremonies in the
                    hall dedicated to Confucius were in honour of his memory as a benefactor to his
                    country; and whether the rites observed towards ancestors in the hall dedicated
                    to them, were merely to show respect and gratitude ?— Kaung-hee replied, that
                    they comprehended very well the Chinese religion; but the prayer of <hi
                    rend="italic">Kaung-hee,</hi> before going into battle, and published in the
                    Pekin Gazette, might have satisfied the most scrupulous. “Sovereign Lord of
                    heaven, the Supreme Ruler, receive my homage, and grant protection to the
                    humblest of thy subjects. With respectful confidence, I invoke thy aid in a war
                    which I am compelled to wage. Thou has heaped on me thy favours, and hast
                    distinguished me by thy special protection. A people without number acknowledges
                    my power. I adore in silent devotion thy manifold kindnesses, but know not how
                    to manifest the gratitude which I feel. The desire of my heart is to give to my
                    people, and to let strangers enjoy, the blessings of peace; but the enemy has
                    put an end to this my most cherished hope. Prostrate before thee, I implore thy
                    succour, and, in making this humble oblation, I am animated with the hope of
                    obtaining thy signal favour. My only wish is to procure a lasting peace

                    and universal, created a number of inferior spiritual beings as the harbingers
                    and agents of his will; and these spiritual agents, which the Chinese call <hi
                    rend="italic">Quei-shin,</hi> are invisible attenuated beings, some white and
                    good, the advocates of men, others black and wicked, the punishers of sin; and
                    these “illustrious subjects of the Great Ruler” are supposed to preside over the
                    five seasons of the year, over mountains and rivers, over the hearth and the
                    door of the house, and influence all the concerns of men. To these spirits
                    certain duties are prescribed, and certain oblations offered; the men usually
                    bring wine, the women tea; but these are private ceremonies and heartless
                    duties; the devotion of religion was totally wanting; and in such a state it was
                    not surprising that the doctrines and the practices of the sects of Tao-tse and
                    of Fo should captivate the vulgar, and seduce them to a religion that spoke more
                    strongly to the senses. It would seem, indeed, that the establishment of some
                    popular religion is unavoidable, and that of Fo may, on this ground, be
                    encouraged by the government, though it derives little or no support from it.
                    The ancient religion of China entertained the idea of spiritual beings; but they
                    never clothed them in a corporeal form. In the time of Confucius their temples
                    were without images; their guardian gods and their evil genii were mere
                    imaginary beings, to which they neither gave form nor substance; but when the
                    priests of Fo found their entrance into China, they brought with them all the
                    follies and absurdities of the doctrine of Buddh, and grafted them on the
                    superstitions of the Chinese. They filled their temples with all manner of
                    images, each having its peculiar virtues and peculiar influences, and levied for
                    each a tax on the credulity of the people. In some of these temples are not
                    fewer than three hundred sainted personages,—monstrous figures, as large as, and
                    frequently many times larger than, human beings. Their bells and their beads,
                    and burning of incense and tapers,—their images and their altars,—their singing
                    and processions, were well calculated to seduce the populace, who had no outward
                    forms of any religion. So strong was the resemblance of the interior of a temple
                    of Fo, the dress of the priests, and the ceremonies of devotion, to those of the
                    church of Rome, that one of the Catholic missionaries says, it seemed as if the
                    devil had run a race with the Jesuits to China, and having got the start of
                    them, had contrived these things for their mortification.</p>
                <p>The Tao-tse are of Chinese origin, and sprung up under the very nose of
                    Confucius, 1500 years nearly before Christ. Their tenets resemble those of
                    Epicurus; they pretend to magic and alchemy, to consult oracles, and to deal
                    with demons; and they keep old women, who are regarded as a kind of witches. The
                    priests of Fo came from Upper India into China, by invitation from a weak
                    emperor, between the 60th and 70th year of the Christian era. Their tenets
                    resemble the Pythagorean. They kill no living animal, and cat no animal food,
                    lest they might partake of a relation or friend, whose soul had taken up its
                    abode in the animal; and they believe that the human soul, in its transmigration
                    through an infinity of corporeal existences, becomes purified and perfect, and
                    at length is reunited to the Deity, from whom it originally emanated. They
                    consider the consummation of felicity to consist in the annihilation or total
                    suspension of every faculty of the soul, leaving a void for that of Fo to
                    occupy. Arrived at this stage, the devotee soon dies from exhaustion and want of
                    food; his body is burnt, the ashes·put into eight urns, upon which a tower of
                    nine roofs and eight apartments is built, and an urn placed in each apartment;
                    and this is said to have been the origin of the numerous tall pagodas that
                    appear in every part of China. It is pure Shamanism, which may be traced from
                    the Caspian Sea to Japan; from the Saghalien Oula to the Persian Gulf. The
                    priests profess the most sublime notions of virtue, and many of them are said to
                    practise the most refined piety; prayers, fastings, austere and rigorous
                    punishments for the sins of others; chastity, abstinence, penitence, contempt of
                    bodily suffering, to secure for the indestructible soul a better abode in the
                    circle of its transmigrations.</p>
                <p>Some of the Catholic missionaries, however, have represented the priests of Fo as
                    living in all manner of vice and luxury; but the testimony of unprejudiced
                    travellers is against them, and even several of the Jesuits speak highly in
                    their favour, saying that, in their moral doctrines, there is little to
                    reprehend; that they inculcate benevolence, humility, reciprocal kindness,
                    command over the passions, and tenderness towards the brute part of the
                    creation. But it may be questioned whether the priests of Fo or Tao-tse act upon
                    any fixed principles. Some of them, for instance, refuse to drink wine, others
                    to eat garlic and onions; some practise celibacy, and profess perpetual
                    continence; others have several wives and concubines. It is quite certain that
                    neither of them are much <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354296"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-4296-0561"/>respected by the government. Their protection or
                    persecution depends on the caprice or feeling of the ruling sovereign. At one
                    time we find their temples demolished, the materials employed for the public
                    buildings, the bells and brazen statues melted down into money, and the priest,
                    by an imperial edict, reduced to the rank of the people. One emperor persecutes
                    the Ho-chang of Fo, and encourages the Tao-tse. He drinks the beverage of
                    immortality, and dies soon after; his successor eradicates the Tao-tse for
                    poisoning the sovereign, and sanctions the worship of Fo. At present the number
                    of temples dedicated to Fo, and of the priests attached to them, is
                    incalculable. They not only occur in every city, town, and village, but are
                    erected on a small scale in private houses, in which priests are employed,
                    though not generally, to instruct the children of the family. One emperor
                    observed that there were not fewer than 100,000 priests of Fo, and as many
                    priestesses; and that the wisest policy would be to make them marry and get
                    children for the good of the state; that a religion which imposed restraint on
                    the natural passions given to man was undeserving of any regard. No temple can
                    be built without special permission; and they are always used for state purposes
                    by the officers of government, for foreign ambassadors, &amp;c. in their
                    journeying through the country.</p>
                <p>The Christian missionaries are exposed to the same capricious conduct; caressed
                    at one time, persecuted at another. One emperor gives them money towards
                    building churches, and the same emperor converts these into public granaries and
                    public schools. In the year 1747 five missionaries were beheaded in Fokien, and
                    two Jesuits strangled in the same year in Kiang-nan, all of which was done
                    according to the law, which says that the chief of any sect who seduces the
                    people from their duties, under religious pretences, shall be strangled.</p>
                <p>The people are ready enough to embrace any of these religions; but the emperor
                    and his court, and all the officers and magistrates, adhere to the ancient
                    religion, as laid down by Confucius, though there is an obvious leaning of the
                    present Tartar dynasty towards that of Fo or Buddh, which is that of the Lamas
                    of Thibet. The great temple at Gehol, the summer residence of the Tartar
                    sovereigns now on the throne, is named Poo-ta-la (Buddh-laya), the residence of
                    Buddh; but ostensibly he professes and performs the rites of the ancient
                    religion of China; and, at the appointed times, in the capacity of high priest,
                    testifies his gratitude to heaven by offering up the fruits of the earth, and
                    the flesh of certain animals considered as the most useful, as the horse, the
                    ox, the sheep, the hog, the dog, and the domestic fowl. At such times all labour
                    is suspended, the public offices and courts of justice are shut up, and a
                    general festival prevails throughout the whole empire. The vernal ceremony of
                    the emperor holding the plough, is rarely had recourse to in modern times.</p>
                <p>The magistrates perform their devotions in the temple or hall dedicated to
                    Confucius; and the usual oblation to his memory is that of a hog, as being the
                    most useful animal known. The ceremonies are performed before a tablet placed on
                    a pedestal, on which is written the name of the philosopher; and at the foot of
                    the pedestal a grave is dug to receive the hair and offals of the animal, in
                    order that no part of it may fall to unworthy purposes. To this temple every
                    magistrate, on entering upon his office, goes with his official brethren, and,
                    in their presence, after the usual homage to the emperor, professes himself a
                    grateful adherent of the doctrines of the illustrious master, which ceremony
                    amounts to the taking of the oaths of fidelity and allegiance to the sovereign.
                    Père Intorcetta, in his treatise <hi rend="italic">Du</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cultu</hi><hi rend="italic">Sinensi,</hi> has translated the whole ceremony
                    from a Chinese author. It is very curious, and bears a marked resemblance to the
                    Catholic ceremony of high mass. They burn incense, pour out libations of wine,
                    chant solemn hymns, accompanied with instruments, read aloud a panegyric on his
                    memory, prostrate themselves before the tablet; and then proceed to feast on the
                    oblations, and to drink each of the “cup of felicity.” (Intorcetta <hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Cultu</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sinensi.)</hi></p>
                <p>The common festival of all savage nations is the time of full moon; and the
                    common people of China are still barbarous enough to hold this festival, by
                    keeping up a noise and riot the whole night. But the grand festival in which all
                    China partakes is that of the new year, when families visit each other, exchange
                    mutual compliments and presents, and abstain from all labour for several days.
                    Every Chinese, however poor, contrives at this time to treat himself and his
                    family with new dresses. His house is newly painted; and tablets of paper,
                    variously shaped, adorn the walls of his apartments. On new-year’s day every
                    Chinese strictly watches his own conduct, and every thing that befals him, being
                    persuaded that whatever be does on that day will influence his conduct during
                    the whole year. An universal holiday prevails; all labour is suspended; and
                    nothing but feasting, rejoicing, music, and firing of crackers, prevail, from
                    the midnight preceding the first day of their new year to the ninth day
                    following. During this period all is joy and festivity; yet, in this general
                    scene of mirth and conviviality, to the credit of the Chinese it ought to be
                    noticed, that instances of intemperance or inebriety rarely occur.</p>
                <p>The festival of the new year is followed by another of a similar kind, which is
                    called the festival of the lanterns. It commences two days before, and continues
                    two days after, the first full moon of the new year. All China is then in a
                    blaze. Every house and every village, all the shipping on the canals and rivers,
                    every Chinese, however poor, contrives to light up his painted lantern on these
                    days. Transparencies in the shapes of birds, beasts, fishes, and all kinds of
                    animals, are seen darting through the air, and contending with each other; some
                    with squibs in their mouths, breathing fire, and others with crackers in their
                    tails; some sending out sky-rockets, and others rising into pyramids of
                    party-coloured fire; and others again bursting like a mine with violent
                    explosions. A Chinese knows not why, nor makes any inquiries wherefore these
                    things are; it is an ancient custom, and that is enough for him. The
                    inscriptions on these lanterns would seem to point out its religious origin. The
                    most common runs thus, <hi rend="italic">Tien-tee, San-Sheai, Vandin,
                    Chin-tsai,</hi> “Oh, heaven, earth, the three limits, and thousand
                    intelligences, hail!” (Barrow’s <hi rend="italic">Travels in China;</hi>
                    Macartney’s <hi rend="italic">Journal;</hi> Du Halde and Grozier.)</p>
                <p>The basis, however, of the ancient Chinese religion, and which forms as it were
                    the link that connects, it with the government, is the obedience which children
                    owe to their parents, and the respect which is due from the young to the aged,
                    and from the living to the dead, in the strict observance of which all other
                    virtues are concentrated; for these are not to be considered as moral duties
                    only, but as political and religious ordinances. Every family of condition
                    endeavours to build a temple to the memory of its ancestors; and all persons not
                    lost to every sense of duty and devotion visit the tombs of their parents on a
                    certain day in the spring of the year. Never were institutions more innocent in
                    their intention, more blameless in practice, more amiable in their object, or
                    better calculated to produce beneficial results, by recalling pleasing
                    recollections, subduing the passions, and bringing the mind to that calm and
                    tranquil state to which the memory of departed parents usually disposes it. The
                    love and tenderness of departed parents are among the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193354309" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4309-0562"/>best impressions of the human
                    mind; “Bind them,” says Solomon, “continually about thine heart yet the bigoted
                    Dominicans quarrelled with the Jesuits for allowing their Neophytes to honour
                    the memory of departed relations. They represented it as a crime to pluck away
                    the grass and weeds that might have grown around a parent’s tomb, and to scatter
                    flowers on a relation’s grave; to meet together, and regale themselves with
                    those dainties of which the deceased would have been partaker if alive;
                    fulfilling thus the precept of Confucius, which inculcates the same respect to
                    the dead as if they were living. To support his parents while alive, to bury
                    them decently when dead, to visit their graves at the appointed time, are three
                    indispensable duties of a pious son, by which he proves his gratitude, his
                    sorrow, and his veneration.</p>
                <p>There are few families of which some member, in a series of years, has not risen
                    to rank and fortune. Such a one is particularly careful, in obedience to the
                    precept in the ancient book of rites (Z-ee-Äee), before he builds a palace, to
                    erect a temple to the memory of his ancestors. To this temple, at particular
                    seasons, all the branches of the family repair together, old and young, rich and
                    poor, high and low, the first officer in the state and the day-labourer. Here
                    all distinction for the time is laid aside, save that of age, which is always
                    reverenced; and he over whose head has passed the greatest number of years takes
                    the precedence in making the oblations, and at the subsequent entertainment
                    given at the expense of the more wealthy members of the family. From five to ten
                    thousand persons sometimes meet together on such occasions.</p>
                <p>Whether it be the effect of superstition or of real feeling, or be considered as
                    a religious duty, no people observe so much external attention to the memory of
                    the dead as the Chinese. They even move their coffins from the place in which
                    they have been interred, if the situation be gloomy or the ground swampy.
                    Everywhere in China may coffins be seen exposed on the surface of the ground,
                    because the surviving relation has not been able to fix upon a propitious spot
                    to raise the tomb for its reception. These coffins are generally made of wood
                    sufficiently thick to plank a first-rate man of war. A Chinese usually keeps his
                    coffin by him in the house as a piece of furniture. He contemplates with
                    pleasure the <hi rend="italic">angusta domus</hi> which is to receive his last
                    remains, and he tries it on just as he would try on a new coat. They believe in
                    a future state of rewards and punishments; but their notions on this head are so
                    vague, and mixed up with those of the Buddhists and Brahmins, that it is
                    difficult to say what were the precise tenets of the ancient sages respecting a
                    future state of existence.</p>
                <p>Among the religious superstitions of the Chinese, partly native and partly
                    exotic, may be ranked the almost universal’observance of lucky and unlucky days,
                    which are duly registered in the imperial calendar. No marriages, no funerals,
                    no contracts, in short, nothing of importance, must be undertaken on an unlucky
                    day. Even his imperial majesty must be governed in his movements by the Board of
                    Astronomers. Another universal superstition is the <hi rend="italic">fung-shui,
                    wind</hi> and <hi rend="italic">water,</hi> which relates to the exact line in
                    which the roof of a house must be placed, in order to preserve its own security
                    and its owner’s prosperity. The Chinese conceive that a peculiar virtue resides
                    in the odd numbers: thus they reckon <hi rend="italic">three</hi> powers—heaven,
                    earth, and man; <hi rend="italic">three</hi> lights—the sun, moon, and stars;
                    the <hi rend="italic">three</hi> relations—a prince and his ministers, a father
                    and son, a husband and wife. <hi rend="italic">Fo</hi> has his <hi rend="italic"
                    >three</hi> precious ones, and the <hi rend="italic">Tao-tse</hi> their <hi
                    rend="italic">three</hi> pure ones, in which the Jesuits discovered the Holy
                    Trinity. The temples of these sectaries have <hi rend="italic">three</hi>
                    quadrangular courts, the buildings around which contain the <hi rend="italic"
                    >three</hi> classes of spirits, celestial, terrestrial, and infernal. They
                    reckon <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> ruling powers—the sun, moon, and five
                    planets; <hi rend="italic">nine</hi> is as efficient and mysterious a number as
                    among the Hindus; but <hi rend="italic">Jive</hi> appears to be the number which
                    is supposed to exert the most extensive influence. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >five</hi> great virtues frequently spoken of in the ancient classical books
                    are, <hi rend="italic">charity, justice, good manners, prudence,</hi> and <hi

                <p>It is perhaps impossible for the Chinese themselves to determine what portion of
                    their present mixed religion and superstitious belongs to their ancient
                    institutions, and what has been borrowed from other people. This, however, is
                    not the case with their language. Their speech, and the character in which it is
                    written, have maintained their primitive purity, and may be considered as
                    exclusively their own. This language, more than any thing besides, stamps them
                    as an original people. It has no resemblance whatsoever to any other language,
                    living or dead, ancient or modern. It has neither borrowed nor lent any thing to
                    any other nation or people, now in existence, excepting to those who are
                    unquestionably of Chinese origin. The written character is just now as distinct
                    from any alphabetical arrangement, as it was some thousands of years ago; and
                    the spoken language has not proceeded a single step beyond the original meagre
                    and inflexible monosyllable. Our countrymen have at length fathomed this
                    hitherto mysterious, and, as it was supposed, unattainable language, the
                    acquirement of which had long set at defiance all the talents and industry of
                    foreigners, and was said to employ the whole life-time of the natives: to them
                    it is owing that we are now able to give some intelligible account of it. In
                    fact, those insurmountable difficulties turn out to be altogether visionary. The
                    laudable industry of Dr Marshman and Dr Morrison has supplied us with grammars
                    and dictionaries of this singular language. They have not only placed the
                    treasures within our reach, but given us the key to unlock them, though in an
                    uncouth and unsystematic manner; a defect, however, which has been, in a great
                    measure, remedied by the labours of others. As the subject is almost new in this
                    country, we shall endeavour to give as concise and comprehensive a view of it as
                    our limits will admit, and such as may not only convey a correct notion of the
                    singular nature and construction of the written character, but maybe of some use
                    to those who shall engage in the study of it.</p>
                <p>The philologists of China speak of knotted cords, twisted from the inner bark of
                    trees, being made use of originally to register events; but as this period is
                    carried back to the fabulous part of their history, it only deserves notice from
                    the remarkable coincidence of a nation having been discovered many thousand
                    years afterwards on a different continent, and the antipodes almost of China,
                    who wcrc actually in the practice of using the same means for the same purpose.
                    The second step towards the formation of a written character, by the invention
                    of the <hi rend="italic">quoa</hi> or diagrams of Fo-he, is perhaps entitled to
                    as little consideration as the knotted cords. As a language they must have been
                    too complicated, and the supposed use of them too refined, for a people in so
                    rude a state as the Chinese represented themselves to have been in the time of
                    that chief. It is generally thought that the written character was first
                    suggested in the reign of Hoang-tee, the third from Fo-he, and that the figures
                    on a tortoise’s back first gave the idea. Dr Morrison says that a person named
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354322" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4322-0563"/> Paou-she, who
                    lived about the year of the world 2900, is considered as the father of letters,
                    and that nine tenths of his characters were hieroglyphic; he means to say, rude
                    representations of the thing signified, which, in point of fact, may be
                    considered as the first attempt of all uncivilized people to express their ideas
                    to the eye. At a later period we find several accounts of alterations and new
                    suggestions in the characters, one making them to imitate the lines of the
                    dragon, another the flowing lines of worms and snakes, a third the prints of
                    birds’ feet, a fourth of leaves, branches, roots, &amp;c.; all of which would
                    appear to be nothing more than so many attempts to reduce the rude figures of
                    objects to a more convenient and systematic form for general utility. Enough
                    still remains on ancient seals, and vases for sacred purposes, to show the
                    original state, or nearly <hi rend="smallcaps">sq,</hi> of the Chinese
                    characters, and to trace the changes that have taken place from the <hi
                    rend="italic">picture</hi> to the present <hi rend="italic">symbol.</hi> These
                    ancient characters are to be met with in numerous Chinese books; and a
                    collection of them is contained in Père Amiot’s <hi rend="italic">Lettre</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Pekin,</hi> from which the following are extracted. They are
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Kou-wen,</hi> and are the most ancient characters
                    that are known.</p>

                    of philology, being obviously the rude representations of the several objects
                    they are meant to express.</p>
                <p>From these rude imitations of objects Chinese writers trace the progressive steps

                <p>The qualities of objects could only be marked down by arbitrary signs or symbols,
                    which, however, when once settled by convention, were equally expressive with
                    the pictorial resemblances of those objects. Many modifications, however, such,
                    for example, as crooked, straight, above, below, great, little, &amp;c. were
                    capable of being expressed to the eye by particular characters, appropriate to
                    their modifications.</p>
                <p><figure>
                    <graphic url="#"/>
                    </figure> one, <figure>

                    </figure> hooked, <figure>
                    <graphic url="#"/>
                    </figure> covered, sheltered, protected, &amp;c.; but symbolical representations
                    of this kind could not be sufficiently numerous to embrace all the qualities and
                    modifications of objects.</p>
                <p>The first attempt at a regular system of classification of the characters which
                    the Chinese had invented for expressing their ideas, is stated to have been that
                    of dividing them into nine classes, called the <hi rend="italic">Lee-shoo,</hi>
                    and afterwards into six, called the <hi rend="italic">Lieou-ye.</hi> 1st Class
                    contained all those which had been reduced from the rude picture of the object
                    to a more simple form; as the sun, moon, a man, a horse.</p>
                <p>2<hi rend="smallcaps">d</hi>, Those which pointed out some property belonging to
                    the object; as great, small, above, below.</p>
                <p>3d, The combination of two or more simple objects or ideas to produce a third,
                    resulting from their union.</p>
                <p>4Z∕z, Those whose names, when sounded, were supposed to imitate the sound of the
                    objects expressed by them.</p>
                <p>5<hi rend="italic">th,</hi> Those which give an inversion of the meaning by
                    inverting the character; and all those used in a metaphorical sense.</p>
                <p>6/7/, This class seems to include all those characters that are merely arbitrary,
                    and which cannot be brought under any of the preceding divisions. We shall
                    explain these classes by examples.</p>
                <p>This ill-digested and obscure arrangement was soon abandoned for another not much
                    better, namely, that of classing the characters according to their sounds or
                    names. As these names were all monosyllables, and as each monosyllable began
                    with a consonant, with very few exceptions, and ended with a vowel or liquid
                    consonant, the number of such monosyllables was necessarily very limited; by our
                    alphabet, the whole of them might be expressed in about 330 syllables; but as
                    necessity taught the Chinese to employ in early life the organs of speech and
                    hearing, in acquiring a greater nicety than most nations have any occasion for,
                    they were able to swell the number of their monosyllables, by means of
                    intonations and accentuations, to about 1200 or 1300. As soon, therefore, as the
                    number of characters exceeded the number of words, it is evident that any <hi
                    rend="italic">verbal</hi> arrangement must be attended with uncertainty and
                    confusion; if, for instance, they had 10,000 characters and only 1250 words, the
                    same word must be applied to eight different characters; and as the latter now,
                    in Kaung-hee’s Dictionary, exceeds 40,000, each syllable in the Chinese language
                    must, on an average, represent thirty-two different characters; and, in point of
                    fact, there are syllables that give the same name to sixty or eighty different
                    characters.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to conceive, therefore, without the assistance of an alphabet,
                    how they could possibly contrive to class the characters in a dictionary
                    according to their <hi rend="italic">names,</hi> and by what means they could
                    ascertain the name of a character which speaks only to the eye. To discover
                    this, they seem to have had recourse to three different methods. The first was
                    to place at the head of a list of characters, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193354335" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4335-0564"/>having the same sounds, some
                    common well-known character, and to mark them severally with their respective
                    intonations. The second method was that which is still used in all their
                    dictionaries. It consists in writing after the character whose sound is sought
                    for, two common characters, of which the initial sound of the first, added to
                    the final sound of the latter, produces a third; as from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> of <hi rend="italic">moo</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> of <hi rend="italic">tsing,</hi> is compounded the third or
                    new monosyllable <hi rend="italic">ming</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, in the
                    same way, from <hi rend="italic">ting</hi> and <hi rend="italic">he</hi> would
                    be formed <hi rend="italic">tc,</hi> &amp;c. The two characters, so employed,
                    are called <hi rend="italic">tse-moo,</hi> or “mother characters,” and the third
                    produced from them <hi rend="italic">tse,</hi> or “the child.” The third method
                    was, by means of a modified Sanscrit alphabet, or series of sounds, which was
                    introduced into China since the Christian era, by some priests of Buddh, “to
                    give currency,” says one writer, “to the books of Fo.” This system is described
                    in the introduction to Kaung-hee’s Dictionary, though it is never used, and but
                    very little understood. The Chinese, indeed, reprobate the idea of changing
                    their beautiful characters for foreign systems, unknown to their forefathers.
                    “It appears to me,” says one of their writers, “that the people of <hi
                    rend="italic">Tsan</hi> (Thibet, from whence they derived the system of initials
                    and finals) distinguish sounds; and with them the stress is laid on the sounds,
                    not on the letters. Chinese distinguish the characters, and lay the stress on
                    the characters, not on the sounds; hence in the language of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tsan</hi> there is an endless variety of sound, with the Chinese there is an
                    endless variety of the character. In <hi rend="italic">Tsan,</hi> the principles
                    of sound excite an admiration, but the letters are destitute of beauty; in
                    China, the characters are capable of ever-varying intelligible modifications,
                    but the sounds arc not possessed of nice and minute distinctions. The people of
                    Tsan prefer the sounds, and what they obtain enters the car; the Chinese prefer
                    the beautiful character, and what they obtain enters the eye.” And the Chinese
                    arc right; for, unless with their character they gave up their monosyllables,
                    they might almost as well have no written language at all; as, if written
                    alphabetically, it would be wholly unintelligible. The written character assists
                    their meagre monosyllables, an alphabet would completely destroy them. The
                    written character, however, has probably been the means of fixing the spoken
                    language in its primitive monosyllabic form, as the least change or inflexion of
                    the spoken language must at once and for ever destroy the connection between it
                    and the written character; and this connection, by the way, is no mean proof of
                    the antiquity of the present symbols. (Pref, to Morrison’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictionary</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> Barrow’s <hi rend="italic">Travels in
                    China.}</hi></p>
                <p>These symbols are now reduced to a regular and complete system, which renders the
                    study of the language comparatively easy. A certain number of characters have
                    been selected, which the Chinese call <hi rend="italic">Tse-poo,</hi>
                    “superintending or directing characters,” and sometimes <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shoo-moo,</hi> or the “eyes of the book,” which, considering them as composing
                    an index to the book, is no bad name. The Jesuits have given them the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">keys,</hi> and sometimes <hi rend="italic">elements</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">radicals,</hi> there being no character in the whole language,
                    into the composition of which some one or other of them does not enter. This
                    number, according to the classification now in general use, consists of two
                    hundred and fourteen, and they are divided into seventeen chapters or classes;
                    beginning with those keys or elements that are composed or formed of <hi
                    rend="italic">one</hi> stroke of the pencil, and ending with those (of which
                    there is only one) composed of seventeen strokes. Plates CLVIII. CLIX. CLX.,
                    comprehend the whole of these keys or elements, with their several names and
                    significations. When these two hundred and fourteen keys or elements have once
                    become familiar to the eye, there is no great difficulty in detecting them in
                    any of the characters into which they may enter, and without some one or more of
                    which no character can be formed. They will be found to stand more frequently on
                    the left side than on any other part of the character, though they also take
                    their stations sometimes on the right, sometimes in the middle, frequently at
                    the top, and occasionally at the bottom; but a little practice and a ready
                    knowledge of these keys will point them out at once. Thus, in</p>
                <p>1.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">peen,</hi> “convenient,” the key, <hi rend="italic">jin,</hi>
                    “man,” is on the left.</p>
                <p>2.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">tsoo,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> to assist,” has the key, <hi
                    rend="italic">lee,</hi> on the right.</p>
                <p>3.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">tseun,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> the whole,” has the key,
                    <hi rend="italic">jοο,</hi> at the top.</p>
                <p>4.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">ping,</hi> “a soldier,” has the key, <hi rend="italic">pa,</hi>
                    at the bottom.</p>
                <p>5.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">gai,</hi> “to love,” has its key, <hi rend="italic">sin,</hi>
                    in the middle of the compound.</p>
                <p>The dictionaries are divided into seventeen sections, headed respectively by the
                    seventeen classes or keys, commencing with that class which has its keys of one
                    stroke, and ending with that which is composed of seventeen strokes. The
                    characters which each key governs, or to which it serves as the index, are also
                    divided into classes, according to the number of strokes they contain, beginning
                    at <hi rend="italic">one,</hi> and proceeding regularly to the greatest number
                    that any one is found to contain, <hi rend="italic">exclusive of the hey</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and this number, together with the key character, being
                    marked at the top of every page in the dictionary, affords a clue by which any
                    character in the language may be turned to immediately, having first ascertained
                    the <hi rend="italic">hey,</hi> and the number of strokes in the remaining part
                    of that character. Thus, in the above examples, the character <hi rend="italic"
                    >peen</hi> will be found under the key <hi rend="italic">jin,</hi> and in the
                    <hi rend="italic">seventh</hi> section, there being <hi rend="italic">seven</hi>
                    strokes exclusive of the key; in the second, under <hi rend="italic">the
                    fifth</hi> section of the index <hi rend="italic">lee</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> the third under <hi rend="italic">the fourth</hi> section of the index
                    <hi rend="italic">jοο</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the fourth under the <hi
                    rend="italic">fifth</hi> section of the key <hi rend="italic">pa;</hi> and the
                    fifth under the <hi rend="italic">ninth</hi> section of the index <hi
                    rend="italic">sin.</hi></p>
                <p>This classification of the characters is extremely simple and easy; the chief
                    object of it would appear indeed to be, like the Linnaean system, that of giving
                    facility to the finding in the dictionary the character that may be wanted. The
                    nature of Chinese symbols admitted, however, of a more beautiful, perfect, and
                    philosophical arrangement, and might, indeed, have been made the most rational
                    and complete system of pasigraphy or universal character that has yet been
                    attempted. It would seem, indeed, that the Chinese had this idea once in view;
                    but, either through ignorance, pride, or caprice, they have entirely marred the
                    plan, and nearly lost sight of it altogether. In the original adoption of the
                    <hi rend="italic">shoo-moo,</hi> or “book’s eyes,” namely, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >poo</hi> or keys, they selected no less than 479 to serve as indices to the
                    characters, the whole of which were marshalled under nine divisions. The <hi
                    rend="italic">first</hi> had a few only, consisting of a single line. The <hi
                    rend="italic">second</hi> embraced celestial objects, as the sky or firmament,
                    the sun, moon, stars, clouds, rain, thunder. The <hi rend="italic">third,</hi>
                    terrestrial objects, as <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354348"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-4348-0565"/>earth, water, metals, hills, rivers; the <hi
                    rend="italic">fourth,</hi> man, and all the animal functions; the <hi
                    rend="italic">fifth,</hi> moving things, including all the rest of the animal
                    creation; the <hi rend="italic">sixth,</hi> the vegetable world; the <hi
                    rend="italic">seventh,</hi> productions of art and human industry; the <hi
                    rend="italic">eighth,</hi> miscellaneous; and the <hi rend="italic">ninth,</hi>
                    characters of a double genus, whose classification could not well be
                    ascertained. Though this was a complicated, and in some degree an arbitrary
                    classification, yet it comprehended a principle which, if it had been adhered to
                    in simplifying the arrangement of the characters, the Chinese might have
                    challenged the world to produce so beautiful and so philosophical a language as
                    their own. This system, called the <hi rend="italic">Leu-shoo,</hi> is that
                    stated by Dr Morrison to have been invented by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paou-she.</hi></p>
                <p>After this the 479 keys or elementary characters were reduced to 214, and the
                    characters themselves arranged under six divisions, as before mentioned, the
                    nature of which will be best explained by a few examples to each; and they will
                    tend to show how much more might have been accomplished in this practical
                    approach to an universal character.</p>
                <p>lst Class. The rude representation of the object may now be considered as no
                    longer existing; but this class consists generally of simple characters, and
                    almost all the great objects of nature are found among the keys or elements
                    which enter into their composition: this may be called the Imitative Class.</p>
                <p>2d Class. Under this class are comprehended those characters which point out the
                    quality or property of an ob ject, as <hi rend="italic">shang,</hi> above.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">shea,</hi> below.</p>
                <p>Thus also <hi rend="italic">ye,</hi> one, is used to represent unity, con cord,
                    and the like; <hi rend="italic">kuan,</hi> straight, upright; <hi rend="italic"
                    >quay,</hi> hooked; and generally characters whose meaning can be extended, in a
                    metaphorical sense, as far as the object represented would admit of being so
                    applied; as, for instance, a line drawn through a square thus,</p>
                <p>, signifies <hi rend="italic">middle,</hi> or any thing divided into two parts;
                    while the same character, in a figurative sense, expresses moral rectitude, good
                    dispositions, and so forth. This class may therefore be called the
                    figurative.</p>
                <p>3d Class. Under this class might have been ranked all those compound characters
                    which, if the numbers were properly selected, would have given that peculiar
                    beauty and expression to the language which, even in its clumsy and imperfect
                    state, the Chinese still pretend to feel, by employing significant characters,
                    each of which should be connected with the idea to be conveyed by their union.
                    One half of the language, at least, might have been thus composed, and might
                    have presented a series of symbols, every one of which would have been
                    intelligible to the eye; whereas not one sixth part at the most, some say not
                    one tenth, of the compounds, have any relation to their component parts. A few
                    examples will serve to show how much might have been done by attending to a
                    philosophical composition of the compounded characters. Thus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >jin,</hi> man, and <hi rend="italic">yen,</hi> word, forms the compound <hi
                    rend="italic">sin,</hi> sincere:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">je,</hi> the sun, and <hi rend="italic">yue,</hi> the moon, <hi
                    rend="italic">ming,</hi> splendour:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">tchung,</hi> middle, and <hi rend="italic">sin,</hi> heart,
                    fidelity:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">jin,</hi> man, and <hi rend="italic">tien,</hi> a field, <hi
                    rend="italic">tien,</hi> a farmer:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">tien,</hi> a field, and <hi rend="italic">lee,</hi> strength,
                    <hi rend="italic">nan,</hi> male kind:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">cul,</hi> the ear, and <hi rend="italic">tchei,</hi> to stop,
                    <hi rend="italic">chee,</hi> shame:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">koo,</hi> mouth, and <hi rend="italic">kin,</hi> gold, <hi
                    rend="italic">kin,</hi> volubili ty of speech:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">yen,</hi> word, and <hi rend="italic">skee,</hi> temple, <hi
                    rend="italic">shee,</hi> verses, poetry:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">fen,</hi> to divide, and <hi rend="italic">pci,</hi> riches,
                    <hi rend="italic">pin,</hi> poverty:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">yu,</hi> an enclo sure, and man, <hi rend="italic">cheu,</hi> a
                    prisoner:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">ho,</hi> rice, and <hi rend="italic">koo,</hi> mouth,
                    comfort:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">ye,</hi> one, and <hi rend="italic">ta,</hi> great, <hi
                    rend="italic">tien,</hi> heaven or God:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">teheou,</hi> a bamboo, and a slap, <hi rend="italic">chee,</hi>
                    to govern:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">keu,</hi> high, and <hi rend="italic">ma,</hi> horse, <hi
                    rend="italic">klιeu,</hi> proud.</p>
                <p>4th Class. The characters arranged under this class are such as embrace both the
                    <hi rend="italic">meaning</hi> of the object and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sound</hi> it is supposed to utter; and it includes objects animate and
                    inanimate. The characters are all compounded of one of the elements to express
                    the genus, added to one imitative of the sound uttered by the object. Thus, <hi
                    rend="italic">shuee,</hi> water, added to <hi rend="italic">koonq,</hi> forms
                    the character <hi rend="italic">kyang,</hi> which denotes a rapid stream,
                    expressive, as they say, of water rushing with violence; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >ho,</hi> a river, with <hi rend="italic">shuee,</hi> water, makes the compound
                    <hi rend="italic">ho,</hi> a river, the name of which is said to imitate the
                    sound. To this class may also be added those objects in the animal kingdom whose
                    generic character <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354361"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-4361-0566"/>can be expressed by one of the elements, and the
                    spccics by some other character that shall convey its name merely by the sound
                    of the latter character. If, for instance, to the generic character, <hi
                    rend="italic">bird,</hi> be added another character whose name and sound is <hi
                    rend="italic">go,</hi> the new compound will also be named <hi rend="italic"
                    >go,</hi> and will signify a goose; if to the same character <hi rend="italic"
                    >bird</hi> be added another named <hi rend="italic">ya,</hi> the compound will
                    be also <hi rend="italic">ya,</hi> and will signify a <hi rend="italic"
                    >duck</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> if to the generic character <hi rend="italic"
                    >tree,</hi> be added the appellative <hi rend="italic">pe,</hi> the compound
                    will be named <hi rend="italic">pe,</hi> and signify a cypress; with <hi
                    rend="italic">tao,</hi> it will be called <hi rend="italic">tao,</hi> and
                    signify a walnut tree; and with <hi rend="italic">Reou</hi> it will retain the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Reou,</hi> and signify a willow. In this class may
                    also be comprehended all foreign names written in the Chinese characters, to
                    which, in order to mark them as destitute of meaning, they usually annex on the
                    left side the character signifying <hi rend="italic">mouth.</hi> Thus the
                    English word <hi rend="italic">strong</hi> would require three characters, <hi
                    rend="italic">se-te-lung,</hi> and, with the <hi rend="italic">mouth</hi>
                    prefixed, would be written thus, <hi rend="italic">se</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >te</hi><hi rend="italic">lung</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but these charac
                    ters, if the <hi rend="italic">mouth</hi> was taken away, would be read by a
                    Chinese, the <hi rend="italic">magistrate procured a dragon.</hi></p>
                <p>5th Class. Consists of an inversion of the sense by an inversion of the whole or
                    some part of the character; or it alters the meaning by giving a different name
                    to the same character; or, lastly, the characters which compose it are used in a
                    figurative or metaphorical sense. An European cannot readily comprehend the
                    illusions or allegories that are frequently contained in a single character,
                    though probably they are not more numerous than those which are found in any of
                    the languages of Europe, rendered easy, and indeed not perceived, by early
                    habit. The combined characters of the sun and moon, which, in a physical sense,
                    expressed brightness, brilliancy <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, splendour, are
                    also, in a moral or metaphorical sense, noble, illustrious, famous. The
                    characters <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> form a
                    third, which signifies <hi rend="italic">forgetfulness</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">fickleness</hi> or <hi rend="italic">levity</hi> is
                    represented by a <hi rend="italic">girl</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >thought</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">attention,</hi> by the
                    <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> and <hi rend="italic">totality; antiquity,</hi> by
                    <hi rend="italic">mouth</hi> and the numeral <hi rend="italic">ten</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">to flatter,</hi> is compounded of <hi
                    rend="italic">word</hi> and <hi rend="italic">to lick</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">to boast,</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">mountain</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">to speak.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">wife of a magistrate</hi>
                    is used metaphorically for <hi rend="italic">an accomplislιed lady,</hi> a <hi
                    rend="italic">wild boar</hi> for <hi rend="italic">courage,</hi> a <hi
                    rend="italic">tiger</hi> for <hi rend="italic">ferocity</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >:</hi> and so of others. It may be observed, however, that these compounds are
                    disregarded by the Chinese in general, just as many words in the European
                    languages are in common use, without any reference to their etymology.</p>
                <p>6th Class. These characters are either arbitrary, or formed out of some distant
                    or local allusion, most of which are inexplicable to the Chinese themselves.
                    Thus, a <hi rend="italic">bamboo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">heaven</hi> form a
                    compound, which signifies <hi rend="italic">to laugh</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">water</hi> and <hi rend="italic">to go,</hi> compose a
                    character signifying <hi rend="italic">law</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">wood</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">sun</hi> form the word <hi
                    rend="italic">east;</hi> the character <hi rend="italic">woman</hi> three times
                    repeated may signify <hi rend="italic">adultery,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >communicating with an enemy.</hi> These may or may not be arbitrary
                    combinations. We can explain why the compound of <hi rend="italic">wine</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">seal</hi> should signify <hi rend="italic">marriage,</hi> from
                    the circumstance of <hi rend="italic">wine</hi> being presented by the
                    bridegroom to the bride as the <hi rend="italic">seal</hi> to the contract; and
                    why that of <hi rend="italic">girl</hi> and <hi rend="italic">upright</hi>
                    should signify <hi rend="italic">concubine,</hi> or inferior wife, because such
                    a one must <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> in the presence of her lord and master;
                    also why that of <hi rend="italic">woman</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >sickness</hi> should signify <hi rend="italic">death,</hi> because when the
                    sovereign was sick, and given over by the physicians, he was left to <hi
                    rend="italic">die</hi> in the hands of <hi rend="italic">women</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but by far the greater part are utterly inexplicable.</p>
                <p>Such, by the Chinese account, is the philosophy of their language; not very
                    clear, it must be confessed, nor exact ly calculated for practical facility;
                    but, at the same time, approximating to a very beautiful system. That system
                    has, to a <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> certain degree, been preserved in the
                    modern classification under the 214 elements. Thus, under the element or key
                    which signifies <hi rend="italic">heart,</hi> we shall find all the characters
                    arranged expressive of the sentiments, passions, and affections of the mind, as
                    grief, joy, love, hatred, anger, and the like. The element <hi rend="italic"
                    >water</hi> enters into all the compounds which relate to the sea, rivers,
                    lakes, swamps,depth, transparency, and so forth. The key or element <hi
                    rend="italic">plant</hi> takes in the whole vegetable kingdom. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Yen,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">word,</hi> enters into the composition of those
                    characters which relate to reading, speaking, studying, debating, consulting,
                    trusting, and the like. The handicraft trades, laborious employments, and a
                    great number of verbs of action, have the element <hi rend="italic">handior</hi>
                    their governing character. All this is perfectly intelligible; but, on casting a
                    glance over the elementary characters, it will be seen that fully one half of
                    them are utterly incapable of being formed into any generic arrangement; and one
                    is surprised and puzzled to conjecture by what accident they could possibly have
                    been included among the elementary characters, or even as indices to characters.
                    The fact is, that, of the 214 characters thus employed, not more than 150 can be
                    considered as effective; the rest being very rarely employed in the combination
                    of characters. Of the 40,000 characters, or thereabouts, contained in the
                    standard dictionary of the language, sixty of the elements govern no less than
                    25,000. The most prolific is the element <hi rend="italic">grass</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">plants</hi> (No. 140), which presides over 1423 characters; the
                    next <hi rend="italic">water</hi> (No. 85), which has 1333; then the <hi
                    rend="italic">hand</hi> (No. 64), which has 1012. After these follow, in
                    succession, the <hi rend="italic">mouth, heart,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >insect,</hi> each having about 900; then a <hi rend="italic">word,</hi> a <hi
                    rend="italic">man,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">metal,</hi> each exceeding 700;
                    next a <hi rend="italic">reed</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bamboo,</hi> a <hi
                    rend="italic">woman, silk,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">bird, flesh, mountain,</hi>
                    and so on, each governing from 500 to 600. In the modern classification,
                    therefore, of the characters, though probably intended as a more convenient
                    instrument for reference in the dictionaries, so much of the natural arrangement
                    has been preserved as will serve to convey to the eye at once the general
                    meaning of a character; at least of such characters as are governed or fall
                    under any of the principal elements. They have even gone beyond this. Feeling
                    how much more capable of nice discrimination the eye is than the car, the
                    written character has been employed to mark distinctions, which, in an
                    alphabetic language, would be impossible. Instead of the modifications of time,
                    place, age, colour, and the like, by which sensible objects are affected, being
                    expressed by so many epithets or additional characters, in the several stages of
                    their existence, or the lights in which they may be viewed, the Chinese employ
                    only one single character for each several modification of which an object or
                    idea may be susceptible, whether in the physical or intellectual world. Thus
                    they have the key or elementary character for <hi rend="italic">water</hi>
                    simply, another under that key for <hi rend="italic">salt</hi> water, a third
                    for <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi> water, a fourth for <hi rend="italic"
                    >muddy</hi> water, a fifth for <hi rend="italic">clear</hi> water, and so on for
                    <hi rend="italic">running, standing, deep, shallow,</hi> and every other
                    qualification that water is capable of receiving; and the same of love, anger,
                    jealousy, ambition, &amp;c. all of which are expressed by their respective
                    symbols, combined with the element <hi rend="italic">heart.</hi></p>
                <p>The colloquial language is not less singular than the symbolical characters,
                    being, like the latter, exclusively their own, and having borrowed nothing from,
                    nor lent anything to, the rest of the world. The 330 monosyllables, each
                    beginning generally with a consonant, and ending with a vowel, or liquid, or the
                    double consonant <hi rend="italic">ng,</hi> which, as we have observed, complete
                    the catalogue of words in their language, are, by means of four modifications of
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354374" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4374-0567"/> sound, or
                    intonation to each syllable, extended to about 1300; beyond which, not one of
                    them is capable of the least degree of inflexion, or change of termination; and
                    the same unchangeable monosyllable acts the part of a noun substantive and
                    adjective, a verb and a participle, according to its collocation in a sentence,
                    or the monosyllables with which it is connected. It is neither affected by
                    number, case, nor gender; mood, tense, nor person; all of which, in speaking,
                    are designated by certain affixes or prefixes to mark the sense. Thus the
                    genitive of <hi rend="italic">love, gai,</hi> is expressed by the particle <hi
                    rend="italic">tie</hi> set after it, as <hi rend="italic">gai-tié,</hi> of love;
                    the dative by <hi rend="italic">eu-gai,</hi> to love; and the ablative by <hi
                    rend="italic">tung-gai,</hi> by or from love. The plural is expressed sometimes
                    by the repetition of the noun, as <hi rend="italic">yin,</hi> a man; <hi
                    rend="italic">gin-yin</hi> men; <hi rend="italic">to-yin,</hi> many men; <hi
                    rend="italic">to-to-yin,</hi> all men. Certain particles of number are also
                    employed before nouns, which vary according to the nature of the noun. Thus <hi
                    rend="italic">man</hi> has <hi rend="italic">ho,</hi> as <hi rend="italic"
                    >san∙ho∙ym,</hi> three men; most other animals <hi rend="italic">tehee,</hi> as
                    <hi rend="italic">hang-tchee-ma,</hi> two horses; bodies with extended surfaces
                    <hi rend="italic">tchiang,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">ge-tchiang-telioa,</hi> one
                    table. The number of particles so employed amount to about thirty. The final
                    expletive <hi rend="italic">tse</hi> is added to nouns, not only to distinguish
                    them from adjectives, but for the sake of euphony; <hi rend="italic"
                    >aspie-tse,</hi> a pipe; <hi rend="italic">faug-tsé,</hi> a house; <hi
                    rend="italic">ga-tse,</hi> a chair; the particle <hi rend="italic">tié,</hi> the
                    same which designates the genitive of the substantive, is set after the
                    adjective or pronoun; as <hi rend="italic">ta,</hi> he, with <hi rend="italic"
                    >tie</hi> after it, becomes a possessive, <hi rend="italic">ta-tie,</hi> his,
                    &amp;c. The gender of nouns is seldom necessary to be expressed in conversation,
                    unless for the sake of removing ambiguity. When this is the case, <hi
                    rend="italic">nan</hi> and <hi rend="italic">neu</hi> distinguish male from
                    female, as <hi rend="italic">nan-gin,</hi> a man; <hi rend="italic">neu-ym,</hi>
                    a woman. Adjectives admit of comparison in various ways. Commonly <hi
                    rend="italic">ye-yang</hi> is used to express the positive, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >ge-yaug-hoa,</hi> as good as, or equally good; the preposition <hi
                    rend="italic">heng</hi> forms the comparative, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >heng-hao,</hi> better; and, with the addition of <hi rend="italic">toa</hi>
                    following it, the superlative, as <hi rend="italic">hao-toa-heng,</hi> the best.
                    A repetition of the positive also marks the superlative, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >hao-hαο,</hi> very good.</p>
                <p>The personal pronouns <hi rend="italic">go,</hi><hi rend="italic">ne, ta,</hi> I,
                    thou, he, are made plurals by the addition of <hi rend="italic">mun,</hi> as <hi
                    rend="italic">go-mun, ne-mun, tu-nrnn,</hi> we, ye, they. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Che-ho,</hi> this, and <hi rend="italic">no-ho,</hi> that, are the
                    demonstratives.</p>
                <p>The only tenses of the verb necessary to be distinguished are the present, past,
                    and future. The past is formed by the particle <hi rend="italic">lean</hi> set
                    after it, and the future by <hi rend="italic">gau,</hi> will or determination,
                    or <hi rend="italic">tchong lai,</hi> time to come. Thus, go <hi rend="italic"
                    >gαi,</hi> I love; <hi rend="italic">gìgai leau,</hi> I have loved, or did love;
                    <hi rend="italic">go yαu gai,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">go tchang lai</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">gai,</hi> I shall hereafter love. The negatives generally in use
                    are <hi rend="italic">mo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">poo</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> as <hi rend="italic">yeu,</hi> to have; <hi rend="italic">mο yeu,</hi>
                    not to have; <hi rend="italic">hao,</hi> good; <hi rend="italic">poo hao,</hi>
                    bad.</p>
                <p>Such is the simple and inartificial language spoken by a mass of people equal in
                    number to that of the whole of Europe. Its imperfection must be obvious when it
                    is considered that 40,000 distinct characters are represented by about 1300
                    monosyllabic sounds; but, as a good composition is intended only to be seen, the
                    particles and expletives necessary in familiar conversation are all omitted. If
                    such writing were read aloud it would scarcely be intelligible, and, at any
                    rate, full of ambiguity. Indeed, it frequently happens, that, in reading a
                    paper, the auditors are assisted by the reader making, with a motion of his hand
                    in the air, or with his fan, the shape of the character, or, at least, the key
                    of it, to remove any ambiguity. This, in conversation, is obviated by the use of
                    certain expletives. For instance, when a man is speaking of his father, which
                    <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">s&gt;foo,</hi> a monosyllable that has
                    seventy or eighty other meanings besides that of father, a Chinese will say <hi
                    rend="italic">fοο-ehin</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, instead of <hi
                    rend="italic">moo</hi> for mother, <hi rend="italic">moo-chin.</hi> The syllable
                    <hi rend="italic">clírn,</hi> signifying <hi rend="italic">hindred,</hi> removes
                    at once all doubt as to the meaning of the speaker; but the <hi rend="italic"
                    >chin,</hi> in writing, is wholly unnecessary, and would be left out, the
                    character signifyingyhíÄer being totally different from any other ' character
                    that may have the name of <hi rend="italic">foo.</hi> A foreigner, not always
                    aware of this, is liable to many equivoques in speaking the language. Thus a

                <p>One of the most remarkable features of Chinese policy, is the encouragement given
                    to the cultivation of letters, which are professedly the sole channel of
                    introduction to political advancement in the state, and to the acquirement of
                    office, rank, and honours, of almost every description. The pursuits of
                    literature throw open the highest offices in the state to the lowest of the
                    people; and with a few exceptions of particular favourites, or of Tartars
                    connected by blood with the imperial family, it would appear that honours and
                    offices are generally bestowed according to merit. With the prospect of such
                    rewards, the number of competitors is very great, and a taste for letters is
                    almost universally diffused among all ranks and denominations. Schools abound in
                    every town and village, and the best education that China affords is to be had
                    on the most moderate terms. In every part of the empire certain magistrates are
                    appointed by the government to call before them all candidates for employment,
                    to direct them in their studies, and twice a year to hold public examinations,
                    when small presents are distributed to the most deserving. As a further
                    encouragement to literature, the press is left free to all, and any one may
                    print what he pleases, taking his chance for the consequences. That this
                    unrestrained liberty of the press should exist in one of the most arbitrary
                    governments that is known, is a remarkable phenomenon in the history of nations.
                    No previous license is required, no restrictions are imposed, though the
                    publication of books is made amenable to certain regulations established by law.
                    In general, crimes, and their corresponding punishments, are clearly and
                    minutely defined in the <hi rend="italic">Laws of Cliina</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but the law which regards the press is left, perhaps intentionally,
                    vague and uncertain. According to the <hi rend="italic">Leu-tee,</hi> “whoever
                    is guilty of editing wicked and corrupt books, with the view of misleading the
                    people, and whoever attempts to excite sedition by letters or handbills, shall
                    suffer death by being beheaded; the principals shall be executed immediately
                    after conviction, but the accessaries shall be reserved for execution at the
                    usual season.” And further, “all persons who are convicted of printing,
                    distributing, or singing in the streets, such disorderly and seditious
                    compositions, shall be punishable as accessaries.”</p>
                <p>These severe laws are by no means a dead letter; numbers have been executed in
                    virtue of them. Three unfortunate authors were punished with death, and their
                    families banished, by that great patron of literature, Kien-lung, in three
                    consecutive years, for publishing books that no European government would have
                    deigned to notice; but political discussions are least of all palatable to
                    despotic governments, and are easily brought under the charge of constructive
                    treason, a crime that in China is never pardoned.</p>
                <p>The instances, however, that occur of severity of punishment seem to have little
                    effect in diminishing the number of publications, and are not more hostile to
                    the liberty of the press in China, than the occasional punishment of a jail, for
                    libel, is destructive of that liberty in England. A writer in a popular
                    periodical journal says, that thousands of novels and moral tales, amusing
                    stories, laughable comedies, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354387"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-4387-0568"/>moral precepts from ancient sages, and
                    exhortations from living sovereigns; popular songs, fables, and romances; books
                    of receipts to heal the sick and to pamper the appetite; predictions of the
                    weather, and of good or bad luck; manuals of devotion, of religious rites, and
                    rules of good-breeding; almanacs and court calendars, are the lighter sort of
                    publications which issue daily from the press in Pekin, and other great cities
                    of the empire. All ranks in China read, and find it a cheap luxury; the more
                    bulky and expensive works, as those on history, philology, jurisprudence, are
                    sometimes published by subscription, but are supplied to the libraries of the
                    magistrates by the government. Libraries are seldom formed to any great extent
                    by individuals. The grand collections of history, philosophy, and other standard
                    national works, published by the direction of the sovereign, under the
                    superintendence of the <hi rend="italic">Han-lin,</hi> are distributed to the
                    princes of the blood, the viceroys of provinces, presidents of departments, and
                    to the learned of the empire, but arc rarely met with in the libraries of
                    private individuals.</p>
                <p>We can form no estimate of the state of literature in China, from the
                    paraphrastic translations of ill-chosen books, and the commentaries on them,
                    made by the Jesuits and other Catholic missionaries; the trite morality of
                    Cong-foo-tse and Men-tse; the wise sayings of this emperor, and the wicked
                    doings of that, which are contained in the <hi rend="italic">Ou-hing</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Se-choo,</hi> their ancient canonical books, convey no
                    better idea of the state of China or of its literature, than the Domesday Book
                    does of that of England. The <hi rend="italic">Tong-kien-kang-moo,</hi> or
                    General History of China, by Père Mailla, may be considered as the most
                    important of missionary translations. Some of the odes of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shee-hing,</hi> by Père Premare, are curious, as exhibiting specimens of their
                    poetry 4000 years ago. The <hi rend="italic">Eloge</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Moukden,</hi> a poem of the emperor Kien-lung, by Père Amiot, is no bad specimen
                    of modern poetry; for such it is, though, like Ossian, it is unmeasured poetry.
                    Of the merits of his <hi rend="italic">Conquest of the Miao-tsé,</hi> by Mr S.
                    Weston, through the medium of a French translation, we are unable to form any
                    just idea. λVorks on philology, and commentaries on the characters of the
                    languages, are endless; and, on this subject, many curious observations will be
                    found in Père Amiot’s <hi rend="italic">Lettre</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Pehirι,</hi> and in various parts of the <hi rend="italic">Mem.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">concernant les Chinois.</hi> The little novel of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hao-liiau tchuan,</hi> edited by Dr Percy, from the papers of an English
                    supercargo, is so charming a specimen of that kind of writing, as to make us
                    regret that we have not more. The orphan of the house of Tchao was not unworthy
                    of the tragic muse of Voltaire, and yet it was the only specimen of this kind of
                    composition that had appeared in an European dress till a comparatively very
                    recent period. We have now another drama, more closely and more faithfully
                    translated by Mr Davis, taken from the same collection of one hundred dramas in
                    which the <hi rend="italic">Orphan</hi> is found. The <hi rend="italic">Mémoire
                    sur</hi><hi rend="italic">l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Art</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Militaires</hi> although collected from the works of the greatest generals, was
                    unworthy the trouble bestowed upon it by Pèrc Amiot; the military movements, as
                    there represented, are more suitable for mountebanks, tumblers, and
                    posture-makers, than for soldiers; the Chinese are, in fact, the worst soldiers
                    in the world. The same thing may be observed with regard to his treatise on
                    Chinese music, a farrago of trash, not one word of which either he or his
                    Chinese author understood. We have some curious matter on the rites and
                    ceremonies of the several religious sects in China, by Père 1ntorcetta and La
                    Favre, and on various subjects in the <hi rend="italic">Hist, de l'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Académie</hi><hi rend="italic">des Inscript, ct de Belles</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Lettres,</hi> by MM. Ferret and de Guignes; and especially of
                    books translated into Chinese from the Sanscrit, which are to be found in the
                    temples of Fo. These volumes would, no doubt, throw much light on the state of
                    Hindustan before the Mahommedan irruption, which created such havoc and
                    devastation of Hindu literature. It was chiefly with the view of examining these
                    documents, for the better illustration of the history, religion, and literature
                    of India, that Sir William Jones set about learning the Chinese language. De
                    Guignes ascertained that the priests of Fo were in possession of 5400 volumes on
                    the religion of India in the sixth century of the Christian era. Five centuries
                    before this another priest translated twenty-three different books on religion
                    into Chinese, which were lodged in the library of the temple of Sei-gan-foo;
                    and, about the same time, one of a party of pilgrims, who travelled from this
                    city to Benares, from thence to Ceylon, and returned by sea to Canton, published
                    a relation of his travels under the title of <hi rend="italic">Fo-quο∙ kee,</hi>
                    a history of the kingdom of Fo, of which there is a copy in the king’s library
                    at Paris. Frequent mention is made in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tong-hien-hang-moo,</hi> and other histories of China, of priests being
                    dispatched into India, in the early periods of the Christian era, for the
                    express purpose of procuring Hindu writings, chiefly those on religion and
                    astronomy; from which it may be concluded, that, if the Hindus really had any
                    thing valuable which perished by Mahommedan bigotry, it may still have survived
                    in China.</p>
                <p>Among the works of which a translation would be most desirable, may be mentioned
                    the <hi rend="italic">Tai-tsing-ye-tung-tse,</hi> a complete Encyclopaedia of
                    Arts and Sciences, in 200 volumes, published under the sanction, and by the
                    authority, of Kien-lung; for, although we have nothing to expect from the state
                    of science in China, they far surpass all Europe in many arts, and are in
                    possession of others of which Europe is entirely ignorant. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ta-tsing-hoeidien,</hi> another work, containing the whole institutes of this
                    vast empire, with all the regulations of the several departments of government,
                    the whole system of jurisprudence, of revenue and finance, taxation, &amp;c.
                    would afford an interesting picture of this extraordinary nation. Of this
                    curious work, also published by the authority of Kien-lung, there is <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> very general abstract by M. Cibot, in the fourth volume of
                    <hi rend="italic">Mem.</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >les</hi><hi rend="italic">Chinois.</hi> This abstract, and the translation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ta-tsing-leu-lee,</hi> by Sir George Staunton, enable us
                    to form a tolerably correct notion of the machinery by which the multitudinous
                    population of the largest empire on the face of the earth has been uniformly
                    kept in motion, and performed its several functions, for the last four thousand
                    years.</p>
                <p>The desiderata of Chinese literature in Europe are some of their lighter
                    productions, which our increasing knowledge of the Chinese language will no
                    doubt soon supply. The dictionary of De Guignes, compiled by the Jesuits; the
                    more important dictionary of Kaung-hee, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tse-tien,</hi> published in the English language by Dr Morrison; a <hi
                    rend="italic">Chinese Grammar</hi> by the same gentleman; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Clavis</hi><hi rend="italic">Sinica,</hi> ponderous as it is, by
                    Dr Marshman, with various translations of these missionaries, have rendered the
                    study of that language so easy, as to leave no excuse for the continuance of
                    that total ignorance which has for nearly two centuries prevailed among the East
                    India Company’s servants stationed in China. If any proof were wanting of the
                    possibility of a speedy acquirement of the Chinese language by a foreigner, the
                    circumstance of Mr Davis having translated several Chinese works, both in poetry
                    and prose, may be adduced as an example in point Before he had been two years in
                    Canton, this gentleman had acquired a sufficient knowledge of the language to
                    enable him, with the occasional assistance of a native, to translate several
                    pieces of poetry, two or three novels, and, which is probably most difficult of
                    all, a Chinese drama, which has since been published in London. Many years ago
                    Sir George Staunton was able to carry on a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354400"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-4400-0569"/>correspondence with the officers of government at
                    Canton, translate the <hi rend="italic">Ta-tsing-leu-lce,</hi> the journal of a
                    Chinese officer through the vast regions of Tartary, by the Baikal Lake, as far
                    as the Kerghis hordes, near the borders of the Caspian. It corroborates, we
                    understand, in an extraordinary manner, the observations of Bell, which, indeed,
                    were never called in question; and is the more curious, as they both travelled
                    in the same year, and must have crossed each other on the way. Sir George,
                    besides, translated a Chinese drama, and two or three short tales, from a
                    collection called <hi rend="italic">Tsing-tsu,</hi> or, “Histories descriptive
                    of the Passions.” Mr Manning also made himself perfect master of the Chinese
                    language in a comparatively short period. We mention these to show that there is
                    neither any difficulty in acquiring a knowledge of the Chinese language, nor
                    want of inducement to prosecute the study of it. Sir George Staunton alone
                    possessed from 3000 to 4000 volumes.</p>
                <p>Europeans have been deceived as to the vast number of characters in this
                    language, which was supposed to create its difficulty. In the great dictionary
                    of Kaung-hee there are not more than 40,000 characters, of which about 36,000
                    only are in use. The lexico of Scapula contains about 44,000 words, Ainsworth’s
                    Dictionary 45,000, and Johnson’s about the same number. The whole works of
                    Confucius contain only about 3000 different characters. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leu-lee</hi> may have, in the whole, about 100,000 characters, but not more
                    than 1860 different ones throughout the whole work. Where, then, can there
                    possibly be any difficulty?</p>
                <p>The origin of Chinese poetry is indicated by the component parts of the character
                    employed to express it,— <hi rend="italic">words</hi> of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >temple,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> short-measured sentences, delivered as
                    instructions to the people such are those in the ancient writings, and such
                    chiefly are the moral maxims of Confucius. It is so far from being true, as
                    Grozier flippantly asserts, “that a learned man writing good verses would be
                    considered in the same light as a dragoon officer playing well on the fiddle,”
                    that there are few men having any pretensions to learning who do not write
                    verses. The several odes and didactic poems of Kien-lung were quite sufficient
                    to make poetry fashionable, if there were no taste for it among the people; but
                    all are fond of poetry. We have before us the translation of part of an Ode on
                    England and London, written by a common Chinese servant, brought over by a
                    gentleman from Canton, in which are many just observations, with accurate and
                    concise descriptions. The climate, he says, is cold, and people live close to
                    fires; and the houses are so lofty, that you may pluck the stars. Kaung-hee made
                    the same observation to the Jesuits, and supposed that Europeans lived, like
                    birds, in the air, for want of space to build upon. Our Chinese proceeds to say,
                    that the virtuous read their sacred book, and <hi rend="italic">(ρe lee to
                    Got)</hi> pray to God; that they hate the French, and are always fighting with
                    them; that the little girls have red cheeks, and the ladies are fair as the
                    white gem; that husbands and wives love each other; that the playhouses are shut
                    in the day and open at night; that the players are handsome, and their
                    performance delightful. The nature of the character is well adapted to that
                    expressive kind of poetry which pleases the eye of a Chinese, by selecting such
                    as are most comprehensive, or such as allude to some ancient custom, or such as
                    can be used in a metaphorical sense: for instance, “the rushing of water down a
                    precipice roars like thunder,” is expressed by a single character; and that
                    which signifies “happiness,” reminds him, by its component parts, of his
                    guardian angel, of the benefits of union and concord, and of plenty, signified
                    by a mouth over a cultivated field. The intercalary moon is expressed by the
                    character <hi rend="italic">king</hi> placed in that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >gate,</hi> because on such an occasion it was the ancient custom for the king
                    to stand in the door. Thus, also, a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">word</hi> express <hi rend="italic">fidelity</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    <hi rend="italic">nail,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">bargain; beauty</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">goodness</hi> are signified by a character composed of a young
                    virgin and an infant; <hi rend="italic">a flatterer, oi word</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">to lick</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a kingdom is expressed by a
                    <hi rend="italic">square</hi> or <hi rend="italic">space,</hi> within which is a
                    <hi rend="italic">mouth</hi> and <hi rend="italic">weapons,</hi> alluding,
                    perhaps, to <hi rend="italic">arms</hi> and <hi rend="italic">counsel,</hi>
                    being the best protection of a state. But though the sense of seeing seems to be
                    that which is rather addressed in Chinese poetry than the sense of hearing, yet
                    they have their rules both of rhyme, and measure, and quantity, the last of
                    which is given by the tones or accentuations, which are entirely modern. Mr
                    Davies has recently published a very curious work, in which he enters into a
                    critical examination of the rules, and the merits, and the defects of Chinese
                    poetry. Among the specimens of ancient poetry from the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Shee-king,</hi> or collection of odes, upwards of three
                    hundred in number, is of a higher strain, one of which, on marriage, has been
                    beautifully versified by Sir William Jones. The lines consist of no definite
                    number of syllables, some containing three, some seven, but the greater part are
                    limited to four. The rhyme is equally irregular, some having none, in others
                    every line terminating with the same word; sometimes six lines rhyme in a stanza
                    of eight, occasionally four, three, and sometimes only the first and last. Four
                    lines in the stanza, and four characters in each line, seem to be the most
                    common measure in ancient poetry; but many odes of the Shee-king extend the
                    stanza to eight, ten, or twelve lines. At present, <hi rend="italic">five</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> characters are the most common number in the
                    line; the former having the stanza of sixteen, the latter generally of eight;
                    the rhyme seems to be entirely arbitrary. There is not much sublimity of mind or
                    depth of thought in these odes; but they abound with many touches of nature, and
                    are exceedingly interesting and curious, as showing how little change time has
                    effected in the manners and sentiments of this singular people. A number of
                    rules with regard to the tones have recently been introduced, which would
                    require more space to describe than they seem to deserve. As a didactic poem,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Eloge</hi><hi rend="italic">de Mouhden</hi> of Kien-lung
                    appears by no means to be destitute of merit; it is considered, in the Chinese,
                    to be highly poetical, though not written in measured lines; and it contains
                    much beautiful description. His Ode on Tea is of a humbler cast; and some lines
                    on Tea-cups, generally ascribed to him, are, in an English dress we have seen,
                    absolute nonsense. The translator has, in fact, mistaken the whole meaning.</p>
                <p>We give the following from Grozier’s collection, as no unfavourable specimen of
                    modern poetry. It maybe called the Contented Philosopher.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354413" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4413-0570"/>
                <p>“My palace is a little chamber, thrice my own length; finery never entered it,
                    and neatness never left it. My bed is a mat, and the coverlid a piece of felt;
                    on these I sit by day, and sleep by night. A lamp is on one side, and on the
                    other a pot of perfume. The singing of birds, the rustling of the breeze, the
                    murmuring of a brook, are the only sounds that I hear. My window will shut, and
                    my door open,—but to wise men only; the wicked shun it. I shave not, like a
                    priest of Fo; I fast not, like the Tao-tsé. Truth dwells in my heart, innocence
                    guides my actions. Without a master, and without a scholar, I waste not my life
                    in dreaming of nothings, and in writing characters, still less in whetting the
                    edge of satire, or in trimming words of praise. I have no views, no projects.
                    Glory has no more charms for me than wealth, and all the pleasures of the world
                    cost me not a single wish. The enjoyment of ease and solitude is my chief
                    concern. Leisure surrounds me, and bustle shuns me. I contemplate the heavens,
                    and am fortified. I look on the earth, and am comforted. I remain in the world
                    without being in it. One day leads on another, and one year is followed by
                    another; the last will conduct me safe to port, and I shall have lived for
                    myself.”</p>
                <p>Dramatic entertainments are in China, as in Europe, closely connected with
                    poetry. The songs and recitative, in the lighter pieces, abound with characters
                    of double meaning and equivocal expression; but are generally so contrived that,
                    while the written characters shall bear one sense, the sound shall convey to the
                    ear another; and these subterfuges are resorted to in order to avoid that
                    punishment which the magistrates would be compelled to inflict for a breach of
                    the law respecting public decorum, in the publication or exhibition of any thing
                    directly and unequivocally obscene; and yet real life is represented on the
                    stage, without any of its polish or embellishments. All acts, however infamous
                    or horrible, are exhibited on the stage,—a murder or an execution. Whether the
                    culprit be condemned to die by the cord, by decollation, by being cut into ten
                    thousand pieces, or by being flayed alive, the spectators must be indulged with
                    a sight of the operation. Nor do they stop here. Those functions of animal life
                    over which decency requires a veil to be thrown, are exhibited in full display;
                    many of them so gross and indelicate, so coarse in the dialogue, and so indecent
                    in the scenic representation, that foreigners who have witnessed them have
                    retired from the theatre in disgust.</p>
                <p>It is no excuse that these obscene exhibitions were performed for the amusement
                    of foreigners, whom they are pleased to consider as barbarians. The
                    representation of real life, in its ugliest dress and most hateful deformities,
                    could only be conceived by a people of depraved habits and a vicious taste. Of
                    the court exhibitions we have amusing descriptions in the journals of Lord
                    Macartney, Van Braam, and De Guignes. Lord Macartney describes the theatrical
                    entertainments to consist of great variety, tragical as well as comical; some
                    historical, and others of pure fancy, “partly in recitative, partly in singing,
                    and partly in plain speaking, without any accompaniment of instrumental music,
                    but abounding in battles, murders, and most of the usual incidents of the
                    drama.” The grand pantomime followed, the subject of which his lordship
                    conceived to be “The Marriage of the Ocean and the Earth. The latter exhibited
                    her various riches and productions, dragons, and elephants, and tigers, and
                    eagles, and ostriches, oaks and pines, and other trees of different kinds. The
                    ocean was not behind hand, but poured forth on the stage the wealth of his
                    dominions, under the figures of whales and dolphins, porpoises, and leviathans,
                    and other sea monsters, besides ships, rocks, shells, sponges, and corals, all
                    performed by concealed actors, who were quite perfect in their parts, and
                    performed their characters to admiration.” These marine and land productions
                    paraded about for a while, when the whale, waddling forward to the front of the
                    stage, took his station opposite to the emperor’s box, and spouted out of his
                    mouth into the pit several tons of water. “This ejaculation,” says his lordship,
                    “was received with the highest applause; and two or three of the great men at my
                    elbow desired me to take particular notice of it, repeating at the same time,
                    <hi rend="italic">Hac, hung hao! charming, delightful !"</hi> After this, they
                    were entertained with tumbling, wire-dancing, and posture-making; and the
                    amusements of the morning concluded with various fire-works, which were much
                    admired for their novelty, neatness, and ingenious contrivance.</p>
                <p>The Dutch ambassadors were chiefly entertained by the feats of jugglers and
                    posture-makers; after which there was a kind of pantomimic performance, the
                    principal characters of which were men dressed in skins, and going on all fours,
                    intended to represent wild beasts. After them were a parcel of boys habited like
                    mandarins, who were to hunt these animals. “This extraordinary chase, and the
                    music and the rope-dancing, put the emperor into such good humour, that he
                    rewarded the performers very liberally; and the ladies behind some Venetian
                    blinds appeared, from their tittering, to be equally well entertained.”</p>
                <p>An eclipse happened, which kept the emperor and his mandarins the whole day
                    devoutly praying the gods that the moon might not be eaten up by the great
                    dragon that was hovering about her; and the next day a pantomime was performed,
                    exhibiting the battle of the dragon and the moon, and in which two or three
                    hundred priests, bearing lanterns at the end of long sticks, dancing and
                    capering about, sometimes over the plain, and then over chairs and tables, bore
                    no mean part.</p>
                <p>The dramatic representation of the eclipse of the moon is thus described by De
                    Guignes: <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">A</hi> number of Chinese,
                    placed at the distance of six feet from one another, now entered, bearing two
                    long dragons of silk or paper painted blue, with white scales, and stuffed with
                    lighted lamps. These two dragons, after saluting the emperor with due respect,
                    moved up and down with great composure, when the moon suddenly made her
                    appearance, upon which they began to run after her. The moon, however,
                    fearlessly placed herself between them; and the two dragons, after surveying her
                    for some time, and concluding apparently that she was too large a morsel for
                    them to swallow, judged it prudent to retire, which they did with the same
                    ceremony as they entered. The moon, elated with her triumph, then withdrew with
                    prodigious gravity, a little flushed, however, with the chase which she had
                    sustained.”</p>
                <p>It is not easy to reconcile the admission of these puerile absurdities and gross
                    indelicacies on the stage, where regular dramas of a higher order exist, and
                    comedians are trained up to perform them, unless it be that their thorough
                    contempt for foreigners induces them to think any thing good enough for their
                    entertainment. The dialogue in the regular drama is uttered in a kind of whining
                    recitative, full of querulous cadences, which are drowned generally in a crash
                    of trumpets, cymbals, gongs, and the kettle-drum. The passions, as in the
                    Italian opera, are mostly expressed in song. If a fight ensues, each of the
                    combatants sings a stanza, and then falls to, and during the combat the
                    instruments of music keep up a most tremendous noise.</p>
                <p>Comedians are not much esteemed, if we may judge from the statute against
                    actresses; and yet it is said that <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354426"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-4426-0571"/>Kien-lung’s mother was on the stage; since which,
                    the parts of females are performed by eunuchs and boys, the latter of whom are
                    regularly bound apprentices to the trade. Pekin is said to have about a hundred
                    different companies, and each company to consist of fifty persons and upwards,
                    composed of speakers, musicians, tumblers, and jugglers, so as to suit all
                    tastes. They live in passage boats, in which they are conveyed from place to
                    place. There are no regular theatres, but players are hired by the wealthy at so
                    much by the day. They are said to be ready at any moment to perform any play
                    that may be fixed upon, out of a list seldom short of 100. These are the sorts
                    of plays performed before their countrymen, and not the trash which they exhibit
                    before foreigners at the court and at the sea-port town of Canton. The
                    translation of <hi rend="italic">An Heir in his Old Age,</hi> by Mr Davis, is
                    calculated to give rather a favourable opinion of the Chinese drama. It consists
                    of five regular acts; it has plot and character; the action is simply one, and
                    never stands still. It is deficient in wit, but not in sentiment, and the
                    several characters are well preserved. It is, in short, a story that may
                    commonly occur in a family, thrown into action instead of being merely told, and
                    the catastrophe is quietly and naturally brought about.</p>
                <p>Many of their dramas, however, are full of bustle and business, and abound with
                    incident. They are generally representations of real life, and contain sometimes
                    the whole life and adventures of an individual, some great sovereign, or
                    celebrated general; a history, in fact, thrown into action, not unlike that
                    “Lamentable tragedy, mixed full of pleasant mirth, conteyning the life of
                    Cambyses king of Percia, from the beginning of his kingdom unto his death.” The
                    argument of a drama of this kind was found among Mr Wilkinson’s papers. An aged
                    matron and her son (the hero of the piece) being reduced to poverty, are driven
                    to the necessity of asking alms for their support. An officer’s daughter,
                    finding them of good parentage and education, gives money to the son, and
                    engages the mother to attend on her. The son hires himself to serve in a
                    tea-house kept by an old woman and her daughter. A rakish young officer, liking
                    the daughter, gains the consent of the old woman to take her into his house, but
                    the girl rejects the offer. He then sends his servants to carry her off by
                    force, but the new servant rescues her. The officer lays an accusation against
                    him; he is carried before a magistrate, who orders him a flogging, and to wear
                    the cangue or wooden collar. Not satisfied with this, the young officer sends
                    out his people with cudgels to beat him to death. Unable, on account of the
                    collar, to reach his mouth, they find the young girl giving him food. His hands,
                    however, being at liberty, he lays about him on all sides, and, by a sudden
                    whirl of his wooden ruff, the corner of it strikes the young officer on the head
                    and kills him on the spot. The head man of the street takes him and the young
                    woman into custody, carries them before a magistrate, who releases the young
                    man, but takes the girl of the tea-shop into his own house, from which she is
                    suffered to escape by his wife. The superior magistrate of the district being
                    informed of the death of the young officer, and that the girl of the teahouse
                    was the chief cause of it, sends an order to the inferior magistrate, who had
                    taken her into his house, to deliver her up; but she is nowhere to be found;
                    and, in the greatest dismay, this inferior magistrate orders his .servants to go
                    out and seize any woman they meet with and carry her before the superior
                    magistrate. They find, in a temple, the officer’s daughter first mentioned, with
                    the old woman, who had fled from home on her father being disgraced, and all his
                    goods and family seized. She is hurried away before the magistrate, and, in the
                    supposition of her being the tea-house girl, sentenced to lose her head. Being
                    carried to the place of execution at midnight, she is recognized by the old
                    matron’s son, who was among the spectators, and who, by seizing the officer’s
                    sword, attacks the executioner, and rescues the young lady; but they are
                    speedily taken, and both ordered for execution; the truth, however, is
                    discovered, and the magistrate who played off the trick suffers in their stead.
                    This superior magistrate, however, falls in love with the lady, and proposes to
                    take her for his <hi rend="italic">βrst</hi> or legitimate wife, and hires the
                    young man for his servant. The lady peremptorily refuses, upon which she is
                    ordered to be beaten by the servants till she lies for dead, and the young man
                    is directed to carry the body and throw it into the river. He lays her on the
                    bank, covers her with his cloak, and goes to buy a coffin, as his last act of
                    gratitude for one who had relieved his mother and himself in their distress. A
                    boat approaching, and finding a woman thus bestowed, carries her off to serve
                    the Tartar queen in her wars against the Chinese; this same people, it seems,
                    having already carried off the old matron and the young girl of the tea-shop.
                    Our hero returning and missing the body, falls in great distress. However, he
                    tells his master he has obeyed his commands, who by this time has learned whose
                    daughter he had thus cruelly treated; and, to prevent further mischief, he
                    engages his new servant (the hero of the piece) to put to death her father,
                    instead of which he reveals the whole to the father, and they concert together
                    and put to death his master. The hero then flies to the wars against the
                    Tartars; and it being the custom (or the Chinese thinking so) for the women to
                    fight, he encounters his-own mother, the young lady who relieved her, and the
                    girl of the tea-shop, on which discovery he suffers himself to be taken prisoner
                    by the Tartars, is brought before the queen, who, on hearing the story, sets the
                    three Chinese women at liberty, and commits them to his care. They all return to
                    China; they find the father of the young lady restored to his rank and honours,
                    who bestows his daughter on the hero of the piece; and the other young woman of
                    the tea-shop is provided for by his taking her for a second wife. By the
                    emperor’s patent he is created a great mandarin for the service he has
                    performed, receives the suitable habit for himself and his two wives, and the
                    congratulations of all their friends. (Macartney; Staunton; Barrow; De Guignes;

                <p>As connected with the drama, the state of Chinese music may next be considered.
                    Detestable as Europeans must find the very best of this music, such is the force
                    of habit or prejudice, that the Chinese are as fond of their own as a Highlander
                    is of the bagpipe. Their ancient writers ascribe to it all those extraordinary
                    and extravagant effects of softening the manners and promoting civilization,
                    taming wild beasts, moving rocks and stones, and, in short, performing all the
                    wonders which have been related of the strains of Orpheus and the lyre of
                    Amphion. The Şhoo-king says, that the emperor <hi rend="italic">Chun</hi>
                    considered music as one of the most efficient engines of government, and a test
                    for proving the national character. Confucius was so astounded with one of the
                    old airs, that he could neither eat nor drink, and for three months could think
                    of nothing else. In the book of <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> it is remarked,
                    that, while the Institutes of the empire continue to be observed, and music to
                    be cultivated, China will remain a mighty and invincible nation. And one of the
                    early emperors has this remark: “would you conquer your enemies without
                    bloodshed, diffuse among them songs set to tender and voluptuous melodies, to
                    soften their minds and enervate their bodies, and then, by sending among them
                    plenty of women, your conquest will be complete.” <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193354439" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4439-0572"/>Dr Burney has well observed,
                    that the more barbarous the age and the music, the more powerful its
                    effects:</p>
                <p>For still the less they understand,</p>
                <p>The more they admire the slight of hand.</p>
                <p>In China the music is still barbarous enough, whatever the people may be who can
                    admire it. It has neither science nor system; but from a strange confused
                    account given by Pcre Amiot, of the generation and true dimensions of the tones
                    (not one word of which, as he afterwards acknowledges, he could understand), the
                    Abbé Roussier concludes, that, like the music of the Greeks, it appears to be
                    the remaining fragments of a complete system, belonging to a people more ancient
                    than either of them. It will, perhaps, be safer to follow Dr Burney’s
                    conclusion, “that, from all the specimens he had seen of Chinese music (and he
                    quotes Dr Lind, who resided some time in China, in support of bis opinion), all
                    the melodies of this nation have a very strong analogy to the old Scottish tunes
                    that “the Chinese scale is very Scottish that “both resemble in their melodies
                    the songs of ancient Greece and that, “the music of all three ought to be
                    considered as <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> music.”</p>
                <p>The Chinese airs are almost invariably sung in slow movements, generally
                    plaintive, and mostly of a querulous or complaining cast; and they are always
                    accompanied by some stringed instrument in the shape of a guitar. They make use,
                    in singing, of so many shakes, their airs abound with so many half and quarter
                    tones, that they are dull, drawling, and drowsy.</p>
                <p>Their gamut consists of five natural tones, which they distinguish by five
                    characters of the language, and two semitones; but they use neither lines nor
                    spaces to note down their music. They however, write flown in succession the
                    characters or notes in a column, as they arc played, though it does not appear
                    that they pay any attention in marking the time, the key, the mode of
                    expression, or the like, but acquire their airs by dint of labour and imitation.
                    Their gamut for instrumental music is so imperfect, and the keys so
                    inconsistent, wandering from flats to sharps, and the contrary, that they are
                    under the necessity of being steadied and directed by a bell or cymbal. They
                    always play, or endeavour to play, in unison, having no idea of counterpoint and
                    parts in music. The band of Lord Macartney, on this account, afforded them no
                    pleasure, except when it played some simple air, such as “Malbrook,” or the
                    national song of“God save the King.” Some of their instruments, however, do
                    occasionally rise to the octave in the accompaniment. The wind instruments are
                    in general shrill, harsh, and discordant; the drums, bells, cymbals, and other
                    pulsatory instruments, loud and jarring; and the stringed instruments meagre and
                    jingling. The sweetest instrument is a small organ, made of unequal reeds stuck
                    into the upper surface of a hollow cup of wood, of which there are numbers in
                    this country, but for which Dr Burney tried in vain to adapt a scale. This we
                    believe to be the same <hi rend="italic">tibia</hi> which that literary coxcomb
                    Isaac Vossius maintained to be superior to all the instruments of modern
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>As a favourable specimen of Chinese music, the following national song of <hi
                    rend="italic">Moo-lee-wha</hi> is here inserted:</p>
                <p>This air was played by Lord Amherst’s band, and delighted the Chinese more than
                    any other.</p>
                <p>It may be added, that the affected gravity of Chinese manners, and their unsocial
                    life, are unfavourable to the cultivation of music, which cannot be expected to
                    arrive even at a state of mediocrity, among a people who rarely assemble
                    together, who take no enjoyment in the amusement of dancing, and whom the loves
                    and the graces have not as yet condescended to visit.</p>
                <p>In a country where every kind of luxury is discouraged, and some of them
                    constitute a crime, where property is so precarious as rarely to descend to
                    three generations, and where the useful only is affected to be considered as
                    valuable, no great progress can be looked for in the fine arts. For the same
                    reason that their poetry is deficient in invention, imagination, and dignity of
                    sentiment, and thcir music of harmony, the sister art of painting is wanting in
                    all the requisites that are considered to be necessary to form a good picture.
                    Indeed it could not well be otherwise, as, independently of their contracted
                    ideas, they offend against every principle of perspective, which, with the
                    effects produced by a proper disposition of light and shade, they affect to
                    consider as unnatural. That it is not from want of talent that their drawings
                    and paintings are so extravagantly outré, is sufficiently proved by the facility
                    and accuracy with which the painters of Canton copy any picture put into their
                    hands, whether on paper, glass, or canvass; and, so far from the Abbé Grozier’s
                    Parisian idea being true, that their best works are executed in Pekin, the very
                    reverse is the case; all the arts, manufactures, even down to common printing,
                    being worse executed in the capital than in any other city of the empire: and
                    the reason is obvious enough; for the moment that a man acquires a superior
                    reputation, he is summoned to the palace, where, within its spacious precincts,
                    his talents must be exercised for the emperor alone. Here their arts and
                    manufactures remain stationary, while the artists of Canton, being in the habit
                    of copying from better models, are superior to any that the imperial palace can
                    boast. It is all very well for a Chinese to pretend that the ancients greatly
                    excelled the moderns in the art of painting, and to produce examples in their
                    books of one painter having drawn on the palace walls some hawks so very natural
                    that the little birds, afraid to approach, flew screaming away; and of another
                    having painted a door oh a wall, the deception of which was so complete, that
                    people endeavoured to go through it: but why <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>
                    should the Jesuits repeat these idle stories as if they were facts? or why
                    should we be told that the Chinese would be good sculptors if the art was not
                    prohibited by the government? which is so far from being true, that in every
                    temple, bridge, and burying-ground, may be seen all manner of grotesque figures
                    of men, women, quadrupeds, and other creatures, that never existed but in the
                    sculptor’s imagination; and these we have abundantly in all manner of materials,
                    wood, stone, metals, and baked clay. Individual objects they can paint with
                    great accuracy; and in a composition each individual object is represented as
                    close to the eye. Thus the leaves of trees, however distant, are distinctly
                    represented; and objects in the back-ground are painted of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193354452" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4452-0573"/>same size with those of the
                    same kind in the fore-ground, which they absurdly contend to be proper, because
                    they arc so in nature. It may be doubted whether the most skilful European
                    artist can excel a Chinese in painting a bird or a reptile, an insect, a fish,
                    or a flower; so correct is he to nature, that not one plumula of a feather, nor
                    a single scale of a fish, escapes him, and every shade and tint of colour is
                    minutely imitated. It is strange that a man of Pauw’s sagacity should suffer his
                    judgment to be so warped as to assign the “singular disposition of their optical
                    organs” as the cause which prevented the Chinese from becoming good painters. As
                    little truth is there in his assertion, that they are unable to copy from good
                    models, without falling into their own style, and converting European cyes,
                    ears, and noses, into those of a Chinese; they are the most servile imitators on
                    earth. A Chinese will imitate the likeness of any object in shape, colour, and
                    proportion. Though when left to himself he has no mind to convey the idea of
                    distance, solidity, expression, and magnitude of objects, by fore-shortening,
                    .perspective, and a due distribution of light and shade, yet he will copy them
                    all in a picture with scrupulous accuracy.</p>
                <p>Sculpture has been thought by some to date its improvements, if not its origin,
                    from monumental edifices. No country can boast a greater number or variety of
                    objects of this nature than China; but, like the rest of its edifices, they are
                    totally destitute of the character of solidity and duration. A few monsters, or
                    distorted forms of men and domestic animals, generally moulded in clay, are
                    sometimes placed among the tombs, but they are wholly undeserving of notice. In
                    cutting wood, in forming the root of a plant into the shape of human beings,
                    quadrupeds, or monsters, they suceeed better, and communicate to the features or
                    to the action a high degree of expression; the same things occur in metal and in
                    porcelain; but the human figure is always clothed, and a naked statue never
                    seen. Some of the gigantic clay figures in the temples are by no means void of
                    character and expression, and the images cut in stone, which sometimes adorn the
                    avenues to the palaces, the gates of cities, and the parapets of bridges,
                    monstrous as they generally are, show that, by proper encouragement and
                    instruction, they are capable of producing something better; but they seem to be
                    deficient in taste and feeling, and to possess no general ideas of the beauties
                    of nature. Content with the representation of individuality, the imagination is
                    never called into play; they servilely imitate what appears before them, with
                    all its beauties and all its blemishes. They are deficient neither in ingenuity
                    nor in dexterity. They engrave with a tool on copper, on silver, or on wood, as
                    well, generally speaking, as the same kind of work can be executed in any part
                    of Europe; and they are expert enough as lapidaries, in cutting all sorts of
                    precious stones. They use spectacles made of cryal.</p>
                <p>It is somewhat remarkable that a government so long and so firmly established,
                    and a population so numerous and civilized, should at no period of its history
                    have constructed a building, public or private, that could deserve the least
                    attention or admiration for its form, solidity, or magnitude, or that could
                    possibly resist the action of two or three centuries; such is the obstinate and
                    inveterate adherence of this people to ancient usage, which has narrowed and
                    confined their ideas in the construction of their dwellings to the primitive
                    tent. Perhaps, however, the want o permanent security to private property may
                    have operated against the construction of solid and expensive edifices, and
                    confined them to the less durable materials of half-burnt brieks, mud, clay, and
                    wood. This is more likely to be the ease than the absurd and ridiculous reason
                    assigned by Grozier, that the heat and moisture of the southern provinces, and
                    the rigorous cold of the northern ones, would render buildings of marble *and
                    other stone unhealthy and scarcely habitable; and that the same reasons equally
                    operate against a number of stories, as the second and third would not be
                    habitable. If the Abbé Grozier had passed but a single summer’s day under the
                    roof of one of the magnificent stone buildings of Calcutta, and another under a
                    Chinese tent, he would not have committed such nonsense to paper. From the want
                    of windows in their houses to the street, and from the small courts behind being
                    barricadoed by high walls, which overtop the roofs, and conceal the dwellings
                    from adjoining courts, it may perhaps be concluded that privacy, and jealousy of
                    their women, have been the causes that prevent the Chinese from building second
                    and third stories to their dwelling-houses. The missionaries, however, have
                    assigned the frequent earthquakes in the northern provinces as the cause of the
                    lowness of the houses and slightness of the materials; as if men would
                    speculate, over a whole empire of unparalleled extent, on a contingency which
                    might never happen, and which, when it had happened, was confined to certain
                    limits. The eruptions of Vesuvius have not prevented the inhabitants of Naples
                    from building palaces, much less the Russians from rebuilding Moscow; though the
                    distance between these two cities is not greater than that of Pekin, where
                    earthquakes are frequent, from that of Canton, where they never happen.</p>
                <p>One can scarcely givecredit to the disastrous effects produced by these
                    earthquakes. The lives that have been lost are reckoned in Chinese history by
                    hundreds of thousands, especially under the Mongoos dynasty. This might lead to
                    a suspicion of exaggeration, as famines, earthquakes, and inundations, are
                    considered by the Chinese as the scourges inflicted by heaven on the people, to
                    show its dislike to a sovereign whom it disapproves, did not the accounts of
                    more recent earthquakes, given by the missionaries, who were eye-witnesses of
                    their tremendous effects, correspond with those recorded in Chinese history. It
                    is stated by Père Mailla, that, in 1679, in the reign of Kaung-hee, more than
                    300,000 inhabitants of Pekin were buried under the ruins of the houses thrown
                    down by an earthquake; that at the same time above 30,000 persons perished in
                    the city of Tong-tchoo. The statements, however, of the missionaries, are vague
                    and discordant. Père Couplet says, <hi rend="italic">Sub</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >decimam horam matutinam, regiam urbem et loca vicina tam horribilis terree
                    motus concussit, ut innumera palatia, deorum fana, turres et urbis</hi><hi

                    quadraginta homimim millia.</hi> Again, in 1730, in the reign of Yong-tehin, a
                    violent earthquake shook the capital to its foundations, and 100,000 of its
                    inhabitants were crushed to death. The earth opened in various places, black
                    volumes of smoke issued forth, and left behind large pools of water. The city of
                    Pekin is represented as affording a horrible spectacle; its walls, its palaces,
                    the public buildings, two of the Jesuits’ churches, and a multitude of
                    dwelling-houses, were wholly or in part thrown down. The palace of the emperor,
                    more solid than any other cdifice, was greatly injured; that of Yuen-min-yuen
                    was scarcely reparable. Of the 100,000 inhabitants contained in the adjoining
                    village of Haitien, 20,000 arc stated to have perished. The imperial family
                    betook themselves to their barges in the canals within the precincts of the
                    palace. The emperor distributed many millions of money to the sufferers, and
                    gave the Jesuits one thousand ounces of silver towards the expense of repairing
                    their churches.</p>
                <p>If earthquakes were to throw down the tall and ill-built brick pagodas of seven
                    and nine stories in height, there would be nothing surprising; yet these appear
                    to stand <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354465" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4465-0574"/>the
                    shocks, and many of them are evidently among the oldest buildings-in China.
                    These, and the temples of Fo and Tao-tse, are among the most striking buildings
                    of the country. The want of a national or state religion will best explain the
                    want of those magnificent edifices in China, that almost every other civilized
                    nation has reared to the objects of divine worship. Some of their bridges are
                    light, and sufficiently pretty in their appearance; but they are generally
                    slight and faulty in their construction. They consist of every possible variety
                    of form. Their monuments to the memory of the dead are still more various than
                    their bridges, but they are poor in design and bad in execution. Wooden pillars
                    forming a triple gateway, roofed over, and painted, gilt, and varnished, are
                    among the most striking objects that catch the eye of a stranger. They are
                    monuments erected at the public expense, in streets or by the sides of highways,
                    to commemorate some celebrated warrior, some ancient mandarin, or some
                    antiquated virgin who had withstood temptation, and never swerved from the
                    strict rules of decorum. To such a one will probably be inscribed, in letters of
                    gold, “Honour granted by the emperor—to icy coldness, hard frost.” But these <hi
                    rend="italic">pei-loos</hi> have little permanency. The mandarin to whom the
                    emperor’s order is addressed for erecting it, employs a carpenter, contracts for
                    building the edifice as cheaply as he can, and pockets the rest of the money.
                    The emperor’s object is answered by publishing the edict in the National
                    Gazette. It is handed down to posterity in the great history of the empire,
                    whilst the monument itself in a few years is consumed by the dry-rot, and is
                    seen no more.</p>
                <p>Superior as the temples and palaces of the Hindus and Mahommedans in India and
                    Persia, and indeed throughout Asia, are to those of the Chinese, the dwellings
                    of the latter are infinitely more comfortable in every respect than those of the
                    former. Their stoves for warming the apartments and for cooking, their beds and
                    furniture, bespeak a degree of refinement and comfort unknown to other oriental
                    nations; but the great characteristic difference is, that the Chinese sit on
                    chairs, eat off tables, burn wax candles, and cover the whole body with
                    clothing.</p>
                <p>Their naval architecture wears the stamp of great antiquity, and is exceedingly
                    grotesque. They have, in fact, made little progress in maritime navigation, from
                    the inveterate dislike of the government to all foreign intercourse, and to all
                    innovation. The very same kind of vessels as those described by Marco Polo at
                    the port nearest to Pekin, in the thirteenth century, were found without
                    variation by Lord Macartney, five hundred years afterwards, and accurate to the
                    Italian’s description, even to the number of compartments into which the hold of
                    each vessel was divided. They had anchors of wood, and ropes and sails of
                    bamboo. The boats and barges for internal commerce and communication are very
                    varied, generally commodious, especially the passage-boats on the grand canal,
                    and all of them suited to the depth and velocity of the stream, and the width of
                    the locks and floodgates of the respective canals and rivers which they are
                    intended to navigate. These vessels are so numerous as almost to supersede the
                    necessity of land-carriage; and the most common and convenient mode of
                    travelling in China is in barges, which are generally provided with cabins for
                    sleeping, and a kitchen and utensils for cooking victuals. Their military navy
                    is unworthy of the name. It consists of a flotilla, whose principal occupation
                    is that of conveying soldiers where they may be wanted, and looking after
                    pirates and smugglers. An English frigate would beat the whole naval force of
                    China. (Grozier, Du Halde, Barrow, De Guignes, &amp;c.)</p>
                <p>The state of their military architecture and military science is equally rude and
                    imperfect. There is nothing, in fact, from the celebrated wall on the side of
                    Northern and Western Tartary, to the mouth of the Bocca Tigris near Canton, that
                    merits the name of a fortress. They are all of the same construction, being
                    mounds of earth hcaped into the shape of a wall, and cased on each side with
                    bricks, and flanked with square towers at bowshot distance; and with walls of
                    this description all their cities are surrounded.</p>
                <p>The best defences of China are its great distance from any civilized country; its
                    rugged mountains and sandy deserts on one side, and a stormy sea, whose
                    navigation is but little known, on the other. In its military strength it can
                    place little or no confidence; a fact which has frequently been proved by the
                    successful incursions of the Tartars, who have twice since the Christian era
                    conquered the whole country, and changed the ruling dynasty. There is little
                    doubt, indeed, that a well-appointed army of 15,000 or 20,000 men, led by an
                    experienced general, would easily make its way from Canton to Pekin. It has been
                    supposed, from their skill in fire-works, and from the frequent mention of them
                    in ancient books, that the deflagrating power of nitre, sulphur, and other
                    ingredients, was well known to them; but it is pretty evident that they had but
                    an imperfect, if any knowledge of cannon or muskets, before the arrival of
                    European missionaries in the capital. We may form some notion of the mode of
                    fighting of the Tartars and the Chinese about the Christian era, from the memoir
                    of a general officer, presented to the sovereign when about to make war on the
                    Tartars.</p>
                <p>“The manner,” this general says, “in which the Tartars carry on war is very
                    different from ours. To mount up and descend the steepest mountains with
                    astonishing rapidity; to swim deep and rapid rivers; to brave storms of wind and
                    rain, hunger and thirst; to make forced marches, and overleap all impediments,
                    training their horses to tread in the narrowest paths; expert in the use of the
                    bow and arrow, they are always sure of their aim— such are the Tartars. They
                    attack, retreat, rally, with a promptitude and facility peculiar to themselves.
                    In the gorges of the mountains, and in the ravines and deep defiles, they will
                    always have the advantage over us; but on the plains, where our chariots can
                    perform their evolutions, our cavalry will always beat theirs. Their bows have
                    not the strength of ours, their spears are not so long, and their arms and
                    arrows are inferior in quality to ours. To stand firm, to come to close
                    quarters, to handle the pike, to present a front, to cut their way when
                    surrounded, are the proper manoeuvres of our troops, of which the Tartars are
                    ignorant, and against which they can oppose no successful resistance. In such
                    situations, with equal numbers, our forces are as five, when the Tartars are but
                    as three.” <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Gén. de la Chines</hi></p>
                <p>The first mention of anything like fire-arms, and that is but an equivocal one,
                    is in the year 1219, when Gengis-khan was penetrating the provinces of China. It
                    is stated that the Chinese, from the turrets of the walls of Tsao-yong, played
                    their machines called <hi rend="italic">pao,</hi> the present name of guns, by
                    which they killed great numbers at every stroke. Again, when Ogdai-khan laid
                    siege to Lo-yang, the Chinese commandant Kiang-chin invented a kind of <hi
                    rend="italic">pao,</hi> which hurled large stones to the distance of one hundred
                    paces, with such accuracy as to strike any point that might be desired. But
                    another passage is more to the purpose. The Tartars are said to have breached an
                    angle of the wall, by employing more than a hundred machines', consisting of
                    tubes, each made of thirteen laths of bamboo; that the Chinese repaired these
                    breaches with wood, straw mixed with horse-dung, &amp;c., which the Tartars set
                    on fire with their <hi rend="italic">ho-pao,</hi> or fire-tubes; and immediately
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354478" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4478-0575"/> afterwards we
                    find these <hi rend="italic">ho-pao</hi> called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tchen-tien-ley,</hi> or heaven-shaking thunder; and it is further stated that a
                    certain substance put into them, when set on fire, explodes like a thunder-clap,
                    loud enough to be heard at the distance of a hundred <hi rend="italic">ley,</hi>
                    or thirty miles. This description, and that of the effects produced, leave no
                    doubt of these bamboo staves, hooped together, being the first attempt in China
                    at the use of cannon, to which succeeded probably those of plates of malleable
                    iron, also hooped together, several of which kind have been found in India, and
                    also seen by Bell, lying in heaps, within the walls of a city near the great
                    wall.</p>
                <p>In 1453 we find mention made of chariots of war, carrying cannon in their fronts;
                    but it is probable they knew very little of the use of them; for when
                    Chin-tsing, in 1608, made war upon the Tartars on the northern frontier, and was
                    defeated, the Portuguese at Macao, availing themselves of the panic into which
                    the Chinese were thrown, made an offer of assistance with a party of artillery.
                    A Jesuit was dispatched from the capital to hasten the new auxiliaries. The
                    party consisted of two hundred Portuguese, and as many Chinese trained and
                    exercised in the European manner, and they were commanded by two Portuguese
                    captains, Pierre Cordier and Antoine Rodriguez del Capo. They were feasted and
                    treated with distinguished honours on their passage to the capital, where they
                    were well received and generally admired, except in the cut of their jackets,
                    which, according to Chinese notions, were too scanty to be elegant. This
                    admiration, however, soon ceased, and in a few days they were sent back to
                    Macao. It is stated by one of the missionaries, that this was owing to a
                    Portuguese and four Chinese being killed in firing the guns. That the Jesuit
                    Verbiest taught them how to cast cannon there can be no doubt, for the president
                    of the tribunal of rites thanks the missionaries for this signal service; and
                    the matchlocks now in use by the Chinese troops are nothing more than the old
                    Portuguese matchlock.</p>
                <p>The Tartars are soldiers by profession, mostly cavalry, and their arms the bow
                    and a broad simitar, which they wear on the left side, with the point forwards,
                    and which they draw by carrying the right hand behind them, in order, they say,
                    that their adversary may not cut the arm when in the act of drawing. They are
                    arranged under eight banners, distinguished by different colours. The Chinese
                    soldiers are for the most part a sort of militia, enrolled for the defence of
                    the extended frontier, guards to the city gates, and the military posts placed
                    at certain distances along the roads, rivers, and canals. All expresses are
                    forwarded from post to post by the soldiers. Vast multitudes are employed to
                    assist the civil magistracy, and act in the cities as police-officers. Their
                    dress and appearance are most unmilitary, better suited for the stage than the
                    field of battle; their paper helmets, wadded gowns, quilted petticots, and
                    clumsy satin boots, are but ill adapted for the purpose of war. Indeed, unless
                    it be to quell an insurrection, or to pursue bands of robbers, the Chinese
                    military are rarely called away from their pacific employments. There was some
                    anxiety, on the return of Lord Amherst through the country, that the military
                    should put on an imposing appearance. “Through the whole route,” says-the
                    emperor, “take care that the soldiers have their armour fresh and shining, and
                    their weapons disposed in a commanding style, and that an attitude be maintained
                    at once formidable and dignified.”</p>
                <p>The people are all enrolled for service, when called upon, from a certain age. A
                    father of a family, having a certain number of children, is exempt from service;
                    an only son, and a son who supports his parents, are both exempt. Great
                    distinctions are shown to those who fall in battle.</p>
                <p>The body of an officer is burnt, and his ashes, with his armour and a suitable
                    eulogium, sent to his friends; the bow and sabre of a common soldier slain in
                    fight are sent to his family; rewards are distributed, and honourable mention
                    made of the deceased in the Pekin Gazette.</p>
                <p>Since the conquest of Western Tartary, completed by Kicn-lung, they are not
                    likely to be engaged in any foreign wars. If the neighbouring states, which pay
                    a nominal vassalage, contribute nothing to their wealth or strength, neither are
                    they likely to give them trouble or uneasiness. They have nothing to apprehend
                    on the side of Tartary but an irruption of the Russians, an event which has been
                    supposed not altogether foreign to the plans of the rulers of that overgrown
                    empire. A revolt, however, of a very alarming nature, took place in the western
                    provinces, and extended itself to the very heart of the empire, in which the
                    rebels were stated to be everywhere victorious; but the only result would be, if
                    successful, to set up a new sovereign, perhaps a new dynasty. Every thing else
                    will go on just as it has done from time immemorial. <hi rend="italic">(Hist.

                <p>Nothing has yet appeared in Europe from an authentic source, to warrant any other
                    conclusion than that of the utter ignorance of the Chinese in the pure,
                    speculative, and abstract science of mathematics. Their knowledge of arithmetic
                    and geometry is bounded by mere practical rules. Their numerical notation is
                    marked down by symbols of the language, as that of the Greeks and the Romans
                    was, by letters of the alphabet; and, like them, the Chinese symbols want that
                    value in position which the Arabic numbers possess. The common operations of
                    arithmetic are generally performed by a few balls strung on wires, somewhat
                    resembling the Roman abacus, and sometimes by the joints of the fingers. The
                    measure of quantity is usually determined, by reducing all surfaces and sides to
                    the dimensions of squares or cubes; and with those few practical operations they
                    contrive to manage all the common purposes of life.</p>
                <p>Yet the Chinese have been represented by some of the French missionaries as
                    profound astronomers at a time when all Europe was in a state of barbarism; as
                    being able to calculate the recurrence of eclipses; to adjust the irregular
                    motions of the sun and moon; to measure the distances of the planets, and so
                    forth. The ridiculous ceremonies observed by the great officers of state when
                    eclipses happen, furnish, it is true, no proof against the knowledge of their
                    causes. A government established on ancient customs cannot afford to lop off any
                    of its props; and the foretelling of eclipses, the frightening away of the
                    dragon that would devour the sun or moon, the favourable or unfavourable omens
                    of the heavenly appearances, are so many engines for keeping the ignorant in
                    awe. The Imperial Calendar is an admirable coadjutor of the Imperial Gazette.
                    But when we find, from their own annals, and from the report of the earliest
                    travellers, that foreigners have had the superintendence of the astronomical
                    part of this almanac; and that, from the defective knowledge of these foreign
                    astronomers, and the occasional want of them altogether, the national calendar,
                    as declared by one of their emperors, had undergone no less than seventy-two
                    revisions, it may safely be concluded that the Chinese know very little of the
                    matter. M. Fréret says he had in his possession the copy of a celestial chart,
                    constructed in China about the sixth century of the Christian era, on which were
                    inserted 1460 stars in their proper positions, at least sufficiently near to be
                    recognised; but this may have been made mechanically, and perhaps by a
                    foreigner. It is recorded in their annals, that in 718 of the Christian era, an
                    Indian astronomer of the name of <hi rend="italic">Koo-tαn,</hi> having brought
                    from the west a treatise on astronomy, was employed at court <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193354491" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4491-0576"/>to translate it into the
                    Chinese language; and they also mention that Kublai-khan encouraged learned men
                    to remain in China, and that under his reign an Arab astronomer was employed in
                    rectifying the calendar, and constructing astronomical instruments. Since that
                    time, Armenians, Bucharians, Hindus, Arabs, and Christians, have presided over
                    the board charged with the construction of the National Almanac, in which the
                    native Chinese took no other part than that of assigning the lucky and unlucky
                    days, what was to be done and what abstained from on those days. When Lord
                    Macartney was in Pekin, a Portuguese, who called himself Bishop of Pekin, a
                    person of no great skill in mathematical knowledge, presided over this board.
                    Indeed, the state in which their calendar was found when Adam Schaal, one of the
                    earliest Jesuits, made his way to Pekin, sufficiently proves their ignorance of
                    astronomical calculations, an intercalary month having been introduced into the
                    wrong year. On making them acquainted with this blunder, all the departments of
                    the state, ordinary and extraordinary, were summoned to sit in judgment on the
                    good father’s'report, which they voted to be erroneous, and that the ancient
                    system should be continued. They kept, however, the learned Jesuit at court, and
                    quietly allowed him to set them right. The emperor Kaung-hee, who seems to have
                    entertained no high opinion of his Chinese subjects, brought the Chinese
                    president of the board of astronomy to trial because he could not calculate the
                    length of shadow which a gnomon would throw, but which was immediately done by
                    Father Verbiest. This intelligent Tartar put himself under the tuition of the
                    Jesuits, who made for him a quadrant, translated into the Chinese language a set
                    of logarithm tables, which were printed, and a copy of which is now in the
                    library of the Royal Society of London; a very beautiful specimen of Chinese
                    typography. Kaung-hec carried these tables and his quadrant suspended from his
                    girdle, and, when in Tartary, is said to have constantly amused himself in
                    taking angles, and measuring the height of mountains.</p>
                <p>The Chinese system, if system it can be called, of astronomy, resembles so
                    closely that which remains of the Hindus, that both must have been derived from
                    the same source. The period or cycle of sixty years, by which their chronology
                    is regulated—the period of 10,800 years, observed by the Tao-tse, which is the
                    sum of the first three Hindu ages, with their intermediate periods—the division
                    of the zodiac into twelve signs, and also into twenty-eight constellations, or
                    habitations of the moon, corresponding with the twenty-eight Hindu
                    nacshatras—are so many proofs of a common origin; and both may perhaps have
                    derived the remains of this science from some third nation, more ancient than
                    either; as the little which both nations do possess appears to be the remains
                    rather than the elements of the science.</p>
                <p>The system of policy which discouraged all intercourse with strangers, which set
                    no value on foreign commerce and navigation, and which cultivated no language
                    but that of the country, which was unintelligible to other nations, must
                    necessarily have kept the people of China in ignorance of all the rest of the
                    world. China was to them, in fact, the whole world. It appears, however, that at
                    a very remote period they had intercourse with Pegu, Siam, Malacca, Hindustan,
                    and several of the Asiatic islands. Two centuries before the Christian era, they
                    bad a knowledge of the upper regions of Tartary; and one of their travellers
                    gives an account of an inland sea, into which the rivers running to the westward
                    were received, which could be no other than the Caspian. The great islands of
                    Borneo, Java, Sumatra, and Ceylon, are names easily recognized in their annals,
                    on which great numbers of Chinese are still found, retaining their original
                    language, manners, and government. Captain Sayer, of his Majesty’s ship Leda, on
                    ascending a river of the western coast of Borneo, came unexpectedly on a colony
                    of Chinese in the interior, consisting of not less than 200,000 or 300,000
                    persons, all united under one chief or captain; and Sir Thomas Raffles says,
                    that near the same place, it has been calculated that the number of Chinese
                    employed in the gold mines alone amounts to 32,000 working men.</p>
                <p>Their knowledge, however, of their immediate neighbours was very limited and
                    imperfect. By the aid of practical geometry, they had a tolerable notion of
                    their own country. Père Mailla asserts, that on comparing an ancient chart of
                    China, said to be copied out of the <hi rend="italic">Shocking,</hi> with the
                    actual survey made by his brother Jesuits and himself, and which took them ten
                    years to complete, they found the limits and the positions of the provinces, the
                    courses of the rivers, and the direction of the mountains, pretty nearly to
                    accord; but the proportions of the objects to each other, and to the whole, were
                    not in the least observed. He further observes, that they saw and gazed with
                    astonishment and admiration at the chasms which the emperor Yu caused to be cut
                    through solid mountains, to open new channels for the waters of the Yellow
                    River. Some, however, will be apt to conclude that it was the water itself, and
                    not the emperor Yu, which opened these channels.</p>
                <p>Of natural and experimental philosophy, they know only what the Jesuits taught
                    them, and that appears not to be much. Of clock-making, dialling, optics, and
                    electricity, they know nothing; of hydrostatics and hydraulics, very little.
                    They raised water by a machine resembling the Persian wheel, and by a large
                    wheel, with bamboo tubes fixed obliquely on its rim; but they were ignorant even
                    of the principle of the common pump. The use of most of the mechanical powers is
                    known to savages; but the most commodious and effective application of them was
                    not known to the Chinese. In most cases manual strength supplied the place of
                    mechanical power. When Mr Barrow, in delivering the presents to the emperor
                    Kien-lung, failed in making him comprehend the use of the mechanical powers from
                    a complete set of models, the old man observed, that they might serve as
                    playthings for his grandchildren.</p>
                <p>The nature of their own language, their universal ignorance of any other, and
                    their pertinacious resistance to all intercourse with foreigners, may explain
                    the low ebb of the sciences and liberal professions in China. The maxims of the
                    sovereignsand sages of antiquity, the ritesand ceremonies and duties required by
                    the civil and religious institutions of the empire, the laws and customs, are
                    the points of knowledge which lead to wealth, pow er, and distinction in the
                    state. As there is no established religion, so none is paid or preferred by the
                    government for instructing the people. As there is no pleading in criminal or
                    civil suits, so there are none who act as attorneys or advocates; and the
                    practice of physic is attended with too little either of honour or emolument to
                    excite emulation in men of rank and ability in the pursuit of it, and is
                    generally in the hands of the sectarian priests of Fo and Tao-tsé, or of low
                    vulgar quacks. Without the least knowledge of anatomy or surgery, they can know
                    little of the animal economy. The seat of the disease they pretend to discover
                    by the quackery of the pulse, by the eye, the nose, the tongue, the ears, and
                    the voice. When this is ascertained, they prescribe their vomits, purges,
                    febrifuges, &amp;c.. extracted from the three kingdoms of nature, of which
                    mercury, antimony, rhubarb, and ginseng, constitute no inconsiderable part. Of
                    ginseng alone they profess to have no less than seventy-seven preparations.
                    Their surgery<pb break="no" facs="nls:193354504" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4504-0577"/>
                    consists chiefly in acupunctuation and shampooing, and it is practised chiefly
                    by the barbers. There are certain persons whose occupation is to discover
                    whether those who may be found dead have died a natural death or by violence,
                    whether by their own means or that of others; and the verdict of the criminal
                    court is often grounded on the decision of these quacks.</p>
                <p>The emperor Kaung-hee soon convinced himself that several of the Jesuits were
                    better skilled in medicine than his own physician. At first, however, he had
                    some scruples, upon being attacked by a fever, of following their advice. Three
                    of the first physicians to the court dissuaded him from taking a medicine of
                    whose qualities they professed themselves ignorant, and advised him to let the
                    disease go on, that they might discover its true character. The emperor,
                    however, at last took the Peruvian bark which the Jesuits had prescribed, and
                    soon recovered; but it is said in the <hi rend="italic">General History,</hi>
                    that several officers who had similar fevers were first ordered to take the
                    bark, and finding it at least harmless, he then ventured upon it himself. As
                    ignorance is a crime in the eyes of the ignorant, it is more especially so at
                    the court of China, and made capital in those to whom the life of the sovereign
                    is intrusted. The three physicians were, therefore, delivered over to the
                    criminal court, who condemned them to death; but Kaung-hee mitigated the
                    punishment to that of exile, and rewarded the Jesuits with a house in Pekin, and
                    contributed largely towards the building of a church.</p>
                <p>Kaung-hee was a man of great humour, and used frequently to joke with the
                    missionaries respecting their religion and the customs of their country. One day
                    he asked Mezzabarba, the pope’s legate, if it was the custom in Europe to
                    condemn a man to death without sufficient proof of his guilt; and being answered
                    in the negative,—“One cannot,” says the emperor, “attach too great a value to
                    the life of man and turning to his body physician, and ordering him to approach,
                    “Here,” continues he, “is a much more formidable person than myself. I can only
                    put a man to death on legal proof of guilt; but this fellow can dispatch
                    whomsoever he plcases without the form of trial.”</p>
                <p>Whoever may be curious to see the quackery of the pulse detailed, without a
                    complete knowledge of which a physician would gain no reputation in China, may
                    find a translation of the doctrine in the collection of Du Halde.</p>
                <p>The Chinese are subject to a species of contagious leprosy, which their
                    physicians cannot cure, and which the law ordains to be a legitimate cause of
                    divorce, as the only means to stop its progress. The itch is most prevalent, and
                    cutaneous disorders of various kinds are very common; but they have escaped the
                    plague, more, as Pauw thinks, by constant ventilation, by burning sandal-wood
                    dust, and other odoriferous woods, by the abundant use of musk and various
                    strong scented drugs, than by any attention to cleanliness. Perhaps, also, the
                    universal smoking of tobacco may have contributed to save them from the horrors
                    of the plague. <hi rend="italic">{Hist. Gén. de la Chine,</hi> par Du Halde.)
                    <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> Though little progress has been made in any of
                    the liberal arts or abstract sciences, and little as they are likely to advance
                    under a system of government which interdicts all intercourse with foreign
                    nations, the arts which necessity demands, which add to the conveniences and
                    increase the comforts of a civilized state of society, seem to have flourished
                    at a very early period of their history; and many of them have been brought to a
                    degree of perfection which is still unequalled by the most polished nations of
                    Europe. Whatever depends on mere imitation and manual dexterity, can be executed
                    as well and as neatly by a Chinese as by the most skilful artists of the western
                    world; and some of them in a style of very superior excellence. No people, for
                    example, have carried the art of dyeing, or of extracting dyeing materials from
                    so great a variety of animal, mineral, and vegetable substances, as the Chinese
                    have done; and this merely from a practical knowledge of chemical affinities,
                    without troubling themselves with theories derived from scientific principles.
                    In like manner practice has taught them how to detect the exact proportion of
                    alloy that may be mixed with gold and silver, and how to separate it. We import
                    from China their native cinnabar; but our vermilion, extracted from it, is not
                    to be compared with theirs for brilliancy and deepness of colour, which is
                    supposed to be given to it by long and patient trituration under water. Again,
                    the beautiful blues on their porcelain are more transparent, deep, and vivid,
                    than the same blues applied to our pottery-ware; yet we supply the Chinese with
                    the same cobalt frits from which our own colours are extracted. It has been
                    supposed that the greater or less brilliancy of the colours used for painting
                    porcelain depends more on the nature of the glaze on which they are laid, than
                    on their own intrinsic merits. Here then we have something still to learn from
                    the Chinese. The biscuit of their porcelain, too, is much superior in whiteness,
                    hardness, and transparency, to any which has been made in Europe. The Swansea
                    porcelain comes the nearest to it in these respects, which is supposed to be
                    owing in some degree to a proportion of magnesian earth being mixed with the
                    aluminous and silicious ingredients. In form and decoration, which depend on a
                    taste and feeling which the Chinese are strangers to, we far surpass them.</p>
                <p>In the cutting of ivory into fans, baskets, pagodas, nests of nine or more hollow
                    movable balls, one within the other, beautifully carved, the artists of Europe
                    cannot pretend to vie with the Chinese; yet it does not appear that they
                    practise any other means than that of working in water with small saws. As
                    little can Europeans pretend to rival their large horn lanterns, of several feet
                    ih diameter, perfectly transparent in every part, without a flaw or opaque spot,
                    and without a seam; yet a small portable stove or furnace, an iron boiler, and a
                    pair of common pincers, are all the tools that are required for the manufacture
                    of those extraordinary machines. In silver fillagree they are at least equal to
                    the Hindus, and their lacquered cabinets and other articles are excelled only in
                    Japan. They are not less expert in cutting tortoise-shell and mother of pearl,
                    and all kinds of gems and stones. They have a method of ornamenting their
                    cabinet wares, tea-chests, and other articles, with spangles laid on with the
                    black varnish in the shape of plants, birds, insects, &amp;c. exhibiting varied
                    iridescent colours, appearing like metallic scales that have undergone the
                    process of heat; but they are nothing more than the thin lamina of a particular
                    species of shell <hi rend="italic">(Helix),</hi> which they have a method of
                    separating by boiling, as they pretend, for the space of half a moon. In all the
                    metals they work with neatness; and if they make not a lock or a hinge that an
                    English artist would look at, it is only because a Chinese would not pay the
                    price of a good one. Their white copper is a metal, or a mixture of metals,
                    unknown in Europe; and though we think that we have ascertained the component
                    parts of the famous gong to be copper, tin, and bismuth, we are yet unable to
                    make a Chinese gong. In works of the loom, and especially in the manufacture of
                    silk and satin cloths, we cannot pretend to cope with them; and their silken
                    twisted eords, tassels, and all kinds of embroidery, in general the labour of
                    females, are extremely beautiful. In the variety of gums, spices, and perfumes,
                    they excel the rest of the world. Our artists can attest the excellence of their
                    ink, and their paper and printing may challenge those of Europe. Many other
                    branches of the mechanical<pb break="no" facs="nls:193354517"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-4517-0578"/> arts might be enumerated, in which the Chinese
                    may consider themselves as second to none; but those already mentioned are
                    sufficient to exemplify their skill in this respect. There are no manufactorics
                    carried on by machinery, or upon a great scale. Generally speaking, each
                    individual in the country spins, weaves, and dyes his own web. It would appear,
                    however, from some regulations laid down in the <hi rend="italic">Leu-lee,</hi>
                    that of porcelain, silks, satins, and certain other articles, government is its
                    own manufacturer. The manufactories of porcelain and the coarser kinds of
                    pottery, for the sake of the coal, are mostly in Kiang-see; and the village of
                    Kin-te-chin, it is said, contains nearly a million of people, all of them
                    engaged in the potteries.</p>
                <p>. There is no subject on which the accounts of the missionaries are so vague and
                    contradictory as that of the population; yet they all affect to refer to
                    official documents. They agree, however, in stating it to be something immense,
                    though the highest number is not equal to two thirds of the enormous mass of
                    333,000,000, which the mandarins attendant on Lord Macartney’s embassy gave to
                    that nobleman as the amount of the population. The inaccuracy, however, not to
                    say impossibility, of that account, is obvious from mere inspection. The numbers
                    in each province are given in round millions, and in two provinces the number of
                    millions is precisely the same. In the <hi rend="italic">General History of
                    China,</hi> the population is frequently stated at different periods, but in a
                    way so loose and vague as to deserve little attention. There can be no doubt,
                    however, that from time to time a census is <hi rend="italic">ordered</hi> to be
                    taken, and the result of it made public; that the number of <hi rend="italic"
                    >mouths</hi> is always included; but that a separate list of the taxable
                    inhabitants only is taken at the same time, and is all perhaps that the
                    government cares about. Thus it is stated, that under Yang-tee, in the 609th
                    year of the Christian era, the empire contained 8,900,000 families, which, at
                    six to each family, would give a population of 53,400,000; but, to show how very
                    little numbers are to be depended on, it is also stated that China at that time
                    was from north to south 14,815 <hi rend="italic">lee,</hi> and from east to west
                    9300 <hi rend="italic">lee,</hi> or 4444 miles by 2790, which is about three
                    times its actual dimensions, or nine times its magnitude.</p>
                <p>Again, it is stated that, in the year 1222, under the reign of Hoei-tsong, before
                    the Tartar conquest, the Board of Taxes ordered a census to be taken, which
                    amounted to 20,882,358families, and46,734,784 persons, or about2 <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> θths to each family,
                    which is absurd. In 1290, after the Tartar conquest, Kublai-khan directed a
                    census to be taken of the taxable population. It amounted to 13,196,206
                    families, comprehending 58,834,711 persons; but it is admitted that the state of
                    the country prevented the whole being taken. In 1502, Shiao-tsong caused a
                    census to be taken, the result of which is stated to have been 53,280,000
                    mouths. There is a strange difference between these numbers and those which are
                    published by Grozier, purporting to be a census of all the people in China,
                    taken in the years 1760 and 1761, in the former of which the list amounts to
                    196,837,977 <hi rend="italic">mouths,</hi> in the latter to 198,214,553, making
                    an increase in one year of 1,376,576 <hi rend="italic">mouths.</hi></p>
                <p>If we are to givecredit to these accounts, we must suppose that the population of
                    China must have attained its prodigious magnitude within the last two or three
                    centuries, and that it must be greatly on the increasc; but we are immediately
                    stopped short from drawing this conclusion, by the translation^ of some
                    statistical accounts of China by Dr Morrison, taken by order of the emperor
                    Kia-king in order to be compared with a similar statement made at the
                    commencement of the reigning dynasty. According to this census, the total
                    population, including the twelve Tartar banners, and all ranks and conditions,
                    great and small, amounts to between 145,000,000 and 146,000,000 of mouths; and
                    this account agrees very exactly with that census taken by Kien-lung in the year
                    1743, and contained in the <hi rend="italic">Yedung-tche,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">All matters concerning China,</hi> a curious work we have before
                    mentioned. By this census the number of heads of families paying taxes is
                    stated, at 28,514,488; which, by reckoning five persons to each family, would
                    give 142,582,440. The number of the literati, the military, and others exempt
                    from taxation, will amply make up the deficiency. Grozier, indeed, by the
                    omissions of Père Amiot, and the exempts as above mentioned, swells the total to
                    157,301,755.</p>
                <p>This enormous population is fed and subsisted, and alii its wants entirely
                    supplied, from China alone. Except a few English broad cloths and metals, a few
                    furs from Russia, and a little cotton from Bombay, it receives but little
                    external supplies. The extent and fertility of the soil are amply sufficient for
                    its demands. China consists of at least one million and a half of square miles,
                    and has about ninety-seven persons to a square mile. Deduct a third for waste
                    lands, lakes, and mountains, and 640,000,000 acres still remain, which give near
                    four and a half acres of land to each individual. The land is subject to an
                    arbitrary tax, generally about one tenth; and, in order to ascertain the
                    revenue, a report was made to Kien-lung in the year 1745, of the amount of land
                    under cultivation. It was as follows:</p>

                    statement, the land under cultivation was about 600 millions of acres.</p>
                <p>The constituent parts of the population of China were anciently considered to
                    consist of four classes; the <hi rend="italic">tse,</hi> or learned, who
                    governed and instructed the rest; thenwn^, or agriculturists, who provided food
                    and materials for clothing the rest; the <hi rend="italic">kung,</hi> artizan or
                    manufacturer, who clothed, and built, and furnished houses for the rest; and the
                    <hi rend="italic">shang,</hi> who distributed and exchanged the productions of
                    the other two among all the classes of society. But nothing like a division into
                    <hi rend="italic">castes</hi> ever appeared in China. On the contrary, every
                    encouragement is held out for the children of the three inferior classes to
                    aspire to the first.</p>
                <p>The numbers of the <hi rend="italic">tse,</hi> or officers and literary men,
                    consisting of the members of the several boards, governors of provinces and
                    cities, judges, treasurers, collectors, commissaries, inspectors, and the like,
                    with an enormous list of subaltern officers, according to Grozier, amount to
                    98,615; and of the literati, who every year take their degrees and qualify for
                    office, there are 24,701; the whole of whom living at any one time cannot, he
                    says, be estimated at less than 494,000. The military officers are also reckoned
                    among the learned; and the number of those who have actual commands amount to
                    7411, each of whom, on an average, employs nine subaltern officers under him;
                    the whole, therefore, of these would amount to 74,110; and the total of the
                    military, or militia, is estimated at 822,621. But one of the officers of
                    government told Père Amiot that the military<pb break="no" facs="nls:193354530"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-4530-0579"/> exceeded two millions; and this agrees pretty
                    nearly with the information given to Lord Macartney.</p>
                <p>A court calendar and an army list are published in Pekin four times a year, each
                    consisting of several volumes; a tolerable proof of the frequent changes that
                    take place in the subordinate movements of this vast machine.</p>
                <p>Tlíe great mass of the people, however, are employed in productive labour;
                    perhaps, on a rough estimate, full two thirds in agriculture and the fisheries;
                    the remaining third, after deducting the military, the civil officers, the
                    students, and candidates for office, amounting, perhaps, on a rough guess, to
                    about ten millions, are manufacturers, tradesmen, shopkeepers, and the
                    multitudes that are employed in the numerous vessels and barges on the rivers
                    and canals, to carry on the internal commerce of the kingdom. Agriculture is the
                    productive labour that has always received the highest encouragement from the
                    government; and occasionally the emperor himself has turned out into the field
                    with great pomp and solemnity, to hold the plough, as an example to the
                    peasantry. Perhaps, however, as Pauw observes, if they would remove all the
                    trammels from agriculture, it would have a better effect than the continuance of
                    this ancient ceremony. These trammels are, however, fewer and lighter than in
                    most countries. One tenth of the estimated produce is all that is required for
                    the state; and they have neither priesthood nor poor to maintain, each family
                    being compelled by law and custom to take care of its poor relations, and the
                    sovereign taking care of the spiritual concerns of his subjects. The monarch may
                    be considered as the universal and exclusive proprietor of the soil. There is no
                    such thing as freeholds; but undisturbed possession is kept, as long as the
                    holder complies with the conditions on which the land was granted. As there are
                    no public funds, and capital vested in trade is not very secure, nor the
                    profession highly esteemed, the purchase of land is the most eligible mode of
                    rendering capital productive. Still there are very few great landed proprietors.
                    Two reasons may be assigned for this; first, the rate of legal interest being as
                    high as three per cent, for a month, it would be ruinous to borrow money on
                    mortgage; and, secondly, it appears by the penal code, that the proprietorship
                    of the landholder is of a very qualified nature, and subject to a degree of
                    interference and control on the part of government, not known under any of the
                    European governments. It can only be disposed of by will, under certain
                    restrictions; the inheritors must share it under certain proportions. If a
                    proprietor should neglect to register his land in the public records, and to
                    acknowledge himself as responsible for the payment of the taxes, such land would
                    become forfeited. If land capable of cultivation be suffered to lie waste,
                    through the inability of the proprietor to till it, another may obtain
                    permission to cultivate it; and the mortgagee becomes responsible for the
                    payment of the taxes, until the land be redeemed by the proprietor. All these
                    restrictions operate against large landed proprietorships.</p>
                <p>Much has been said in praise of Chinese agriculture— much more, in faet, than it
                    deserves. In Europe it would be despised. There are no great farms in China; few
                    families cultivate more than is necessary for their own use, and for payment of
                    the imperial taxes; and without teams of any kind—without any knowledge or
                    practice of a succession of crops—without any grazing farms, for feeding cattle
                    or for the dairy, of which they are totally ignorant— making no use of milk,
                    butter, or cheese—they can have little manure, nor can the land be kept in good
                    condition. In fact, the old fallowing system is followed, and in many parts the
                    spade and the hoe are the great implements of cultivation, their miserable
                    plough scarcely deserving the name. The command of water is the principal
                    substitute for manure. Every substance, however, that can be converted into
                    manure, is most carefully collected; and numbers of old people and children of
                    both sexes find employment in scraping together, with wooden rakes, into their
                    little baskets, whatever may have fallen in the streets or roads, where
                    these</p>

                <p>Leaves, roots, or stems of plants, mud from the sides of canals, and every sort
                    of offal that presents itself, of which human hair, shaven from the scalps of a
                    hundred millions weekly, forms no inconsiderable ingredient, are carefully
                    scraped together. Large earthen vessels are sunk in the ground, to which, it is
                    said, their cattle are taught to retire; and on the outskirts of many towns and
                    villages are small buildings, invitingly placed for the accommodation of
                    passengers who may have occasion to use them. All these resources, however, are
                    very limited, and the utmost supply thus afforded can only serve for
                    horticultural purposes.</p>
                <p>The whole of the land in China under cultivation may be said to be employed
                    exclusively for the subsistence and clothing of man. The staff of life is rice;
                    and it is the chief article of produce in the middle and southern provinces.
                    This grain requires little or no manure; age after age the same piece of ground
                    yields its annual crop, and some of them two crops a year. In the culture of
                    rice, water answers every purpose; and nature has supplied this extensive
                    country most abundantly with that valuable element. It is here that Chinese
                    agricultural skill is most displayed; the contrivances for raising it out of
                    rivers where the banks are high, by means of wheels, long levers, swinging
                    buckets, and the like; or of leading it down from mountain springs, and along
                    terraces levelled on the sides of hills, or in little channels across the
                    plains, are all admirable; but when, from long drought, the rivers run low in
                    their channels, and the springs fail, a scarcity of the crop is the inevitable
                    consequence, and the effects or famine are most dreadful; for though the
                    government has not been wanting in storing up a year’s supply of grain in the
                    public magazines (the produce of the taxes being mostly paid in kind), yet,
                    before the beneficent intentions of the sovereign can be carried into effect,
                    there are so many previous memorials and references necessary, and so many forms
                    of office to pass through, that the mischief has worked its effects before the
                    remedy is applied; and though in this vast empire the scarcity of grain may be
                    local and partial, they have no relief to look to from without, and the system
                    of external commerce is too slow in its operations to throw in a timely supply
                    where it may be most wanted. In the northern provinces, where water is less
                    abundant and less to be depended upon, wheat, barley, buck-wheat, and a great
                    variety of millets, supply the place of rice. Everywhere are met with leguminous
                    plants of different kinds, pumpkins, melons, sweet potatoes, and whole fields of
                    a luxuriant vegetable <hi rend="italic">coX</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">eApei-tsai,</hi> the white herb, apparently a species of brassica,
                    which is salted for winter consumption. In Kiang-nan and Tche-kiang, vast tracts
                    of land are planted with the white mulberry tree, as food for the silk worms.
                    They appear like a young orchard of cherry trees, being kept low by constant
                    pruning, to make them throw out young shoots and fresh supplies of leaves. In
                    all the middle provinces are large fields of cotton, which article supplies the
                    usual clothing of the great mass of the population; in addition to which,
                    immense quantities are imported annually from Bombay. That peculiar species of a
                    yellowish tinge, which we call Nankin, is not worn by the Chinese, at least in
                    its natural colour; blue, brown, and black, are the prevailing colours. Patches
                    of indigo are generally found in the vicinity of the cotton plantations.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354543" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4543-0580"/>
                <p>The tea plant, which forms so important an article for the common beverage of the
                    country, and also for exportation, is cultivated only in particular provinces,
                    and in certain situations; but it is found in gardens and small enclosures in
                    every part of the empire, being very much of the habit and appearance of the
                    broad-leafed myrtle. We scarcely yet know whether the different kinds of tea are
                    from the same plant, or different species of the same genus. The leaf of the
                    sou-chong is broader than that of the hyson; but this seems to constitute the
                    only difference. Both sorts undergo the process of <hi rend="italic"
                    >roasting</hi> in their iron pans; the black in a higher degree of heat than the
                    green, which is sufficient to give a different character to the extractive
                    matter from the two sorts; and the nervous quality usually ascribed to green tea
                    may be owing to the little alteration which the juices of the leaf undergo from
                    the small degree of heat that is used in the process. To procure the fine
                    flavour, the Chinese usually press the green teas into the chests and cannisters
                    while hot. They have a practice also of giving a finer bloom to dull-green teas,
                    by sprinkling a little indigo, mixed with powder of gypsum, while stirring the
                    leaf about in the pan. The different sorts of black and green are not merely
                    from soil, situation, and age of the leaf; but, after winnowing the tea, they
                    are taken up in succession as the leaves fall: those nearest the machine, being
                    the heaviest, form the gunpowder tea; the light dust the worst, being chiefly
                    used by the lower classes. That which is brought down to Canton undergoes there
                    a second roasting, winnowing, packing, &amp;c.; and many hundred women are
                    employed for these purposes, the rate of pay being about fifty of their small
                    copper coins, or fourpence per day. The Chinese say that the best tea is that
                    which is gathered in the morning while the dew is on. The gathering in the hyson
                    countries, Kiang-nan and Fokien, commences about the middle of April, and
                    continues till about the middle of May. The collecting, the rolling, the
                    twisting, and roasting, give employment to a multitude of people. From the berry
                    of the <hi rend="italic">tcha-wha,</hi> or flower of tea <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Camélia</hi><hi rend="italic">sesanqua),</hi> a fine edible oil is extracted.
                    The almond and the <hi rend="italic">Palma Christi</hi> also afford them an oil
                    for culinary purposes. The white wax is the produce of a tree, or rather of a
                    small insect which frequents the tree; and the <hi rend="italic">Croton
                    sebifcrum</hi> yields an excellent vegetable tallow; both of these articles
                    serving them to make candles. In the southern provinces sugar is a common
                    article of cultivation, but it is rather a luxury than an article of common
                    consumption. It is used mostly in a coarse granulated form; but for exportation,
                    and for the upper classes, it is reduced to its crystallized state. Tobacco is
                    universally cultivated, and in universal use by all ages and both sexes. Fruits
                    of every kind abound, but are mostly bad, except the orange and the <hi
                    rend="italic">lee-tchee,</hi> both of which are probably indigenous. The art of
                    grafting is well known; but they do not appear to have taken advantage of this
                    knowledge to the improvement of their fruits? They have also an art, which
                    enables them to take off bearing branches of fruit, particularly of the orange
                    and peach, and transfer them, in a growing state, to pots, for their artificial
                    rocks, and grottoes, and summer-houses. It is simply by removing a ring of the
                    bark, plastering round it a ball of earth, and suspending a vessel of water to
                    drop upon it, until it has thrown out roots into the earth. It would require too
                    much space to describe the various vegetable productions used for food and for
                    clothing, for medicine and for the arts. The climate and the soil are well
                    adapted for producing almost all that the rest of the world affords, except,
                    perhaps, those parts which lie within a few degrees of the equator; and the
                    Chinese have obtained their full share even of them.</p>
                <p>They are exceedingly sparing in the use of animal food. Those important articles
                    of milk, butter, and cheese, are wholly unknown to them. The broad-tailed sheep
                    are kept in the hilly parts of the country, and brought down to the plains; but
                    the two animals most esteemed, because they contribute most to their own
                    subsistence, and are kept at the cheapest rate, are the hog and the duck. Whole
                    swarms of the latter are bred in large barges, surrounded with projecting
                    stages, covered with coops, for the reception of these birds, which are taught,
                    by the sound of a whistle, to jump into the rivers and canals in search of food,
                    and by another call to return to their lodgings. They are usually hatched by
                    placing their eggs, as the ancient Egyptians were wont to do, in small ovens, or
                    sand-baths, in order that the same female may continue to lay eggs throughout
                    the year, which would not be the case if she had a young brood to attend. The
                    ducks, when killed, are usually split open, salted, and dried in the sun, in
                    which state they afford an excellent relish to rice or other vegetables.</p>
                <p>The fisheries are free to all; there are no restrictions on any of the great
                    lakes, the rivers, or canals. The subject is not once mentioned in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Leu-lee</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but the heavy duties on salt
                    render the use of salt fish in China almost unknown. Besides the net, the line,
                    and the spear, the Chinese have several ingenious methods of catching fish. In
                    the middle parts of the empire, the fishing corvorant, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pelicanus piscator,</hi> is almost universally in use; in other parts, they
                    catch them by torch-light; and a very common practice is, to place a board
                    painted white along the edge of the boat, which, reflecting the moon’s rays into
                    the water, induces the fish to spring towards it, supposing it to be a moving
                    sheet of water, when they fall into the boat.</p>
                <p>When animal food fails them, the Chinese make no scruple in eating lizards,
                    toads, grubs, cats, rats, mice, and many other nauseous creatures. The naked
                    Egyptian dog is commonly exposed for sale in the market. But rice, the hog, and
                    the duck, may be considered as the staple articles of human subsistence for the
                    great mass of the population. Those who can afford it indulge in every species
                    of luxury, and more especially in gelatinous soups, which, while they pamper the
                    appetite, are supposed to excite the passions, and to increase their corpulency,
                    which, in their ideas, confers a degree of respectability and dignity to which a
                    small meagre figure can never arrive.</p>
                <p>No country in the world is better adapted, from situa-, tion, climate, and
                    products, for extensive commerce, than China; yet no civilized country has
                    profited less by these advantages. «The happy distribution of its numerous
                    rivers, aided by artificial canals, affords an almost uninterrupted water
                    communication from the northern to the southern, and from the western to the
                    eastern extremities of this grand empire; and thus a facility is given for the
                    interchange of the products of one province with those of another, unknown in
                    any other country, and unequalled even in Great Britain. But the commerce that
                    exists is principally that of barter; no system of credit is established between
                    the merchants of distant provinces; no bills of exchange; no circulating medium
                    of any kind, as a common measure of value, excepting a small copper coin, of the
                    value of the thousandth part of 6s. 8d., or about one third of a farthing. The
                    multitudes of barges of different sorts and sizes, which vary in their
                    construction on almost every river, are incredible. The Chinese are rarely to be
                    trusted where numbers are concerned; but they are probably not far amiss in
                    stating that the number of imperial barges employed in the grand canal and its
                    lateral branches, for the purpose of collecting and distributing among the
                    public granaries the rice and grain paid in kind as taxes, amounts to 10,000,
                    or, as they express it, where they mean <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354556"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-4556-0581"/>to be correct, to 9999. A vast number of vessels
                    are also employed in conveying the copper currency from place to place, wherever
                    it may be wanted; others in collecting the silks, cottons, and various articles
                    of taxes, paid in kind, and depositing them in the public magazines; and the
                    salt barges alone are probably not less numerous than those which carry grain.
                    It was calculated that the depot of salt accumulated at Tien-sing for the use of
                    the capital and the northern provinces, was sufficient for a year’s consumption
                    for thirty millions of people. This was all brought up, in the course of the
                    summer, from the seacoast of Tche-kiang and Fokien, in seagoing vessels. Cakes
                    of coal-dust and turf, for fuel, and cakes made up of various ingredients for
                    garden manure, employ a multitude of barges; and when to these are added the
                    various kinds of vessels employed in general commerce, in the conveyance of
                    passengers and baggage, in breeding ducks, and in the fisheries of the interior,
                    we may be sure that the number of persons who constantly reside upon the water
                    amounts to many millions, and are probably equal to the whole population of
                    Great Britain. It may be doubted if these are included in any census.</p>
                <p>All foreign commerce is systematically discouraged. The extent, fertility, and
                    variety of their soil and climate, happily situated between the extremes of heat
                    and cold, partaking of the advantages of both, without experiencing the
                    inconveniences of either, supply the Chinese with the productions of almost all
                    the world besides, whether to minister to the necessities, the comforts, or the
                    luxuries of their numerous population; and leave this great empire, as a nation,
                    completely independent of foreign supplies through the medium of commerce.
                    Satisfied, or affecting to be satisfied, with the prodigal bounty of nature,
                    jealous of strangers, and governed by a gradation of arbitrary despots, the
                    Chinese consider it as a favour bestowed on foreigners to open one of their
                    ports for the interchange of commodities. The revenue derived from this limited
                    intercourse is of little or no importance at the chief seat of government. The
                    largest estimate that can be made of the value of the whole of their foreign
                    commerce, and the largest computation of revenue flowing from it into the
                    imperial treasury, is but as a drop in the ocean. Individual and local interests
                    might and would most materially be affected by any prohibition of an intercourse
                    which has now subsisted for a century and a half; but the government pays little
                    regard to the prosperity or misery of a particular province. The interested
                    views of individuals may, for a time, keep up a trade which is at variance with
                    the general rule of policy prescribed by the laws; and the frequent discussions
                    with the English, whose power they are aware of and dread, will most probably
                    determine them ultimately to close Canton against all foreigners. The English
                    they will not venture particularly to exclude, though they know that other
                    nations would take their articles of produce without forcing upon them European
                    broad cloths, which they affect not to want, but would give them specie, which
                    is, of all other things, what they most desire. The English, however, by their
                    highly improper conduct, not long ago endangered the privilege of foreigners
                    resorting to Canton. Fortunately, by the removal of the aggressor, and a
                    reference to Pekin, which produced a permission to continue the trade, on
                    conditions sufficiently humiliating, a recurrence to naval and military force,
                    threatened on our part, was avoided, and the impolicy and injustice of such a
                    measure rendered unnecessary.</p>
                <p>The luxuries, however, which wealth requires, have forced a foreign trade by
                    their own subjects with the nations of the East, as well as with Europe. A very
                    extensive intercourse is carried on by them with Japan, the Philippine Islands,
                    Java, Sumatra, Timor, Gelolo, and the great island of Borneo, in all of which
                    are found multi tudesof Chinese, living in habits of peaceful industry, in th«
                    midst of the more idle and less civilized natives, conduct ing the concerns of
                    trade, cultivating the ground, and ex ercising all the various branches of the
                    mechanical arts in no place, however, varying in the smallest degree thei
                    original character. But though the Chinese spread them selves over every part of
                    the Asiatic, and into many of th« Polynesian islands, there seems to be no
                    reciprocity o commerce by the vessels of those countries visiting th« ports of
                    China, excepting some ten or twelve junks tha annually visit the southern ports
                    of Fokien from Japan, am perhaps as many from Cochin-China. “From Canton,’ says
                    Lord Macartney, “to Ten-chou-foo, at the entrance of the Gulf of Pe-tche-lee (to
                    say nothing of the country within the gulf itself), is an extent of coast of
                    near twe thousand miles, indented with innumerable harbours, many of them
                    capable of admitting the largest European ships, and all of them safe and
                    sufficiently deep for the vessels of the country. Every creek or haven has a
                    town or city upon it; the inhabitants, who abound beyond credibility, are mostly
                    of a trafficking mercantile cast, and a great pari of them, from their necessary
                    employment in the fishery, which supplies them with a principal article of their
                    subsistence, are accustomed to the sea, and the management of shipping.” Yet
                    with all these advantages, all foreign commerce in foreign bottoms is
                    interdicted to these people; whatever they wish to import must be fetched by
                    themselves; and the articles thus brought in are numerous and of considerable
                    value. Thus from Java alone they import birds’ nests to the value of half a
                    million dollars annually: the sea slug or biche-de-mer <hi rend="italic"
                    >(holothuria),</hi> from the coast of New Holland, Timor, and adjoining islands,
                    to a still greater extent; sharks’ fins from the same quarter; copper from
                    Japan, and tin from Bantam; pepper, areca nut, spices of different kinds, ebony,
                    sandal wood, red wood for dyeing, tortoise-shell, pearl-shell, coral, camphor,
                    wax, and a variety of articles, generally produced or collected by their own
                    countrymen resident in the islands of the East.</p>
                <p>When Lange, who accompanied Ismaeloff, the Russian ambassador, asked permission
                    for his nation to establish factories in all the provinces, the reply of the
                    emperor was, “I allow you to remain here (Pekin), and other foreigners at
                    Canton, so long as you and they give me no cause of complaint; but if this
                    should ever be the case, I will suffer neither you to remain here, nor them at
                    Canton ;” so very indifferent does the court affect to be about foreign
                    commerce. In the whole of this extensive empire there are but two places where
                    the natives have any intercourse with Europeans, at Canton with the crews of the
                    several maritime powers, and at Kiackta with the Russians; and this intercourse
                    is chiefly confined at the former to a select number of men, appointed or
                    licensed by the government; at the latter it takes place only under special
                    directions of the government itself, through merchants appointed under the seal
                    of the emperor. Of the instructions given to these merchants the Russians
                    procured a copy some years ago, though the punishment for betraying them is
                    condemnation to track the imperial barges for life; and a more singular document
                    was never issued by any government. It confirms all that has been said of the
                    meanness arid knavery of this proud and insolent people; and as it has not
                    appeared in print, a summary of it may prove amusing, and may serve to show, at
                    the same time, the notions entertained by the Chinese with regard to the conduct
                    of foreign commerce.</p>
                <p>It sets out by stating that the aim of every nation, trading with other
                    countries, is to prevent the advantage being on the side of the foreign nation;
                    to do this the more effectually', and to establish harmony and frankness, “all
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354569" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4569-0582"/> the letters
                    received by any one of the licensed merchants from their partners are to be
                    opened in a public assembly, that they may act in concert against the Russians.”
                    2. That as the general principles of commerce require that prices and demands
                    should be foreseen, means must be taken to ascertain what articles the Russians
                    are in want of, and what prices they fetch in Russia; what supplies they may
                    have or expect in the market, and what value they bear in Russia. Every one is
                    therefore to strive with all his might to get at this information, and lay it
                    before a general meeting, when the president will give to each merchant a note
                    of the quantities of each article, and of the prices he is to buy at, and of
                    those articles which he is to withhold from the Russians. 3. That the Chinese
                    market is to be kept scantily supplied, and Russian goods not eagerly sought,
                    that the trade may be of importance to them, and the commerce advantageous to
                    China. 4. That care be taken that the quantity of Chinese goods should appear
                    always less than that of the Russians; and that no fresh goods be brought into
                    the market before all the old stock be sold off. 6. That no eagerness be shown
                    in the purchase of Russian goods, how much soever any individual of the
                    merchants may be in want of them, “for the interest of the whole company is not
                    to be sacrificed to that of an individual.” 7. That when the Russians have a
                    scanty supply of any article that may be likely to meet with a considerable
                    demand in China, a great eagerness is to be shown to buy up the whole; the
                    Russians are to be told that China is very much in want of the said article, and
                    one merchant is to outbid the other, and, when bought, they are to divide the
                    quantity among themselves. 8. That the Russians, thus tempted by the high
                    prices, and the assurance given them of the great demand, will cause large
                    supplies to be brought to market, when they arc to be told that the article is
                    no longer in request in China, &amp;c., and thus the goods will be obtained at a
                    cheap rate from the foreigners, to the great advantage of the whole nation. 9.
                    Whenever the Russian merchants shall attempt to raise the prices of any
                    commodity in consequence of its scarcity, every obstacle must be thrown in their
                    way for the space of a month; and if they will not lower the prices, the whole
                    trade must be suspended; and if, on complaint of the merchants, the Russian
                    government should interfere, it will not be attended to, and the answer will be,
                    that the commerce between the two nations shall cease. The 10th article contains
                    an impudent falsehood: it instructs them not only to tell the Russians that the
                    quantities of the several articles on hand are much less than they really are,
                    but that “China does not produce silk and cotton.” The 11 th article directs
                    them to carry on all their intereourse in the Russian language, which every one
                    engaged in the trade must learn, in order to prevent the Russians from feeling
                    the necessity of learning the Chinese language, and by that means “of
                    discovering the secrets of the trade, or those of the government,” by
                    overhearing conversations, &amp;c. The 12th directs them to treat the Russians
                    politely; permits reciprocal visits; but forbids a Chinese to pass a night in a
                    Russian house; directs, that in these visits each should endeavour to learn
                    something about the affairs of the Russian government, and according to the
                    importance of the information obtained will be the value of the reward. The 13th
                    directs, that a new merchant arriving at Mai-mai-chin is not to do any business
                    for a whole year, but merely to look on and learn the nature of the trade, “for
                    fear he should, by some mistake, break the thread of the whole.” The 14th and
                    15th prohibit gold and silver, manûfaetured copper and iron, from being
                    exchanged, and the introduction of all articles of luxury, of goods manufactured
                    in China, and of wine and spirituous liquors. 16th, “The secrets of our trade in
                    the interior, as well as of that on the spot, must not be revealed, that this
                    indiscretion may not occasion a rise in their prices, and a fall in ours, and
                    therehy injure our empire and the trade of our subjects.” The eight remaining
                    articles prescribe the various punishments for disobedience of the foregoing
                    instructions, from a reprimand to that of death. The 22d runs thus: “Whoever
                    betrays to the Russ⅛ns the secrets of our commerce in the interior, or the
                    prices of Russian products in the interior, or the demand for them, the quantity
                    he holds himself, or that others hold at Kiackta, or that may be on the road
                    thither, shall be banished from Kiackta for ever, and be sent to the galleys for
                    three years; but whosoever betrays to them <hi rend="italic">these
                    instructions</hi> verbally, or in effect, or by deed, shall be sent to the
                    galleys for life.” And by the 23d, “Whoever betrays the secrets of the
                    government which are not to be known by the Russians, shall be beheaded, not,
                    however, without the sanction of the emperor." We know very little of the value
                    of the trade carried on at this place in this extraordinary manner. It consists
                    chiefly in exchange, on the part of Russia, of fur and various kinds of peltry,
                    horses, drugs, &amp;c., for tea, silks, nankeens, porcelain, lacquered ware, and
                    other small articles similar to those imported by England. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Prom a Russian MS.}</hi></p>
                <p>The principal mart for foreign commerce is that of Canton, the only port, in
                    fact, which is open for foreigners. For the last twenty years the foreign
                    commerce of this port was almost exclusively in the hands of the English and the
                    Americans. The English commerce consisted of two distinct branches; the one
                    direct from England, and a complete monopoly of the East India Company; the
                    other indirectly carried on by individuals from the several presidencies of
                    India, chiefly from Bombay. The Chinese system of conducting their foreign trade
                    at Canton is somewhat different from that of Kiackta. It is a monopoly confided
                    to a certain number of persons, known by the name of Hong merchants; <hi
                    rend="italic">hong</hi> being the name of the large factories or masses of
                    buildings surrounding square courts similar to our old inns, or the
                    caravanserais of the East. Each nation has its separate hong, and the whole
                    being arranged along the bank of a fine river, with abroad quay in their front,
                    their appearance has a grand effect from the opposite side. The river is at
                    least as broad as the Thames åt London, and for the distance of four or five
                    miles it is crowded by Chinese vessels of all descriptions, which, from the
                    multitude of people constantly residing in them, may be considered as a floating
                    city. Foreign vessels are not allowed to approach nearer to Canton than Whampoo,
                    which is about fifteen miles down the river.</p>
                <p>The Chinese levy no specific duties on the articles imported, nor <hi
                    rend="italic">ad valorem</hi> duties on the eargoes; the only impost is on the
                    ship itself, and is estimated by a rule as absurd as it is partial and unequal.
                    They measure the length from the centre of the fore-mast to the centre of the
                    mizen-mast, and the breadth is taken close abaft the mainmast. The length is
                    then multiplied by the breadth, and the product, divided by ten, gives the
                    measurement of the ship. All ships, according to this measurement, are classed
                    under first, second, or third rates; all other vessels, however small, are
                    classed as third rates. By this rule a ship of a hundred tons would pay from
                    4000 to 5000 dollars, and a ship of a thousand not above double that sum.</p>
                <p>When a ship arrives at Canton she is immediately consigned to one of the hong
                    merchants, who is responsible to the government for the good conduct of her
                    commander anderew during her stay in the river. Through his hands all her cargo
                    must pass, and by him the return cargo must be supplied. By long experience of
                    the honourable manner in which the servants of the East India Company conduct<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193354582" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4582-0583"/> their concerns, a
                    degree of mutual confidence has been established, which is unknown even in
                    Europe. Not a bale of cloth, nor a package of any kind, is ever opened to be
                    examined, but is received and passed from hand to hand, the Company’s mark being
                    a suflicient guarantee of its answering the description in the invoice; the same
                    confidence prevails on our part; and though the Chinese attach no dishonour to
                    roguery in trade, few packages of teas, silks, nankeens, or other articles, are
                    received in England which are not conformable with the samples. This, however,
                    was not the case originally, nor is it so yet in purchases made by individuals;
                    but as the hong merchants take back any article not answering to the description
                    given of it, anci return it to the person who supplied the same, the inducement
                    to cheat the Company is taken away. Some of the hong merchants accumulate
                    fortunes which, for their magnitude, are unknown in Europe; others become
                    bankrupt, in which case, as they are all appointed by government, the rest find
                    it expedient to compound with their creditors, and, by such arrangements as may
                    mutually be agreed upon, undertake to liquidate by instalments the whole debt.
                    At the close of every season there is generally a balance in the hands of the
                    hong merchants due to the East India Company, from half a million to a million
                    sterling, and as much more due to individuals trading on their own bottoms. The
                    hong merchants plead the necessity of retaining this balance, in order to enable
                    them to make advances to the teagrowers, silk and cotton manufacturers, &amp;c.
                    who, as in lndia, are persons of small capitals, and require these advances to
                    raise their respective products.</p>
                <p>The articles exported to China by the East India Company consist of broad cloth,
                    long cloths, camblets, furs, lead, tin, copper, &amp;c. but the chief article is
                    broad cloth. The commanders and officers of the Company’s ships have the
                    privilege of taking out certain articles, such as peltry, glass, clocks,
                    watches, cutlery, coral, prints, and paintings, &amp;c. The principal article of
                    import from China is tea. The rest of the cargo consists of nankeens and raw
                    silk. The minor articles of porcelain, lacquered and ivory goods, tutenague,
                    mother of pearl, drugs, cinnabar, &amp;c. are chiefly confined to the private
                    trade.</p>
                <p>The Chinese appear to have no regular established system of credit among
                    themselves, and the only circulating medium in the shape of coin, is a small
                    piece of base metal (copper, tin, or lead mixed), of the value of the
                    one-thousandth part of six shillings and eightpence, of little more intrinsic
                    value, in fact, than a cowrie shell, which the Chinese, as well as the Hindoos,
                    would seem once to have used; as the same character in their language which
                    signifies a <hi rend="italic">shell</hi> signifies also money and wealth, and it
                    enters into the composition of characters which represent <hi rend="italic"
                    >buying, selling, paying,</hi> &amp;c. Silver in small ingots is used in
                    commerce, but they have no determinate value, the price fluctuating with the
                    demand, as in other articles of commerce. The high rate of interest operates as
                    a discouragement to mercantile speculations, and the rigour of corporal
                    punishment is added with the view, as it would appear, of deterring the must
                    hardy speculator. The law says, “whoever shall lend either money or goods, shall
                    only receive three parts in the hundred per month,” and that “how much soever
                    may be suffered to accumulate, the capital shall remain the same.” It is lent
                    from month to month, anti if the lender should complain of the interest not
                    being punctually paid, the borrower is subject to the punishment of ten stripes
                    of the bamboo the first month, twenty the second, and so on. While this
                    exhor-bitant rate of interest, and the penalties attached to the law of usury,
                    operate against all speculation among the Chinese, the Europeans resident at
                    Canton have availed themselves of the opportunity of increasing their fortunes
                    at the expense of the hong merchants, and at the risk of losing both capital and

                    the country, the buildings, and the! people, so totally different from any thing
                    he had before’ seen, that he might fancy himself to be transported into a new
                    world. In the long line of internal navigation between the capital and Canton,
                    of 1200 miles, with but one short interruption, he will observe every variety of
                    surface, but disposed in a very remarkable manner in great masses. For many days
                    he will see nothing but one uniform extended plain, without the smallest
                    variety; again, for as many days, he will be hemmed in between precipitous
                    mountains of the same naked character, and as unvaried in their appearance as
                    the plains; and, lastly, ten or twelve days sail among lakes, swamps, and
                    morasses, will complete the catalogue of monotonous uniformity. But whether he
                    crosses the dry plains of Petcheli and Shantung, abounding with cotton and all
                    the varieties of grain and pulse,—the more varied surface of Kiang-nan, fertile
                    in silk, in yellow cotton, in fruits, in the staple commodity of grain, and in
                    every thing that constitutes the luxuries, the comforts, and the necessities of
                    the people,—the dreary swamps, morasses, and extensive lakes of the northern
                    part of Kiang-see, where men subsist by fishing,—or its naked and picturesque
                    mountains to the southward, famous for its porcelain manufactories ;—or whether
                    he descend to the fertile plains of Quang-tung, on which almost all the
                    vegetable products of the East may be said to be concentrated, —the grand
                    characteristic feature is still the same, namely, a redundant population.
                    Everywhere he meets with large masses of people, but mostly of one sex;
                    thousands of men in a single group, without a single woman mixing among them—men
                    whose long gowns and petticots give them the appearance of the softer sex;
                    whilst these are sparingly seen at a distance in the background, peeping over
                    the mud-walls, or partially hid behind trees or bushes; and their short jackets
                    and trowsers would make them pass for men among strangers, if their braided
                    hair, stuck full of flowers, and their little cramped and bandaged feet, did not
                    betray their sex. He will be pleased with the unequivocal marks of good humour
                    which prevail in every crowd, uninterrupted and unconcerned by the bawling of
                    some unhappy victim suffering under the lash of magisterial correction; and he
                    will be amused at the awkward exertions of the softer sex to hobble out of sight
                    when taken by surprise; but his slumbers will be interrupted on the nights of
                    the full moon by the nocturnal orgies of squibs and crackers, gongs and
                    trumpets, and other accompaniments of boisterous mirth.</p>
                <p>A constant succession of large villages, towns, and cities, with high walls,
                    lofty gates, and more lofty pagodas,—large navigable rivers, communicating by
                    artificial canals, both crowded with barges for passengers and barks for burden,
                    as different from each other, in every river and every canal, as they are all
                    different from any thing of the kind in the rest of the world,—will present to
                    the traveller an animated picture of activity, industry, and commerce. He will
                    behold, in the lakes and morasses, every little islet crowned with villages and
                    mud hovels. He will observe birds (the <hi rend="italic">leu-tse,</hi> or
                    cormorant) catching fish; and men in the water, with jars on their head, fishing
                    for birds. He will see shoals of ducks issuing from floating habitations,
                    obedient to the sound of a whistle; carts on the land, driven by the wind; and
                    barges on the water, moving by wheels, like those of late years invented in
                    Europe for propelling the steam-boats. Among other strange objects, he will
                    observe, at every ten or twelve <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354595"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-4595-0584"/>miles, small military guard-houses, with a few
                    soldiers fantastically dressed in paper helmets and quilted petticots, making
                    use of the fan, if the weather be warm, and falling on their knees if an officer
                    of rank should pass them. He will observe that the meanest hut, with walls of
                    clay, and a roof of thatch, is built on the same plan, and of the same shape,
                    with the palace of the viceroy, constructed of blue bricks, and its tiled roof
                    supported on pillars. He will notice that the luxury of glass is wanting in the
                    windows of both; and that, whilst one admits a free passage to the air, the
                    other but imperfectly resists the weather, and as imperfectly admits the light,
                    whether through oiled paper, silk gauze, pearl shell, or horn.</p>
                <p>Nothing, perhaps, will more forcibly arrest the attention of the traveller than
                    the general nakedness of the country as to trees and hedge-rows, the latter of
                    which have no existence, and the former exist only in clumps near the dwellings
                    of the public officers, or the temples of Fo, or Tao-tse. No green meadows will
                    meet his eye; no cattle enliven the scene; the only herbage is on the narrow
                    ridges which divide the plots of grain or the brown fallow, as in the common
                    fields of England. The terraced hills he will probably observe to be terminated
                    with a clump of trees, or a pagoda, the only objects in the distance that catch
                    the eye. But the bridges on the canals, •of every variety of shape, circular,
                    elliptical, horse-shoe, Gothic, slight and unstable as they are, are objects
                    that, by their novelty and variety, must attract notice; and the monumental
                    architecture, which adorns the cemeteries under every form, from the lowly
                    tent-shaped dwelling to the loftiest column—the elevated terraces, supported by
                    semicircular walls—and the round hillocks, which, in their graduated size, point
                    out that of the father, the mother, and the children, according to seniority—are
                    among the most interesting objects that China affords.</p>
                <p>If by chance he should be admitted within the gates of one of their great cities,
                    as Pekin, Nankin, Sau-tcheou-foo, Hong-tcheou-foo, or Canton, he may fancy
                    himself, from the lowhouses with curved overhanging roofs, uninterrupted by a
                    single chimney, the pillars, poles, flags, and streamers, to have got into the
                    midst of a large encampment. The glitter arising from the gilding, the
                    varnishing, and the painting, in vivid colours, that adorn the fronts of the
                    shops, and, in particular, the gaily painted lanterns of horn, muslin, silk, and
                    paper; the busy multitude all in motion, and all of one sex; the painted and
                    gilded inscriptions, that, in announcing the articles dealt in, assure the
                    passengers that “they don’t cheat here ;” the confused noise of tinkers,
                    cobblers, and blacksmiths, in their little portable workshops; the buying,
                    selling, bartering, and bawling, of different wares; the processions of men
                    carrying home their new-married wives, with a long train of presents, and
                    squalling and noisy music, or carrying to the grave some deceased relation, with
                    most lamentable howlings; the mirth and bursts of laughter occasioned by
                    jugglers, conjurors, mountebanks, quack-doctors, musicians, and comedians—in the
                    midst of all which is constantly heard a strange twanging noise from the
                    barbers’ tweezers, like the jarring sound of a cracked Jew’s harp; the
                    magistrates and officers, attended by their lictors, and a numerous retinue
                    bearing flags, umbrellas, painted lanterns, and other strange insignia of their
                    rank and office;—all these present to the eyes and ears of a stranger a novel
                    and interesting spectacle. The noise and bustle of this busy multitude commence
                    with day-light, and cease only with the setting of the sun; after which scarcely
                    a whisper is heard, and the streets are entirely deserted.</p>
                <p>Towards the central parts of China, near to the places where the two great
                    rivers, the Whang-ho and the Yang-tse-kiang, intersect the grand canal, a scene,
                    magnificent beyond description, will arrest the attention of the traveller. Here
                    he will find himself in the midst of bustle and business. The multitudes of
                    ships of war, of commerce, of convenience, and of pleasure, some gliding down
                    the stream towards the sea, others working against it by sails, oars, or wheels,
                    and others lying at anchor; the banks on either side, as well as those of the
                    canals, covered with towns as far as the eye can reach; the continuance along
                    the canals of cities, towns,· and villages, almost without interruption; the
                    vast number of light stone bridges, of one, two, and three arches; the temples
                    occurring in frequent succession, with their double and triple tiers of roofs;
                    the Pei-los, or triple gateways, in commemoration of some honest man or chaste
                    virgin; the face of the surrounding country, beautifully diversified with hill
                    and dale, and every part of it in the highest state of cultivation; the
                    apparently happy condition of the numerous inhabitants, indicated by their
                    cheerful looks and substantial clothing, chiefly in silk ;—such are the scenes
                    which presented themselves to our countrymen who composed the embassy of the
                    Earl of Macartney, and were afterwards repeated to those who accompanied Lord
                    Amherst.</p>
                <p>He would probably be mistaken, however, in inferring the general happy state of
                    the people, or beautiful appearance of the country, from what might occur along
                    this great line of communication between the northern and southern extremities
                    of the empire. The Dutch embassy setting out in winter, when the canals were
                    frozen, proceeded by a different route, and the inconveniences they suffered,
                    as. described by Van Braam, are such as can scarcely be credited to have
                    occurred in any nation removed but a few degrees from the savage state. The face
                    of the country was dreary, without a visible trace of cultivation, or a hovel of
                    any kind, for the space of eight or ten miles together. In many parts the
                    surface was covered with water, and the mud hovels completely melted down. Very
                    few cities, towns, or villages, occurred in their route, and those were almost
                    universally in a ruinous condition. Near to the capital they passed a city
                    exhibiting only a mass of ruins. It was not before they had crossed the Yellow
                    River that the prints of wheel carriages marked out the road. The people
                    everywhere appeared indigent and oppressed, equally destitute of the feelings of
                    humanity and hospitality. The Dutch were carried in small bamboo chairs, each
                    having four bearers, so weak and tottering that they could seldom go through the
                    day’s journey; and it frequently happened that they halted in the middle of a
                    cold night, in an open uninhabited part of the country, exposed to all the
                    inclemency of the weather, without a hovel of any kind to afford them shelter;
                    and when they reached the end of the day’s journey, the lodgings appropriated
                    for their reception were so miserable, admitting on all sides the wind, rain, or
                    snow, that they generally preferred taking a little rest in their bamboo chairs.
                    They observed on the road old men and young women travelling in wheelbarrows,
                    sometimes in litters or chairs carried by a couple of asses, one being fixed
                    between the poles before and one behind. The rivers were without bridges, and
                    crossed, when not fordable, by rafts of bamboo. All this is corroborated in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Voyage a Peking,</hi> by M. de Guignes; and hence it may be
                    concluded that China, like other countries, has its fertile and its desolate
                    districts, and that much information is yet required to form a competent notion'
                    of the real state and condition of this mighty empire. (Staunton’s <hi

                <p>One thing at least is quite certain, that a traveller in the best and most
                    frequented parts would look in vain for <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354608"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-4608-0585"/>the least trace of these enchanting gardens, of
                    which Sir William Chambers and his friend Lepqua, the painter of Canton, aided
                    by another brother of the brush, Frère Attiret, Jesuit and painter to the
                    emperor of China, have put together so fanciful a description. Sir William saw,
                    what Europeans generally see in Canton, the shops in China-street, the quay, on
                    which the foreign factories are situated, and perhaps a small mean garden, at
                    the head of the first reach of the river, to which strangers are permitted, as a
                    great favour, to go and buy parcels of lettuce and turnip seeds, neatly packed
                    up, and sold as rare and curious flowers; and the French Jesuit’s taste and
                    accuracy may be estimated from his own statement, that “the face of the country
                    from Canton to Pekin is very indifferent; and though six or seven hundred
                    leagues (it is four hundred) nothing occurs worthy of attention.” He tells us,
                    it is true, that he was shut up in a kind of close cage, which they laboured to
                    persuade him was a litter, and that he arrived in Pekin without having seen any
                    thing at all on the journey.</p>
                <p>With the exception of the imperial gardens of Gehol and Yuen-min-yuen, there is
                    not, perhaps, in all China a piece of ornamental ground of the extent of three
                    acres’; and a traveller may pass the whole distance in the open air, which Frère
                    Attiret did in his eage, without seeing a single one of any extent. If he should
                    chance to get a peep within the inclosing walls of those lodges set apart for
                    the residence of the emperor when he travels, or of the habitation of some
                    magistrate or wealthy merchant, he will probably find a square court of a rood
                    or two of ground behind the women’s apartments, concealed completely from public
                    view, in which two or three little fishponds have their margins fantastically
                    broken by shapeless masses of rock, or cut so as to resemble rugged mountains in
                    miniature; among which, planted in concealed earthen vessels, are dwarfish
                    trees, proportioned in size to the pigmy mountains, and bearing all the marks of
                    venerable age; causing new roots to strike in old branches, twisting and bending
                    them into particular forms and directions, wounding the stem, and smearing it
                    with sugar, to attract the ant and other insects. Among these rocks are narrow
                    paths almost impassable, with holes anderevices here and there to peep through,
                    just to catch a glimpse of some piece of stagnant water, on the shore of which
                    is a wooden temple, a bridge, a pavilion,—or perhaps to view a remarkable piece
                    of rock. Within the water, if large enough, an island with its pagoda will
                    probably be placed; or, as occupying less space, the imitation of a passageboat
                    stuck upon piles, and fitted up with appropriate apartments, kitehen, &amp;c. In
                    the recesses of the rocks are seats or small summer-houses, opposite to which
                    are parterres of various flowers growing in sunken pots, which can thus be
                    replaced by others in bloom, according to the season of the year; and where
                    there is space, the peach, the orange, the lee-tchce, and other fruit trees, are
                    introduced. From the boundary wall a roof is generally projected, supported on
                    wooden pillars, which forms a covered gallery to walk in; gravel walks are out
                    of the question, and would be wholly inconsistent with the feelings and usage of
                    a nation, the women of which, for whose recreation these gardens are chiefly
                    designed, cannot walk, and whose male population of the upper ranks are too
                    indolent to walk. In short, where seerecy is so desirable, where enjoyments are
                    stolen, and walking is considered as drudgery, seats and concealed recesses are
                    best suited to the comfort and convenience of the people. If a Chinese acts on
                    any principle, it is that of producing the greatest possible variety in the
                    least possible space. He is indebted to nature for many of the most beautiful
                    shrubs and flowers which she has bestowed on man for the gratification of the
                    sense of sight or smell. Various species of camélia, poeonia, chrysanthemum,
                    asters, roses, and a numerous list of the choicest flowers, gratify the eye;
                    while the <hi rend="italic">Pergularia odoratissima,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Olea</hi><hi rend="italic">fragrans,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Petrospo-rum

                    their fragrance around. The sacred Nelumbium breaks the surface of the water
                    with its peltate leaves and showy flowers, and the elegant bamboo and the water
                    eyprus (<hi rend="italic">Cupressus pendula),</hi> like the weeping willow, give
                    concealment to their seats of retirement, whether for ease or sensuality.</p>
                <p>Throughout this extensive empire, embracing so great a variety of climate, the
                    physical and moral characters of the people remain as fixed and unchangeable as
                    the laws and customs, from which, in fact, they receive their colour. Such is
                    the force of ancient usage, and the dread of innovation, that a Chinese never
                    stops to inquire what he ought to do on any pressing emergency, but what Yao and
                    Chun did in a similar case four thousand years ago. Time, in fact, may be said
                    to stand still in China. Here not only the system of morals, of social
                    intercourse, of jurisprudence, of government, is the same now as it was three
                    thousand years ago, but the cut of their robes, their houses and furniture, are
                    precisely the same; so that if custom has exercised its dominion over this
                    singular people, they have at least been freed from the tyranny of fashion. Here
                    a young lady may safely wear the head-dress of her great-grandmother, without
                    the imputation of being singular or old fashioned. One of the missionaries
                    observes, <hi rend="italic">Parcourez l’empire de la Chine, tout vous semblera
                    fondée dans le même creuset, et façonne par le même moule.</hi> No fault can be
                    found with the metal or the mould in which it is cast. The general stature of
                    the Chinese is about that which in Europe we call the middle size; few tall men
                    are to be found among them, and fewer dwarfs or deformed persons; but they are
                    distinguished by many physical peculiarities, as the narrow, elongated,
                    half-closed eye, the linear and highly arched eye-brow; the broad root of the
                    nose; the projection of the upper jaw a little beyond the lower; the thin
                    straggling beard, and the body generally free from hair; a high conical head and
                    triangular face; and these are the peculiar characteristics which obtained for
                    them, in the <hi rend="italic">Systema</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturae</hi> of
                    Linnaeus, a place among the varieties of the species distinguished by the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">homines monstrosi.</hi></p>
                <p>Every individual, without exception, plaits his strong black hair into a long
                    tail, something like the lash of a whip, extending below the waist, sometimes to
                    the calf of the leg. This tail grows from the crown of the head, the rest of the
                    scalp being closely shaven. The hair of the beard is pulled out till nearly the
                    age of forty, when its growth is encouraged, and, being an indication of age, is
                    considered as a mark of respect. The great mass of the people is decently and
                    substantially clothed; the upper and middle classes in rich silks, satins, and
                    fine cottons, the lower orders generally in cottons; but they are not cleanly in
                    their persons, having, apparently, a particular aversion to cold water, which
                    they never use in its pure state as a beverage, and always warm it for washing
                    the hands and face, even in the middle of the dog-days; yet they use ice in the
                    northern provinces for cooling their fruits.</p>
                <p>The countenance of a Chinese man has something in it peculiarly pleasing and good
                    humoured, which is just the reverse of that of the women, at least of those in
                    the common rank of life, the only women who are seen in public. A Chinese is
                    never out of humour except when disturbed at his meal; necessity only, not even
                    his own self-interest, will prevail on him to leave his rice unfinished.</p>
                <p>The common people seldom sit down to table, or, in fine weather, take their meals
                    within doors; but each with <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354621"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-4621-0586"/>his bowl in his hand, squatting himself down on
                    his haunches round the boiler, eats his frugal repast of rice or other
                    vegetables, seasoned with a little pork or fish; or salted duck, with oil, fat,
                    or a little soy, washing it down with weak tea, or warm rice beer, or <hi
                    rend="italic">seau-tcheou,</hi> a villanous ardent spirit. Rice is the staff of
                    life in China, of which they eat largely, but in drinking they are extremely
                    moderate. They are not nice in their choice of food,—dogs, cats, rats, and
                    almost every animal, being eagerly sought after by the poorer clas⅛. In such a
                    mass of population, many families must necessarily struggle with all the ills of
                    extreme poverty; fewer, however, it would appear, in proportion to the
                    population, than in most other countries; the small imposts on agricultural
                    produce, the easy terms on which land is procured, the small divisions into
                    which it is partitioned out, the multitude of large rivers, lakes, and canals
                    abounding with fish, the freedom of the fisheries, and the extremely moderate
                    rate at which the agricultural and labouring poor are taxed, are so many spurs
                    to industry; and when a man through age or infirmity becomes incapable of
                    labour, his relations are compelled to contribute to his support; a refusal
                    would be an offence against parental affection, which is not in China a mere
                    moral maxim, but carries with it the force of a positive law; poor-houses are
                    consequently scarcely known, and beggars exist only in the persons of the
                    priests of Fo and Tao-tse and other impostors, in the shape of astrologers and
                    fortune-tellers. Old age is here highly respected, and the imperial family takes
                    every occasion to set the example. On Yung-chin’s marriage with a Tartar
                    princess, she distributed a piece of cotton cloth and two measures of rice to
                    every woman throughout the empire whose age exceeded 70 years. In the province
                    of Shang-tung alone, whose population may amount to 20,000,000, the list
                    consisted of 98,222 above seventy, 40,893 above eighty, and 3453 above ninety
                    years of age.</p>
                <p>In all ranks of life, but more especially among the magistrates and officers of
                    government, vivacity and activity are less esteemed than sedateness and
                    deliberation; gravity is considered as the test of wisdom, and silence of
                    discretion. A magistrate should never attempt to joke, and should forbear to
                    talk; he should resemble great bells, which seldom strike, and full vessels,
                    which give little sound. He should never show his anger, as this would put the
                    person who had offended him on his guard. A Chinese of education is a complete
                    machine; he must act and speak, and walk abroad, dress, receive and return
                    visits, according to rule, founded on ancient usage; the observance of which is
                    a most important part of his duty. If two persons meet, they know from the
                    button on the bonnet their respective ranks; and that alone determines what each
                    has to do and to say. If two officers of equal rank pass each other, they fold
                    their hands and salute each other till out of sight; if of different ranks, the
                    chair or carriage of the inferior must stop, while that of the superior passes;
                    and where the difference is very great, the inferior must alight. It is not, as
                    in Europe, that one person may pass another with indifference, may take off his
                    hat or keep it on, may give or refuse his hand, according to the humour in which
                    he may happen to be; if one of the people should fail to pay the respect that is
                    due to their superiors, a few strokes of the bamboo will bring him back to a
                    sense of his duty. Where there is so much ceremony, there must be much hypocrisy
                    and little cordiality.</p>
                <p>When one officer pays a visit to another, a sheet of red paper, folded in a
                    particular manner, bearing the name and quality of the visitor, is dispatched
                    before him, that the person visited may know where to receive him, at the gate,
                    in the first court, or in the inner apartment. The card is accompanied by a list
                    of presents meant to be offered. If part be received, a letter of thanks, and a
                    list of those returned, are sent back, with this observation in two characters,
                    “They are pearls, I dare not touch them ;” in allusion to the prohibition of
                    pearls being worn by any except the imperial family, or those who have special
                    leave. The visits of an inferior must always be made before the first meal, that
                    the fumes of meat or wine may not offend the person visited. If he means to
                    decline the visit, the bearer of the card is desired to say to his master, that
                    he will not give him the trouble to alight from his chair; but if he does not
                    return the visit in person, he sends his card within three 'days, and there the
                    visiting acquaintance ends. Where a visitor is received, a prodigious deal of
                    bowing and ceremony takes place. When once seated, to lounge on the chair, to
                    lean back, to sit cross-legged, or to throw about the arms, or to look round,
                    would be a gross breach of good manners. A cup of tea, sipped simultaneously,
                    according to rule, finishes the formal visit.</p>
                <p>These restraints of ceremony, imposed more or less on all conditions of men, are
                    incompatible with frankness and sincerity, and beget that want of confidence
                    between colleagues in office which is particularly observable in this jealous
                    government, by the constant plotting against and undermining each other. The
                    habitual gravity which a magistrate must put on in public stamps an air of
                    importance on matters of the most trifling nature; though it is said they
                    sometimes relax in private, where they indulge in all manner of excesses; and
                    the stiff formality which strongly characterizes this people is said to give
                    way, on such occasions, to conviviality; not, however, unless they are well
                    acquainted with their guests. At such feasts women never appear, but are usually
                    left to be amused by a set of players. To convince the guests how ar <hi
                    rend="subscript"> t</hi> xious the entertainer is to see them, the invitation is
                    repeated three several times; the first on the preceding evening, the second on
                    the morning of the day, and the third when dinner is ready for serving up, which
                    is the latter of the two meals, and generally from four to six o’clock,
                    according to the season of the year. The guests do not sit down at one table,
                    but generally in pairs, at small square tables, every one of which is served
                    precisely with the same kind of dishes, which are very numerous. Besides the
                    ordinary quadrupeds, birds, and fishes, used as food, several gelatinous
                    articles, as bears’ paws, the hoofs of various animals, stags’ sinews, sharks’
                    fins, birds’ nests, biche-de-mer, fucus or sea-weed, enrich their soups. With
                    these and other substances, mixed with spices, and soys, and various herbs, they
                    have an endless preparation of dishes, served up in small porcelain bowls, eaten
                    with porcelain spoons, and two little ivory or ebony sticks, with which they
                    take the pieces of meat or dry rice, and throw them into the mouth. Pastry and
                    sweetmeats are served up at intervals; tea follows the dinner, after which comes
                    the dessert. Those who, from illness or accident, send an excuse, have their
                    portion of the dinner sent to their homes. Each guest, the next morning, sends a
                    billet of thanks for the good fare he enjoyed the preceding evening.</p>
                <p>Though there are tea-houses and cook-shops, to which tradesmen, artizans, and the
                    peasantry, with the inferior officers of state and clerks of the departments,
                    occasionally resort, to refresh themselves and to read the Pekin Gazette, there
                    are no promiscuous assemblies or fixed meetings, as fairs for the lower classes,
                    or routes, balls, or music parties for the higher ranks. Dancing is utterly
                    unknown. The clumsy boots of one sex, and the crippled feet of the other, would
                    be ill adapted for the amusement of dancing, even were the sexes permitted to
                    mix together; but “tripping on the light fantastic toe” would not become that
                    gravity which is so essential in the exterior <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193354634" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4634-0587"/>of Chinese good breeding. In
                    the former Tartar dynasty, some Lamas from Thibet brought with them to court a
                    set of dancing girls, whose lascivious movements gave great offence to the grave
                    and virtuous Chinese, whose general conduct towards the women is nearly as bad
                    as that which prevails among savage tribes. One may discover in their proverbs
                    the feeling toward the sex. “A family,” it is said, “in which there are five
                    women, has nothing to fear from robbers; its poverty will protect it.” Again,
                    “When the hen crows in the morning, domestic affairs are not going on as they
                    should be ;” and, “What the women have lost in their feet, .they have added to
                    their tongues.”</p>
                <p>It is remarkable enough, that the accurate Marco Polo is wholly silent on the
                    subject of-the crippled feet of the Chinese women, which there, can be no doubt
                    were as common in his time as they are now. Of the origin of this unnatural
                    custom the Chinese relate twenty different accounts, all equally absurd.
                    Europeans suppose it to have originated in the jealousy of the men, determined,
                    says Pauw, in his severe manner, to keep them “si étroit qu’on ne peut comparer
                    l’exactitude avec laquelle on les gouverne.” Whatever may have been the cause,
                    the continuance may more easily be explained: as long as the men will marry none
                    but such as have crippled feet, crippled feet must for ever remain in fashion
                    among Chinese ladies. It is kept up by the pride of superiority and the dread of
                    degradation, like the custom of widows burning themselves in India.</p>
                <p>The little value set upon females leads but too frequently to that unnatural
                    crime, female infanticide and exposure. There can be no question as to its
                    existence; the extent of it, however, may have been exaggerated. In the Pekin
                    Gazette of 1.815 is a representation from a humane magistrate of Kiang-nan to
                    the tribunal of justice in the capital, praying that the horrible practice of
                    selling and putting away wives and drowning female infants may be prohibited: on
                    which the emperor Kia-king sagaciously observes, that “the existence of male and
                    female is essential to the continuance of the human species that “husband and
                    wife form one of the five relationships in which human beings stand to each
                    other ;” that “divorce is not allowable except for one of the seven causes and
                    concludes, “if it be true that it is a common practice among poor families to
                    drown their female infants, and the husband and wife separate for every trifle,
                    these are indeed wicked practices, which should be put a stop to by admonitory
                    and prohibitory edicts.” The magistrates of a district of Fokien sent a case to
                    court on another occasion, to know how they should act. It was this: A man had
                    made a vow that, if his wife recovered from a fit of sickness, he would make a
                    sacrifice of his son, who was three years of age. The wife recovered, and he
                    performed his vow. The supreme court decreed that, having violated the laws of
                    nature, he had incurred the penalty of death; but, on a mistaken notion that, by
                    the unnatural sacrifice, he had savea the life of his mother, the emperor
                    mitigated the punishment to a hundred blows of the bamboo, and perpetual
                    banishment.</p>
                <p>This is but a miserable picture of the state of society in China. It is rendered
                    still worse by the common practice of all oriental nations, which admits of a
                    man taking as many wives as he can maintain. In China a second or inferior wife
                    is taken without any ceremony, and generally purchased. The children by her are
                    considered as the children of the first wife, and strictly legitimate; but the
                    mother is without consideration in the eye of law, and may be disposed of in the
                    same way as she was procured.</p>
                <p>The athletic exercises of wrestling, boxing, fencing, the active amusements, such
                    as cricket, golf, bowls, tennis, are wholly unknown; and the sports of the
                    field, as hunting, shooting, angling, as pursuits of pleasure, cannot be
                    conceived by them. The Tartars, however, are fond of hunting, of the pleasures
                    of which the Chinese had so little idea, that Kien-lung, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Eloge</hi><hi rend="italic">de Mouhden,</hi> seems to think it
                    necessary to acquaint them with the benefits arising from this diversion. Having
                    described the pleasures and the dangers of the chase, “Thus,” says he, “ends
                    this delightful and highly useful exercise, which is at once propitious to
                    heaven, to the earth, and to the army; to heaven by the offerings it affords in
                    its honour; to the earth, which it relieves from the cruel and pernicious guests
                    that prey upon it; and to the army, by accustoming them to the dangers and
                    fatigues of war.”</p>
                <p>To appear with the head uncovered, and without boots, would be an act of rudeness
                    not to be tolerated. To receive a present with one hand would be equally rude
                    and disrespectful. To mention the word <hi rend="italic">death</hi> would be an
                    insufferable rudeness. When a person dies he is said to be gone to his
                    ancestors. Many other peculiarities might be mentioned in which they differ from
                    the rest of the world, and many in which they resemble the Turks in a very
                    marked manner; but this is the less surprising, as the Turks are from the same
                    Scythian stock.</p>
                <p>Suicide is no crime with the Chinese. It is a favour to a condemned criminal to
                    allow him to be his own executioner. Women and officers of the government are
                    most addicted to the practice of suicide; the former perhaps from a sense of
                    degradation, or in the gloom of solitude; the latter possibly to escape torture
                    or disgrace when suspected of criminal conduct.</p>
                <p>There are two favourable traits in the Chinese character which should not be
                    overlooked,—the respect and veneration of children for their parents, and the
                    almost universal sobriety that prevails in all ranks and conditions of men. A
                    curious story is told by Le Gentil, which he had from Père Laureati, respecting
                    the emperor Kaung-hee, who one day determined to experience the unknown pleasure
                    of getting drunk. He chose his favourite minister as his bottle companion, who
                    contrived to keep sober while his master was unable to stand. The minister
                    apprized the chief eunuch of the emperor’s situation, and hinted that, if they
                    did not contrive to cure him of the practice, none of their lives would be safe
                    for a moment. “You must therefore,” he continues, “load me with chains, and
                    throw me into a dungeon.” Kaung-hee on waking inquired for his companion; the
                    eunuch said that he was in confinement by his orders, for having incurred his
                    displeasure. The emperor doubted his senses; but having ordered the minister to
                    be brought before him, he was so shocked and provoked that he never afterwards
                    ventured to repeat the experiment.</p>
                <p>Like other nations, therefore, the Chinese character has its bright as well as
                    its dark side; and if we find the latter to be the most prominent, it should be
                    remembered that it is drawn chiefly by foreigners, and principally by those
                    whose communication is rare and restricted, or by those who have only visited
                    one of their out-ports, distant many hundred leagues from the seat of
                    government. Here by all .accounts they are so much given to knavery and
                    cheating, that it is held to be no crime in the seller to cheat where the buyer
                    is stupid enough to be cheated. Pauw observes that the shopkeepers would never’
                    have thought of writing upon their signs, “here nobody will be cheated,” if they
                    had not predetermined to cheat all the world; yet our own shopkeepers are not
                    backward in announcing their “genuine” articles. It is to be feared, however,
                    that the boasted morality of the Chinese is built on no principle of feeling or
                    propriety of action between man and man; and that where public decorum is not
                    offended there is no breach of moral duty. Great crimes <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193354647" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4647-0588"/>are not common, but little
                    vices pervade all ranks of society. A Chinese is cold, cunning, and distrustful;
                    always ready to take advantage of those he has to deal with; extremely covetous
                    and deceitful; quarrelsome, vindictive, but timid and dastardly. A Chinese in
                    office is a strange compound of insolence and meanness. All ranks and conditions
                    have a total disregard for truth; from the emperor downwards the most palpable
                    falsehoods are proclaimed with unblushing effrontery, to answer a political, an
                    interested, or an exculpatory purpose. The emperor asserted, and several great
                    officers of state repeated the assertion to Lord Amherst, that they <hi
                    rend="italic">saw</hi> Lord Macartney go through the whole of their odious
                    ceremony, and that he performed it to admiration.</p>
                <p>These arc among the dark shades of the Chinese character; opposed to which maybe
                    set his sober and industrious habits, submissive disposition, a mild and affable
                    manner, an exactness and punctuality in all which he undertakes to perform, and
                    if he has not been taught a general philanthropy, or if sentiments of love for
                    the whole species havtì not been instilled into his mind, he haè at least the
                    merit of believing in the God of his fathers, in obeying the commands of his
                    superior, and in honouring his father and mother. Under a better government the
                    Chinese could not fail to become a better people; as it is, some favourable
                    traits may be found, both in the habits of the people and the principles of the
                    government. “Some very considerable and positive moral and political
                    advantages,” as Sir George Staunton observes, “are attributable to the system of
                    early and universal marriage; to the sacred regard that is habitually paid to
                    the ties of kindred; to the sobriety, industry, and even intelligence of the
                    lower classes; to the almost total absence of feudal rights and privileges; to
                    the equable distribution of landed property; to the natural incapacity and
                    indisposition of the government and people to an indulgence in ambitious
                    projects and foreign conquests; and, lastly, to a system of penal laws, if not
                    the most just and equitable, at least the most comprehensive, uniform, and
                    suited to the genius of the people for whom it is designed, perhaps of any that
                    ever existed and with this qualified character we dismiss the subject. <hi
