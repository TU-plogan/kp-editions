                <p><label type="entry">CHANCERY</label>, the highest court of justice in Britain
                    next to the parliament, and of very ancient institution. It has its name
                    chancery <hi rend="italic">(cancellaria}</hi> from the judge who presides here,
                    the lord chancellor, or <hi rend="italic">cancellarius,</hi> who, according to
                    Sir Edward Coke, is so termed, <hi rend="italic">a cancellando,</hi> from
                    cancelling the king’s letters patent when granted contrary to law, which is the
                    highest point of his jurisdiction. In chancery there are two distinct tribunals;
                    the one ordinary, being a court of common law; and the other extraordinary,
                    being a court of equity.</p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> legal court holds pleas of recognizances
                    acknowledged in the chancery, writs of <hi rend="italic">scare facias</hi> for
                    repeal of letters patent, writs of partition, &amp;c. and also of all personal
                    actions by or against any officer of the court. Sometimes a <hi rend="italic"
                    >supersedeas,</hi> or writ of privilege, has been granted by this court, to
                    discharge a person out of prison: one may also obtain here a <hi rend="italic"
                    >habeas corpus</hi> prohibition, &amp;c. in the vacation; and a <hi
                    rend="italic">subpaena</hi> may be had to force witnesses to appear in other
                    courts when they have no power to call them. But in prosecuting causes, if the
                    parties descend to issue, this court cannot try it by jury; the lord chancellor
                    delivers the record into the king’s bench to be tried there; and after trial
                    had, it is remanded into the chancery, and there judgment is given; though if
                    there be a demurrer in law, it must be argued in this court.</p>
                <p>In this court is also kept the <hi rend="italic">officina</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >justitiae,</hi> out of which all original writs that pass under the great seal,
                    all commissions of charitable uses, sewers, bankruptcy, idiocy, lunacy, and the
                    like, do issue; and for which it is always open to the subject, who may there at
                    any time demand and have, <hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >debito</hi><hi rend="italic">justitiae,</hi> any writ which his occasions may
                    call for. Those writs relating to the business of the subject, and the returns
                    of them, were, according to the simplicity of ancient times, originally kept in
                    a hamper, <hi rend="italic">in hanaperio</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the
                    other (relating to such matters as the crown was mediately or immediately
                    concerned in) were preserved in a little sack or bag, <hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi><hi rend="italic">parva</hi><hi rend="italic">baga;</hi> and hence has
                    arisen the distinction of the <hi rend="italic">hanaper</hi> office and the <hi
                    rend="italic">petty-bag</hi> office, which both belong to the common law court
                    in chancery.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> court, or court of equity, proceeds
                    by the rules of equity and conscience, and moderates the rigour of the common
                    law, considering the <hi rend="italic">intention</hi> rather than the <hi
                    rend="italic">words</hi> of the law. It gives relief for and against infants
                    notwithstanding their minority, and for or against married women notwithstanding
                    their coverture. All frauds and deceits for which there is no redress at common
                    law; all breaches of trust and confidence; and accidents, as to relieve
                    obligors, mortgagers, and others, against penalties and forfeitures, where the
                    intent was to pay the debt, are here remedied. This court also gives relief
                    against the extremity of unreasonable engagements entered into without
                    consideration; obliges creditors who are unreasonable <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193351124" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1124-0317"/>to compound with an
                    unfortunate debtor; and makes executors, &amp;c. give security and pay interest
                    for money which is to lie long in their hands. This court may confirm title to
                    lands, though one has lost his writings; and render conveyances which are
                    defective through mistake or otherwise, good and perfect. In chancery,
                    copy-holders may be relieved against the ill usage of their lords; inclosures of
                    land which is common may be decreed; and this court may decree money or lands
                    given to charitable uses, oblige men to account with each other, &amp;c. But in
                    all cases where the plaintiff can have his remedy at law, he ought not to be
                    relieved in chancery; and a thing which may be tried by a jury is not triable in
                    this court.</p>
