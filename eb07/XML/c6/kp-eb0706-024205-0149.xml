                    Russia,</hi> was the natural daughter of a country girl, and was born at Ringen,
                    a small village upon the Lake Virtcherve, near Dorpt, in Livonia. The year of
                    her birth is uncertain; but according to her own account she came into the world
                    on the 5th of April 1687. Her original name was Martha, which she changed for
                    Catherine when she embraced the Greek religion. Count Rosen, a
                    lieutenant-colonel in the Swedish service, who owned the village of Ringen,
                    supported, according to the custom of the country, both the mother and the
                    child, and was for that reason supposed by many persons to have been her father.
                    She lost her mother when she was only three years old; and as Count Rosen died
                    about the same time, she was left in so destitute a situation that the
                    parishclerk of the village received her into his house. Soon afterwards Gluck,
                    Lutheran minister of Marienburg, happening, in a journey through those parts, to
                    see the foundling, took her under his protection, brought her up in his family,
                    and employed her in attending his children. In 1701, or about the fourteenth
                    year of her age, she espoused a dragoon of the Swedish garrison of Marienburg.
                    Many different accounts are given of this transaction. One author affirms that
                    the bride and bridegroom remained together eight days after their marriage;
                    while another asserts, that on the morning of the nuptials, her husband being
                    sent with a detachment for Riga, the marriage was never consummated. This much
                    is certain, that the dragoon was absent when Marienburg surrendered to the
                    Russians, and Catherine, who was reserved for a higher destiny, never saw him
                    more.</p>
                <p>Upon the taking of Marienburg, General Bauer saw Catherine among the prisoners;
                    and being smitten with her youth and beauty, took her to his house, where she
                    superintended his domestic affairs, and was supposed to be his mistress. Soon
                    afterwards she was received into the family of Prince Menzikof, who was no less
                    struck with the attractions of the fair captive. With him she lived until 1704;
                    when, in the seventeenth year of her age, she became the mistress of Peter the
                    Great, and won so much upon his affections, that he espoused her on the 29th of
                    May 1711. The ceremony was secretly performed at Jawerof, in Poland, in the
                    presence of General Bruce; and on the 20th of February 1712 it was publicly
                    solemnized with great pomp at Petersburg.</p>
                <p>Peter expired on the morning of the 28th of January 1725. This event being made
                    known, the senate, the generals, the principal nobility and clergy, hastened to
                    the palace to proclaim the new sovereign. It was previously settled by Menzikof
                    and his party that Catherine should be empress; and the guards, who surrounded
                    the palace with drums beating and colours flying, effectually vanquished all
                    opposition. The only circumstance, therefore, which remained, was to give a just
                    colour to her title, by persuading the assembly that Peter intended to have
                    named her his successor. For this purpose Menzikof demanded of that emperor’s
                    secretary whether his late master had left any written declaration of his
                    intentions. The secretary replied, that a little before his last journey to
                    Moscow he had destroyed a will; that he had frequently expressed his design of
                    making another, but had always been prevented by the reflection, that if he
                    thought his people, whom he had raised from a state of barbarism to a
                    considerable degree of power and glory, could be ungrateful, he would not expose
                    his final inclinations to the insult of a refusal; and that if they recollected
                    what they owed to his labours, they would regulate their conduct by his
                    intentions, which he had disclosed with more solemnity than could be manifested
                    by any writing. An altercation now began in the assembly, and some of the nobles
                    having the courage to oppose the accession of Catherine, Theophanes, archbishop
                    of Piescoff, called to their recollection the oath which they had all taken in
                    1722 to acknowledge the successor appointed by Peter; and added, that the
                    sentiments of that emperor delivered by the secretary were in effect an
                    appointment of Catherine. The opposite party, however, denied that those
                    sentiments were so clear as the secretary chose to insinuate; and insisted, that
                    as their late monarch had failed to nominate his heir, the election of the new
                    sovereign should revert to the state. Upon this the archbishop further
                    testified, that the evening before the coronation of the empress at Moscow,
                    Peter had declared, in the house of an English merchant, that he should place
                    the crown upon her head with no other view than to leave her mistress of the
                    empire after his decease. This attestation being confirmed by many persons
                    present, Menzikof cried out, “What need have we of any testament? A refusal to
                    conform to the inclination of our great sovereign, thus authenticated, would be
                    both unjust and criminal. Long live the Empress Catherine !” These words being
                    instantaneously repeated by the greater part of those who were present,
                    Menzikof, saluting Catherine by the title of empress, paid his first obeisance
                    by kissing her hand; and his example was followed by the whole assembly. She
                    next presented herself at the window to the guards and to the people, who
                    shouted acclamations of “Long live <pb break="no" facs="nls:193350162"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-0162-0243"/>Catherine !” whilst Menzikof scattered among them
                    handfuls of money. Thus, says a contemporary, the empress was raised to the
                    throne by the guards, in the same manner as the Roman emperors were by the
                    praetorian cohorts, without either the appointment of the people or of the
                    legions.</p>
                <p>The reign of Catherine may be considered as the reign of Menzikof; for that
                    empress having neither inclination nor abilities to direct the helm of
                    government, placed the most implicit confidence in a man who had been the
                    original author of her good fortune, and the sole instrument of her elevation to
                    the throne. During her short reign her life was exceedingly irregular; she was
                    extremely averse to business; would frequently, when the weather was fine, pass
                    whole nights in the open air; and was particularly intemperate in the use of
                    tokay. These irregularities, joined to a cancer and a dropsy, hastened her end;
                    and she expired on the 17th of May 1727, a little more than two years after her
                    accession to the throne, and in about the fortieth year of her age.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Catherine</hi> II. Empress of Russia, whose original name
                    was Sophia Augusta Frederica, was the daughter of Christian Augustus of Anhalt
                    Zerbst, a small district in Upper Saxony, and was born in the castle of Zerbst
                    on the 23d of May 1829. She was educated under the eye of her parents, along
                    with her brother Prince Frederic Augustus, and at an early period displayed a
                    masculine spirit. Her person was at once majestic and handsome, her complexion
                    clear and bright, and the expression of her countenance dignified, yet tempered
                    by a smile of beneficence. But it was early observed that under this exterior
                    she concealed a certain austerity of disposition, and an ambition, which was
                    even then considered as excessive, and which proved afterwards insatiable.</p>
                <p>The Empress Elizabeth, who had pitched upon her nephew the duke of Holstein
                    Gottorp Oldenburg as her successor, was also desirous to choose a consort for
                    him, and the princess of Anhalt Zerbst was selected upon this occasion, when
                    only fourteen years of age. She was chiefly indebted for this unexpected honour
                    to the tender regard which her imperial majesty always entertained for the
                    memory of the princess’s uncle, who had been her lover; and in an evil hour she
                    united the fate of the prince, better known afterwards by the name of Peter III.
                    to that of the princess of Anhalt Zerbst. In consequence of a special
                    invitation, the future empress repaired to St Petersburg, accompanied by her
                    mother, and being admitted into the bosom of the Greek church, the ceremonial of
                    marriage, after some delay, took place; upon which these august personages were
                    formally acknowledged, by her imperial majesty and the senate, as Grand Duke and
                    Duchess of Russia.</p>
                <p>The empress hoped that the name and pretensions of Prince Iwan would be
                    obliterated by the issue of the grand duke; and the whole empire impatiently
                    wished for and now expected an heir to the throne of Peter the Great. But a
                    marriage of eight years was not productive of any issue; and strange suspicions
                    began to be entertained. This alarmed the court; for a formidable rival, who
                    possessed a superior claim to the throne, still existed; and although he was in
                    bondage, yet, in a country like Russia, the interval is sometimes small between
                    a dungeon and a throne. But the birth of a son and a daughter, soon afterwards,
                    put an end to all apprehensions of this kind, and tended not a little to give
                    stability to the empire.</p>
                <p>The grand duke, who at times discovered noble and even magnanimous sentiments,
                    had about this period formed a most unfortunate connection with Elizabeth
                    Voron-soff, a lady of high rank, but celebrated neither for her beauty nor for
                    her talents. He seldom saw his consort in private, and all the hours which were
                    not occupied either by military exhibitions or the pleasures of the table were
                    entirely devoted to his mistress.</p>
                <p>The grand duchess, on the other hand, is said to have spent much of her time in
                    company with a young Pole, whose history, like that of Catherine’s, has since
                    been interwoven with the annals of Europe. This was Count Poniatowski,
                    afterwards known as Stanislaus Augustus, king of Poland. He was the third son of
                    a grandee of the same name, the favourite of Charles XII. of Sweden, by the
                    Princess Ezatoryska, who boasted the possession of the noblest blood in Poland,
                    as she traced her descent from the Jagellons, the ancient sovereigns of
                    Lithuania. His person was of exquisite symmetry, his air was noble, his manners
                    were agreeable, and his mind, a circumstance extremely rare, was not less
                    graceful than his person. At this period he was in no higher station than that
                    of a gentleman in the suite of the minister plenipotentiary from England, who
                    had formed an intimacy with his family during a former mission at Warsaw. But
                    being now taught to look higher, he returned to his native country, and appeared
                    soon afterwards at Petersburg as ambassador from the king of Poland. In this new
                    capacity he did not forget to pay his respects at the little court of
                    Oranienbaum; and the young plenipotentiary, with a view of ingratiating himself
                    with the grand duke, smoked, drank, and praised the king of Prussia. At length
                    Paul Petrowitsch received the Polish minister with coolness, and he was actually
                    forbidden to visit at the palace. This, however, it is said, did not deter him
                    from concealing the order of the white eagle, and disguising himself as a
                    mechanic, under which assumed character he repaired one summer evening to the
                    gardens in the neighbourhood of the Gulf of Cronstadt; but he was discovered by
                    his highness, who ordered him to be brought before him, and, after affecting to
                    reprimand the captain of his guard for his disrespect to the representative of a
                    crowned head, told him he was at liberty to depart.</p>
                <p>From this moment the grand duchess is said to have changed both her system and
                    her conduct. She had formerly aspired only to direct the counsels of the future
                    emperor; she now resolved, if possible, to obtain the crown for her son, and the
                    regency for herself. Such a task would have discouraged a common mind; for it
                    was impossible to achieve it without prevailing on the empress to consent to
                    dethrone her own nephew. But Bestuchef, the grand chancellor, who hated the heir
                    apparent, joined cordially in the scheme; and Elizabeth, who had herself
                    obtained the crown by means of a revolution, was taught to tremble for her life,
                    in consequence of the designs of her successor, who was represented as having
                    resolved to shorten her days by poison. An unexpected revolution in the
                    ministry, however, put an end to these intrigues. Bestuchef was driven into
                    exile, and Poniatowski was recalled.</p>
                <p>A long and melancholy interval now ensued, during which the ambition of the grand
                    duchess was rather suspended than annihilated. In the midst of the gloom which
                    overspread her, however, she had recourse to, and soothed her anguish by means
                    of, books; and it was in her closet that she laid the foundation of her future
                    greatness, and rendered herself in some measure deserving of a throne. During
                    her leisure moments she found means to gain partisans; and she acquired the
                    favour of the soldiery, who did duty around her person, by means of her
                    liberality and condescension. Peter, on the other hand, to the personal
                    exertions of a common soldier added the orgies of a bacchanalian. Surrounded by
                    his male and female favourites, he consumed whole days and nights in
                    intoxication, and forgot that he was a prince. There were some few moments,
                    however, when he appeared great, and even magnanimous<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193350175" xml:id="kp-eb0706-0175-0244"/>; but unhappily these were of
                    short duration; and it was his misfortune to have a weak woman for his mistress,
                    and an able and ambitious one for his wife.</p>
                <p>Such was the situation of the court when Elizabeth died, on the 5th of January
                    1762. The grand duke now ascended the throne by the name of Peter III. The
                    following answer to a letter from the king of Prussia, who had requested him to
                    be on his guard against the plot which was then hatching, conveys no
                    unfavourable opinion of his heart: “Touching the interest you express for my
                    safety, I request you will rest contented. I am called the father of my
                    soldiers; they prefer a male to a female government. I walk alone constantly in
                    St Petersburg: if any mischief is meditated, it would have been effected long
                    since; but I am a general benefactor. I repose myself on the protection of
                    heaven; trusting to that, I have nothing to fear.”</p>
                <p>This false security proved his ruin. Whilst his mind was occupied with plans of
                    reform, and he aspired to rival, nay even to excel, his illustrious predecessor,
                    whose name he had assumed, a person who had sworn fidelity to him at the altar,
                    and who owed him allegiance by the double ties of wife and subject, was actually
                    employed in planning a conspiracy, and organizing a revolt against him. It has
                    been said that he intended to have shut up his consort and son in a convent. But
                    it is known that, so far from this being the intention of Peter, he was
                    preparing for a journey to Holstein, and had actually empowered his consort to
                    act as regent during, his absence.</p>
                <p>The mistakes of the emperor did not escape the penetration of his enemies. He
                    purposed to carry his guards into Holstein, with a view to recover the
                    possessions wrested from his ancestors. But the regiments which had hitherto
                    done duty at the palace, and were inured to the indulgences of the capital,
                    revolted at the idea of a foreign war; they had been accustomed to be governed
                    by women, and they were taught to fix their eyes on the consort of the czar.</p>
                <p>It is not the least wonderful part of her conduct, that previously to the great
                    catastrophe now meditating, Catherine had contrived to appear abandoned by all
                    the world. She knew how interesting a female, and more especially an empress,
                    appeared whilst in distress; and she took care to heighten the sensibility of
                    the public, by bursting at times into a flood of tears. This artful woman had
                    found means to attach many persons to her destiny; it must be owned, however,
                    that her adherents were neither so powerful nor so numerous as to afford her any
                    well-founded hopes of success. She had gained several subalterns, and some
                    privates, of the guards; but her principal partizans consisted of the Princess
                    D’Aschekof, niece to the new chancellor; Prince Rozamouski, who had risen from
                    obscurity, having been originally a peasant; Odart, an intrigue-ing Italian; and
                    Panin, governor to the grand duke. The arrest of Passick, one of the
                    conspirators, seemed to lead to a discovery which would have proved fatal to the
                    malcontents; but this very circumstance induced them to declare instantly, and
                    in the end crowned an apparently desperate attempt with complete success.</p>
                <p>The empress, who was asleep at the castle of Peterhof, received intimation of
                    their design by a common soldier, who soon afterwards returned with a carriage
                    and eight horses. On the faith of this man, and accompanied only by <hi
                    rend="italic">a few</hi> peasants, a German female domestic, and a French
                    valet-de-chambre, she arrived at eight o’clock in the morning in the capital,
                    and stopped opposite the batracks of the regiment of Ismailof. There she
                    addressed the soldiers in an eloquent speech, intermingled with sighs and tears,
                    and actually found means to persuade them that she and her son had but that
                    moment escaped from the hands of assassins, sent by the emperor to murder them.
                    This story, by agitating the passions of the troops, had a wonderful effect on
                    them; and they all swore, with the exception of only one regiment, to die in
                    defence of her and the young archduke. Upon this the empress ordered a crucifix
                    to be brought, and commanded the priests to administer a new oath of allegiance.
                    She afterwards repaired to one of the principal churches, where she was met by
                    the Bishop of Novogorod and the clergy, and, having returned thanks to Almighty
                    God, ascended a balcony, and presented her son to the people. In a few hours she
                    was again seen, dressed in the uniform of the guards, riding at the head of a
                    numerous and well-appointed army against her husband.</p>
                <p>On the first intelligence of the plot, Munich had repaired to his benefactor, and
                    advised him to march directly to the capital, at the head of his German troops.
                    “I shall precede you,” said the generous veteran, “and my dead body shall be a
                    rampart to your sacred person.” But, on the other hand, the emissaries of the
                    empress, bathing his hands with their hypocritical tears, deprecated resistance,
                    magnified the danger, and invited him to repose in the inviolable fidelity of
                    his consort. In short, on the 14th of July 1762, he was taken prisoner by the
                    orders of his own wife, to whom he had been married fourteen years; prevailed on
                    by the threats and intreaties of Count Panin to renounce his crown; conveyed to
                    the castle of Robscha; and, three days afterwards, put to death. The empress, on
                    her assumption of the crown, now rendered vacant by murder, notified the event
                    to all the courts of Europe, under her new name of Catherine Alexiewna II. But
                    there was still a competitor for the empire; and suspicion never slumbers near a
                    throne. This was Prince Iwan, son of the princess of Mecklenburg, and grand
                    nephew of Peter the Great and the empress Anna Iwanowna, who had destined him as
                    her successor; butin consequence of a former revolution, he had been seized
                    while yet an infant, and doomed to lead a life of captivity. During eighteen
                    years of precarious existence, he had been shut up in the castle of
                    Schlusselburg, and never in all that time had he breathed the open air, or
                    beheld the sky, but once. This prince was visited by Peter HL, who, finding him
                    in an arched room twenty feet square, determined to set him at liberty; but his
                    generous intentions were unavailing; the youth, in consequence of his long and
                    solitary confinement, had been deprived of his senses. In this situation the
                    emperor determined to build a house for him, with a convenient terrace, where he
                    might take the air daily within the fortress. Such, however, are the changes of
                    fortune, that, in three weeks, Peter himself was precipitated from a throne, and
                    suffered a violent death. This event was but the prelude to that of Iwan; for,
                    as orders had been given, in case of an attempt to rescue him, that an end
                    should be put to his life, and as a real or pretended plot had been hatched for
                    this purpose, the motives and details of which have hitherto been involved in
                    the most profound obscurity, the unhappy prince experienced the same fate as his
                    generous protector.</p>
                <p>Catherine being now firmly seated on the throne, wisely determined to divert the
                    thoughts of the nation from the late horrid scenes, and fix them upon more
                    agreeable objects. Having soothed Prussia, acquired a preponderance in the
                    cabinet of Denmark, which had for some time been an absolute monarchy, and
                    entered into a league with the popular party in Sweden, not yet bereft of its
                    liberties; she cast her eyes on Courland, then governed by Prince Charles of
                    Saxony, the second son of Augustus III. king of Poland, and, finding that
                    country admirably situated for the increase of her present and the extensión of
                    her future power, she, in 1762, expelled the lawful sovereign, and invested<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193350188" xml:id="kp-eb0706-0188-0245"/> Biron, a creatute
                    of her own, with the ducal cap. Nor was she content with this; for the new duke,
                    soon reduced to the most abject dependence, was prevented from resigning his
                    precarious power, and the states assembled at Mittau were actually interdicted
                    from nominating a successor. This, however, was only a prelude to scenes of
                    greater importance; for she had scarcely dethroned one sovereign before she
                    undertook to create another. Augustus IL, or, as he is called by some, Augustus
                    III. of Poland, having died at Dresden in 1763, her imperial majesty did not let
                    slip so favourable an opportunity for interfering in the appointment to the
                    vacant throne, and even placing upon it one of her own dependents. Count
                    Poniatowski, on the elevation of Catherine, had sent a friend to Petersburg to
                    sound the disposition of the empress about his return to that capital, where he
                    naturally hoped to participate in her power, and bask in the sunshine of the
                    imperial smiles. But the more prudent German, who was at this very moment
                    meditating a splendid provision for him elsewhere, prohibited the journey from
                    political motives. Accordingly, notwithstanding the opposition of the grand
                    chancellor Bestuclιer, and indeed of all her ministers, she determined to invest
                    him with the ensigns of royalty. The head of the house of Brandenburg, being
                    swayed by his hatred to Saxony and Austria; or, what is still more likely, the
                    Prussian eagle having perhaps, even now, scented his future prey; Catherine was
                    enabled to send into Poland 10,000 men, who, encamping on the banks of the
                    Vistula, overawed the deliberations of the diet, assembled on the 9th of May
                    1764, and placed Stanislaus Augustus on the throne.</p>
                <p>Having thus conferred the crown of Poland on an amiable and accomplished prince,
                    who, on account of his youth, his poverty, and even his dependence on Russia,
                    would have been excluded from that painful pre-eminence had the free suffrages
                    of the nation been collected, and who, in consequence of the hatred of his
                    countrymen, was still more subjected to the dominion of the empress, she began
                    to prepare for a war against the Turks, which was accordingly declared in 1768.
                    During this contest the Greek cross was triumphant both by sea and land.</p>
                <p>In the mean time a dangerous insurrection broke out in the very heart of her
                    dominions, instigated by a Cossack of the name of Pugatschef, who pretended to
                    be Peter III. After displaying great valour and considerable talents, which had
                    enabled him, at the head of raw and undisciplined levies, to contend against
                    veteran troops and experienced generals, this unfortunate man was at length
                    seized, inclosed in an iron cage, and beheaded at Moscow on the 21st of July
                    1775.</p>
                <p>On the 21st of July in the preceding year, a peace had been concluded with the
                    porte, which proved highly honourable to Russia; but it was productive of little
                    benefit to the latter; for the liberty of navigating the Black Sea, and a free
                    trade with all the ports of the Turkish empire, which would have afforded
                    inestimable advantages to a civilized people, proved of but little consequence
                    to a nation unacquainted alike with commerce and manufactures.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, we find her imperial majesty still unsatisfied. Scarcely had four
                    years elapsed, when, after an armed negociation, a new treaty of pacification
                    was agreed to by the reluctant sultan, on the 21st of March 1789, by which the
                    Crimea was declared independent; an event not calculated to allay ancient
                    jealousies, but, on the contrary, to produce fresh dissensions, as it afforded
                    an opening into the very heart of the Turkish empire, and a ready pretext for
                    future interference. New claims and new concessions immediately followed. Russia
                    insisted on establishing consuls in the three provinces of Moldavia, Wallachia,
                    and Bessarabia; which she was accordingly permitted to do by the treaty of 1781.
                    But mortifying as this compliance was, it produced only a short respite. The
                    emperor Joseph was now brought upon the political stage, and the Roman and
                    Russian eagles, after hovering over the carcass of the Turkish empire, and
                    meditating to devour the whole, were at last content with part of the prey. The
                    empress, as it may be readily believed, was not inattentive to her own
                    interests; and by the treaty of Constantinople, signed on the 9th of January
                    1784, the entire sovereignty of the Crimea, which then received its ancient name
                    of Taurica, the isle of Taman, and part of Cuban, were ceded to Russia.</p>
                <p>Thus, in the fifty-eighth year of her age, and the twentyfifth of her reign,
                    Catherine may be said to have attained the very summit of her wishes. Knowing
                    the effect of splendour upon ignorance, she ushered in the year 1787 with a
                    brilliant journey to Cherson. Accompanied thither at once by a court and an
                    army, with foreign ambassadors, an emperor and a king, in her train, she
                    intended to have assumed the high-sounding titles of Empress of the East, and
                    Liberator of Greece. At Kiow, where she remained during three months, she was
                    received under triumphal arches; and, having heard the petitions of the deputies
                    from distant nations, and extended the walls of that city, she inscribed in
                    Greek characters, on the quarter next to Constantinople, “Through this gate lies
                    the road to Byzantium.”</p>
                <p>Scarcely, however, had the empress, after visiting Moscow, returned to her
                    capital, when the Porte thought proper to declare war. Her majesty, long
                    prepared for an event which was far from being displeasing, called forth the
                    stipulated succours of her ally the emperor; and the combined army under the
                    Prince de Cobourg made itself master of Choczin after a siege of three months.
                    Oczakow, after a still more obstinate resistance, was assaulted and taken by the
                    Russians alone. Having concluded a final treaty of peace with the Turk on the
                    9th of January 1792, by which the river Dniester became the boundary of the two
                    empires, and was to be navigated by both, the empress had more time to apply her
                    mind to European politics. Part of Poland had been dismembered and partitioned
                    during the year 1792; not only in contravention of the unalienable rights of
                    nations, but in direct opposition to the most solemn treaties on the part of
                    Russia, Prussia, and Austria. The revolution which took place in that ill-fated
                    country on the 3d of May 1791, and which afforded the prospect of a happy and
                    stable government to the remains of the republic, was the signal of its
                    annihilation. The imperial and royal spoilers seized this opportunity to fall
                    once more in concert on their prey, which was in no condition to resist this
                    detestable confederacy; and they shared it at their pleasure. Another great
                    object had for some time engaged the attention of Catherine. This was the French
                    revolution. With a treasury nearly exhausted by the war with the Ottoman porte,
                    which had not then terminated, and at a distance from the scene of action, the
                    empress could not well engage in the contest; but she readily entered into the
                    coalition, and soon afterwards subsidized the king of Sweden. She also launched
                    forth a menacing manifesto against France, and prepared for a new war.
                    Afterwards, at the instigation of Zuboff, she formed the design of giving
                    effectual assistance to the confederated kings; and, as a proof of her
                    intentions, issued orders for a squadron of men-of-war to join the English
                    fleet, and commanded a levy of 60,000 troops. But she at the same time
                    prosecuted a war on the frontiers of Persia, where her army, under the command
                    of a near relation of the grand master of the artillery, had experienced <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193350201" xml:id="kp-eb0706-0201-0246"/> a most
                    humiliating defeat; and she was now preparing to send fresh succours to his
                    assistance.</p>
                <p>But while the mind of Catherine was occupied with projects for the overthrow of
                    the French republic, and the subjugation of the distant Persians, she was
                    smitten by the hand of death. On the morning of the 9th of November she rose at
                    her usual hour, and breakfasted, according to custom, on coffee. Some time
                    afterwards she retired to her closet; and her long absence exciting the
                    suspicion of her attendants, they entered the apartment and found her lying
                    speechless. Dr Rogerson, lier physician, being sent for, treated her disease as
                    apoplexy,, and considerable relief seemed to ensue after the application of the
                    lancet. But the empress never entirely recovered her senses, and did not utter a
                    single word during the remainder of her life, which was prolonged till ten
                    o’clock in the evening of the 10th of November 1797.</p>
                <p>Catherine was the only sovereign of Russia who ever exhibited a taste for
                    letters. Nor was this all. She was an author herself, and did not disdain to
                    compose little treatises for her grandchildren, whose education she
                    superintended. She also possessed an exquisite relish for music, and brought
                    Gabrielli and a number of singers of great note from Italy, allowing them
                    liberal salaries, and treating them with great attention. Throughout the whole
                    of her long reign Catherine also evinced a marked predilection for painting. In
                    the midst of a war with the Turks she purchased pictures in Holland to the
                    amount of 60,000 rubles, all of which were lost by the ship which carried them
                    being wrecked on the coast of Finland. This, however, served rather to stimulate
                    her to fresh exertions, and her agents accordingly procured whatever was to be
                    found in Italy worthy of notice. The Houghton collection from England was also
                    transferred, by an act of her munificence, to the shores of the Baltic; and,
                    whilst it added to her glory, lowered this nation in the eyes of foreigners. Her
                    conduct to learned men was truly worthy of a woman of genius. She was proud of
                    the correspondence and friendship of Voltaire; she invited Diderot to her court,
                    and lived with him while there in habits of the utmost familiarity; to
                    D’Alembert she looked up as to a superior being, and endeavoured, although in
                    vain, to induce him to fix his residence at St Petersburg. Her political
                    character has been variously estimated; and no sovereign of modern times has
                    attracted a greater share of censure and eulogium than Catherine. As a female
                    she appears at times the slave of lust and the puppet of her courtiers; as <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> sovereign we behold her towering like an immense colossus,
                    with one foot placed on Cherson, and another on Kamtschatka, waving her iron
                    sceptre over the subject nations, and regulating the destiny of a large portion
                    of mankind. The world, however, shudders at the untimely fate of Peter and of
                    Iwan, and posterity will not easily pardon the partition of Poland and the
                    massacres of Ismailof and of Praga.</p>

                    modern history, belongs to ladies of the first quality in the Russian court. It
                    was instituted in 1714, by Catherine, wife of Peter the Great, in memory of his
                    signal escape from the Turks in 1711. The emblems of this order are a red cross,
                    supported by a figure of St Catherine, and fastened to a scarlet string edged
                    with silver, on which are inscribed the name of St Catherine, and the motto <hi
