                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">CLERK</label><hi rend="italic">(clericus),</hi> a word
                    formerly used to signify a learned man, or man of letters. The word comes from
                    the Greek xXrcgo¢, used for <hi rend="italic">clergy,</hi> but more properly
                    signifying <hi rend="italic">lot</hi> or <hi rend="italic">heritage,</hi>
                    because the lot or portion of clerks or ecclesiastics is to serve God.
                    Accordingly <hi rend="italic">clerus</hi> was at first used to signify those who
                    were particularly attached to the service of God. The origin of the expression
                    is derived from the Old Testament, where the tribe of Levi is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">lot</hi> or <hi rend="italic">heritage, r.λr</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">ξος</hi>; and God is reciprocally called <hi
                    rend="italic">their portion,</hi> by reason of that tribe having been
                    consecrated to the service of God, and lived on the offerings made to God,
                    without any other settled provision. Thus Pasquier observes, that the officers
                    of the counts, or <hi rend="italic">comites,</hi> were anciently created under
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">clerks of accompts,</hi> and secretaries of state
                    were called <hi rend="italic">clerks of the secret.</hi> So <hi rend="italic"
                    >clericus domini regis,</hi> in the time of Edward I., was rendered, <hi
                    rend="italic">the kings secretary,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">clerk of his
                    council.</hi> The term was applied indifferently to all who made any profession
                    of learning, or who knew how to manage the pen; though originally it was applied
                    only to ecclesiastics. As the nobility and gentry were usually brought up to the
                    exercise of arms, there were none but the clergy left to cultivate the sciences;
                    and hence, as it was the clergy alone who had made any profession of letters, a
                    very learned man came to be called a <hi rend="italic">great clerk,</hi> and a
                    stupid, ignorant man, a <hi rend="italic">bad clerk.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Clerk</hi> is also applied to such as by their course of life exercise their
                    pens in any court or office; of which there were, and still are, various
                    kinds.</p>

                    likewise, by himself or deputy, sets the watch in the court. There was also an
