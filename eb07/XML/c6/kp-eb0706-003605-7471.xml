                    ores, without bellows, by means of water falling through a funnel into a close
                    vessel, which sends from it so much air or vapour as continually blows the fire.
                    If there be the space of another vessel for it to expatiate in by the way, it
                    there deposits its humidity, which otherwise might hinder the work. This
                    contrivance was named <hi rend="italic">camera aeolia</hi> by Kircher.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Camera</hi><hi rend="italic">Lucida,</hi> a contrivance of
                    Dr Hook for making the image of any thing appear on the wall of a room during
                    sunshine. Opposite to the wall on which the image is to be received there is an
                    aperture in the window shutter of at least a foot in diameter. The object is
                    placed outside the aperture. The object must be strongly enlightened by a mirror
                    which throws the sun’s rays upon it. Between the object and the wall which is to
                    receive the image place a large convex lens, whose focal distance is
                    sufficiently great to give an image on the wall. In proportion as the lens is
                    placed nearer to the object, the image on the wall will be larger; and when the
                    lens is moved farther from the object, the object will be less. <hi

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Camera</hi><hi rend="italic">Inicida,</hi> an instrument for
                    drawing in perspective; one of the many ingenious inventions of Dr
                    Wollaston.</p>
                <p>If a piece of plain glass be fixed at an angle of forty-five degrees with the
                    horizon, and if, at some distance beneath, there be a sheet of paper laid
                    horizontally on a table, a person looking downwards through the glass will see
                    an image of the objects situated before him; and as the glass which reflects the
                    image is also transparent, the paper and pencil can be seen at the same time
                    with the image, so that the outline of the image may be traced on the paper. The
                    image is an <hi rend="italic">inverted</hi> one. This is the simplest form of
                    the instrument, and may be constructed extemporaneously by fixing on a stand a
                    plain transparent glass, with its surfaces ground parallel, or a piece of
                    Muscovy glass, at an angle of forty-five degrees with the horizon; a card with a
                    small hole in it will serve as a sight for keeping the eye steady in one
                    situation whilst the pencil is tracing the image.</p>
                <p>If there be a plain mirror at an angle of 22∣ degrees with the horizon, and a
                    piece of plain transparent glass be placed near it, at an angle of 22∣ degrees
                    with the vertical, the rays from the object will be twice reflected before they
                    reach the eye; and consequently, on looking down through the transparent glass,
                    an <hi rend="italic">erect</hi> image is seen, and the peneil may be drawn over
                    the outlines of this image so as to leave a perspective representation on the
                    paper. This disposition is seen at fig 1, Plate CXLIV., where <hi rend="italic"
                    >he</hi> is the mirror, <hi rend="italic">ah</hi> the transparent plain
                    glass.</p>
                <p>As the image and pencil are at different distances, they cannot be both seen in
                    the same state of the eye. To remedy this, inconvenience, a convex glass is
                    used, of such focus as to require no more effort than is necessary for seeing
                    the distant objects distinctly. By means of this lens, the image will appear as
                    if it were placed on the surface of the paper. In fig. 1 <hi rend="italic"
                    >hd</hi> is a convex glass of twelve inches focus; at <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                    the eye is placed; <hi rend="italic">fghe</hi> is the course of the rays
                    proceeding from the object to the eye.</p>
                <p>Those whose eyes are adapted to seeing near objects alone, will not derive
                    advantage from the use of a convex glass, but will require a concave glass to be
                    placed at <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> in the course of the rays from the object to
                    the reflecting surface. In fig. 2, <hi rend="italic">ih</hi> is a concave glass
                    placed in the above-mentioned situation: it is so disposed as to be turned at
                    pleasure into its place, as the sight of the observer may require. Persons whose
                    sight is nearly perfect may use either the concave glass placed before the
                    reflecting surface, or the convex glass placed between the paper and the
                    eye.</p>
                <p>in the actual construction of the instrument, a prism is used instead of a mirror
                    and a plain glass. The rays from the object fall upon the surface <hi
                    rend="italic">he of</hi> the prism, fig. 3. This surface <hi rend="italic"
                    >he</hi> is inclined 22⅜ degrees to the horizon. The refractive power of the
                    glass allows none of the rays in this situation to pass out; they are all
                    reflected from the surface <hi rend="italic">he</hi> to the surface <hi
                    rend="italic">ah,</hi> and from that to the eye. <hi rend="italic">ah</hi> makes
                    an angle of 135 degrees with <hi rend="italic">he,</hi> and 221 degrees with the
                    vertical. The eye cannot see the pencil through the prism as it does through a
                    plain glass; therefore, in order that the pencil may be seen, the eye must be so
                    placed that only a part of the pupil may be above the edge of the prism, as at
                    <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> fig. 3; and then the reflected image will be seen at
                    the same time with the paper and pencil. There is a small piece of brass
                    perforated with a lwle <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> and moving on a ecntre, fig. 2;
                    this serves to keep the eye in one position, as it must be, that the image may
                    be steady, and also to regulate the relative quantities of light to be received
                    from the object and from the paper.</p>
                <p>The instrument," being near the eye, does not require to be large. The smallest
                    size which can be executed with accuracy is to be preferred, and is such that
                    the lens is only three fourths of an inch in diameter. Fig 4 shows the
                    instrument on its stand, and clamped to a board. The joint by which the prism is
                    attached to the stand is double. The whole instrument packs in a box eight
                    inches by two, and half an inch deep.</p>
                <p>This instrument serves for drawing objects of all forms, and consequently also
                    for copying lines already drawn on a plain surface. If it is required that the
                    copy shall be of the same size as the original drawing, the distance of the
                    drawing from the prism should be the same as the distance of the paper from the
                    eye-hole. No lens will be necessary in this ease, because the image and the
                    paper, being both at the same distance from the eye, coincide without the aid of
                    a glass.</p>
                <p>In order to have a reduced copy of a drawing, the drawing is to be placed at a
                    distance from the prism greater than the distance of the paper from the
                    eye-hole. If the distance is twice as great, a copy will be obtained in which
                    the lines are of one half the size of the lines in the original, and so in
                    proportion for other distances. A lens is necessary, that the eye may be enabled
                    to see at two different distances; and, in order that one lens may serve, the
                    distance between the eye-hole and the paper should be variable; to that effect
                    the stand is susceptible of being lengthened or shortened at pleasure.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193347484" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7484-0037"/>
                <p>The length of the stem is adjusted upon optical principles. When a distant object
                    is to be delineated, the rays coming from it, and reflected by the instrument to
                    the eye, are parallel, and it is required that the rays proceeding from the
                    paper to the eye should also be parallel. This is accomplished by interposing a
                    lens between the paper and the eye, with its principal focus on the paper. When
                    the object to be delineated is so near that the rays which come from it to the
                    eye are divergent, then it is required that the rays from the paper should
                    likewise be divergent in the same degree, in order that the paper and the image
                    may both be seen distinctly by the same eye; for this purpose the lens must be
                    placed at a distance from the paper less than the distance of its principal
                    focus. The stem of the instrument is marked at certain distances, to which the
                    conjugate foci are in the several proportions of 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. to I, so that
                    distinct vision may be obtained in all cases by placing the original drawing
                    more distant.</p>
                <p>If the convex lens be transposed to the front of the prism, and the proportional
                    distances be reversed, a magnified image of the object will be obtained.</p>
                <p>This instrument has deservedly come into use. Its advantages, when compared with
                    tĥc camera obscura, are, <hi rend="italic">ist,</hi> That it is small and easily
                    carried about, <hi rend="italic superscript"> t</hi> 2<hi rend="italic"
                    >dly,</hi> That no lines are distorted, not even those most remote from the
                    centre; whereas, in the camera obscura, the lines which are not near the centre
                    of the field are more or less distorted. 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> In the
                    field of the camera lucida 70 or 80 degrees may be included, whilst the distinct
                    field of the camera obscura does not extend beyond 30 or 35 degrees at most. The
                    specification of Dr Wollaston’s patent for the camera lucida is inserted in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Repertory of Arts,</hi> vol. X. 1807, p. 162, and his
                    description of the instrument in Nicholson’s <hi rend="italic">Journal,</hi>
                    vol. xvii.</p>
                <p>The camera lucida employed by Captain Hall packs in a small box. When the
                    instrument is to be used the box folds out and forms a small table, which is
                    fixed on the top of a tripod. There is a folding three-legged seat, which packs
                    within the tripod. The tripod, when closed and containing the seat, is only the
                    size of a walking stick.</p>
                <p>If the camera lucida be fixed at the eye-glass of a telescope, it will reflect to
                    the eye the image of the objects in the field of the telescope, so that a
                    drawing of the image may be made. See Dr Brewster’s <hi rend="italic">Account of
                    some Philosophical Instruments.</hi> A plain reflecting glass, fixed at an angle
                    of 45 degrees with the horizon, and placed so as to receive the rays from the
                    eye-glass of a telescope, will also give an image of the objects in the field,
                    so situated that the image may be traced with a pencil. Varley’s patent graphic
                    telescope is upon this principle. In order that the field may be large, the
                    magnifying power of the telescope should be small.</p>
                <p>• The inherent qualities of all the instruments for drawing in perspective being
                    closely allied, it will be proper to say something of the principles on which
                    these instruments are formed, and to mention some that are not described in
                    other parts of this work.</p>
                <p>To make a perspective drawing of an object is to lay down on paper a section of
                    the perspective cone, whose apex is at the eye, and whose base is the object. An
                    experienced draughtsman can draw the figure of this section without the aid of
                    instruments. Others who have not acquired the facility of drawing the image they
                    see, must have recourse either to <hi rend="italic">measurement,</hi> or to <hi
                    rend="italic">instruments which bring the image under the pencil.</hi></p>
                <p>Drawing by measurement is performed by actually measuring the height of the
                    principal parts of the object, and their horizontal distance from the eye;
                    together with the distance of the paper from the eye; and from these dimensions
                    the drawing is constructed by the systematic rules of perspective.</p>
                <p>Another mode of obtaining a drawing by measurement is to measure the angles at
                    the eye. Suited to this purpose are theodolites, astronomical quadrants, or
                    other instruments capable of measuring vertical and azimuthal angles at the eye.
                    ∙ The angles to be measured are, the angles of altitude, and the angles of
                    azimuth, between the point of sight and the principal points of the object; and
                    if the tangents of the azimuthal angles be laid down with a radius equal to the
                    distance of the paper from the eye, and the tangents of the angles of altitude
                    with a radius equal to the distance of the paper multiplied by the secant of the
                    azimuth, the situation of the principal points of the drawing will be
                    determined. Or, if the instrument is capable of measuring angles in any plane,
                    the angles between the principal points of the object and the point of sight are
                    to be observed, and the azimuthal angles of these principal points with the
                    point of sight; and the tangents of both are to be laid down on the paper, with
                    a radius equal to the distance of the paper from the eye.</p>
                <p>But these two modes by measurement are long, particularly the first. Usually,
                    therefore, the instruments to which recourse is had for facilitating the
                    operation of drawing, are such as give an image or section of the perspective
                    cone on a plain surface, so that the pencil maybe drawn over the outline of the
                    image. These instruments may be considered under two heads; the first
                    comprehending those in which the pencil is immediately drawn over the lines of
                    the image; the second those in which the pencil has a motion parallel to that of
                    the point which moves over the lines of the image.</p>
                <p>Of the first kind are the following. 1. The tracing pane, a very simple and
                    convenient instrument, consisting in a transparent plate of plain ground glass,
                    or of Muscovy glass, placed vertically between the object and the eye; whilst
                    the eye is kept fixed by a sight, the outline of the image is drawn on the glass
                    with Indian ink. 2. Or the upright glass may be divided into small squares by
                    lines crossing each other, and the paper on which the drawing is to be made
                    being similarly divided, the particular intersections on the glass that cover
                    the principal points of the object are observed, and these points are laid down
                    on the corresponding intersections on the paper. 3. The image seen in a plain
                    mirror may also be drawn on its surface with Indian ink. 4. In the camera
                    obscura, different forms of which are described in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopoedia</hi> under the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Dioptrics</hi> and
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics,</hi> the image to be drawn is formed at the focus
                    of a lens. 5. In the camera lucida the reflected image is used.</p>
                <p>In the second division of the instruments which give a Section of the perspective
                    cone susceptible of being delineated, the pencil does not move immediately over
                    the lines of the image, but moves parallel to these lines. 1. There is a rod
                    which can be moved in all directions, consistent with its remaining parallel to
                    itself. If one extremity of this rod be moved in space over the outlines of the
                    image which the eye sees, a pencil at the other extremity will necessarily move
                    with a similar motion, and form a drawing of the object on paper. In Sir
                    Christopher Wren’s instrument, of which he has given the description and figure
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> vol. iv., the rod is
                    suspended by strings passing over pullies, and the ends of the strings are fixed
                    to a counterpoise. On a similar principle' is Peacock’s instrument, described in

                    for the years 1760, 1774, and 1790. A well-constructed instrument on this

                    Cary’s in the Strand. 2. The pencil may delineate the base of a cone similar and
                    opposite to the-perspective cone. If the rays from the extreme points of an
                    object cross on the ray from the centre, as they do in passing through a small
                    hole into a dark room, and if it be supposed that, in the place of one of the
                    rays a slender inflexible rod is substituted movable on a centre at the hole,
                    when this rod is moved so that its outer extremity goes over the outlines of the
                    external image, a pencil fixed to its inner extremity will form an inverted
                    drawing of the object. Of this nature is the op-tigraph of Ramsden and Thomas
                    Jones, described in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine.,</hi> vol.
                    xxviii. 1807, p. 67. The image of the object is seen in a telescope. There is a
                    piece of plain glass near <hi rend="italic">c</hi> in the focus of the eye-glass
                    of the telescope F, fig. 5. On the centre of this piece of glass is a dot; <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> is a plain mirror, inclined so as to reflect the image of
                    the object down into the telescope. This mirror remains fixed, whilst the
                    telescope is movable on a universal joint at its object-glass <hi rend="italic"
                    >l&gt;.</hi> Near <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is another plain mirror, which
                    reflects the rays to the eye-glass. The eye being placed at the eye-glass at e,
                    the telescope is to be moved by the handle A, so that the dot in the focus of
                    the eye-glass shall pass over the outlines of the image seen by the eye, and the
                    pencil at L performing a similar motion to that of the dot, and sliding freely
                    in its sheath, presses with its weight on the paper: a drawing of the object is
                    the result. If the stand and slider H be lengthened, an enlarged drawing will be
                    obtained. The instrument packs in a box 14 inches by 6 and 3.</p>
                <p>The instrument used for drawing profiles of the face consists of a long rod which
                    moves on a joint. One end of the rod is moved over the face, the other end,
                    which terminates in an iron point, describes the profile on paper. Professor
                    Wallace of Edinburgh has constructed an improved drawing instrument, which will
                    be described under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Eidograph.</hi> It is of the
                    nature of the pento-graph, and serves for copying and reducing. <hi

                    placed within the machine, in the focus of the glass. The first invention of

                    by exhibiting images perfectly like their objects, each being clothed in its

                    n∙o other art can <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> imitate. By means of this
                    instrument, a person unacquainted with designing will be able to delineate
                    objects with the greatest accuracy and justness, and another well versed in
                    painting will find in it many things to perfect his art.</p>
