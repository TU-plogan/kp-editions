                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">CATO, <hi rend="smallcaps">Marcus Portius</hi></label>, the
                    Censor, one of the greatest men among the ancients, was born at Tusculum in the
                    year of Rome 519, about the 232d before Christ. He began to bear arms at
                    seventeen, and on all occasions showed extraordinary courage. He was a man of
                    great sobriety, and reckoned no bodily exercise unworthy of him. He had but one
                    horse for himself and his baggage, and he looked after and dressed it himself.
                    On his return from his campaigns he betook himself to plough his ground; not
                    that he was without slaves to do it, but because such was his inclination. He
                    also dressed like his slaves, sat down at the same table with them, and partook
                    of the same fare. He did not in the meanwhile neglect to cultivate his mind,
                    especially in regard to the art of speaking; and he employed his talents, which
                    were very great, in generously pleading causes in the neighbouring cities
                    without fee or reward. Valerius Flaccus, who had a country seat near Cato,
                    conceiving an esteem for him, persuaded him to go to Rome, where Cato, by his
                    own merits, and the influence of so powerful a patron, was soon taken notice of,
                    and promoted. He was first of all elected tribune of the soldiers for the
                    province of Sicily; and he was next made questor in Africa under Scipio. Having
                    in this last office reproved the general for his profuseness to his soldiers,
                    the latter answered that he did not want so exact a questor, but would make war
                    at what expense he pleased; nor was he to give an account to the Roman people of
                    the money he spent, but only of his enterprises, and the execution of them.
                    Cato, provoked at this answer, left Sicily, and returned to Rome.</p>
                <p>Cato was afterwards made pretor, and fulfilled the duties of that office with the
                    strictest justice. He conquered Sardinia, governed with admirable moderation,
                    and was created consul. Being tribune in the war of Syria, he gave distinguished
                    proofs of his valour against Antiochus the Great; and on his return stood
                    candidate for the office of censor. But the nobles, who not only hated him as a
                    <hi rend="italic">new</hi> man, but dreaded his severity, set up against him
                    seven powerful competitors. Valerius Flaccus, who had introduced him into public
                    life, and had been his colleague in the consulship, was a ninth candidate, and
                    these two united their interests. On this occasion Cato, far from employing soft
                    words to the people, or giving hopes of gentleness or complaisance in the
                    execution of his office, loudly declared from the rostra, with a threatening
                    look and voice, that the times required firm and vigorous magistrates, to put a
                    stop to that growing luxury which menaced the republic with ruin; censors who
                    would cut up the evil by the roots, and restore the rigour of ancient
                    discipline. It is to the honour of the people of Rome, that, notwithstanding
                    these startling intimations, they preferred him to all his competitors, who
                    courted them by promises of a mild and easy administration. The comitia also
                    appointed his friend Valerius his colleague, without whom he had declared that
                    he could not hope to compass the reformations he had in view. Cato’s merit, upon
                    the whole, was superior to that of any of the great men who stood against him.
                    He was temperate, brave, and indefatigable; frugal of the public money, and
                    wholly incorruptible. There is scarcely any talent requisite for public or
                    private life which he had not received from nature, or acquired by industry. He
                    was a great soldier, an able statesman, an eloquent orator, a learned historian,
                    and very skilful in rural affairs. Yet with all these accomplishments he had
                    very great faults. His ambition being poisoned with envy, disturbed both his own
                    peace and that of the whole city as long as he lived. Though he refused to take
                    bribes, he was unmerciful and unconscionable in amassing wealth by all means
                    which the law did not punish as criminal.</p>
                <p>No part of the censor’s conduct seemed so cruel to the nobles and their wives as
                    the taxes he laid upon luxury in all its branches, including dress, household
                    furniture, women’s toilets, chariots, slaves, and equipage. The people, however,
                    were in general pleased with his regulations; insomuch that they ordered a
                    statue to be erected to his honour in the Temple of Health, with an inscription
                    which mentioned nothing of his victories or triumphs, but imported only, that by
                    his wise ordinances in his censorship he had reformed the manners of the
                    republic. Plutarch relates, that before this, upon some of Cato’s friends
                    expressing their surprise, that when many persons without merit or reputation
                    had statues, he had none, he answered, “I had much rather it should be asked why
                    the people <pb break="no" facs="nls:193350227" xml:id="kp-eb0706-0227-0248"
                    />have not erected a statue to Cato, than why they have.” Cato was the occasion
                    of the third Punic war. Being dispatched to Africa to terminate a difference
                    between the Carthaginians and the king of Numidia, he, on his return to Rome,
                    reported that Carthage had grown excessively rich and populous, and warmly
                    exhorted the senate to destroy a city and republic, during the existence of
                    which Rome could never be safe. Having brought from Africa some very large figs,
                    he showed them to the conscript fathers in one of the lappets of his gown. “The
                    country,” says he, “where this fine fruit grows, is but a three days’ voyage
                    from Rome.” We are told that from this time he never spoke in the senate upon
                    any subject, without concluding with these words, “I am also of opinion that
                    Carthage ought to be destroyed.” He judged, that for a people debauched by
                    prosperity, nothing was more to be feared than a rival state, always powerful,
                    and now, from its misfortunes, grown wise and circumspect. He held it necessary
                    to remove all dangers that could be apprehended from without, when the republic
                    had within so many distempers threatening her destruction.</p>
                <p>Cato died in the year of Rome 604, aged eighty-five. He wrote several works, as,
                    1. A Roman History; 2. Concerning the Art of War; 3. Of Rhetoric; 4. A Treatise
                    of Husbandry. Of these the last only is extant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cato,</hi><hi rend="italic">Marcus Portius</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Cato of Utica,</hi> was
                    great-grandson of Cato the Censor. It is said that from his infancy he
                    discovered, by his speech, his countenance, and even by his childish sports and
                    recreations, an inflexibility of mind; for he forced himself to execute whatever
                    he had undertaken, though the task was ill suited to his strength. He was rough
                    towards those who flattered him, and quite untractable when threatened; he was
                    rarely seen to laugh, or even to smile, and not easily provoked to anger; but if
                    once incensed he was scarcely to be pacified. Sylla having conceived a
                    friendship for the father of Cato, sent often for him and his brother, and
                    talked familiarly with them. Cato, who was then about fourteen years of age,
                    seeing the heads of great men brought there, and observing the sighs of those
                    who were present, asked his preceptor, why does nobody kill this man? Because,
                    said the other, he is more feared than he is hated. The boy replied, why then
                    did you not give me a sword when you brought me hither, that I might have
                    stabbed him, and freed my country from this slavery?</p>
                <p>He learned the principles of the Stoic philosophy, which so well suited his
                    character, under Antipater of Tyre, and applied himself diligently to the study
                    of it. Eloquence he likewise cultivated as a necessary means of defending the
                    cause of justice, and made considerable proficiency in that art. To increase his
                    bodily strength, he inured himself to suffer the extremes of heat and cold; and
                    used to make journeys on foot and bare-headed in all seasons. When he was sick,
                    patience and abstinence were his only remedies; he shut himself up, and would
                    see nobody till he became well. Though remarkably sober in the beginning of his
                    life, making it a rule to drink but once after supper and then retire, he
                    insensibly contracted a habit of drinking more freely, and of sitting at table
                    till morning. His friends endeavoured to excuse this, by saying that the affairs
                    of the public engrossed his attention during the day, and that, being ambitious
                    of knowledge, he passed the night in the conversation of philosophers. He
                    affected singularity; and, in things indifferent, sought to act directly
                    contrary to the taste and fashions of the age. Magnanimity and constancy are
                    generally ascribed to him; and Seneca would fain make that haughtiness and
                    contempt for others, which, in Cato, accompanied those virtues, a subject of
                    praise. Cato, says Seneca, having received a blow in the face, neither took
                    revenge nor was angry; he did not even pardon the affront, but denied that he
                    had received it. His virtue raised him so high that injury could not reach him.
                    He served as a volunteer under Gallus in the war of Spartacus; and when military
                    rewards were offered him by the commander, he refused them, because he thought
                    he had no right to them. Some years afterwards he went a legionary tribune into
                    Macedonia, under the praetor Rubrius; in which station he appeared,in dress, and
                    during a march, more like a private soldier than an officer: but the dignity of
                    his manners, the elevation of his sentiments, and the superiority of his views,
                    set him far above those who bore the titles of generals and proconsuls.</p>
                <p>Cato laboured to bring about a reconciliation between Caesar and Pompey; but
                    seeing it in vain, he took part with the latter. When Pompey was slain he fled
                    to Utica, and being pursued by Caesar, advised his friends to be gone, and throw
                    themselves on Caesar’s clemency. His son, however, remained with him; and also
                    Statilius, a young man, remarkable for his hatred of Caesar. The evening before
                    the execution of the purpose he had formed with regard to himself, after
                    bathing, he supped with his friends and the magistrates of the city. They sat
                    late at table, and the conversation was lively. The discourse falling upon this
                    maxim of the Stoics, that the wise man alone is free, and that the vicious are
                    slaves, Demetrius, who was a Peripatetic, undertook to confute it from the
                    maxims of his school. Cato, in answer, treated the matter very amply, and with
                    so much earnestness and vehemence of voice, that he betrayed himself, and
                    confirmed the suspicion of his friends that he designed to kill himself. When he
                    had done speaking, a melancholy silence ensued; and Cato perceiving it, turned
                    the discourse to the present situation of affairs, expressing his concern for
                    those who had been obliged to put to sea, as well as for those who had
                    determined to make their escape by land, and had a dry and sandy desert to pass.
                    After supper, the company being dismissed, he walked for some time with a few
                    friends, and gave his orders to the officers of the guard; and going into his
                    chamber, he embraced his son and his friends with more than usual tenderness,
                    which further confirmed the suspicions of the resolution he had taken. He then
                    laid himself down on his bed, and took up Plato’s Dialogue on the Immortality of
                    the Soul. Having read for some time, he looked up, and missing his sword, which
                    his son had removed while he was at supper, he called a slave, and asked who had
                    taken it away; and receiving no pertinent answer, he resumed his reading. Some
                    time afterwards he asked again for his sword, and, without showing any
                    impatience, ordered it to be brought to him; but having read out the book, and
                    finding nobody had brought him his sword, he called for all his servants, fell
                    into a rage, and struck one of them on the mouth with so much violence that he
                    very much hurt his own hand, crying out in a passionate manner, “What! do my own
                    son and family conspire to betray me, and deliver me up naked and unarmed to the
                    enemy ?” Immediately his son and friends rushed into the room, and began to
                    lament, and to beseech him to change his resolution. Cato raising himself, and
                    looking fiercely at them, “How long is it,” said he, “since I have lost my
                    senses, and my son is become my keeper? Brave and generous son, why do you not
                    bind your father’s hands, that when Caesar comes he may find me unable to defend
                    myself? Do you imagine that without a sword I cannot end my life? Cannot 1
                    destroy myself by holding my breath for some moments, or by striking my head
                    against the wall ?” His son answered with his tears, and retired. Apollonides
                    and Demetrius remained with him; and to them he addressed himself in the
                    following words: “Is it to watch over me that ye sit <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193350240" xml:id="kp-eb0706-0240-0249"/>silent here? Do you pretend
                    to force a man of my years to live? or can you bring any reason to prove that it
                    is not base and unworthy of Cato to beg his safety of an enemy? or why do you
                    not persuade me to unlearn what I have been taught, that, rejecting all the
                    opinions I have hitherto defended, I may now, by Caesar’s means, grow wiser, and
                    be yet more obliged to him than for life alone? Not that I have determined any
                    thing concerning myself; but I would have it in my power to perform what I shall
                    think fit to resolve upon; and I shall not fail to ask your counsel when I have
                    occasion to act up to the principles which your philosophy teaches. Go tell my
                    son that he should not compel his father to what he cannot persuade him.” They
                    withdrew, and the sword was brought by a young slave. Cato drew it, and finding
                    the point to be sharp, “Now,” said he, “I am my own master and, laying it down,
                    he took up his book again, which it is reported he read twice over. After this
                    he slept so soundly that he was heard to snore by those who were near him. About
                    midnight he called two of his freedmen, Cleanthes his physician, and Butas, whom
                    he chiefly employed in the management of his affairs. The last he sent to the
                    port to see whether all the Römans were gone; to the physician he gave his hand
                    to be dressed, which was swelled by the blow he had given his slave. This being
                    regarded as an intimation that he intended to live, gave great joy to his
                    family. Butas soon returned, and brought word that they were all gone except
                    Crassus, who had staid upon some business, but was just ready to depart. He
                    added that the wind was high and the sea rough. These words drew a sigh from
                    Cato. He sent Butas again to the port to know whether there might not be some
                    one who, in the hurry of embarkation, had forgotten some necessary provisions,
                    and had been obliged to put back to Utica. It was now break of day, and Cato
                    slept yet a little more, till Butas returned to tell him that all was perfectly
                    quiet. He then ordered him to shut the door, and flung himself upon his bed, as
                    if he meant to finish his night’s rest; but immediately he took his sword and
                    stabbed himself a little below his chest; yet not being able to use his hand so
                    well, by reason of the swelling, the blow did not kill him. It threw him into a
                    convulsion, in which he fell from his bed, and overturned a table near it. The
                    noise gave the alarm, and his son and the rest of the family entering the room,
                    found him weltering in his blood, and his bowels half out of his body. The
                    surgeon, upon examination, found that his bowels were not 'cut, and was
                    preparing to replace them and bind up the wound, when Cato, recovering his
                    senses, thrust the surgeon from him, and tearing out his bowels, immediately
                    expired, in the forty-eighth year of his age. This was the insanity of political
                    fanaticism.</p>
