                <p><label type="entry">CAMOENS</label>, Louis, the most illustrious of the
                    Portuguese poets, was born at Lisbon in 1517. His family was of considerable
                    note, and originally Spanish. In 1370 Vasco Perez dc Camaens, disgusted at the
                    court of Castile, fled to that of Lisbon, where King Ferdinand immediately
                    admitted him into his council, and gave him the lordships of Sardoal, Punhete,
                    Marano, Amendo, and other lands of considerable extent, a certain proof of the
                    eminence of his rank and abilities. In the war of the succession, which broke
                    out on the death of Ferdinand, Ca-mocns sided with the king of Castile, and was
                    killed in the battle of Aljabarota. But though John I. the victor, seized a
                    great part of his estate, his widow, the daughter of Gonzalo Tereyro, grand
                    master of the order of Christ, and general of the Portuguese army, was not
                    reduced beneath her rank. She had three sons who took the name of Camaens. The
                    family of the eldest intermarried with the first nobility of Portugal, and even,
                    according to Cas-tera, with the blood royal; but the family of the second
                    brother, whose fortune was slender, had the superior honour of producing the
                    author of the Lusiad.</p>
                <p>The misfortunes of our poet commenced early in life. In his infancy, Simon Vaz de
                    Camaens, his father, commander of a vessel, was shipwrecked at Goa, where he
                    perished, together with the greater part of his fortune. His mother, however,
                    Anne de Macedo of Santarem, provided for the education of her son Louis at the
                    university of Coimbra, where he acquired an intimacy with the classics, equal to
                    that of a Scaliger, but directed by the taste of a Milton or a Pope. When he
                    left the university he appeared at court. He was handsome, with expressive eyes
                    and a fine complexion; and as he was a polished scholar, this, added to the
                    natural ardour and vivacity of bis disposition, rendered him an accomplished
                    gentleman. Courts are the usual scenes of intrigue; and intrigue was then
                    fashionable at Lisbon. But the particulars of the amours of Camaens remain
                    unknown. It only appears that he had aspired above his rank, and was in
                    consequence banished from the court; and in several of his sonnets he ascribes
                    his misfortunes to love.</p>
                <p>He now retired to his mother’s friends at Santarcm, where he renewed his studies,
                    and began his poem on the discovery of India. But as John III. was at this time
                    preparing an armament against Africa, Camaens, tired of an inactive and obscure
                    life, went to Ceuta with the expedition, and greatly distinguished himself by
                    his valour in several encounters. In a naval engagement with the Moors in the
                    Straits of Gibraltar, he was among the foremost to board, and lost his right eye
                    in the conflict. Yet neither the hurry of actual service, nor the dissipation of
                    a camp, could stifle his genius. He continued his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lusiadas,</hi> and several of his most beautiful sonnets were written in
                    Africa, while, as he expressed it, “one hand the pen, and one the sword
                    employed.” The fame of his valour had now reached the court, and he obtained
                    permission to return to Lisbon. But whilst he solicited an establishment which
                    he had merited in the ranks of battle, the malignity of evil tongues, as he
                    expresses it in one of his letters, was poured out upon him. Though the bloom of
                    his early youth was effaced by several years’ residence under the scorching sun
                    of Africa, and though altered by the loss of an eye, his presence gave
                    uneasiness to the gentlemen of some families of the first rank where he had
                    formerly visited; and Camaens now found it prudent to banish himself from his
                    native country. Accordingly, in 1553, he sailed for India, with a resolution
                    never to return. As the ship left the Tagus, he exclaimed, in the words of the
                    sepulchral monument of Scipio Africanus, <hi rend="italic">Ingrata
                    patria,</hi><hi rend="italic">non</hi><hi rend="italic">possidebis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ossa mea</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> “ungrateful country, thou
                    shalt not possess my bones.” But he knew not what evils in the East would awaken
                    the remembrance of his native land.</p>
                <p>λVhen Camaens arrived in India, an expedition was ready to sail, to avenge the
                    king of Cochin on the king of Pimenta. Without allowing himself any rest on
                    shore after his long voyage, he joined this armament, and in the conquest of the
                    Alagada islands displayed his usual bravery. In the following year Camaens
                    attended Manuel de Vasconccllo in an expedition to the Red Sea, where, as he had
                    no use for his sword, he employed his pen, and also visited Mount Felix and the
                    adjacent part of Africa, which he so strongly pictures in the Lusiad, and in one
                    of his little pieces where he laments the absence of his mistress. λVhen he
                    returned to Goa he enjoyed a tranquillity which enabled him to bestow attention
                    on his epic; but this serenity was interrupted by his own imprudence; for he
                    wrote some satires which gave offence, and, by order of the viceroy, Francisco
                    Barreto, he was banished to China.</p>
                <p>But the accomplishments and manners of Camaens soon found him friends, though
                    under the disgrace of banishment. He was appointed commissary in the island of
                    Macao, a Portuguese settlement in the bay of Canton, where be continued his
                    Lusiad; and, after five years residence, he acquired a fortune, though small,
                    yet equal to his wishes. Dom Constantine de Braganza was now viceroy of India;
                    and Camaens, desirous to return to Goa, resigned his charge, and set sail in a
                    ship freighted by himself; but he was shipwrecked in the gulf near the mouth of
                    the river Mecon, on the coast of China, and all he had acquired perished in the
                    waves. His poems, which he held in one hand, while he swam with the other, were
                    all he found himself possessed of when he stood friendless on an unknown
                    shore.</p>
                <p>On the banks of the Mccon he wrote his beautiful paraphrase of the psalm, <hi
                    rend="italic">Super</hi><hi rend="italic">flumina</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Babylonis,</hi> where the Jews, in the finest strain of poetry, are represented
                    as hanging their harps on the willows, by the rivers of Babylon, and lamenting
                    their exile from their native land. Here Camaens continued some time, till an
                    opportunity offered of a passage to Goa. When he arrived at that city, Dorn
                    Constantine de Braganza, the viceroy, admitted him to his friendship, and
                    Camaens continued happy till Count Redondo assumed the government. While
                    Constantine continued in power, those who bad formerly procured the banishment
                    of the satirist were silent; but now they exerted all their arts against him.
                    Redondo, when he entered upon office, however, pretended to be the friend of <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193347562" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7562-0043"/> Camaens; yet,
                    with unfeeling indifference, he suffered the innocent man to be thrown into the
                    common prison. But after much delay in bringing forward witnesses, Camaens, in a
                    public trial, fully refuted every accusation directed against his conduct while
                    commissary at Macao, and his enemies were loaded with ignominy and reproach.
                    Camaens, however, had some creditors, and they detained him in prison a
                    considerable time, till the gentlemen of Goa becoming ashamed that a man of his
                    singular merit should experience such treatment among them, he was set at
                    liberty, again assumed the profession of arms, and received the allowance of a
                    gentleman volunteer, a character at this time common in Portuguese India. Soon
                    afterwards, Pedro Barreto, appointed governor of the fort at Sofala, allured the
                    poet by high promises to attend him thither. The governor of a distant fort, in
                    a barbarous country, shares in some measure the fate of an exile; yet, though
                    the only motive of Barreto was to enjoy the conversation of Camaens at his
                    table, he took no care to render the life of his guest agreeable. Chagrined with
                    his treatment, and weary of a state of dependence, Camaens resolved to return to
                    his native country. A ship, on the homeward voyage, at this time touched at
                    Sofala, and several gentlemen on board were desirous that Camaens should
                    accompany them; but this the governor ungenerously endeavoured to prevent, and
                    charged him with a debt for board. Anthony de Cabra, however, and Hector de
                    Sylvcira, paid the demand; and Camaens and the hb-nour of Barreto were
                    discharged together.</p>
                <p>After an absence of sixteen years, Camaens in 1569 returned to Lisbon, unhappy
                    even in his restoration to his native country, for the pestilence then raged in
                    the capital, and prevented his publication for three years. At last, in 1572, he
                    printed his Lusiad, which, in the opening of the first book, he addressed to
                    King Sebastian, then in his eighteenth year, wdio was so pleased with its merit,
                    that he gave the author a pension of four thousand reals, on condition that he
                    should reside at court; but this salary seems to have been withdrawn by Cardinal
                    Henry, who succeeded to the crown of Portugal, which Sebastian lost at the
                    battle of Alcaçar in Africa.</p>
                <p>Henry, though the patron of one species of literature, utterly neglected the
                    author of the Lusiad; and under his inglorious reign Camaens died in all the
                    misery of poverty, and, according to some, in an alms-house. It appears,
                    however, that he had not even that certainty of subsistence which such houses
                    usually provide. He had a black servant, who had grown old with him, and had
                    long experienced his master’s humanity. This grateful Indian, a native of Java,
                    who, according to some, had saved his master’s life in the unhappy shipwreck
                    where he lost his effects, begged in the streets of Lisbon for the only man in
                    Portugal on whom God had bestowed those talents which had a tendency to elevate
                    the spirit of a declining age. To the eye of a faithful observer, the fate of
                    Camaens throws great light on that of his country, and will appear strictly
                    connected with it. The same ignorance, and the same degenerate spirit, which
                    suffered Camaens to depend on his share of the alms begged in the streets by his
                    aged servant, sunk the kingdom of Portugal into the most abject vassalage ever
                    experienced by a conquered nation. But while the grandees of Portugal were blind
                    to the ruin which impended over them, Camaens beheld it with a pungency of grief
                    which hastened his end. In one of his letters he has these remarkable words: “I
                    am ending the course of my life; the world will witness how I have loved my
                    country. I have returned, not only to die in her bosom, but to die with 'lier.”
                    In this unhappy situation died, at the age of sixty-two, the year after the
                    fatal defeat of Dorn Sebastian, Louis de Camaens, the greatest genius Portugal
                    ever produced; in martial courage and spirit nothing inferior to her most
                    honoured heroes.</p>
                <p>Fifteen years after his death, a monument was erected in honour of Camaens. Death
                    had allayed all jealousies; and the homage due to him, as the national poet of
                    Portugal, was now enthusiastically paid. The genius of Camaens was inspired by
                    the history of his country and the manners of his age; his lyric poems, in
                    particular, like the works of Dante, Petrarch, Ariosto, and Vasso, belong to
                    romantic and chivalrous rather than to purely classical literature; and hence
                    the partizans of the latter, which were very numerous in his time, were far from
                    greeting with applause the first steps of his career. Of the Lusiad it would be
                    superfluous to offer any criticism in this place. Suffice it to say, that with
                    many faults, both of design and execution, it possesses perfect unity of
                    interest, arising from the patriotic sentiments with which it is animated
                    throughout, and charms alike by the stateliness and grace of its versification,
                    which foreigners as well as native Portuguese can relish and appreciate. The
                    most esteemed edition of the works of Camaens appeared at Lisbon in 1779—1780,
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Obras de Luis de Camaens</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">principe</hi><hi rend="italic">dos</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >poetas</hi><hi rend="italic">de Hespanha,</hi> 4 tom. 12mo. A second edition
                    also appeared in 1782-1783, the first volume of which contains the life of the
                    author and the Lusiad, and the last the dramatic and other pieces ascribed to
                    Camaens.</p>
