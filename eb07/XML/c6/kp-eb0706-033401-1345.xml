                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">CHASTITY</label>. Purity of the body, or freedom from
                    obscenity. The Romañ law justifies homicide in defence of the chastity either of
                    one’s self or one’s relations; and so also, according to Selden, stood the law
                    in the Jewish republic. The law of England likewise justifies a woman in killing
                    a man who attempts to ravish her. So the husband or father may justify killing a
                    man who attempts a rape upon his wife or daughter, but not if he takes them in
                    adultery by consent; for the one is forcible and felonious, the other not.</p>
