                    celebrated statesman, grammarian, and divine, descended of an ancient family in
                    the Isle of Wight, was born at Cambridge in the year 1514, and educated at St
                    John’s College in that university. After taking his degrees in arts, he was
                    first chosen Greek lecturer, and then, in 1540, professor of that language, with
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> stipend of L.40 a year. In this station he was
                    principally instrumental in reforming the pronunciation of the Greek language,
                    which, having been much neglected, was imperfectly understood. About the year
                    1543 he was incorporated as master of arts at Oxford, where, we are told, lie
                    had studied for some time. In the following year he was sent to the court of
                    King Henry VIII. and appointed tutor for the Latin language, jointly with Sir
                    Anthony Cooke, to Prince Edward, about which time he was made canon of the
                    college newly founded at Oxford; so that he must by this time have been in
                    orders. On the accession of his royal pupil to the crown, Mr Cheke was first
                    rewarded with a pension of a hundred merks, and afterwards obtained several
                    considerable grants from the crown. In 1550 he was made chief gentleman of the
                    privy chamber, and was knighted the following year; in 1552, chamberlain of the
                    exchequer for life; in 1553, clerk of the council; and soon afterwards secretary
                    of state and privy counsellor. But these honours were of short duration. Having
                    concurred in the measures of the Duke of Northumberland for settling the crown
                    on the unfortunate Lady Jane Grey, and acted as her secretary during the nine
                    days of her reign, Sir John Cheke was, on the accession of Queen Mary, sent to
                    the Tower, and stripped of the greater part of his possessions. In September
                    1554 he obtained his liberty, and a license from her majesty to travel abroad.
                    He went first to Basel, thence to Italy, and afterwards returned to Strasburg,
                    where he was reduced to the necessity of reading Greek lectures for subsistence.
                    In 1556 he set out in an evil hour to meet his wife at Brussels; but before he
                    reached that city he was seized by order of Philip IL, hoodwinked, and thrown
                    into a waggon, and thus ignominiously conducted to a ship, which brought him to
                    the Tower of London. He soon found that religion was the cause of his
                    imprisonment; for he was immediately visited by two Catholic priests, who
                    piously endeavoured to convert him, but without success. However, he was at last
                    visited by Fleckenham, who told him from the queen that he must either comply or
                    be burned. This powerful argument had the desired effect; Sir John Cheke
                    formally complied, and his lands, upon certain conditions, were restored; but
                    his remorse soon put an end to his life. He died in September 1557, at the house
                    of his friend Mr Peter Osborne, in Wood Street, London, and was buried in St
                    Alban’s church. He left three sons, the eldest of whom, Henry, was knighted by
                    Queen Elizabeth. He wrote, 1. A Latin translation of two of St Chrysostom’s
                    homilies, Lond, 1543, 4to; 2. A Latin translation of six homilies of the same
                    Father, Lond. 1547; 3. The Hurt of Sedition, Lond. 1549, 1576, 1641; 4. A Latin
                    translation of the English Communion Service, printed among Buccr’s Opuscula; 5.
                    De Obitu doctissimi et sanctissimi theologi Domini Martini Buceri, &amp;c. Lond.
                    1551; 6. Carmen Heroicum, or Epitaphium, in Antonium Deneium clarissimum virum,
                    Lond. 4to; 7. De Pronunciatione Graecae, Basel, 1555, 8vo; 8. De Superstitione
                    ad Regem Henricum; 8. Several letters published in his life by Strype; 10. A
                    Latin translation of Archbishop Cranmer’s book on the Lord’s Supper, 1553; 11.
                    Translation of Leo de Apparatu Bellico, Basel, 1554. Sir John Cheke left also a
                    great many unpublished writings, which are most probably lost.</p>
