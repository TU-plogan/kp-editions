                <p><label type="entry">CASAUBON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Isaac de</hi></label>, was
                    born at Geneva, on the 18th February 1559, his family, which was originally from
                    Dauphine, having taken refuge in that city after embracing the reformed
                    religion. He received the rudiments of his education from his father, who was*
                    latterly minister of Crest; and his progress was so rapid that at the age of
                    nine he spoke Latin with correctness and fluency. He remained under the paternal
                    roof till he was nineteen, when he entered upon his academical course at Geneva;
                    and having devoted himself to the study of jurisprudence, theology, and the
                    oriental languages, he was in 1582 found qualified to succeed his master, Μ.
                    Portus, in the chair of Greek. He married Florence, daughter of Μ. Er,iennc;
                    and, in 1596, accepted the chair of Greek and belles-lettres at Montpellier,
                    where, however, he remained only two years, because the salary which had been
                    promised him was ill paid. Henry IV. informed of his merit, now called him to
                    Paris, and gave, him a situation similar to that which he had held in Languedoc.
                    But his religion, the jealousy of the other professors, and perhaps also his
                    untractable temper, produced misunderstandings, and occasioned inconveniences,
                    for which, however, he was amply indemnified by being appointed librarian to the
                    king, with a salary of four hundred francs, which was a considerable sum at that
                    period. He was one of the commissioners at the conference of Fontainbleau,
                    between Cardinal Duperron and Duplessis Mornai, and gave his opinion in favour
                    of the former and against the latter. It is known, indeed, that on various
                    important points he dissented from the tenets of the reformed church; and he was
                    even suspected of a disposition to reconcile himself to the ancient religion; a
                    suspicion which was strengthened when his son embraced the Romish religion, and
                    became a Capuchin. After the death of Henry IV. Casaubon went to England in the
                    suite of Sir Henry W'otton, ambassador extraordinary of King James I. and was
                    received with great favour by that monarch, who gave him two prebends, one at
                    Canterbury and the other at Westminster, and, besides, conferred on him a
                    pension of L.200. Casaubon now established himself definitively in England, and
                    died at London on the 1st of July 1614. He was buried at Westminster, where a
                    monument was erected to his memory. The Protestants of France always doubted the
                    sincerity of his attachment to their party: and Pierre Dumoulin, writing to
                    Montague, bishop of Bath, said that Casaubon had a great inclination towards
                    popery; that he only adhered to the reformed religion by reason of his doubts
                    regarding a small number of articles; and that he would end by changing his
                    religion; a prediction which, however, was not verified. Nevertheless, Casaubon
                    was an able theologian, a scholar of the first order, a good translator, and an
                    excellent critic. Pithou, De Thou, Heinsius, Graevius, and other learned men,
                    have all given him the same character. Cardinal Duperron said of him that, in
                    the belles-lettres, he knew more than all the Jesuits put together, which was
                    manifestly an exaggeration; and added, that when he spoke French, he appeared to
                    be a peasant, but when he spoke Latin, he seemed to employ his native tongue,
                    which was not far from the truth. His Latin, however, is deformed by Gallicisms,
                    and his historical works are not free from inaccuracies. A complete list of his
                    works would of itself fill several columns. The principal are, 1. <hi

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Casaubon,</hi><hi rend="italic">Meric,</hi> son of the
                    preceding, was born at Geneva, on the 14th of August 1599. Having commenced his
                    studies at the Protestant academy of Sedan, he followed his father to England,
                    and went to pursue them at Christ College, Oxford, where he took the degree of
                    master of arts in 1621. He was appointed curate of Bledon in the county of
                    Somerset, prebendary of Canterbury, and rector of Wickham; but the great
                    revolution which conducted Charles I. to the block deprived him of all his
                    preferments. A proposal was afterwards made to him upon the part of Oliver
                    Cromwell, to write the history of the civil war, a task in the performance of
                    which he was assured that he might exercise the greatest impartiality; and at
                    the same time a pension was offered to him with reversion to his children, and
                    determinable only by the death of the youngest of them. But lie respectfully
                    declined to undertake the proposed work, upon the ground that it would be
                    equally unsuitable to his character and principles, and that he might conceive
                    himself obliged to introduce reflections which could scarcely fail to be
                    displeasing to the protector. Notwithstanding this refusal, however, Cromwell,
                    sensible of his integrity and worth, ordered a gratuity of L.400 to be tendered
                    him by a bookseller in London; but Casaubon, although his circum·' stances were
                    then straitened, rejected the offer, which he could only consider as in reality
                    a bribe. Christina, queen of Sweden, also attempted, by her ambassador, to
                    induce him to repair to that country, promising him a suitable appointment; but
                    with no better success, for he had resolved to spend the remainder of his days
                    in England. At the restoration he was rewarded for his unalterable fidelity,
                    bybeing reinstated in all his benefices, which he enjoyedtill the period of his
                    death, which happened on the 14th July 1671. He was interred in the cathedral of
                    Canterbury, where a monument with a suitable inscription was erected to his
                    memory. Casaubon was a pious man, charitable to the poor, of an honest and
                    affable character, and ever ready to communicate the result of his researches.
                    He applied himself principally to criticism, in which he succeeded better than
                    in any other pursuit; and his erudition was varied, though by no means so
                    profound as that of his father, from whose papers, moreover, he derived great
                    benefit. To the philosophy of Descartes he ascribed the decline of the taste for
                    the belles-lettres, which formed one of the characteristics of his time. His

                    Casaubon’s English style is hard and lumbering, being interlarded with Greek and
                    Latin words, according to the usage of his time. He left a great number of
                    manuscripts, which are preserved in one of the libraries at Oxford.</p>
