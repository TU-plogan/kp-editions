                <p><label type="entry">CHANCELLOR</label> was at first only a chief notary or scribe
                    under the emperors, and was called <hi rend="italic">cancellarius,</hi> because
                    he sat behind a lattice (in Latin <hi rend="italic">cancellus},</hi> to avoid
                    being crowded by the people; but some derive the word from <hi rend="italic"
                    >caìicellare,</hi> to cancel. This officer was afterwards invested with several
                    judicial powers, and a general superintendence over the rest of the officers of
                    the prince. From the Roman empire it passed to the Roman church, ever emulous of
                    imperial state; and hence every bishop has to this day his chancellor, who is
                    the principal judge of his consistory. And when the modern kingdoms of Europe
                    were established upon the ruins of the empire, almost every state preserved its
                    chancellor with different jurisdictions and dignities, according to their
                    different constitutions. But in all of them he seems to have had the supervision
                    of charters, letters, and such other public instruments of the crown as were
                    authenticated in the most solemn manner; and therefore, when seals came in use,
                    he had always the custody of the king’s great seal.</p>

                    rend="italic">of Great Eritain,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Lord Keeper of the
                    Great Seal,</hi> is the highest honour of the long robe, and created by the mere
                    delivery of the king’s great seal into the custody of him who is selected to
                    fill the office; by which he becomes, without writ or patent, an officer of the
                    greatest weight and power of any in the kingdom. He is a privy counsellor by his
                    office, and, according to Lord Chancellor Ellesmere, prolocutor of the House of
                    Lords by prescription. To him belongs the appointment of all the justices of the
                    peace throughout the kingdom. In former times the chancellor or lord-keeper
                    being commonly an ecclesiastic (for none else were then capable of an office so
                    conversant in writing), and presiding over the royal chapel, he became keeper of
                    the king’s conscience; visitor, in right of the king, of all hospitals and
                    colleges of the king’s foundation; and patron of all the king’s livings rated
                    under the value of L.20 per annum in the king’s books. He is the general
                    guardian of all infants, idiots, and lunatics, and has the superintendence of
                    all charitable uses in the kingdom; and this over and above the vast extensive
                    jurisdiction which he exercises in his judicial capacity in the court of
                    chancery. He takes precedence of every temporal lord except the members of the
                    royal family, arid of all spiritual peers except the Archbishop of
                    Canterbury.</p>
