                <p><label type="entry">CHEKE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir John</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated statesman, grammarian, and divine, descended of an ancient family in
                    the Isle of Wight, was born at Cambridge in the year 1514, and educated at St
                    John’s College in that university. After taking his degrees in arts, he was
                    first chosen Greek lecturer, and then, in 1540, professor of that language, with
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> stipend of L.40 a year. In this station he was
                    principally instrumental in reforming the pronunciation of the Greek language,
                    which, having been much neglected, was imperfectly understood. About the year
                    1543 he was incorporated as master of arts at Oxford, where, we are told, he had
                    studied for some time. In the following year he was sent to the court of King
                    Henry VIII. and appointed tutor for the Latin language, jointly with Sir Anthony
                    Cooke, to Prince Edward, about which time he was made canon of the college newly
                    founded at Oxford; so that he must by this time have been in orders. On the
                    accession of his royal pupil to the crown, Mr Cheke was first rewarded with a
                    pension of a hundred merks, and afterwards obtained several considerable grants
                    from the crown. In 1550 he was made chief gentleman of the privy chamber, and
                    was knighted the following year; in 1552, chamberlain of the exchequer for life;
                    in 1553, clerk of the council; and soon afterwards secretary of state and privy
                    counsellor. But these honours were of short duration. Having concurred in the
                    measures of the Duke of Northumberland for settling the crown on the unfortunate
                    Lady Jane Grey, and acted as her secretary during the nine days of her reign,
                    Sir John Cheke was, on the accession of Queen Mary, sent to the Tower, and
                    stripped of the greater part of his possessions. In September 1554 he obtained
                    his liberty, and a license from her majesty to travel abroad. He went first to
                    Basel, thence to Italy, and afterwards returned to Strasburg, where he was
                    reduced to the necessity of reading Greek lectures for subsistence. In 1556 he
                    set out in an evil hour to meet his wife at Brussels; but before he reached that
                    city he was seized by order of Philip IL, hoodwinked, and thrown into a waggon,
                    and thus ignominiously conducted to a ship, which brought him to the Tower of
                    London. He soon found that religion was the cause of his imprisonment; for he
                    was immediately visited by two Catholic priests, who piously endeavoured to
                    convert him, but without success. However, he was at last visited by Fleckenham,
                    who told him from the queen that he must either comply or be burned. This
                    powerful argument had the desired effect; Sir John Cheke formally complied, and
                    his lands, upon certain conditions, were restored; but his remorse soon put an
                    end to his life. He died in September 1557, at the house of his friend Mr Peter
                    Osborne, in Wood Street, London, and was buried in St Alban’s church. He left
                    three sons, the eldest of whom, Henry, was knighted by Queen Elizabeth. He
                    wrote, 1. A Latin translation of two of St Chrysostom’s homilies, Lond, 1543,
                    4to; 2. A Latin translation of six homilies of the same Father, Lond. 1547; 3.
                    The Hurt of Sedition, Lond. 1549, 1576, 1641; 4. A Latin translation of the
                    English Communion Service, printed among Buccr’s Opuscula; 5. De Obitu
                    doctissimi et sanctissimi theologi Domini Martini Buceri, &amp;c. Lond. 1551; 6.
                    Carmen Heroicum, or Epitaphium, in Antonium Dencium clarissimum virum, Lond.
                    4to; 7. De Pronunciatione Graecae, Basel, 1555, 8vo; 8. De Superstitione ad
                    Regem Henricum; 8. Several letters published in his life by Strype; 10. A Latin
                    translation of Archbishop Cranmer’s book on the Lord’s Supper, 1553; 11.
                    Translation of Leo de Apparatu Bellico, Basel, 1554. Sir John Cheke left also a
                    great many unpublished writings, which are most probably lost.</p>
