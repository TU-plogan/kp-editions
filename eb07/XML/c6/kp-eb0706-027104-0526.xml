                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">CELESTINS</label>, a religious order, so called from their
                    founder Peter de Meuron, afterwards raised to the pontificate under the name of
                    Celestin V. This Peter, who was born of mean parents at Ifernia, a little town
                    in the kingdom of Naples, in the year 1215, retired, while very young, to a
                    solitary mountain, in order to dedicate himself wholly to prayer and
                    mortification. The fame of his piety attracted several, from curiosity, to see
                    him; some of whom, charmed with his virtues, renounced the world in order to
                    join him in his solitude. With these he formed, in the year 1254, a kind of
                    community, which was approved by Pope Urban IV. ten years afterwards, and
                    erected into a distinct order, called the <hi rend="italic">Hermits of St
                    Damim.</hi> Peter de Meuron governed this order till 1286, when his love of
                    solitude and retirement induced him to quit the charge. In July 1294, the great
                    reputation of his sanctity raised him, though much against his will, to the
                    pontificate. He then took the name of Celestin V. and his order that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Celestins</hi> from him. By his bull he approved of their
                    constitutions, and confirmed all their monasteries to the number of twenty. But
                    he occupied too short time the chair of St Peter to do many great things for his
                    order; for having governed the church five months and a few days, he considered
                    that the great burden he had taken upon himself was one to which he was no
                    longer equal, and solemnly renounced the pontificate in a consistory held at
                    Naples.</p>
                <p>After his death, which happened in 1296, his order made great progress, not only
                    in Italy, but likewise in France whither the then general, Peter of Tivoli, sent
                    twelve religious persons, at the request of King Philip the Fair, who gave them
                    two monasteries; one in the forest of Orleans, and the other in the forest of
                    Compiegne at Mount Chartres. This order likewise passed into several provinces
                    of Germany. They have about ninety-six convents in Italy, and twenty-one in
                    France, under the title of priories.</p>
                <p>The Celestins rise two hours after midnight to say matins. They eat no flesh at
                    any time, except when they arc sick. They fast every Wednesday and Friday, from
                    Easter to the feast of the exaltation of the holy cross; and, again, from that
                    feast to Easter, every day. Their habit consists of a white gown, a capuche, and
                    a black scapulary. In the choir, and when they go out of the monastery, they
                    wear a black cowl with the capuche: their shirts are of serge.</p>
