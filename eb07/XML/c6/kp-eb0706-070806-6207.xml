                <p><label type="entry"> CIVII. LAW</label></p>
                <p>Is a term applied by way of eminence to the municipal law of the Romans. This
                    system of jurisprudence has for many ages been regarded as one of the most
                    conspicuous monuments of human wisdom and genius; and its powerful influence on
                    modern legislation has been felt and acknowledged by every civilized nation of
                    Europe. Although it has long ceased to retain the full authority of written law,
                    it can never cease to attract the attention, and to excite the admiration, of
                    lawyers who are capable of ascending to this clear and copious fountain of
                    juridical knowledge. The study of the civil law may formerly have engrossed a
                    larger share of notice than it can justly claim; but there are many reasons for
                    supposing that, in this country at least, it is too much neglected, both by
                    professional lawyers, and by those who aspire at the reputation of general
                    learning.</p>
                <p>It is stated by Mr Hallam, that “the stream of literature that has so remarkably
                    altered its channel within the last century, has left no region more deserted
                    than those of the civil and canon law. Except among the immediate disciples of
                    the papal court, or perhaps in Spain, no man, I suppose, throughout Europe will
                    ever again undertake the study of the one; and the new legal systems, which the
                    moral and political revolutions of this age have produced, and are likely to
                    diffuse, will leave little influence or importance to the other.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hallam’s Hist, of the Middle
                    Ages, vol. iii. p. 519.</p></note> But in all Catholic countries, the canon law
                    is a necessary study; and even the Protestants of Germany think it a study which
                    cannot be safely neglected. When to a certain extent we recommend the study of
                    the canon as well as the civil law, we at the same time make a clear distinction
                    between the utility to be derived from the one and from the other. A familiar
                    acquaintance with the civil law we are disposed to regard as the best foundation
                    of all juridical science: the student, duly initiated in classical learning, may
                    thus acquire a concise and elegant mode of reasoning on the multifarious topics
                    of jurisprudence; and he thus becomes familiar with those maxims of law which
                    have extended their influence to all the civilized portions of Europe. This
                    species of knowledge is therefore highly valuable in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193356220" xml:id="kp-eb0706-6220-0709"/>itself, and it guides us to
                    other knowledge, of more immediate application to the ordinary business of life.
                    In several countries, the civil law continnes to be studied with a degree of
                    ardour which Mr Hallam could not fail to consider as surprising, and perhaps
                    preposterous. But the canon law cannot claim the same pre-eminence, nor is it to
                    be recommended to students on account of its intrinsic excellence; it is to be
                    considered as the spurious offspring of the civil law, and as having gradually
                    attained its full growth under the fostering care of priestly usurpation; what
                    is most valuable, it has derived from the Roman jurisprudence, and its own
                    peculiar maxims have all the same general tendency towards the power and
                    aggrandizement of the church.</p>
                <p>In those countries most remarkable for the extent and solidity of their
                    erudition, namely, in Germany and Holland, the study of the civil law has long
                    constituted an essential branch of a liberal education; and they persuade
                    themselves that many advantages result from such a plan of study. Many of their
                    professed scholars are excellent civilians, and many of their professed
                    civilians are excellent scholars. It is sufficiently obvious that those who are
                    acquainted with the phraseology and with the spirit of the Roman law, will
                    readily understand many passages of the Latin classics which to others must
                    remain obscure and unintelligible. Even the poets admit of such illustration:
                    Plautus, Horace, and Ovid may frequently be explained from the writings of the
                    civilians.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The juridical
                    science of Ovid has been illustrated in a work published under this title:
                    “Dissertatio philologicojuridica de insigni in poeta Ovidio Romani Juris
                    Peritia, quam Thesibus suis inauguralibus adjectam voluit auctor J. van
                    Iddekinge, J. U. D.” Amst. 1811, 8vo.</p></note></p>
                <p>These general assertions will best be confirmed by a particular example; and the
                    examples are so abundant that the chief difficulty lies in the necessity of
                    making a selection. The subsequent passage in one of the epistles of Pliny may
                    however be regarded as sufficient for our purpose, “Tu quidem pro caetera tua
                    diligentia admones me, codicillos Aciliani, qui me ex parte instituit heredem,
                    pro non scriptis habendos, quia non sint confirmati testamento: quod jus ne mihi
                    quidem ignotum est, quum sit iis etiam notum qui nihil aliud seiunt. Sed ego
                    propriam quandam legem mihi dixi, ut defunctorum voluntates, etiamsi jure
                    deficerent, quasi perfectas tuerer. Constat autem, codicillos istos Aciliani
                    manu scriptos. Licet ergo non sint confirmati testamento, a me tamen, nt
                    confirmati, observabuntur.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Plinii Epistolae, lib. ii. ep. xvi. edit. Gesner.</p></note> This point of
                    law, says Pliny, is even known to those who are ignorant of every other; but it
                    seems nevertheless to have been completely misapprehended by Dr Adam, who has
                    thus stated the doctrine of codicils: “When additions were made to a will, they
                    were called <hi rend="italic">codicilli.</hi> They were expressed in the form of
                    a letter addressed to the heirs, sometimes also to trustees (ad
                    fideicomissarios). It behoved them however to be confirmed by the testament.
                    Plin. <hi rend="italic">Ep.</hi> ii. 16.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Adam’s Roman Antiquities, p. <hi rend="italic"
                    >5β.</hi></p></note> The first of these sentences contains a definition of a
                    modern eodicil; but, according to the civil law, a codicil was a less solemn
                    form of a will. It might be made by a person who was either testate or
                    intestate; in other words, it could either accompany or subsist without a
                    testament. A person might leave several codicils; whereas no <hi rend="italic"
                    >pagan,</hi> that is, no person who was not a soldier, could leave more
                    testaments than one. It was essential to the character of a testament that it
                    should institute an heir; but a codicil was in all cases incompetent for that
                    purpose, and could only bequeath legacies and trusts: it therefore could not
                    disinherit one heir, or substitute another. As the law stood in the age of
                    Caius, a legacy bequeathed by a eodicil, and not ratified by a testament, was
                    null and void;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Caii
                    Institutiones, lib. ii. § 270.</p></note> and, according to the doctrine which,
                    in-more general terms, was afterwards stated by Papinian, where the codicil was
                    of a date prior to the will, it was held to be ineffectual unless confirmed by
                    that will, or by another codicil.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Digest, lib, xxix. tit. vii. fr. 5.</p></note> The notion of
                    Dr Adam, that a codicil must succeed a testament, and that it must nevertheless
                    be confirmed by a testament, cannot very easily be comprehended; but the
                    statement of the ancient writer, when properly understood, is easily reconciled
                    to the doctrine of the civilians. The individual whom he mentions had first made
                    a codicil, and afterwards a testament, and had neglected to confirm in the one a
                    legacy which had been bequeathed in the other: a direct bequest could not be
                    effectually made in this manner, but Pliny expresses his determination to take
                    no advantage of the legal informality.</p>
                <p>The legislation of Rome under the regal dynasty must have been extremely simple.
                    Of this era however very few reliques have been preserved, nor are the genuine

                <p>After the expulsion of the last king, the want of a regular eode of laws appears
                    to have been felt by the Romans, who were yet an inconsiderable and a rude
                    people. Aceording to the uniform testimony of their own writers, they had
                    recourse to the expedient of sending a deputation to Greece, in order to procure
                    information respecting the laws of a kindred nation. The commonly received

                <p>It is stated by Livy, and by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, that ambassadors were
                    sent to Greece, in order to collect information respecting the laws of that
                    country; and the same account, or nearly the same, is repeated by many other
                    ancient writers. Angelo Mai, adopting the opinion of Vico has urged as an
                    objection against this account, that it is <pb break="no" facs="nls:193356233"

                    necessary to admit the inference; for Cicero might or might not find occasion to
                    refer to an event which, so far as we can discover, no person regarded as
                    doubtful. The following expressions however seem to contain a manifest allusion
                    to the influence of the Athenian upon the Roman laws: ’ ' Adsunt Athenienses,
                    unde humanitas, doctrina, religio, fruges, jura, leges ortae, atque in omnes

                    to a fact which must have been considered as incontrovertible: “Creatique

                    subject his opinion is entitled to attention. The value and importance of
                    Dionysius’s work for the early history of the Roman law, has been discussed by
                    Dr Šchulin;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>De Dionysio

                    necessary to remark that we regard him as no incompetent authority for such a
                    fact as he has recorded. Had the fact of such a mission been very absurd or very
                    incredible in itself, the state of the question would have been essentially
                    different. It is further urged by the same learned professor, that all the
                    ancient monuments of Roman history must have perished when the city was burnt by
                    the Gauls. But it is not to be doubted that the laws of the twelve Tables, or at
                    least ample portions of them, survived the destruction of the city: those laws
                    are repeatedly mentioned by Cicero, as we should now mention the Great Charter,
                    not as what has existed, but as what still exists;<note anchored="true"

                    commentaries, nor do we meet with any hint or suggestion that such commentaries
                    related to fragments, instead of the entire collection. It is indeed stated by∣
                    Livy that, after this calamity, an attempt was made by public authority to
                    recover the regal and decemviral laws;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Hist. lib. vi. cap. i.)</p></note> and we learn from Cyprian that, during the
                    third century, the laws of the twelve Tables were still to be found engraved on
                    tablets of brass.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    themselves were rescued from the ruins of the city, is there any difficulty in
                    imagining, or any absurdity in believing, that their genuine history was
                    likewise preserved? Let us even suppose that every written monument perished in
                    the common wreck; yet the nation itself was not exterminated; and the oral
                    tradition of one generation became the lettered record of the next.</p>
                <p>Some writers have involved the subject in unnecessary doubt and difficulty, by
                    misapprehending the real state of the question; for it has been seriously asked
                    whether the decemvirs transferred the entire laws of Solon to the twelve Tables.
                    If any person imagines that they transferred the entire laws of Solon, or any
                    other legislator, he manifestly entertains a very crude opinion; and he who
                    opposes such an opinion, can only be thought to combat a phantom. Let us examine
                    the passage of Livy as our original text: “Quum de legibus conveniret, de latore
                    tantum discreparet, missi legati Athenas Sp. Postumius Albus, A. Manlius, Ser.
                    Sulpicius Camerinus; jussique inclytas leges Solonis describere, et aliarum

                    afterwards states that those ambassadors were nominated among the decemvirs for
                    two reasons: “His proximi legati tres habiti, qui Athenas ierant; simul ut pro
                    legatione tam longinqua praemio esset honos; simul peritos legum peregrinarum ad
                    condenda nova jura usui fore credebant.” Nothing can be more plain and
                    intelligible than this account. Three ambassadors, or as we might with equal
                    propriety describe them, three messengers, were sent to Greece, with
                    instructions to procure a copy of the laws of Solon,’ and to acquaint themselves
                    with the laws and institutions of other states of Greece besides Athens. In the
                    commission for preparing a body of laws, these three individuals were included,
                    in order that this honour might compensate them for their former labours, and
                    that the knowledge which they had acquired of foreign jurisprudence might be
                    rendered useful in the compilation of a new body of laws. The expression <hi
                    rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">condenda</hi><hi rend="italic">nova
                    jura</hi> certainly does not suggest the idea of transferring laws already made.
                    If therefore any enquirer should succeed in proving, what it will however be
                    very difficult to prove, that there is not a single coincidence between any
                    existing fragment of the twelve Tables, and any existing fragment of the laws of
                    Athens or any other state of Greece, no argument could thence be deduced <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193356246" xml:id="kp-eb0706-6246-0711"/> against Livy’s
                    account of the mission. The Romans, at that period a rude and simple nation,
                    were anxious to obtain some knowledge of the laws, customs, and institutions of
                    a kindred people, before they attempted to reduce their own laws to something
                    approaching to a systematic form; and in order to procure this knowledge, they
                    adopted an expedient which must strike every person, who reflects on the state
                    of society at that remote era, as the most obvious and practicable that could
                    have been devised. But of the new laws with which they thus became acquainted,
                    it is evident that many were utterly to be rejected, some to be abhorred; and
                    they might learn what to avoid, as well as what to imitate. We might as
                    rationally expect one nation to adopt the entire language as the entire laws of
                    another nation. When the decemvirs were employed in their important task, the
                    city of Rome had seen three centuries of years, and during that period had
                    partly been governed by written, and partly by unwritten laws. It is therefore
                    to be supposed that the twelve Tables chiefly consisted of a digest of what was
                    regarded as the best portion of their municipal enactments and customs:
                    customary law, which acquires its vigour and consistency in the early stages of
                    society, was doubtless a very essential part; and some modifications, perhaps
                    various regulations entirely new, might be derived from a foreign source. This
                    we conceive to be the authentic history, and these the genuine effects, of the
                    famous mission into Greece; and in the general texture of this story we find
                    nothing that exceeds the limits of rational belief.</p>
                <p>Dr Dunbar has well remarked that “the Romans, while yet a rude people, disdained
                    not to appoint an embassy to enquire into the jurisprudence of the Greeks, and
                    to supply, from that fountain, the deficiencies in their civil code. This
                    embassy seems to have been suggested by Hermodorus, an exiled citizen of
                    Ephesus, who afterwards eminently assisted in interpreting the collection of
                    laws brought from Greece. His public services met with a public reward. A statue
                    was erected to him in the Comitia at the public expense; an honour which the
                    jealousy of Rome would have denied to a stranger in a less generous age. But, at
                    this period, she acted from a nobler impulse; and the statue erected to
                    Hermodorus was erected, in reality, to her own honour. Yet the name of this
                    Ephesian, which casts a lustre upon Rome, seemed to cast a shade upon his native
                    city; and that people, according to Heraclitus, deserved to have been extirpated
                    to a man, who had condemned such a citizen to exile.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>Before we dismiss the history of the twelve Tables, we are tempted to notice an
                    opinion which another modern author has delivered respecting one of their
                    enactments. “Ancient-histories,” says Lord Kames, “are full of incredible facts
                    that passed current during the infancy of reason, which at present would be
                    rejected with contempt. Every one who is'conversant in the history of ancient
                    nations, can recal instances without end. Does any person believe at present,
                    though gravely reported by historians, that in old Rome there was a law for
                    cutting into pieces the body of a bankrupt, and distributing the parts among his
                    creditors ?”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Kames’s

                    this law of the twelve Tables: Bynkershoek was solicitous to prove that the
                    creditors were entitled to divide, not the body, but the price of the insolvent

                    Lond. 1811, 2 vols. 8vo.</p></note> Those who consider such an enactment as
                    altogether incredible, ought at the same time to consider the real character of
                    the Roman people at that period of their history. They certainly were not
                    distinguished by the gentler virtues; and if their laws were altogether silent
                    as to the treatment of debtors, we ascertain from other sources of information
                    that it was extremely harsh and cruel. In more rude communities, where commerce
                    is almost entirely unknown, and where the poor are completely subjected to the
                    rich, the insolvent debtor is very apt to be treated as a criminal. In ancient
                    Rome, we know from historical records, not merely from the letter of the law,
                    that he might be reduced to the condition of a slave; and it is obvious to every
                    person acquainted with ancient history, that the unrelenting treatment of
                    debtors was a ground of open dissension between the different orders of the
                    people. The same laws which conferred on the father of a family the power of
                    life and death over his wife and children, and which awarded capital punishment
                    against the author of a satirical poem, may without much difficulty be conceived
                    to have disposed of a poor debtor’s person in the most summary manner.</p>
                <p>It was in the 302d year from the building of the city that the decemvirs were
                    appointed, and were invested with extraordinary powers, for the purpose of
                    compiling a body of laws. They accordingly completed ten tables, which in the
                    following year were confirmed by the comitia centuriata; but as some
                    deficiencies were still to be supplied, decemvirs were again created, and the
                    labour was thus brought to a conclusion. The laws of the twelve <pb break="no"

                    in those declining annals discover any vestiges of ancient genius. The reign of
                    Constantine was not conspicuous for legal science; and by fixing the seat of
                    empire at Byzantium, he diminished all the chances or probabilities of
                    improvement. To the great body of those who inhabited the new metropolis, the
                    language of the law was a foreign language; nor was this the only circumstance
                    unfavourable to the cultivation and progress of jurisprudence.</p>
                <p>It is well known that the decisions of certain lawyers obtained the force of

                    flourished at the close of the second and the commencement of the third century.
                    After an interval of nearly one hundred years, appeared another imperial
                    constitution, intended to regulate the number and weight of legal opinions. In
                    the judges themselves very little confidence seems to be reposed, nor is it
                    difficult to imagine that their general merits are not undervalued: they are
                    bound to decide points of law, according to the number of accredited opinions;
                    when the numbers are equal, and the decision of Papinian can be produced on one
                    side of a question, his authority must be allowed to preponderate, “qui, ut
                    singulos vincit, ita cedit duobus ;” and it is only in the case of a perfect
                    equilibrium of legal opinions, that they are left to the full exercise of their
                    own discrimination.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cod.

                    discovery of several reliques of the Roman law has given a fresh impulse to the
                    continental civilians. New portions of the Theodosian Code have been brought to

                    but the recovery of the long-lost Institutes of Caius is too remarkable an event
                    to be noticed in the same manner. An unsatisfactory abridgement of these
                    Institutes had long been known; but the genuine text of Caius was not discovered
                    till the year 1816. In the library of the chapter of Verona, the celebrated
                    Niebuhr, author of the Roman history, found a juridical manuscript of great
                    antiquity; and when a short extract was communicated to Savigny, he easily
                    ascertained that it formed a portion of the original work of this ancient
                    lawyer, who flourished about the age of Antoninus. In the course of the
                    following year, the Royal Academy of Berlin dispatched to Verona two
                    distinguished members of the university, Professor Göschen, a civilian, and
                    Professor Bekker, a philologer, entrusted with the important commission of
                    executing a transcript of the manuscript; and in the performance of this very
                    formidable task, they were greatly aided by the spontaneous and indefatigable
                    services of Dr Bethmann Holweg, who was afterwards appointed a professor of law
                    at Berlin. The manuscript is a <hi rend="italic">codex</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Hermogenianus, for their respective names are not completely ascertained.<note

                    Gregorius appears to have collected the imperial constitutions belonging to the
                    intermediate reigns, from Hadrian to Constantine the Great. Hermogenianus is
                    supposed to have formed a supplementary collection; and the remaining fragments
                    consist entirely of the constitutions of Dioelesian and Maxirainian. Of the
                    former of these compilers, the personal history is involved in complete
                    obscurity. According to the conjectures of modern civilians, the latter must
                    have flourished in the reign of Constantine; and he is supposed to be the same
                    Hermogenianus whose works are quoted in the Pandects. Both compilations are
                    apparently to be considered as the undertakings of private individuals: the
                    ancient commentator on the Theodosian Code has indeed averred that their
                    authority is confirmed by a law, “sub titulo de Constitutionibus Principum et
                    Edictis,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cod. Theodos,
                    lib. i. tit. iv. 1. 1.</p></note> and Gothofredus has naturally enough relied on
                    this averment; but the commentator probably alluded to a constitution which has
                    recently been discovered, and which certainly affords no adequate support to
                    such an opinion. The emperor merely declares his resolution of forming a
                    collection of imperial constitutions, “ad similitudinem Grego-riani atque
                    Hermogeniani Codicis :” he thus acknowledges the propriety of such a model, but
                    is silent with respect to any public sanction of those antecedent codes<note

                    probable that they obtained some degree of authority in the forum.<note

                    the intrinsic value of such a collection of laws; and we may conceive the two
                    codes to have obtained the same degree of authority as .might belong to the
                    publication of an English author, who had prepared a digest or an abridgement of
                    the Statutes. In either case the ercdit of the compiler must depend, not upon
                    any formal sanction, but upon the fidelity with which he is generally believed
                    to have executed his undertaking.</p>
                <p>It appears to have been the original intention of Theodosius to compile two
                    codes, arranged according to different plans; but his second code was never
                    completed, nor&lt; is it easy to conjecture what specific plan he had
                    contemplated. The emperor had thus divulged his intention in the year 429, and
                    the Theodosian Code received his sanction on the fifteenth of February 438. This
                    code of laws, which is sometimes erroneously ascribed to Theodosius the Great,
                    derived its origin from his grandson Theodosius the younger. On the decease of
                    the first Theodosius, the Roman empire was divided between his two sons, the
                    provinces of the east being allotted to Arcadius, those of the west to Honorius.
                    From the sovereign of the east descended Theodosius the Second: after the death
                    of his father and of his uncle, he again united the dominions which had thus
                    been partitioned; hut conferring the titles of Caesar and Augustus upon
                    Valentinian the Third, who married his daughter Licinia Eudoxia, he assigned to
                    him the western provinces of the empire. This son-in-law, who became his
                    successor at Constantinople, was likewise his cousin, being the son of
                    Constantius Caesar, and of Galla Placidia, the daughter of Theodosius the
                    Great.</p>
                <p>The compilers of the code were eight in number, and, as Gothofredus has remarked,
                    they all occupied stations which required an acquaintance with the laws.
                    Antiochus, who was placed at their head, has been confounded by him, as well as
                    by Heineccius, with Antiochus the eunuch, and likewise with a third individual
                    of the same name.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    been discovered, and which bears the date of 435, the emperor had invested these
                    commissioners with power to retrench what was superfluous, to add what was
                    wanting, to change what was ambiguous, and to correct what was incongruous.<note

                    more ample powers: they were even authorized to consolidate several
                    constitutions into one; and we may presume that neither of the two codes
                    exhibited the imperial laws, or at least a large proportion of them, in their
                    original state. In the novel which sanctions the Theodosian Code, the emperor
                    evidently admits that the compilers whom he had employed were not mere copyists:
                    “Manet igitur, mancbitque perpetuo, elimata gloria conditorum, nec in nostrum
                    titulum demigravit nisi lux sola brevitatis.”</p>
                <p>This code contains the edicts and rescripts of sixteen emperors; and its
                    chronology extends from 312 to 438, thus embracing a period of 126 years. It
                    commences with the reign of the first Christian emperor, and there is a
                    systematic exclusion of the constitutions issued by the military adventurers
                    who, during that interval, were finally unsuccessful in their attempts to usurp
                    the government; but the selection is not limited to the constitutions of the
                    Christian princes, for here we find the apostate Julian among other imperial

                    each title are arranged in chronological order.</p>
                <p>The body of laws thus prepared by the emperor of the east was immediately adopted
                    by the emperor of the west. A very curious document, containing the “Gesta in

                    Clossius. At this period the Roman senate only exhibited a shadow of its former
                    greatness: the stern and dignified republicans had long been supplanted by the
                    minions of an imperial court; and a senate, possessing a very slender remnant of
                    authority, had been embodied in each of the two great divisions of the
                    empire.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>ĴM. C. Curtii

                    of the consuls, Anicius Acilius Glabrio Faustus, proceeded to acquaint the
                    fathers with the legislative enterprize of the one emperor, and the zealous
                    concurrence of the other. “Quam rem aeternus princeps, dominus noster
                    Valentinianus, devotione socii, affectu filii cornprobavit.” He afterwards read
                    the constitution, which has already been mentioned, relative to the project of
                    forming two different codes; and this recitation was succeeded by many
                    exclamations in the highest strain of loyalty. In the midst of various
                    expressions of kindness and regard for the consul, the senators hazarded a few
                    suggestions respecting the custody and transcription of this new code of laws;
                    but we perceive no vestiges of free discussion, or of real deliberation, which
                    always implies the power of adopting either the one or the other of two
                    conflicting opinions. They might presume to regulate certain matters of detail,
                    but were without any real influence in the administration of public affairs. In
                    the instance now before us, their chief functions were manifestly confined to
                    the ready approval of what the consul informed them was the will of the
                    emperor.</p>
                <p>The Theodosian Code was thus promulgated in the western, as well as in the
                    eastern empire. The Gothic conquerors of the west permitted their Roman subjects
                    to enjoy the benefit and the protection of their own laws; and a compendium of
                    those laws was soon prepared under the auspices of Alaric king of the Visigoths,
                    whose dominions comprehended certain provinces of Spain and Gaul.<note

                    the king’s reign; and such a date we may suppose to apply to the act of
                    verifying the copy, not to that of compiling the work itself. We might indeed

                    contributed their assistance, under the general direction of Goiaric.<note

                    is added an <hi rend="italic">interpretatio,</hi> or explanation. The
                    manuscripts of the Theodosian Code do not all contain the same explanation, and
                    two different explanations are sometimes subjoined to the same law. It appears
                    from the <hi rend="italic">auctoritas,</hi> or royal sanction, that explanations
                    were inserted by order of King Alaric, and we must suppose others to have been

                    Gothofredus’s edition of the Theodosian Code; and a very cursory inspection of
                    it seems to have betrayed Sir Edward Sugden into the error of supposing that
                    code partly to consist of a digest of the public laws, and partly of the
                    discussions of private lawyers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    in the year 1528, we are indebted to the commendable zeal of Joannes Sichar-dus.
                    He had access to several manuscripts; but all of them appear to have been so
                    defective, that very many titles are not to be found in his publication, and
                    indeed several books present themselves in the most mutilated form. He has

                    After an interval of twenty-two years, a more complete edition of the Theodosian
                    Code was pub-fished<pb break="no" facs="nls:193356298"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-6298-0715"/> at Paris by Jean du Tillet, or Tillius, who has
                    however omitted the ancient commentary. In 1566, an edition was published at
                    Lyon by Cujacius, who, among other appendages, has subjoined the ancient
                    commentary, and a collection of the Novels. According to the title-page, the
                    sixth, seventh, eighth, and sixteenth books, “nunc primum prodeunt, caeteri
                    aucti sunt innumeris constitutionibus.” Another edition by the same illustrious
                    civilian, but without his name, was published at Paris in 1586; and, in the
                    course of the same year, his name appeared in the title of an edition printed at
                    Geneva. These were followed by other editions of the Theodosian Code; and all
                    the editions include other reliques of ancient jurisprudence.</p>
                <p>But the great expounder of the Thcodosian Code was Jacobus Gothofredus, or
                    Godefroy, who was born at Geneva in 1587, and died there in 1652. Having at an
                    early age been appointed to a law-professorship in his native city, he acquired
                    a very high reputation as a lawyer of deep and extensive erudition, and in this
                    respect he is only equalled by Cujacius. To his ample stores of philological
                    learning he added a masterly knowledge of history, both civil and
                    ecclesiastical; his industry appears to have been indefatigable, and his reading
                    unbounded. Uniting with his other qualifications a complete knowledge of ancient
                    jurisprudence in all its branches, and applying to his multifarious
                    investigations an acute understanding and a sober judgment, he has produced
                    various works which rise very far above the ordinary standard; but the great and
                    lasting monument of his talents and learning is his edition of the Theodosian
                    Code, on which he bestowed the assiduous labour of thirty years. Thirteen years
                    after his death, it was published under the superintendence of Antoine Marville,
                    professor of law in the university of Valence, who with no small assiduity and
                    perseverance digested his papers into a proper form.<note anchored="true"

                    the illustrious civilian of Geneva had himself prepared this edition for the
                    press, it would doubtless have appeared to greater advantage; but even in its
                    present state it is a work of the highest value to the lawyer and to the
                    historian; it is indeed an immense storehouse of juridical and historical
                    knowledge. The commentator has collected a stupendous mass of learning, and his
                    information is derived from every accessible source. To the text of the Code he
                    subjoins the ancient explanation: this is followed by his notes, in which he
                    adverts to the various readings, to the emendation of the text, and to the
                    parallel or conflicting passages in the Theodosian or Justinian laws; and the
                    illustration of each title is completed by his ample commentary, in which he
                    discusses the scope and tendency of the various enactments, and pours around
                    every subject of importance an immense stream of erudition, drawn from the
                    deepest recesses of jurisprudence and history. But in addition to his perpetual
                    commentary, he has composed different tracts which greatly contribute to the
                    elucidation of this collection of laws. “Immortale opus est,” says Hugo, “quod
                    Gothofredus perfecit, in quo neque pracivit ei quis-quam neque ejus vestigia
                    premere ausus est. Nemo Codicem Theodosianum illustrare studuerat; qui primus id

                <p>The discovery of the Institutes of Caius gave a renovating and powerful impulse
                    to the civilians of the continent; and the recesses of many libraries were
                    explored, in the eager expectation of detecting other reliques of ancient
                    jurisprudence. In the public library at Turin, Professor Peyron discovered a
                    mutilated and undescribed volume in large octavo; and on a more particular
                    examination he found that it was a palimpsest. This volume, as he is led to
                    conjecture, had formed a part of the literary reliques collected in the
                    monastery of Bobbio, which was founded by St Columbanus, a native of Ireland,
                    about the beginning of the seventh century. The second writing consisted of
                    Julius Valerius’s Latin version of a narrative of the exploits of Alexander the
                    Great, written by a Greek bearing the name of Aesop. On the application of a
                    proper acid, this version, written with evanescent ink, was very easily effaced,
                    and the more ancient writing became disentangled. Peyron supposes that this
                    manuscript of the Code was transcribed during the earlier part of the sixth
                    century; but, according to Mai, the peculiarities of writing rather belong to
                    the century following. In this manner are preserved thirteen leaves,
                    comprehending portions of the first five books, and two pages which contain a
                    fragment of the sixth book of the Thcodosian Code. Nor are these leaves without
                    mutilation: the vellum, in the course of its preparation for a new purpose, has
                    been cut at one side, so that in one page the beginning, and in another the end
                    of the lines, are regularly shorn away; and, in some instances, the tops or
                    bottoms of the leaves are likewise curtailed.<note anchored="true"

                <p>After the interval of a century, the example of Theodosius was followed by
                    Justinian. To ten individuals learned in the laws he in the year 528 entrusted
                    the important task of compiling a new code; and at the head of this commission
                    he placed Tribonian, who makes so conspicuous a figure in the history of his
                    reign.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>J. P. de Ludewig

                    three codes which have already been mentioned, and in the constitutions of the
                    intervening emperors. Their collection includes the edicts and rescripts of a
                    long series of princes, from Hadrian to Justinian; 'and they were authorized to
                    select what was most important, to retrench what was superfluous, to rectify
                    what was erroneous, and even to consolidate several constitutions into one. This
                    task they performed with sufficient dispatch: the new code, which was to
                    supersede all the former, received the imperial sanction on the 7th of April
                    529. But soon after its completion, Justinian found it necessary to issue fifty
                    new decisions, for the purpose of reconciling conflicting principles; and having
                    in the course of a very few years promulgated various other constitutions, he
                    granted a commission to Tribonian and other four persons to revise the code, and
                    insert the additional laws in their proper places. The first edition was
                    suppressed, and the new edition, <hi rend="italic">Codex reĵìetitoe

                <p>During this interval, however, Tribonian had been engaged in a work of greater
                    difficulty. On the 15th of December 530, he had been appointed, along with
                    sixteen associates, to prepare a general digest of legal science, not from the
                    edicts and rescripts of the emperors, but from the writings of those lawyers who
                    enjoyed the highest reputation in the forum.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    compiled contains a very copious collection of legal principles and legal
                    discussions, exhibiting one of the most remarkable specimens of ancient genius
                    and ancient wisdom. It is divided into fifty books. Dr Bluhme has with much
                    labour and ingenuity attempted to ascertain the general principle of arrangement
                    in the titles of which the different books are composed; and his theory has
                    obtained the approbation of Hugo, and other most competent judges. He supposes
                    that the commissioners appointed by Justinian were divided into three sections,
                    and that to each section was assigned the task of extracting the proper
                    materials from a particular series of works. We are thus to expect a triple
                    series in each title: the deviations from this general plan he conceives to be
                    but inconsiderable; and for particular modifications he discovers an obvious and
                    intelligible reason. The first series commences with the commentaries on
                    Sabinus, the second with those on the <hi rend="italic">Edictum</hi><hi

                <p>After the completion, but before the publication of the Digest or Pandects, the
                    emperor employed Tribonian, Theophilus, and Dorotheus, to prepare a short and
                    elementary work as a standard introduction to the study of the law. This work is
                    professedly compiled from more ancient treatises of the same nature, and
                    particularly from the Institutes of Caius, whom Justinian styles “Caius noster.”
                    The discovery of this latter work is of great importance in illustrating the
                    text of the imperial institutes, which have for so many centuries retained their
                    place in the schools of jurisprudence, and have so generally served as models to
                    those who in modern times have undertaken to write elementary treatises of law.
                    “This little work,” says Dr Bever, “is so truly admirable, both for its method
                    and conciseness, as well as for the elegance of its composition, that it has
                    been imitated by almost every nation in Europe, that hath ever made any attempt

                    remarkable,” as Mr Hume has observed, “that in the decline of Roman learning,
                    when the philosophers were universally infected with superstition and sophistry,
                    and the poets and historians with barbarism, the lawyers, who in other countries
                    are seldom models of science or politeness, were yet able, by the constant study
                    and close imitation of their predecessors, to maintain the same good sense in
                    their decisions and reasonings, and the same purity in their language and

                <p>The Institutes were sanctioned on the 21st of November 533; and on the 16th of
                    December, the emperor issued two constitutions, the one in Latin and the other
                    in Greek, by which he confirmed the Institutes, Code, and Pandects, and imparted
                    to them the force and validity of law in the forum, and commanded them to be
                    taught in the schools of Rome, Constantinople, and Berytus. Justinian survived
                    till the year 565, and during that long interval he promulgated many new laws. A
                    collection was at length formed of his Novels, or new Constitutions, to the
                    number of one hundred and sixty-eight. The greatest part of them appear to have
                    been originally written in Greek; some were however written in Latin, and others
                    were at the same time exhibited in both languages.<note anchored="true"

                    these was the same Theophilus who wrote a Greek paraphrase of the Institutes,
                    has been long and much disputed among civilians: to recapitulate all the
                    arguments which have been urged on both sides of the question, would require too
                    much time and space; we shall therefore content ourselves with stating, that we

                    identity, and with referring the more curious reader to the ample discussions of

                    at Constantinople, and Dorotheus at Berytus. During the reign of Justinian, the
                    two imperial cities, together with Berytus, were the only places, within the
                    limits of the empire, where public schools of law were established, or indeed
                    where law was permitted to be publicly taught.<note anchored="true"

                    beautiful city, was situated on the coast of Syria: here a school of
                    jurisprudence was founded during the third century, and it was long frequented
                    by a numerous train of students; but its prosperity was first interrupted, and
                    rvas finally subverted, by some of the great convulsions of nature. In the year
                    384 the town was greatly injured by an earthquake, and in 554 it was visited by
                    another earthquake, which left it a heap of ruins., Some professors and a
                    multitude of students perished in this common calamity: the surviving professors
                    transferred their school to Sidon, and the surviving inhabitants made a vigorous
                    effort to raise a new city from the ruins of the old; but another calamity
                    awaited them, and this famous scat of jurisprudence was totally consumed by

                <p>The paraphrase of Theophilus is of great utility and importance in explaining the
                    text of the Institutes. He has not servilely confined himself to the original,
                    and his work in a <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> great measure supplies the
                    place of a perpetual commentary. It is a book indispensably necessary for every
                    more learned and inquisitive student of the civil law. This paraphrase is not
                    indeed entirely free from errors: Reitz conjectures, and not without a
                    considerable degree of plausibility, that Theophilus had dictated it to the
                    students of Constantinople, in the exercise of his functions as a public
                    expounder of the law; and that for its transmission to posterity we are solely
                    indebted to copies taken by his auditors, and uncorrected by himself. To this
                    valuable relique the attention of modern lawyers was first directed by Angclo
                    Poliziano, who died at a premature age in the year 1494. He was a person of
                    singular talents and attainments, who only required a greater length of days to
                    have earned the highest reputation. To the celebrity of an Italian and Latin
                    poet, and of a classical critic, he was solicitous to add that of a civilian;
                    and he was likewise the first individual who attempted a collation of the

                    the time of Justinian; but Pohl and Heimbach have shewn that there are no
                    sufficient grounds for believing that he undertook such a task.<note

                    of Constantinople, who had been conjoined with Tribonian in the commission for
                    compiling the original work. The Code was likewise translated into Greek: the
                    translator is supposed to be the person who, in the scholia of the Basilica, is
                    repeatedly described as Kωδ∕zeuτ&gt;js. To many of the judges, as well as the
                    suitors, in the eastern empire, Latin must evidently have been an unknown
                    tongue. When the seat of empire was transferred from Rome to Byzantium, the
                    first emperors were anxious to transfer the use of the Roman language, and for a
                    considerable time this continued to be at least the language of the court.
                    Teachers of Roman eloquence were established in the second metropolis, and they^
                    doubtless found many pupils among the youth who aimed at a fashionable
                    education, or were ambitious of preferment; but it was not to be expected that
                    the great body of the people should be induced to unlearn one language, and to
                    acquire another.</p>
                <p>During the interval which elapsed between the reign of Justinian and that of
                    Basilius, there were many Greek writers on the Roman law; and not a few names
                    have been recovered from the wreck of time by Lambecius, Suarés, Asseman,<note

                    learned enquirers. Basilius, who has obtained a conspicuous place among the
                    legislators of the empire, derived his lineage from Armenia, but was himself
                    born in Macedonia, and is commonly known by the name of Basilius the Macedonian.
                    He rose from an origin sufficiently humble, and after having been a groom, he

                    sovereign of the east. The eastern empire, in which the Greek language was
                    vernacular, was governed by a collection of laws chiefly written in Latin; and
                    the different versions which had been executed were without the sanction of
                    public authority. It was therefore his object to select such enactments as were
                    still in force, and having digested them into the form of a regular code, to
                    invest them with the imperial sanction. This great undertaking he did not live
                    to complete. He died in the year 886, and was succeeded by bis son Leo, surnamed
                    the Philosopher. The body of Greek laws was completed under his direction: the
                    date of its promulgation has not been ascertained; but as the student is
                    referred to it in Leo’s Ecloga, which was written in the year 910, the <hi

                <p>It has long been a current opinion that, in the western empire, all knowledge of
                    the civil law became extinct, and was not revived till after the lapse of
                    several centuries. “All the world knows,” says Lord Kames, “that the Roman law,
                    after being buried in oblivion for ages, came to be restored in Italy by an
                    accident. The very books of that law were understood to be lost past recovery,

                    speculation. “The fortunate, or perhaps unfortunate discovery of the Roman <hi

                    institutions of almost every country in Europe. The dignified clergy of that day
                    immediately perceived how advantageous the adoption of the regulations of
                    Justinian would prove to them; and the popes, who then pretended to dispose of
                    the throne of the Caesars, were eager to support the arbitrary edicts of
                    emperors, who, like themselves, affected to think that both their persons and
                    their rescripts were inviolable. The neighbouring countries cheerfully submitted
                    to the change, and thus engrafted slavery and the civil law on that evenhanded
                    Gothic jurisprudence, which had ensured freedom to all the northern
                    nations.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Stephens’s

                    This philosophic speculator, who thus attempts to twist a rope of sand, has not
                    even arrived at the point of distinction between the Pandects and the Code. So
                    true it is that when an English writer ventures to speak of the Pandects, he

                    polity, one of the general divisions of the laity, comprehending all orders of
                    men, from the highest nobleman to the meanest peasant, who are not included
                    under the military or maritime states; though it may sometimes include
                    individuals of these classes, as well as of the clergy; since a nobleman, a
                    knight, a gentleman, or a peasant, may become either a divine, a soldier, or a
                    seaman. The division of this state is into nobility and commonalty.</p>
