                <p><label type="entry">CHARCOAL</label>. When vegetable substances are subjected to
                    a strong heat in the apparatus for distillation, the fixed residue is called
                    charcoal. Charcoal is made in various ways. For general use it is obtained by
                    building up pieces of wood in a pyramidal form, then covering the pile with
                    earth or clay, leaving a few air-holes, which are closed when the mass is
                    lighted, in order that combustion may proceed in a slow and imperfect manner.
                    Charcoal of a very superior kind is made in the forest of Benon, near Rochelle,
                    where great attention is paid to its manufacture. Black oak from ten to fifteen
                    years old is cut into billets of about four feet in length, which are built up
                    as above described, and, before being inclosed in the clay or earth, covered
                    over to the depth of four inches with dry grass or fern. When the mass is
                    charred, great care is taken to extinguish ignition, because if exposed too soon
                    to the atmosphere, combustion goes on, and this is not put a stop to without
                    difficulty. Accordingly, to obviate this, a barrel of water is thrown over the
                    pile, and earth to the thickness of five or six inches is spread on it, after
                    which it is left for twenty-four hours to cool. Charcoal is also made on a great
                    scale in the following manner. A series of cast-iron cylinders, about four feet
                    in diameter and six feet in length, are built horizontally into brick work, so
                    that the flame of one furnace may play round about two cylinders. The ends are
                    made to project from the brick work, and both are closed with discs of iron.
                    From the centre of one of these an iron tube proceeds, and enters at a right
                    angle the main tube of refrigeration. The vapour which is condensed in tltís
                    vessel is a strong vinegar called pyrolignous acid. The tubes, of course, are
                    filled with wood cut up into billets. Fire is applied during the day; all night
                    they are allowed to cool, and next morning the charge is drawn. Care is taken to
                    prevent the access of air, both while the jvood is charring and after it has
                    begun to cool. When charcoal is wanted for the manufacture of gunpowder, it is
                    necessary that the whole of the vinegar and tar should be allowed to escape, and
                    that the re-absorption of the vapours should be prevented, by cutting oft’ the
                    communication between the interior of the cylinder and the ap-ļiaratus for
                    condensing the pyrolignous acid, after the fire has been withdrawn from the
                    furnace. Unless this precaution be taken, the gunpowder manufactured with the
                    charcoal will be of inferior quality. Mr Mushet has made a number of valuable
                    experiments respecting charcoal. The following is his table of results, reduced
                    to 100 parts, from experiments on one pound avoirdupois of various kinds of
                    wood.</p>

                <p>MM. Clement and Desormes state that wood contains one half its weight of
                    charcoal. We are informed by Μ. Proust that good pit-coals afford 70, 75, or 80
                    per cent, of charcoal, which leaves of ashes after combustion only two or three
                    parts in the hundred. This species is much used in Great Britain under the name
                    of coke. Turf or peat has been lately charred in France by a peculiar process.
                    It is considered as superior to that obtained from wood. It kindles more slowly,
                    but emits more flame, and burns longer than the other. Gold fused .by <hi

                    soot. This charcoal of oils is well known in the arts under the name of lamp
