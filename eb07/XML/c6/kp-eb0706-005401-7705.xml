                <p><label type="entry">CANAAN</label>, the fourth son of Ham, whose irreverence
                    towards his father Noah is recorded in the ninth chapter of Genesis. Upon the
                    occasion of his disrespectful conduct, the patriarch cursed him in <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> branch of his posterity, declaring that “a servant of
                    servants shall he be unto his brethren.” This curse however being pronounced,
                    not against Ham the immediate transgressor, but against his son, who does not
                    appear, from the words of ĂIoses, to have been anywise concerned in the crime,
                    has occasioned several conjectures; some believing that Noah cursed Canaan
                    because he could not well have cursed Ham himself, whom God had not long before
                    blessed; whilst others think that the chief intent of Moses in recording this
                    prediction was to raise the spirits of the Israelites, then entering on a
                    terrible war with the children of Canaan, by the assurance that that people were
                    destined by God to be subdued by them. The opinion of those who imagine that all
                    Ham’s race were here accursed, seems repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,
                    which confines the malediction to Canaan and his posterity, and it is also
                    contrary to fact. Indeed the prophecy of Noah, that Canaan should be a servant
                    of servants to his brethren, seems to have been wholly completed in him. It was
                    completed with regard to Shem, not only in a considerable part of the seven
                    nations of the Canaanites being made slaves to the Israelites, when they took
                    possession of their land, as part of the remainder of them were afterwards
                    enslaved by Solomon, but also by the subsequent expeditions of the Assyrians and
                    Persians, who were both descended from Shem, and under whom the Canaanites
                    suffered subjection as well as the Israelites; not to mention the conquest of
                    part of Canaan by the Elamites or Persians under Chedorlaomer, which preceded
                    them. With regard to Japhet, we find a completion of the prophecy, in the
                    successive conquests of the Greeks and Romans in Palestine and Phoenicia, where
                    the Canaanites were settled, and especially in the total subversion of the
                    Carthaginian power by the Romans; besides some invasions of the northern
                    nations, in which many of them probably were carried away captive. The posterity
                    of Canaan were very numerous. His eldest son was Sidon, who founded and peopled
                    the city of Sidon, and was the father of the Sidonians and Phoenicians; and he
                    had, besides, ten sons, who were the fathers of as many tribes, dwelling in
                    Palestine and in part of Syria, namely, the Hittites, the Jebusites, the
                    Amorites, the Girgasites, the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, the Arvadites,
                    the Zemarites, and Hamathites.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Land of</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Cαnααn,</hi> the
                    country so named from Canaan, the son of Ham. It lies between the Mediterranean
                    Sea and the mountains of Arabia, extending from Egypt to Phoenicia, and is
                    bounded to the east by the mountains of Arabia; to the south by the wilderness
                    of Paran, Idumea, and Egypt; to the west by the Mediterranean, called in Hebrew
                    the Great Sea; and to the north by the mountains of Libanus. Its length, from
                    the city of Dan, afterwards called Caesarea Philippi, or Paneadis, to Beersheba,
                    is about seventy leagues; and its breadth, from the Mediterranean Sea to the
                    eastern borders, is in some places thirty. This country, which was first called
                    Canaan, from Canaan the son of Ham, whose posterity possessed it, was afterwards
                    called Palestine, from the people whom the Hebrews call Philistines, and the
                    Greeks and Romans corruptly Palestines, who inhabited the sea coasts, and were
                    thus first known to them. It likewise had the name of the Land of Promise, from
                    the promise which God made to Abraham of giving it to him; that of the Land of
                    Israel, from the Israelites having made themselves masters of it; that of Judah,
                    from the tribe of Judah, which was the most considerable of the twelve; and
                    lastly, the ever memorable fact of its having been sanctified by the presence,
                    actions, miracles, and death of Jesus Christ, has given it the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Holy Land,</hi> which it still retains. The first inhabitants of
                    this land therefore were the Canaanites, who were descended from Canaan, and the
                    eleven sons of that patriarch. Here they multiplied extremely. Trade and war
                    were their first occupations, and gave rise to their riches, as well as to the
                    several colonies scattered by them over almost all the islands and maritime
                    provinces of the Mediterranean. The measure of their idolatry and abominations
                    was completed when God delivered their country into the hands of the Israelites.
                    In St Athanasius’s time the Africans still pretended they were descended from
                    the Canaanites; and it is said that the Punic tongue was almost entirely the
                    same with the Canaanitish and Hebrew language. The colonies which Cadmus carried
                    into Thebes in Boeotia, and his brother Cilix into Cilicia, appear to have
                    sprung from the stock of Canaan; and the isles of Sicily, Sardinia, Malta,
                    Cyprus, Corfu, Majorca and Minorca, Gades and Ebusus, are also supposed to have
                    been peopled by the Canaanites. Bochart, in his large work entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Canaan,</hi> has treated of these migrations and settlements with
                    great learning, though not without an evident bias towards his favourite
                    hypothesis.</p>

                <p>Many of the old inhabitants of the north-west of the land of Canaan, however,
                    particularly on the coast of Tyre and Sidon, were not driven out by the children
                    of Israel; and hence this tract seems to have retained the name of Canaan long
                    after those other parts of the country which were better inhabited by the
                    Israelites had lost this denomination. The Greeks called the tract along the
                    Mediterranean, inhabited by the old Canaanites, Phoenicia; and the more inland
                    parts, inhabited partly by Canaanites and partly by Syrians, Syrophoenicia; and
                    hence the woman said by St Matthew to be a woman of Canaan, whose daughter Jesus
                    cured, is said by St Mark to be a Syrophoenician by nation as she was a Greek by
                    religion and language.</p>
