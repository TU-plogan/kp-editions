                <p><label type="entry">CAUFIRISTAN</label>, a mountainous country of Asia, situated
                    partly upon the Hindoo Coosh, and partly upon the Beloor Taugh. Its boundaries
                    are Caubul, Budukshaun, and Bulkh. This territory consists of vast mountains
                    covered with snow, inclosing a few narrow but fertile valleys. It is inhabited
                    by a singular people, the Caufirs, who, in religion, manners, and institutions,
                    have remained entirely distinct from all their neighbours. Their religion is
                    entirely Pagan, and they cherish the deadliest antipathy against the Mahommedan
                    name. To have killed a Mussulman is the highest glory to which a Caufir can
                    aspire. Their religious observances bear no resemblance to those established in
                    any part of India. They acknowledge a supreme deity, whom they call Imra, and in
                    their ceremonies represent him by a stone called Imrtan, or the holy stone; but
                    they observe, “this stands for him, but we know not his shape.” They have,
                    besides, numerous inferior deities, consisting chiefly of deceased Caufirs, who
                    have distinguished themselves by some eminent qualities. The best mode of
                    securing an apotheosis, is by giving numerous feasts to the village, hospitality
                    and good cheer being held by this people in the highest veneration. The Caufirs
                    are at almost continual war with their neighbours. They sometimes attack openly,
                    but more commonly seek to surprise, their enemy. On succeeding, they set up a
                    war-cry, sing a song of triumph, and massacre all without distinction. Numerous
                    privileges are attached to the having killed a Mussulman. He who has performed
                    this exploit may wear a turban stuck with feathers, may flourish his axe over
                    his head in the dance, and may set up a pole before his door, with a pin stuck
                    in it for every slaughtered enemy. Their arms are bows, four and a half feet
                    long, with light arrows, sometimes poisoned. When pursued, they unbend their
                    bows, and use them as poles, by the aid of which they leap from rock to rock
                    with astonishing agility. About thirty years ago all their neighbours united in
                    a general confederacy for the extirpation of the Caufirs. They penetrated the
                    country in every direction, but found themselves unable to maintain their
                    ground, and were soon obliged to retire with considerable loss.</p>
                <p>The Caufirs are hospitable in the extreme. A stranger arriving at one of their
                    villages is not only welcomed, but is expected to visit each of the principal
                    men, where he is regaled with every dainty which the house can afford. Their
                    wealth consists of cattle and slaves; the latter are always their own
                    countrymen, as they never spare the life of a Mussulman. The government is
                    chiefly conducted by consultations among the rich men. Their dress consists
                    principally of goats’ skins, with the hair turned outwards, two of which form a
                    vest, and other two a kind of petticot. They are less addicted to hunting than
                    the Afghans. The favourite amusement is dancing, of which they never tire. They
                    cannot accommodate themselves to the Asiatic practice of seating themselves
                    cross-legged on the ground, but sit in the European manner on benches and
                    stools. They also use tables, and drink wine copiously, though not to
                    intoxication, out of silver cups. These European habits have given rise to the
                    hypothesis of their being a Greek colony, left during the expedition of
                    Alexander; and the probability of this conjecture is greatly increased by the
                    circumstance that their language is closely allied to Sanscrit, which answers to
                    Greek as face answers to face in a glass. The two chief towns, or rather
                    villages, of the Caufirs, are Caumdaish and Tsokooce. The former contains five
                    hundred houses.</p>
