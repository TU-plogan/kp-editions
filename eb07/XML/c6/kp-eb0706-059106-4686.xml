                    Rajpoot district of Hindustan, in the province of Ajmeer, situated to the
                    south-west of Joudpoor, and bordering on Gujerat and Malwah. The country is
                    subject to the ranah of Chitore or Odeypoor, whose family is the most ancient
                    and honourable of all the Rajpoot chiefs, though they at present possess little
                    power. In modern times, the town of Odeypoor has become the capital of the
                    district. The territory of the Odeypoor ranah is bounded on the north by the
                    Ajmeer district and the chiefship of Kishenagur, on the north-west and west by
                    Joudpoor, on the south and south-east by the province of Malwah, on the
                    south-west by Gujerat, and on the north-east by Kotah and Bundee. The present
                    territories of the prince are estimated at about seventy miles in length by a
                    hundred and ten in breadth. The country is in general mountainous; but valleys
                    are interspersed of great fertility, which yield sugar, indigo, tobacco, wheat,
                    rice, and barley. The country contains also iron and sulphur mines. The lands
                    arc all held on feudal principles, every Rajpoot being a soldier, and holding
                    his lands by the tenure of military service. The cultivators of the soil are all
                    Hindus, of the tribes of Brahmin, Jaut, Bheel, and Rajpoot. Owing to the want of
                    good pasturage, the cattle are smaller than in the neighbouring countries. They
                    also breed a number of sheep and camels. The revenues of the district have been
                    much diminished, owing to the frequent incursions of the Mahrattas.</p>

                    capital of the above-mentioned district, and a celebrated fortress, was formerly
                    the capital of the ranah of Odeypoor. It is situated on the top of a high and
                    rugged mountain, and is considered as a place of great strength. In 1303 it was
                    taken by theMa-hommedans, the ranah’s son-in-law defending it to the last
                    extremity; and having put to death his women and children, he rushed out with
                    his garrison, and fell in the midst of the enemy. The Mahommedans retained
                    possession of it till the year 1345, when it was given over to the rajah of
                    Jalore, from whom it came again into the possession of the former ranah’s
                    family; and in 1567 it was taken by the armies of the emperor Acbar. The place
                    was garrisoned by 8000 disciplined Rajpoots, who made an obstinate defence; and
                    when at last driven to despair, they sacrificed their women and children, and
                    were trampled to death by the war-elephants introduced into the place by the
                    emperor. It was again taken by the Moguls in 1680, during the reign of
                    Aμrungzebe, when sixty-three Hindu temples were destroyed, either in the, fort
                    or town. In the succeeding reign the ranah again got possession, and retained it
                    till the end of last century,, when it was again surprised by a rebellious
                    chieftain. In 1790 it was taken by Mudajee Šcindia, and restored to^its lawful
                    possessor on the payment of an annual stipend of a large sum of money.</p>
