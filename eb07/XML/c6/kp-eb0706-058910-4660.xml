                <p><label type="entry">CHIPPING</label>, a phrase used by the potters and chinamen
                    to express that common accident both of our own stone and earthen ware, and of
                    the porcelain of China, which consists in the flying off of small pieces, or
                    breaking at the edges. Our earthen wares are particularly subject to this, and
                    are always spoiled by it before any other flaw appears in them. Our stone wares
                    escape it better; but not so well as the porcelain of China, which is less
                    subject to this species of injury than any other manufacture of the kind in the
                    world. The method by which the Chinese defend their ware from this accident is
                    this: They carefully burn some small bamboo canes to a sort of charcoal, which
                    is very light and very black; this they reduce to a fine powder, and then mix it
                    into a thin paste, with some of the varnish which they use for their ware; they
                    then take the vessels, when dried, and not yet baked, to the wheel, and turning
                    them softly round, cover the whole circumference with a thin coating, by means
                    of a pencil dipt in this paste; after which the vessel is again dried, and the
                    border made with this paste, appears of a pale grayish colour when it is
                    thoroughly dry. They work on it afterwards in the common way, covering both this
                    edge and the rest of the vessel with <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354673"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-4673-0590"/>the common varnish. When the whole is baked, the
                    colour given by the ashes disappears, and the edges are as white as any other
                    part; only when the baking has not been sufficient, or the edges have not been
                    covered with the second varnishing, we sometimes find a dusky edge, as in some
                    of the ordinary thick tea-cups. It may be a great advantage to our English
                    manufacturers to attempt something of this kind. The willow is known to make a
                    very light and black charcoal; but the elder, though seldom used, greatly
                    exceeds it. The young green shoots of this shrub, which are almost all pith,
                    make the lightest and the blackest of all charcoal, which readily mixes with any
                    liquid, and might be easily used in the same way as the Chinese use the charcoal
                    of the bamboo cane, which is a light hollow vegetable, more resembling the elder
                    shoots than any other English plant. It is no wonder that the fixed salt and oil
                    contained in this charcoal should be able to penetrate the yet raw edges of the
                    ware, and to give them in the subsequent baking a somewhat different degree of
                    vitrification from the other parts of the vessel; which, however, if given to
                    the whole, might take off from the true semi vitrified state of that ware,
                    whereas at the edges it is not to be regarded, and only serves to defend them
                    from common accidents, and keep them entire. The Chinese use two precautions in
                    this application; the first in the preparation, and the second in the laying it
                    on. They prepare the bamboo canes for burning into charcoal by peeling off the
                    rind. This might easily be done with our elder shoots, which are so succulent
                    that the bark strips off with a touch. The Chinese say that if this were not
                    done with their bamboo, the edges touched with the paste would burst in the
                    baking, which does not indeed seem very probable; but the charcoal will
                    certainly be lighter when made from the peeled sticks, and this is a known
                    advantage. The other precaution is never to touch the vessel with hands that
                    have any greasy or fatty substance about them; for if this be done they always
                    find the vessel crack in that place.</p>
