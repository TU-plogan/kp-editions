                    rend="smallcaps">Descartes, Rene</hi></label>, was born at La Haye, in Touraine,
                    on the 31 st of March 1596, and descended of a noble family, who came originally
                    from Bretagne. In infancy his constitution was extremely delicate, or rather
                    weak, a peculiarity which he shared in common with many other men of genius;
                    and, in fact, it is sometimes in the feeblest body that the intellectual
                    faculties exhibit the greatest vigour. He was educated among the Jesuits, then
                    recently established in the college of La Flcche, and early distinguished
                    himself by an extreme passion for study. It was at this seminary that he became
                    first connected with Mersenne, afterwards a monk of the order of Minims, whose
                    friendship was subsequently approved by its usefulness as well as fidelity to
                    the illustrious object of it. Having completed the usual course of scholastic
                    study, and of what was then as it is still in some parts of the world called <hi
                    rend="italic">philosophy,</hi> Descartes at once perceived the worthlessness of
                    the acquisition he had made; but he was keenly alive to the interest and
                    importance of the mathematical sciences, which nature had destined him to
                    renovate. The first thing which he did on leaving college was, as he tells us in
                    his Discourse on Method, to renounce all books, and to labour to efface from his
                    mind every thing uncertain which he had learned, in order henceforward to admit
                    nothing except what appeared to him to be demonstrated by reason and experience;
                    and, in following out this mode of inquiry, he invented that method of sceptical
                    examination which has since become the first principle of all our positive
                    knowledge. At the present day we are unable to appreciate fully the greatness of
                    such an effort, because we are educated in conformity with this very doctrine,
                    which appears to us as natural as it is reasonable. But if we reflect that, at
                    the period when Descartes lived, the Aristotelian philosophy exercised a
                    despotic dominion over all minds, that it reigned supreme in the world as well
                    as in the colleges, that it seemed a necessary support of religion, and that to
                    doubt its truth was then considered as an act of unpardonable temerity, if not a
                    crime, some conception may be formed of that force of mind which enabled a young
                    man of nineteen to discard this intellectual idolatry, and to undertake the
                    reformation of all his opinions. Nor is it less wonderful that at the period in
                    question Descartes seems to have been in possession of his finest geometrical
                    discoveries. This is sufficiently evinced by the history of his life; but the
                    time had not yet arrived for the publication of his new ideas; and he thought
                    that travelling, by extending his knowledge of mankind, would furnish him with
                    favourable opportunities for improving himself in the only true philosophy.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, he went abroad, and, conformably with his condition and the manners
                    of his age, engaged in the profession of arms. He served successively as a
                    volunteer in the army of Holland and in that of the Duke of Bavaria; and, in
                    1620, he was present at the battle of Prague. But although the ardour of youth
                    led him then to take some pleasure in this tumultuous kind of life, he
                    nevertheless knew how to appreciate rightly the bloody game of war; and seeking
                    neither advancement nor fortune, he consented to take part in it only because it
                    was necessary to accompany the men whom he wished to study closely. In the midst
                    of camps he accordingly continued his metaphysical and mathematical
                    speculations, and, as often as an occasion presented itself, put them to the
                    test of experimental application. While he was in garrison at Breda, chance led
                    him one day to a place where he observed on a wall a placard written in Flemish,
                    with a number of persons assembled in a group before it, and containing the
                    enunciation of a geometrical problem, which some unknown person proposed to
                    mathematicians, according to the usage of the time. Not understanding Flemish,
                    Descartes requested one of the spectators to explain the problem. The person to
                    whom he applied was Beckman, principal of the college of Dort, and himself a
                    mathematician, who, finding the problem very difficult, appeared surprised to
                    see a young soldier inquiring about things of this sort, and, in answering him,
                    assumed that air of pedantry and superiority which is common enough among his
                    tribe; but his astonishment was extreme when the young soldier without
                    hesitation promised a solution of the problem, and <pb break="no"

                    Descartes. Paris, 1668, 4to.</p></note> For several years Descartes continued to
                    lead this meditative and military life; but at length the reverses of which he
                    was a witness in Hungary disgusted him with the profession of arms, which he
                    therefore renounced, and continued his travels as a private individual. At this
                    period an adventure happened to him which had nearly cost him his life. He had
                    completed his travels through the north of Germany, and was returning to Holland
                    by sea, when the crew of the vessel on board of which he had embarked, observing
                    hΓm to be of a quiet and gentle disposition, took him for a young man without
                    experience, and concluded that it would be an easy matter to kill him, in order
                    to take possession of his property, more especially as he was only attended by a
                    single French domestic. Having come to this resolution, they held council
                    together as to the means of executing their project; and they did not scruple to
                    do so in the presence of their intended victim, under the impression that, being
                    a foreigner, he would not understand them. But in this they were fortunately
                    mistaken. Descartes had understood every word that passed, and when he was fully
                    aware of their design, he started up suddenly, drew his sword, and addressing
                    the ruffians in their own tongue, and in a determined manner, threatened to run
                    them through if they dared to offer him the slightest insult. Intimidated by his
                    boldness, the villains relinquished their purpose, and put him ashore in safety
                    at the place where he wished to land. He then visited in succession Holland,
                    France, Italy, Switzerland, the Tyrol, and ultimately spent some time at Venice
                    and at Rome. Whilst in Italy, he did not visit Galileo, who had just entered
                    upon the career of experimental philosophy; and, what is still more remarkable,
                    he seems never to have entertained a proper sense of the merit of this great
                    man; a circumstance which of itself would be sufficient to prove that Descartes,
                    although admirable as a geometrician, was ignorant of the true method by which
                    alone the physical sciences can be advanced.</p>
                <p>Having returned from his travels, and taken a survey of the various occupations
                    of men, Descartes perceived that the only one which suited him was the
                    cultivation of reason; but as his ardent temperament naturally led him into
                    extremes, he conceived a notion that, if he remained in France, he would neither
                    be sufficiently solitary nor sufficiently free for the prosecution of the
                    pursuits in which he was anxious to engage. Accordingly, having sold part of his
                    property, he, in 1629, retired into Holland, which he regarded as a tranquil
                    retreat, peculiarly suitable for peaceful and free meditation; and there applied
                    himself to the study of metaphysics, anatomy, chemistry, and astronomy. He
                    composed a treatise on the System of the World, such as he then conceived it;
                    but on the news of the imprisonment of Galileo, he suppressed this production;
                    and it was probably the dread of similar persecution which caused him, at a
                    later period, to adopt the improbable and absurd notion of the sun and the
                    planets revolving round the earth, as Tycho Brahe had done before him. As yet
                    Descartes had published no mathematical work of any extent; but his genius for
                    the exact sciences, and his immense superiority over the greater part of his
                    contemporaries, were already evinced by the extreme facility with which he
                    resolved, almost in sport, the questions which appeared to them the most
                    difficult. The vivacity of his character involved him in quarrels with some of
                    them; and in these he was sometimes in the right, sometimes in the wrong. He was
                    in the right with Roberval, a French mathematician, who, denying his genius,
                    laboured long to represent him as a vile plagiary of the discoveries of others;
                    but he was in the wrong with regard to Fermat, to whom he did not at first do
                    full justice, and who, though able to maintain a contest on equal terms, was
                    ever desirous to render homage to the genius of Descartes, and to seek his
                    friendship. At length, yielding to the solicitations of his friends, and
                    probably influenced by an honourable desire to shut the mouths of his
                    adversaries, Descartes consented to publish his discoveries. But attaching more
                    value to metaphysical speculations, to which he had then devoted himself, than
                    to the geometrical methods of which he was the inventor, and which had already
                    perhaps lost the charm of novelty, he gave his geometry only as a single chapter
                    of his Treatise on Method, and this chapter was worked up slightly and in haste.
                    Posterity, however, has reversed this judgment, and regarded the geometrical
                    labours of Descartes as affording the best proofs of his genius. Before his time
                    considerable progress had been made in researches purely algebraic, and the
                    resolution of equations of the second, third, and fourth order had already been
                    invented; but the notation employed was still rude, and affected by material
                    relations, which intermixed with algebra, strictly so called, ideas of length,
                    of surface, and of solidity. Algebra, however, is a language the special object
                    as well as the principal advantage of which is to express only the abstract
                    relations of quantities. To extend it, therefore, it is necessary to begin by
                    freeing it from all foreign considerations or elements by which it is limited.
                    Descartes was the first who rendered it this important service; for the
                    metaphysical bent of his mind, which was injurious to him in the sciences of
                    application, proved singularly useful in this particular. According to the
                    ancient limitation of algebra, the successive products of the same quantity were
                    represented in the three first dimensions by a square and a cube in perspective,
                    sometimes by the initial letter of the word “square” or the word “cube” placed
                    above the quantity, and sometimes by the repetition of the letter by means of
                    which the quantity was designated. For this embarrassing mode of notation, which
                    impeded the current of thought, Descartes substituted one clear, simple,
                    general, and, above all, adapted to the purposes of calculation. He placed a
                    cipher above the quantity, and by its different values he indicated the
                    different powers of that quantity. But his greatest discovery consisted in the
                    application of algebra to geometry. He imagined that the nature of each curve
                    might be expressed and defined by a certain relation between two variable lines,
                    of which one represented the absciss and the other the ordinate; and he
                    conceived that, in order to find this relation, it would be sufficient to
                    express in algebraic language one of the characteristic properties of the curve,
                    as, for instance, of the circle, which is a plane curve, all the points of which
                    are equidistant from a given point called the centre. And this discovery had the
                    inestimable advantage, that being once translated into a formula, all that
                    remained to be done was to consider in an abstract manner the resultant
                    equation, in order to deduce from it the other geometrical properties involved
                    in the primary definition.</p>
                <p>Descartes, however, did not stop here; but, pursuing his investigations, he made
                    a discovery exactly the inverse of the preceding. Having learned to express and
                    to know the properties of curves by algebraic equations, he no longer <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193349369" xml:id="kp-eb0706-9369-0182"/> regarded these
                    equations, except as emblems of curves intersected so that the abscisses formed
                    the roots of the equations; and, once in possession of these general methods, he
                    was enabled to enunciate in algebraic language, and to resolve directly,
                    geometrical problems which had baffled all antiquity. This he himself
                    exemplified in the very first question of his geometry; and it is easy to
                    conceive how, possessed of this secret, he was enabled to disport with the
                    greater part of the questions which puzzled the mathematicians of his age. His
                    geometry, at the time when it appeared, was found exceedingly difficult to read;
                    and he himself tells us that he had not sought to develop the different steps of
                    procedure by which he arrived at his results; but at the present day his methods
                    are the first which are taught to youth, and for this reason they appear to us
                    much more easy. In a word, the treatise on geometry does honour to the genius of
                    Descartes, and forms one of his proudest titles to immortality.</p>
                <p>His Discourse on Dioptrics also contains many ingenious geometrical applications;
                    but whilst the unequal refrangibility of the different rays of light was
                    unknown, it was impossible that any available progress could be made in this
                    branch of science. Nevertheless it contains another proof of the genius of
                    Descartes in the discovery therein made of the true law of refraction; a
                    discovery which was contested by Huygens after his death, but which,
                    notwithstanding the pretensions of that philosopher, unquestionably belongs to
                    him. The Treatise on Meteors, which is also contained in his Discourse on
                    Method, is much more imperfect than his Dioptrics, inasmuch as he gives rein to
                    his imagination, and undertakes to explain all meteorological phenomena,
                    including even the formation of lightning. It is, however, distinguished by a
                    discovery; for he has given the true theory of the rainbow, as far as it was
                    possible to do so at a period when the unequal refrangibility of light was
                    altogether unknown. His <hi rend="italic">Principia,</hi> or Principles of
                    Philosophy, were first published in 1644, at the age of forty-nine. This work is
                    divided into four parts; the first, devoted to rational philosophy or
                    metaphysics, contains an exposition of the principles of all human knowledge;
                    the second treats of the principles of natural things; and the last two develop
                    his theory of the system of the world, the once celebrated, but, since the time
                    of Newton, for ever exploded theory of vortices. We abstain from making any
                    observations either as to the metaphysical notions or physical theories of
                    Descartes, both of which have been treated of with consummate ability and
                    sufficient amplitude of detail in the Dissertations prefixed to this work. With
                    regard to the former, we shall merely add, that in his celebrated Discourse on
                    the Method of conducting the Reason, and seeking Truth in the Sciences,
                    published in 1637, Descartes had already made known the principal points of his
                    doctrine, and broached the most abstract questions of metaphysics. These,
                    however, he had treated with grea’ter order and fulness in the not less
                    celebrated work which he published in 1641, three years before his <hi
                    rend="italic">Principia,</hi> entitled “Meditations concerning the first
                    Philosophy, in which are demonstrated the Existence of God, and the Immortality
                    of the Soul.” These Meditations are six in number, forming a book small in
                    itself, but which was considerably enlarged by the objections of several
                    metaphysicians of the time, among whom may be mentioned Arnauld, Gassendi, and
                    Hobbes, and by the answers which Descartes made to these objections. They were
                    originally published in Latin; but, in 1642, the Duke of Luynes translated the
                    Meditations, and Clerselier the Objections and Answers, into French.</p>
                <p>The influence which Descartes exercised over his age was very great indeed; his
                    fame spread rapidly, and soon became all but universal. In France, particularly,
                    the novelty of his hypotheses, the grandeur and boldness of his views, and the
                    apparent generality of his methods, swayed more or less the most cultivated
                    minds of the age of Louis XIV. It has been remarked that his partizans were for
                    the most part of the number of those who professed the most independent ideas.
                    Bossuet and Fenelon, Malebranche and the principal members of the congregation
                    of the Oratory, and almost all the writers of the celebrated school of
                    Port-Royal, adopted Cartesianism; and from the saine source Pascal derived that
                    spirit of discussion which distinguishes the Provincial Letters. The Jesuits
                    were later in giving in their adherence to the dominant philosophy; and the
                    University admitted it still more reluctantly, and only as it were at the last
                    extremity. But in its transmission the metaphysical doctrine of Descartes
                    experienced the fate which must ever attend all systems of dogmatic philosophy.
                    In adopting it, each modified it according to the bent of his own mind, or the
                    cast of his own character; receiving or rejecting as much of it as suited his
                    convenience, and deducing from it consequences which, in their turn, formed the
                    basis of new systems. Hence the most opposite, not to say contradictory
                    theories, all acknowledged Cartesianism as their common source. From it
                    Malebranche derived his mystical spiritualism, and Berkeley his pure idealism;
                    Spinosa found in it the germ of what has been called his materialism; and the
                    greater part of the schools of philosophy which have succeeded each other in
                    Germany since the time of Descartes, may be considered as originating in the
                    same common source.</p>
                <p>The writings of Descartes involved him in controversy, and exposed him to
                    persecution. His disputes with Roberval and Fermat have been already noticed by
                    us when adverting to his geometrical investigations and discoveries. But
                    controversies purely scientific are seldom pursued with exasperation, or
                    calculated to mar the happiness of life; and, in point of fact, if Descartes was
                    misrepresented by Roberval, he was guilty of injustice to Fermat. In the hazy
                    region of metaphysics, however, where it is equally difficult to attain any
                    measure of certainty, and easy to discover pretexts for accusations of error or
                    heresy, the most violent contentions are commonly engendered, and men’s passions
                    become excited and envenomed from the very <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> cause
                    which ought to beget charity and forbearance. And so it proved in the case of
                    Descartes. To his metaphysical writings he owed all the disputes which served to
                    disturb the tranquillity of his life; and amongst the clergy he found the
                    bitterest enemies and persecutors. Of the latter, by far the most inveterate was
                    Gisbert Voet, primarius professor of theology in the university of Utrecht; a
                    man whose respectable station and austere manners had secured him a degree of
                    credit much beyond what was due to his ability or learning, and who felt no
                    compunction in accusing of atheism a philosopher who had exhausted all the
                    resources of his genius to discover new demonstrations of the existence of God.
                    But when hatred addresses itself to credulity, it is almost certain to triumph.
                    The fierce theologian of Utrechtattempted in vain to engage Father Mersenne, the
                    intimate and much-loved friend of Descartes, to write publicly against him in
                    defence of the Catholic religion; but though deceived in his expectation of
                    enlisting Mersenne as an auxiliary, he did not relinquish his design; and by
                    continued solicitations and manoeuvres he at length succeeded in “impetrating” a
                    sentence against Descartes, condemning him to pay a very considerable fine, and
                    ordaining his works to be burned. Voet is said to have assisted the executioner
                    in carrying into effect the latter part of the sentence. The theologians of
                    Leyden, imitating the example of those of Utrecht, soon stirred up a new
                    persecution against the philosopher; who, harassed<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193349382" xml:id="kp-eb0706-9382-0183"/> and vexed by these
                    annoyances, cursed the celebrity he had acquired, and regretting the sweets of
                    his retired and studious life, took as his device <hi rend="italic">Qui Lene
                    latuit, Lene vixit.</hi></p>
                <p>Whilst he was in this mood of mind, Descartes received an invitation from
                    Christina, queen of Sweden, to repair to the court of that country, where he was
                    promised an asylum and protection. Although he had always loved independence,
                    and valued his liberty so highly that, as he said, no prince on earth could
                    induce him to surrender it, yet he accepted this proposal, as indeed he had
                    every reason to do. It was made to him at a moment when he was unhappy; Whilst
                    the honour of being sought after by a great queen, and called to her presence
                    and society, was calculated to be useful in enabling him to confound his
                    persecutors. He determined therefore to quit his hermitage at Egmont, in order
                    to repair to Sweden and pass his days in the rigorous climate of that country.
                    On his arrival at court, he was received with the greatest distinction by the
                    queen, and obtained, at his own solicitation, the favour of being exempted from
                    all observance of ceremony, and of only appearing at court when he was specially
                    called. But as the price of this dispensation, the queen stipulated that he
                    would come to converse with her every morning at five o’clock in her library.
                    Descartes, however, who always needed repose, and whose health required great
                    attention, was unable to bear up under the change of life which this matutinal
                    duty imposed on him, especially in so cold a climate, and during the rigour of
                    winter. He was attacked by a disease in the chest, accompanied with delirium,
                    and expired on the 11th February 1650, at the comparatively early age of
                    fifty-four. The queen wished his remains to be interred amongst those of the
                    first families of Sweden; but the ambassador of France interposed, and his
                    corpse was conveyed to Paris for sepulture among his countrymen.</p>
