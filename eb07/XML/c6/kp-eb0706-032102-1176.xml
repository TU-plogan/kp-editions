                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">CHARACTER</label>, in a general sense, signifies a mark or
                    figure, drawn on paper, metal, stone, or other matter, with a pen, graver,
                    chisel, or other instrument, to signify or denote any thing. The word is Greek,
                    formed from the verb <hi rend="italic">γpζws&lt;5ων,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >insculpere,</hi> to engrave or impress.</p>
                <p>The various kinds of characters may be reduced to three heads, viz. <hi
                    rend="italic">Literal Characters, Numeral Characters,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abbreviations.</hi></p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Literal</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Character</hi> is a
                    letter of the alphabet, serving to indicate some articulate sound.</p>
                <p>1. These may be divided, with regard to their nature and use, into <hi
                    rend="italic">Nominal Characters,</hi> or those we properly call <hi
                    rend="italic">letters,</hi> which serve to express the names of things; <hi
                    rend="italic">Peal Characters,</hi> those that instead of names express things
                    and ideas; <hi rend="italic">Emblematical</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Symbolical
                    Characters,</hi> which have this in common with real ones, that they express the
                    things themselves, but, further, possess the peculiarity of in some measure
                    personating them, and exhibiting their form, such as the hieroglyphics of the
                    ancient Egyptians.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Literal</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Characters</hi> may
                    be again divided, with regard to their invention and use, into <hi rend="italic"
                    >particular</hi> and <hi rend="italic">general</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >universal.</hi><hi rend="italic">Particular</hi><hi rend="italic
                    smallcaps"> Characters</hi> are those peculiar to this or that nation, such as
                    the Roman, Italic, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Gothic, and Chinese <hi rend="italic"
                    >characters.</hi><hi rend="italic">Universal</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                    Characters</hi> are also <hi rend="italic">real characters,</hi> and constitute
                    what some authors call a <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Language.</hi></p>
                <p>That diversity of <hi rend="italic">characters</hi> used by several nations to
                    express the same idea is found the chief obstacle to the advancement of
                    learning. To remove this, several ingenious thinkers have taken occasion to
                    propose plans of <hi rend="italic">characters</hi> which should be universal,
                    and which each people should read in their own language. The object is to render
                    <hi rend="italic">character</hi> real, not nominal; to express things and
                    notions, not letters or sounds; yet to be mute like letters, and arbitrary, not
                    emblematical, like hieroglyphics. Thus, every nation would retain its own
                    language, yet every one would understand that of every other without learning
                    it, only by seeing a real or universal <hi rend="italic">character,</hi> which
                    should signify the same thing to all people, by what sounds soever it might be
                    expressed in their particular idiom. For instance, by seeing the <hi
                    rend="italic">character</hi> destined to signify <hi rend="italic">to
                    drink,</hi> an Englishman would read <hi rend="italic">to drink;</hi> a
                    Frenchman, <hi rend="italic">boire;</hi> a Latin, <hi rend="italic">bibere;</hi>
                    a Greek, vr/w/v; a Jew, nnor; a German, <hi rend="italic">trinchen,</hi> and so
                    of the rest; in the same manner as seeing a horse, each people would express it
                    after their own manner, but all would mean the same animal.</p>
                <p>The first and most considerable attempts at a <hi rend="italic">real
                    character,</hi> or philosophical language, in Europe, are those of Bishop
                    Wilkins and Dalgarno; but they <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> proved wholly
                    ineffectual. M. Leibnitz, indeed, thought that those ingenious men did not hit
                    the right method. It was probable, indeed, that by their contrivance people who
                    do not understand one another might easily have a commerce together; but they
                    have not hit on true <hi rend="italic">real characters.</hi> According to him,
                    the <hi rend="italic">characters</hi> should resemble those used in algebra,
                    which, in effect, are very simple, yet very expressive, without any thing
                    superfluous or equivocal, and contain all the varieties required. M. Lodwic, in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> gives us a plan of <hi
                    rend="italic">an universal alphabet</hi> or <hi rend="italic">character</hi> of
                    another description. This was to contain an enumeration of all such single
                    sounds or letters as are used in any language, by means of which people should
                    be enabled to pronounce truly and readily any language; to describe the
                    pronunciation of any language that might be pronounced in their hearing, so that
                    others accustomed to this language, though they had never heard it pronounced,
                    should at first be able truly to pronounce it; and, lastly, this <hi
                    rend="italic">character</hi> was to serve as a standard to perpetuate the sounds
                    of any language.</p>
                <p>A new universal character was proposed by Mr Northmore of London, by which
                    different nations might communicate their sentiments to each other. His original
                    plan <pb break="no" facs="nls:193351189" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1189-0322"/>was to
                    make the same numerical figure represent the same word in all languages. But he
                    found afterwards that it might be improved by using a figure, not for every
                    word, but for every <hi rend="italic">useful</hi> word. And even these, he
                    thinks, might be abbreviated by adopting certain uniform fixed signs, the number
                    of which would not exceed twenty for the various parts of speech. Words of
                    negation he proposed to be expressed by a prefixed sign. A few instances will
                    explain the author’s meaning.</p>

                <p>“From the above specimen, I should find no difficulty in comprehending the
                    following sentence, though it were written in the language of the
                    Hottentots:</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> ∙-~'.</p>
                <p>9, 8, .5,—7, 6. <hi rend="italic">I never saw a more unhappy woman.</hi></p>
                <p>“Those languages which do not usc the pronoun prefixed to the verb, as the Greek
                    and Roman, may apply it in a small character, simply to denominate the person;
                    thus, instead of 9, 8, .5, <hi rend="italic">I never saw,</hi> they may write 8,
                    <hi rend="subscript"> g</hi>.5, which will signify that the verb is in the first
                    person, and will still have the same meaning.”</p>
                <p>Our author thinks, that according to this scheme of an universal character, about
                    twenty signs, and less than 10,000 <hi rend="italic">choseii</hi> words,
                    synonyms being set aside, would answer all the ends proposed; and that
                    foreigners, by referring to their numerical dictionary, would easily comprehend
                    each other. He proceeds next to show how appropriate sounds may be given to his
                    signs, and an universal <hi rend="italic">living language</hi> formed from the
                    universal <hi rend="italic">characters.</hi></p>
                <p>With this view he proposes to distinguish the ten numerals by ten monosyllabic
                    names <hi rend="italic">of easy</hi> pronunciation, or such as may without
                    difficulty run into one another. To illustrate his scheme, however, he calls
                    them, for the present, by their common English names, but suggests that each
                    number made usc of should be pronounced by uttering separately its component
                    parts, after the manner of accountants. Thus, let the number 6943 represent the
                    word <hi rend="italic">horse,</hi> he would not, in the universal language, call
                    a horse <hi rend="italic">six thousand nine hundred and forty-three,</hi> but
                    <hi rend="italic">six, nine, four, three</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and so on
                    for all the words of a sentence, making the proper stop at the end of each. In
                    the same manner, a distinct appellation must be appropriated to each of the
                    prefixed signs, to be pronounced immedialely after the numeral of which it is an
                    appendage. Therefore, if <hi rend="italic">plu</hi> be the appellation or the
                    sign of the plural number, <hi rend="italic">six, nine, four, three, plu,</hi>
                    will be <hi rend="italic">horses.</hi></p>
                <p>“Thus,” says our author, “I hope it is evident that about thirty or forty
                    distinct syllables are sufficient for the above purpose; but I am much mistaken
                    if <hi rend="italic">eleven</hi> only will not answer the same end. This is to
                    be done by substituting the first twenty or thirty numerals for the signs, and
                    saying, as in algebra, that a term is in the power of such a number, which may
                    be expressed by the simple word <hi rend="italic">under.</hi> For example, let
                    6943 represent the word <hi rend="italic">horse,</hi> and suppose 4 to be the
                    sign of the plural number, I would write the word thus, and pronounce it six,
                    nine, four, three, in the power of or <hi rend="italic">under</hi> four. By
                    these means eleven distinct appellations would be sufficient, and time and use
                    would much abbreviate the pronunciation.”</p>
                <p>3. Literal characters may again be divided, with reference to the nations among
                    whom they have been invented, into Greek characters, Roman characters, Hebrew
                    characters, and the like. The Latin character now used throughout all Europe was
                    formed from the Greek, as the Greek was formed from the Phoenician; and the
                    Phoenician, as well as the Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic characters, were formed
                    from the ancient Hebrew, which subsisted till the Babylonish captivity; for
                    after that event the character of the Assyrians, which is the square Hebrew now
                    in use, prevailed, the ancient being only found on some Hebrew medals, commonly
                    called Samaritan medals. It was in 1091 that the Gothic characters, invented by
                    Ulphiľas, were abolished, and the Latin ones established in their room.</p>
                <p>Medallists observe that the Greek character, consisting only of majuscule
                    letters, has preserved its uniformity on all medals as low as the time of
                    Gallienus, after which it appears somewhat weaker and rounder. From the time of
                    Constantine to that of Michael we find only Latin characters; after the time of
                    Michael the Greek characters recommence; but from that period they began to
                    alter with the language, which was a mixture of Greek and Latin. The Latin
                    medals preserved both their characters and language as late as the translation
                    of the seat of the empire to Constantinople. Towards the time of Decius the
                    character began to lose its roundness and beauty; but some time afterwards it
                    retrieved, and subsisted tolerably till the time of Justin, when it degenerated
                    gradually into the Gothic. The rounder, then, and better-formed a character is
                    upon a medal, the fairer pretence it has to antiquity.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Numeral</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Characters,</hi>
                    or characters used to express numbers, arc either letters or figures.</p>
                <p>The Arabic character, called also the common one, because it is used almost
                    throughout Europe in all sorts of calculations, consists of the ten digits, 1,
                    2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 8, 9, 0.</p>
                <p>The Roman numeral character consists of seven majuscule letters of the Roman
                    alphabet, viz. I, V, X, L, C, D, M. The I denotes one, V five, X ten, L fifty, C
                    a hundred, D five hundred, and M a thousand. The 1 repeated twice makes two, II;
                    thrice, three, III. Four is expressed thus, IV, as I before V or X takes an unit
                    from the number expressed by these letters. To express six an I is added to a V,
                    thus, VI; for seven, two, VII; and for eight, three, VIII. Nine is expressed by
                    an I before X, thus, IX. The same remark may be made of the X before L or C,
                    except that the diminution is by tens; thus, XL <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193351202" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1202-0323"/>denotes forty, XC ninety, and
                    LX sixty. The C before D or M diminishes each by a hundred. The number five
                    hundred is sometimes expressed by an I before a C inverted, thus, 13; and
                    instead of M, which signifies a thousand, an I is sometimes used between two
                    C’s, the one direct and the other inverted, thus, CIO. The addition of C and 0
                    before or after'raises CIO by tens; thus, CCIOO expresses ten thousand, CCCIOOO
                    a hundred thousand. The Romans also expressed any number of thousands by a line
                    drawn over any numeral less than a thousand; thus, V denotes five thousand, ‰χ
                    sixty thousand; so likewise M is one million, MM is two millions, and so on.</p>
                <p>The Greeks had three ways of expressing numbers: 1. Every letter, according to
                    its place in the alphabet, denoted a number, from α, one, to ω, twenty-four. 2.
                    The alphabet was divided into eight units, α one, <hi rend="italic">β</hi> two,
                    <hi rend="italic">γ</hi> three; &amp;c.; into eight tens, ∣ ten, κ twenty, λ
                    thirty, &amp;c.; and eight hundreds, <hi rend="italic">ξ</hi> one hundred, d’
                    two hundred, <hi rend="italic">r</hi> three hundred, &amp;c. 3. I stood for one,
                    ∏ five, Δ ten, H a hundred, X a thousand, M ten thousand; and when the latter ∏
                    inclosed any of these, except I, it showed the inclosed letter to be five times
                    its value; as, ∣∆∣ fifty, ∣II∣ five hundred, ∣X∣ five thousand, ∣M∣ fifty
                    thousand.</p>

                <p>The poetical character is not properly any particular virtue or quality, but a
                    composition of several which are mixed together in different degrees, according
                    to the necessity of the fable and the unity of the action; there must be one,
                    however, to reign over all the rest, and this must be found, in some degree, in
                    every part. The first quality in Achilles is wrath, in Ulysses dissimulation,
                    and in Aencas mildness; but as these characters cannot stand alone, they must be
                    accompanied with others to embellish them, as far as they are capable, either by
                    hiding their defects, as in the anger of Achilles, which is palliated by
                    extraordinary valour; or by making them centre in some solid virtue, as in
                    Ulysses, whose dissimulation constitutes part of his prudence; and in Aeneas,
                    whose mildness is employed in submission to the will of the gods. In the making
                    up of this union, it is to be observed, that the poets have joined together such
                    qualities as are by nature the most compatible; valour with anger, piety with
                    mildness, and prudence with dissimulation. The fable required prudence in
                    Ulysses and piety in Aencas; in this, therefore, the poets were not left to
                    their own choice. But Homer might have made Achilles a coward without abating
                    any thing from the justness of his fable; and it was only the necessity of
                    adorning his character that obliged him to make him valiant. The character,
                    then, of a hero in the epic poem is compounded of three sorts of qualities; the
                    first essential to the fable, the second embellishments of the first, while
                    valour, which sustains the other two, constitutes the third.</p>
                <p>Unity of character is as necessary as the unity of the fable. For this purpose a
                    person should be the same from the beginning to the end; not that he is always
                    to betray identical sentiments, or one passion; but that he should never speak
                    nor act inconsistently with his fundamental character. For instance, the weak
                    may sometimes burst into warmth, and the breast of the passionate may be calm; a
                    change which often introduces into the drama a very affecting variety: but if
                    the natural disposition of the former were to be represented as boisterous, and
                    that of the latter as mild and soft, they would both act out of character, and
                    contradict their personality.</p>
                <p>True characters are such as we actually see in men, or as may exist without any
                    contradiction to nature. No man questions but there have been men as generous
                    and as good .as Aeneas, as passionate and as violent as Achilles, as prudent and
                    as wise as Ulysses, as impious and atheistical as Mezentius, and as amorous and
                    passionate as Dido. All these characters, therefore, are true, and nothing but
                    just imitations of nature. On the contrary, a character is false when the author
                    so feigns it that one can see nothing like it in the order of nature in which he
                    designs it shall stand. Such characters should be wholly excluded from a poem,
                    because, transgressing the bounds of probability and reason, they meet with no
                    belief from the reader. They are fictions of the poct’s brain, not imitations of
                    nature; and yet all poetry consists of an imitation of nature.</p>
