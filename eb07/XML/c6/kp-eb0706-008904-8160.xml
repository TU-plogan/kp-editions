                <p><label type="entry">CANON</label>, a person who possesses a prebend, or revenue
                    allotted for the performance of divine service in a cathedral or collegiate
                    church.</p>
                <p>Canons are of no great antiquity. Paschier observes, that the name canon was not
                    known before Charlemagne; at least the first we hear of are in Gregory de Tours,
                    who mentions a college of canons instituted by Baldwin XVI. archbishop of that
                    city, in the time of Clotharius I. The common opinion attributes the institution
                    of this order to Chrodegangus, bishop of Metz, about the middle of the eighth
                    century.</p>
                <p>Originally canons were only priests, or inferior ecclesiastics, who lived in
                    community, residing by the cathedral church to assist the bishop, depending
                    entirely on his will, supported by the revenues of the bishopric, and living in
                    the same house as his domestics or counsellors. They even inherited his movables
                    till the year 817, when this was prohibited by the council of Aix-la-Chapelle,
                    and a new rule substituted in the place of that which had been appointed by
                    Chrodegangus, and which was observed for the most part in the west till the
                    twelfth century. By degrees these communities of priests, shaking off their
                    dependence, formed separate bodies, of which the bishops, however, were still
                    heads. In the tenth century there were communities or congregations of the same
                    kind established even in cities where there were no bishops; and these were
                    called collegiates, as they used the terms congregation and college
                    indifferently; the name chapter, now given to these bodies, being much more
                    modern. Under the second race of the French kings, the canonical or collegiate
                    life had spread itself all over the country; and each cathedral had its chapter
                    distinct from the rest of the clergy. They had the name canon from the Greek
                    καιwv, which signifies three different things; 'a"Yule, a pension or fixed
                    revenue to live on, and a catalogue or matricula, all which are applicable to
                    them.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193348173" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8173-0090"/>
                <p>In time, the canons freed themselves from their rules, the observance relaxed,
                    and at length they ceased to live in community; yet they still formed bodies,
                    pretending to other functions besides the celebration of the common office in
                    the church, assuming the rights of the rest of the clergy, making themselves
                    necessary as a council of the bishop, taking upon them the administration of a
                    see during a vacancy, and the election of a bishop to supply it. There ∙are even
                    some chapters exempt from the jurisdiction of the bishop, and owning no head but
                    their dean. From the example of cathedral chapters, collegiate ones also
                    continued to form bodies after they had abandoned living in community.</p>
                <p>Canons are of various kinds; as, <hi rend="italic">Cardinal Canons,</hi> who were
                    those attached, and, as the Latins cail it, <hi rend="italic">incardinati,</hi>
                    to a church, as a priest is to a parish. </p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Domicellary Canons,</hi> young canons, who, not being in
                    orders, had no right in any particular chapters.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Expectative</hi><hi rend="italic">Canons,</hi> or such as,
                    without having any revenue or prebend, had the title and dignities of canons, a
                    voice in the chapter, and a place in the choir, till such time as a prebend
                    should become vacant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Foreign Canons,</hi> or such as did not officiate in the
                    canonries to which they belonged. To these were opposed mansionary canons, or
                    canons residentiary.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lay</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Honorary Canons,</hi> who are
                    those among the laity who have been admitted, out of honour and respect, into
                    some chapter of canons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Regular Canons,</hi> who are canons that still live in
                    community, and, like religious, have in process of time added the solemn
                    profession of vows to the practice of their rules. They are called regulars, to
                    distinguish them from those secular canons who abandon living in community, and
                    at the same time the observance of the canons made as the rule of the clergy for
                    the maintenance of the ancient discipline. The canons subsisted in their
                    simplicity till the eleventh or twelfth century, when some of them, separating
                    from the community, took with them the name of canons, or acephalous priests,
                    because they declined to live in community with the bishop; and those who were
                    left thenceforth acquired the denomination of canons regular, and adopted most
                    of the professions of the rule of St Augustin. This order of regular canons of
                    St Augustin was brought into England by Adelwald, confessor to Henry I., who
                    erected a priory at Nostel in Yorkshire, and obtained for them the church of
                    Carlisle as an episcopal see, with the privilege of choosing their own bishop.
                    They were singularly protected and encouraged by Henry I. who gave them the
                    priory of Dunstable in 1107; and by Queen Maud, who, in the following year, gave
                    them the priory of the Holy Trinity in London. It appears that under the reign
                    of Edward I. they had fifty-three priories.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tertiary Canons,</hi> or those who had only the third part of
                    the revenues of the canonicate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Canon,</hi> in an ecclesiastical sense, is a law or rule,
                    either of doctrine or discipline, enacted especially by a council, and confirmed
                    by the authority of the sovereign.</p>
                <p>Canons are properly decisions of matters of religion; or regulations of the
                    policy and discipline of a church, made by councils, either general, national,
                    or provincial. Such are the canons of the councils of Nice, Trent, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>There have been various collections of the canons of the eastern councils; but
                    there are four principal ones, each ampler than the preceding. The first,
                    according to Usher, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 3S0, containing only those
                    of the first ecumenical council, and the first provincial ones; they were only
                    164 in number. To these, Dionysius Exiguus, in the year 520, added the fifty
                    canons of the apostles, and those of the other general councils. The Greek
                    canons in this second collection end with those of the council of Chalcedon; to
                    which are subjoined those of the council of Sardica, and the African councils.
                    The fourth and last collection comes down as low as the second council of Nice;
                    and it is on this that Balsamon and Zonaras have commented.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Apostolical Canons</hi> are those which have been usually
                    ascribed to St Clement. Bellarmin, Baronius, and others, will have them to be
                    genuine canons of the apostles. Ca-telerius observes that they cannot be
                    ascribed to the apostles or Clement, because they are not received with other
                    books of Scripture, are not quoted by the writers of the first ages, and contain
                    many things not agreeable to the apostolical times. Hinemar, de Marca,
                    Beveridge, and others, believe them to have been framed by the bishops who were
                    the apostles’ disciples in the second or third century; S. Basnage is of opinion
                    that they were collected by an anonymous writer in the fifth century, but Daille
                    and others maintain them to have been forged by some heretic in the sixth
                    century; and S. Basnage conjectures that some of them are ancient, and others
                    not older than the seventh century. The Greek church allows eighty∙five of them,
                    and the Latin only fifty; though there are eighty-four in the edition given of
                    them in the Corpus Juris Canonici.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Canon</hi> is also used for the authorized catalogue of the
                    sacred writings. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Bible.</hi></p>
                <p>The ancient canon, or catalogue of the books of the Old Testament, was made by
                    the Jews, and is ordinarily attributed to Ezra, who is said to have distributed
                    them into the law, the prophets, and the hagiographa, to which our Saviour
                    refers, Luke, chap, xxiv. ver. 44. The same division is also mentioned by
                    Josephus <hi rend="italic">(Cont. App'wn.</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    y</hi><hi rend="italic">)</hi></p>
                <p>This is the canon allowed to have been followed by the primitive church till the
                    council of Carthage; and, according to St Jerome, it consisted of no more than
                    twenty-two books, answering to the number of the Hebrew alphabet, though at
                    present they are classed into twenty-four divisions, containing Genesis, Exodus,
                    Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Isaiah,
                    Jeremiah, Ezekiel, the twelve minor prophets, the Psalms, the Proverbs, Job,
                    Canticles, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra, comprehending
                    the book of Nehemiah and the Chronicles. However, this order is not universally
                    observed either among Jews or Christians; nor were all the books above
                    enumerated admitted into the canon in Ezra’s time. It is most likely, says Dr
                    Prideaux, that the two books of Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, and Malachi,
                    were added in the time of Simon the Just, when the canon was completed. But that
                    council enlarged the canon very considerably, taking into it the books which we
                    call apocryphal; which the council of Trent has further enforced, enjoining all
                    these to be received as books of Holy Scripture, upon pain of anathema, and
                    being attainted of heresy. The Romanists, in defence of this canon, say that it
                    is the same with that of the council of Hippo, held in 393, and with that of the
                    third council of Carthage, in 397, at which were present forty-six bishops, and
                    among the rest St Augustin, who declared that they had received it from their
                    fathers.</p>
                <p>Their canon of the New Testament perfectly agrees with ours. It consists of books
                    that are well known, and some of which have been universally acknowledged, such
                    as the Gospels, and acts of the Apostles, thirteen Epistles of St Paul, one
                    Epistle of St Peter, and one Epistle of St John; and others, concerning which
                    doubts were entertained, but which were afterwards received as genuine, such as
                    the Epistle to the Hebrews, that of James, the second of Peter, the second and
                    third of John, that of Jude, and the Revelation. These books were written at <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193348186" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8186-0091"/> different times;
                    and they are authenticated, not by the decrees of councils, or infallible
                    authority, but by such kind of evidence as is thought sufficient in the case of
                    any other ancient writings. They were very extensively diffused; they were read
                    in every Christian society; they were valued and preserved with care by the
                    first Christians; they wcrc cited by Christian writers of the second, third, and
                    fourth centuries, as by Irenaeus, Clement the Alexandrian, Tertullian, Origen,
                    Eusebius, and others; and their genuineness is proved by the testimony of those
                    who were contemporary with the apostles themselves, and by tradition. The four
                    Gospels, and most of the other books of the New Testament, were collected either
                    by one of the apostles, or some of their disciples and successors, before the
                    end of the first century. The catalogue of canonical books furnished by the more
                    ancient Christian writers, as Origen about the year 210, Eusebius and Athanasius
                    in 315, Epiphanius in 370, Jerome in 382, Austin in 394, and many others, agrees
                    with that which is now received among Christians.</p>
                <p>Some of the fathers distinguish the inspired writings into three classes;
                    proto-canonical, deutero-canonical, and apocryphal.</p>

                    for a cycle of nineteen years.</p>
                <p>The paschal canon is supposed to be the calculation of Eusebius of Caesarea, and
                    to have been done by order of the council of Nice.</p>

                    order. The canon differs from the <hi rend="italic">missale, martyrologium,</hi>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Canon</hi> is also used, by way of excellence, in the Romish
                    church, for the secret words of the mass, from the preface to the <hi

                    priest consecrates the host. The common opinion is, that the canon of the mass
                    commences with <hi rend="italic">Te igitur,</hi> &amp;c. The people are to be on
                    their knees, hearing the canon, and are to rehearse it to themselves so as not
                    to be heard.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Canon,</hi> in the ancient music, is a rule or mode of
                    determining the intervals of notes. Ptolemy, rejecting the Aristoxenian way of
                    measuring the intervals in music, by the magnitude of a tone, which was supposed
                    to be formed by the difference between a diapente and a diatessaron, thought
                    that musical intervals should be distinguished according to the ratios or
                    proportions which the sounds terminating those intervals bear to one another,
                    when considered according to their degree of acuteness or gravity, which, before
                    Aristoxenus, was the old Pythagorean way. He therefore made the diapason consist
                    in a double ratio, the diapente in a sesquialterate, the diatessaron in a
                    sesquitertian, and the tone itself in a sesquioctave, and all the other
                    intervals according to the proportion of the sounds that terminate them;
                    wherefore taking the canon, as it is called, for a determinate line of any
                    length, he shows how this canon is to be cut accordingly, so that it may
                    represent the respective intervals; and this method answers exactly to
                    experiment, in the different lengths of musical chords. From this canon Ptolemy
                    and his followers have been called <hi rend="italic">Canonici,</hi> as those of
                    Aristoxenus were called <hi rend="italic">AIusici.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"

                    because the different parts beginning one after another repeat incessantly the

                    all questions of the same nature with that proposed.</p>
