                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">CAPELL, <hi rend="smallcaps">Edward</hi></label>, a gentleman
                    well known by his indefatigable attention to the works of Shakspeare, was a
                    native of the county of Suffolk, and received his education at the school of St
                    Edmund’s Bury. In the dedication of his edition of Shakspeare, in 1768, to the
                    Dųke of Grafton, he observes that “bis father and the grandfather of his grace
                    were friends, and to the patronage of the deceased nobleman he owed the leisure
                    which enabled him to bestow the attention of twenty years on that work.” The
                    office which his grace bestowed on Mr Capell was that of deputy-inspector of the
                    plays, to which a salary was annexed of L.200 a year. As early as the year 1745,
                    Mr Capell, shocked at the licentiousness of Han-mer’s plan, first projected an
                    edition of Shakspeare, of the strictest accuracy, to be collated and published
                    in due time, <hi rend="italic">ex fide</hi><hi rend="italic">codicum.</hi>
                    Accordingly, he proceeded to collect and compare the oldest and scarcest copies,
                    noting the original excellencies and defects of the rarest quartos, and
                    distinguishing the improvements or variations of the first, second, and third
                    folios; and after many years labour produced a very beautiful small octavo in
                    ten volumes, with an “Introduction.” There is not, as the authors of a monthly
                    periodical have observed, a more singular literary composition than that
                    “Introduction.” In style and manner it is more obsolete and antique than the age
                    of which he treats. It is Lord Herbert of Cherbury walking the new pavement in
                    all the trappings of romance; but, like Lord Herbert, it displays many valuable
                    qualities accompanying this air of extravagance, much sound sense, and
                    appropriate erudition. In the title-page of “Mr William Shakspeare, his
                    Comedies, Histories, and Tragedies,” it was announced “Whereunto will be added,
                    in some other volumes, notes critical and explanatory, and a body of various
                    readings entire.” “The Introduction” likewise declared that these “notes and
                    various readings” would be accompanied with another work, disclosing the sources
                    from which Shakspeare “drew the greater part of his knowledge in mythological
                    and classical matters, his fable, his history, and even the seeming
                    peculiarities of his language, to which,” says Mr Capell, “we have given for
                    title, The School of Shakspeare.” Nothing surely could be more properly
                    conceived than such designs; nor have we ever met with any thing better grounded
                    on the subject of “the learning of Shakspeare,” than what may be found in the
                    long note to this part of Mr Capell’s Introduction. It is more solid than even
                    the popular “Essay” on this topic. Certain quaintnesses of style, and
                    peculiarities of printing and punctuation, attended the whole of this
                    publication. The outline, however, was correct; and the critic, with unremitting
                    toil, succeeded in his undertaking. But while he was diving into the classics of
                    Caxton, and working his way under ground, like the river Mole, in order to
                    emerge in all his glory,—while he was looking forward to his triumphs, —certain
                    other active spirits went to work upon his plan, and, digging out the promised
                    treasures, laid them prematurely before the public, defeating the effect of our
                    critic’s discoveries by anticipation. Steevens, Malone, Farmer, Percy, Reed, and
                    a whole host of literary ferrets, burrowed into every hole and corner of the
                    warren of modern antiquity, and overran all the country, whose map had been
                    delineated by Edward Capell. Such a contingency nearly staggered the steady and
                    unshaken perseverance of our critic on the very eve of the completion of his
                    labours; and, as his editor informs us—for, unhappily, at the end of near forty
                    years the publication was posthumous, and the critic himself no more—he was
                    almost determined to lay the work wholly aside. By the encouragement of some
                    noble and worthy persons, however, he persevered; and to such their
                    encouragement, and his perseverance, the public was, in 1783, indebted for three
                    large volumes in 4to, under the title of “Notes and various readings of
                    Shakspeare; together with the School of Shakspeare, or Extracts from divers
                    English Books that were in print in the Author’s time; evidently showing from
                    whence his several Fables were taken, and some parcel of his Dialogue. Also
                    farther extracts, which contribute to a due understanding of his Writings, or
                    give a light to the History of his Life, or to the Dramatic History of his Time.
                    By Edward Capell.” Besides the works already mentioned, Mr Capell was the editor
                    of a volume of ancient poems called “Prolusions and the alteration of “Anthony
                    and Cleopatra,” as acted at Drury Lane in 1758. He died on the 24th January
                    1781.</p>
