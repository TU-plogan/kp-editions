                    probably the primitive habitations, before men began to build edifices above
                    ground. The primitive method of burial was also to deposit the bodies in caves;
                    which seems to have been the origin of catacombs. Caves long continued the
                    proper habitations of shepherds. Among the Romans, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >antra</hi> used to be consecrated to nymphs, who were worshipped in caves, as
                    other gods were in temples. The Persians also worshipped their god Mithras in a
                    natural cave consecrated for the purpose by Zoroaster. The cave of the nymph
                    Egeria is still shown at Rome.</p>

                    London, and of Islington. He became chaplain to Charles IL, and in 1684 was

                    more”), was born in 1691. His father being disappointed of some small family
                    expectations, was reduced to follow the trade of a shoemaker at Rugby in
                    Warwickshire. The free school of this place, in which his son had, by the rules
                    of its foundation, a right to be instructed, was then in high reputation, under
                    the reverend Mr Holyock, to whose care most of the neighbouring families, even
                    of the highest rank, intrusted their sons. He had judgment to discover, and for
                    some time generosity to encourage, the talents of young Cave; and was so well
                    pleased with his quick progress in the school, that he declared his resolution
                    to breed him for the university, and recommend him as a servitor to some of his
                    scholars of high rank. But prosperity which depends upon the caprice of others,
                    is of short duration. Cave’s superiority in literature exalted him to an
                    invidious familiarity with boys who were far above him in rank and expectations;
                    and, as always happens in unequal associations, whatever unlucky prank was
                    played was imputed to Cave. When any mischief, great or small, was done, though
                    perhaps others boasted of the stratagem when it was successful, yet upon
                    detection or miscarriage, the blame was certain to fall upon poor Cave. The
                    harsh treatment he experienced on this account, although he bore it for a time,
                    forced him at last to leave the school and abandon the hope of a literary
                    education, in order to seek some other means of gaining a livelihood.</p>
                <p>He was first placed under a collector of the excise; but the insolence of his
                    mistress, who employed him in servile drudgery, quickly disgusted him, and he
                    went up to London in quest of more suitable employment. He was recommended to a
                    timber merchant at the Bankside, and, while he was there on trial, is said to
                    have given promise of great mercantile abilities; but this place he soon quitted
                    and was bound apprentice to Mr Collins, a printer of some reputation, and
                    deputy-alderman. This was a trade for which men were formerly qualified by a
                    literary education, and which was pleasing to Cave, because it furnished some
                    employment for his scholastic attainments. Here, therefore, he resolved to
                    settle, though his master and mistress lived in perpetual discord, and their
                    house was therefore no comfortable habitation. From the inconveniences of these
                    domestic tumults he was soon released, having in two years attained so much
                    skill in his art, and gained so much the confidence of his master, that he was
                    sent without any superintendent to conduct a printing-house at Norwich, and
                    publish a weekly paper. In this undertaking he met with some opposition, which
                    produced a public controversy, and procured young Cave the reputation of a
                    writer.</p>
                <p>His master died before his apprenticeship had expired, and he was not able to
                    bear the perverseness of his mistress; he therefore quitted her house upon a
                    stipulated allowance, and married a young widow, with whom he had lived at Bow.
                    When his apprenticeship terminated he worked as a journeyman at the
                    printing-house of Mr Barbar, a man much distinguished and employed by the
                    Tories, whose principles had at that time so much influence with Cave, that he
                    was for some years a writer in Mist’s Journal. He afterwards obtained by his
                    wife’s interest a small place in the post-office; but he still continued, during
                    the intervals of attendance, to exercise his trade, or to employ himself in some
                    typographical business. He corrected the <hi rend="italic">Gradus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Parnassum,</hi> and was liberally
                    rewarded by the Company of Stationers. He wrote an Account of the Criminals,
                    which had for some time a considerable sale; and published many little pamphlets
                    which accident brought into his hands, of which it would be difficult to recover
                    the titles. By the correspondence which his place in the post-office
                    facilitated, he procured country newspapers, and sold their intelligence to a
                    journalist in London for a guinea a week. He was afterwards raised to the office
                    of clerk of the franks, in which he acted with great spirit and firmness, and
                    often stopped franks which had been given by members of parliament to their
                    friends, because he thought such extension of a peculiar right illegal. This
                    raised many complaints; and the influence which was exerted against him procured
                    his ejectment from office. He had now, however, collected a sum sufficient for
                    the purchase of a small printing-office, and began the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gentleman</hi><hi rend="italic">s</hi><hi rend="italic">Magazine</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> an undertaking to which lie owed the affluence in which he
                    passed the last twenty years of his life, and the large fortune which he left
                    behind him. When he formed the project he was far from expecting the success
                    which he met with; and others had so little prospect of such a result, that
                    though he had for several years talked of his plan among printers and
                    booksellers, none of them thought it worth the trial. That they were not, says
                    Dr Johnson, restrained by their virtue from the execution of another man’s
                    design, was sufficiently apparent as soon as that design began to be gainful;
                    for in a few years a multitude of magazines arose and perished; and the London
                    Magazine, supported by a powerful association of booksellers, and circulated
                    with all the art and all the cunning of trade, alone exempted itself from the
                    general fate of Cave’s invaders, and obtained a considerable, though by no means
                    an equal sale.</p>
                <p>Cave now began to aspire to popularity; and being a great lover of poetry, he
                    sometimes proposed subjects for poems, and offered prizes for the best
                    productions which might be thus elicited. The first prize was fifty pounds, for
                    which, being but newly acquainted with wealth, and thinking the influence of
                    fifty pounds extremely great, he expected the first authors of the kingdom to
                    appear as competitors, and accordingly offered the allotment of the prize to the
                    universities. But when the time of decision arrived, no name appeared in the
                    list of writers that had ever been seen before; while the universities and
                    several private individuals declined the task of awarding the prize. The
                    determination was then left to Dr Cromwell Mortimer and Dr Birch; and by the
                    latter the award was made, which may be seen in <hi rend="italic">Gent.
                    Mag.</hi> vol. vi. p. 59.</p>
                <p>Mr Cave continued to improve his magazine, and had the satisfaction of seeing its
                    success proportionate to his diligence, till 1751, when his wife died of an
                    asthma. He seemed at first not much affected by her death; but in a few days he
                    became feverish, and lost his appetite, which he never afterwards recovered.
                    After having lingered for about two years, experiencing many vicissitudes of
                    amendment and relapse, he was seized with a diarrhoea by drinking acid liquors;
                    and afterwards falling into a kind of lethargic insensibility, he died on the
                    10th of January 1754, having just concluded the twenty-third annual collection
                    of his magazine.</p>
