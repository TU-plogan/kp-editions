                <p><label type="entry">CARMELITES</label>, an order of religious persons, making one
                    of the four tribes of mendicants or begging friars, and taking its name from
                    Mount Carmel, formerly inhabited by Elias, Elisha, and the children of the
                    prophets, from whom this order pretends to be derived in an uninterrupted
                    succession. The manner in which they make out their antiquity has something in
                    it too ridiculous to be rehearsed. Some among them allege they are descendants
                    of Jesus Christ; others go farther, and make Pythagoras a Carmelite, and the
                    ancient druids regular branches of their order. But Phocos, a Greek monk, speaks
                    the most rationally on the subject. He says, that in his time, 1185, Elias’s
                    cave was still extant on the mountain, near which were the remains of a building
                    which intimated that there had anciently been a monastery; and that some years
                    before, an old monk, a priest of Calabria, by revelation, as he pretended, from
                    the prophet Elias, had fixed there, and assembled ten brothers. In 1209 Albert,
                    patriarch of Jerusalem, gave the solitaries a rigid rule, which Papebroch
                    afterwards printed. In 1217, or, according to others, in 1226, Pope Honorius
                    III. approved and confirmed it. This rule contained sixteen articles, one of
                    which confined them to their cells, and enjoined them to continue day and night
                    in prayer; another prohibited the brethren from having any property; another
                    enjoined fasting from the feast of the holy cross till Easter, except on
                    Sundays; abstinence at all times from flesh was enjoined by another article; one
                    obliged them to manual labour, another imposed on them a strict silence from
                    vespers till the tierce the next <hi rend="superscript"> da</hi> y∙</p>
                <p>The peace concluded by the Emperor Frederic II. with the Saracens in the year
                    1229, a peace so disadvantageous to Christendom and so beneficial to the
                    infidels, occasioned the Carmelites to quit the Holy Land under Alan the fifth
                    general of the order. He first sent some of the religious to Cyprus, who landed
                    there in the year 1328, and founded a monastery in the forest of Fortania. Some
                    Sicilians leaving Mount Carmel at the same time, returned to their own country,
                    where they founded a monastery in the suburbs of Messina. Several English
                    departed from Syria in the year 1240, in order to found others in England.
                    Others of Provence, in the year 1244, founded a monastery in the desert of
                    Aigualates, about a league from Marseilles<pb break="no" facs="nls:193348914"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-8914-0147"/>; and thus the number of their monasteries
                    increasing, they held their European general chapter in the year 1245, at their
                    monastery at Aylesford in England. This order afterwards increased so much, that
                    it had thirty-eight provinces, besides the congregation of Mantua, in which were
                    fifty-four monasteries, under a vicar-general; and the congregations of
                    Barefooted Carmelites in Italy and Spain, which had their peculiar general.</p>
                <p>After theestablishmentof the Carmelites in Europe, their rule was in some
                    respects altered. Pope InnocentIV. added to the first article a precept of
                    chastity, and relaxed the 11 th, which enjoins abstinence at all times from
                    flesh, permitting them, when they travelled, to eat boiled flesh. This pope
                    likewise gave them leave to eat in a common refectory, and to keep asses or
                    mules for their use. Their rule was again mitigated by the popes Eugenius IV.
                    and Pius II. Hence the order is divided into two branches, viz. <hi
                    rend="italic">the Carmelites of the ancient observance,</hi> called the <hi
                    rend="italic">moderate</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mitigated</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and those <hi rend="italic">of the strict observance,</hi> who are the
                    <hi rend="italic">barefooted Carmelites;</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> a reform
                    set on foot in 1548 by S. Theresa, a nun of the convent of Avila, in Castile.
                    These last are divided into two congregations, that of Spain and that of
                    Italy.</p>
                <p>The habit of the Carmelites was at first white, and the cloak was laced at the
                    bottom with several lists. But Pope Honorius IV. commanded them to change it for
                    that of Minims. Their scapulary is a small woollen habit, of a brown colour,
                    thrown over their shoulders. They wear no linen shirts, but instead of them
                    linsey-woolsey, which they change twice a week in the summer, and once a week in
                    the winter.</p>
                <p>If a monk of this order lies with a woman, he is prohibited saying mass for three
                    or four years, is declared infamous, and obliged to discipline himself publicly
                    once a week. If he is again guilty of the same fault, his penance is doubled;
                    and if a third time, he is expelled the order.</p>
