                <p><label type="entry">CASTI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Giambattista</hi></label>, an
                    Italian poet, was born of humble parents in the year 1721, at Montefiascone, a
                    small town in the States of the Church. It was there, too, that he commenced his
                    studies, in which he made such rapid progress that he was appointed in early
                    youth a professor of Greek and Latin in an academy of his native town; an
                    employment which peculiarly directed his attention to classical poetry and
                    literature. He soon, however, quitted this obscure situation, and repaired to
                    Rome in search of more noble examples of emulation, and a higher recompense of
                    public esteem, than his birth-place afforded him. His learning, acuteness, and
                    agreeable disposition, recommended him to the notice and friendship of the most
                    eminent individuals of that capital. He was admitted a member of the academy <hi
                    rend="italic">Degli</hi><hi rend="italic">Arcadi</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and it is believed he might easily have risen from a canonship in the cathedral
                    of Montefiascone, which he had already obtained, to the enjoyment of much higher
                    church benefices, had such been the chief objects of his ambition. But his love
                    of freedom, and his restless inclination for travelling, which appears to have
                    been characteristic of all the literary men of Italy, interfered with his
                    ecclesiastical preferment. He gladly accepted the invitation of Prince Rosenberg
                    (tutor to the Grand Duke Leopold), with whom he had become acquainted at
                    Florence, to accompany him to Vienna, where he was presented to the Emperor
                    Joseph. After this introduction, he visited almost all the capitals of Europe,
                    from Petersburg to Lisbon, and from Constantinople to Stockholm, directing his
                    particular attention to the manners and civil institutions of the various
                    countries through which he passed. On his return to Vienna he was appointed <hi
                    rend="italic">Poeta</hi><hi rend="italic">Cesario</hi> or poet-laureate, in the
                    room of Metastasio; a situation which he held till some time after the death of
                    the Emperor Leopold, when he resigned it, and retired to Florence in 1796.
                    During two years’ residence in that city, he composed a great number of his
                    works. At the end of that period he went to live in Paris; and though now far
                    advanced in life, neither his habitual gaiety nor the ardour of literary
                    composition were in any degree abated. Scarcely a day passed in which he did not
                    add something to his principal poem <hi rend="italic">Gli</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Animali Parianti,</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193349967"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-9967-0228"/>or write one of his poetical novels. At the same
                    time he delighted the society with which he lived by the unceasing liveliness of
                    his conversation, which was rendered highly entertaining and interesting by his
                    knowledge of the world, and the extensive opportunities he had possessed of
                    observing the manners and characters of mankind. Though in 1803 he had passed
                    the age of eighty-two, the strength both of his mind and body still afforded the
                    promise of a yet longer life; but he died during this year, in consequence of
                    having caught a severe cold in returning home at a late hour from a house where
                    he had spent the evening. His funeral was attended by a great concourse of
                    French and Italians, distinguished by literary eminence; and an eloquent funeral
                    oration was pronounced on this occasion, by Corona, an Italian physician.</p>
                <p>The chief work of Casti is <hi rend="italic">Gli</hi><hi rend="italic">Animali
                    Parianti, Poema Epico Diviso</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >XXVI. Canti.</hi> In 1792 and 1793 the French revolution had attracted the
                    attention and speculations of all Europe, and had introduced comparisons between
                    new theories of government and ancient institutions. The rage of innovation, and
                    dislike of established forms, having infected the minds of so large a proportion
                    of the community, Casti resolved to exhibit, though under an allegorical veil,
                    what he conceived to be the predominant feelings of the multitude, their avowed
                    hopes, and secret designs. With this view, as he himself has expressed it in his
                    preface, “he contrived a grand apologue, divided into parts, and forming a
                    continued poem, in which animals being introduced as speakers and actors, a
                    complete political story might be exhibited, exposing the defects of various
                    political systems, and the absurdity of many institutions which had been from
                    timeto time adopted.” Near the commencement of this apologue the beasts assemble
                    to choose a king, and, after a good deal of intrigue and various harangues, the
                    lion is elected. On his death, the folly of the lioness regent, and perversity
                    of the royal cub, excite murmurs, cabals, and at length a successful
                    insurrection, which is headed by the dog. By thus assigning to animals human
                    speech and passions, the author has very happily parodied the usual appearances
                    and events of political revolutions in general, but often with some allusion to
                    the political events of the day, to the characters of the reigning princes of
                    Europe, and to that most portentous of all revolutions, the consequences of
                    which at the time occupied so large a portion of the thoughts of mankind.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, we find that in this work Casti has portrayed and satirized the
                    hypocrisy so often mixed in political pretensions; the secret ambition of
                    leaders who alternately supplant and succeed each other; the intolerance of
                    cabals and parties, who proscribe all who have not ranged themselves under their
                    banners, and who regard the maxims which happen to be then in vogue as fixed and
                    immutable principles. He has represented with peculiar felicity the democratic
                    declamations of the dog once so loyal, the aristocratic surliness of the bear,
                    the simple good-nature of Lion I., and the caprices of his cub Lion II., who is
                    obviously intended for a late czar of Muscovy. It must, however, be confessed,
                    that the pleasantry of an apologue of twenty-six cantos, each of about 600
                    lines, is too much prolonged; and the too frequent negligence of the style, with
                    the repetition of trivial and obvious morals, like those at the bottom of the
                    page in the English <hi rend="italic">Aesops Fables,</hi> do not aid in
                    sustaining the curiosity or interest.</p>
                <p>This work of Casti, which raised him to a very high rank among the modern poets
                    of his country, was begun at Vienna in 1794. His situation, however, as
                    poet-laureate, was unfavourable to the freedom of political satire, and this
                    obstacle to his favourite pursuit may have been one inducement to his
                    resignation of that office. After his retirement, the poem was continued at
                    Florence without interruption, and completed at Paris, where it was published in
                    1802, in 3 vols. 8vo; an impression which has been followed by various editions
                    in Italy. It was translated into French, Spanish, and German, and we have also
                    seen a free and abridged English version, executed with considerable vivacity
                    and spirit. To most of the Italian editions four apologues have been added; but
                    these have no relation to the subject of the <hi rend="italic">Animali</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Parlanti.</hi> One of them, entitled <hi rend="italic">Della Gatta
                    e del Topo,</hi> written, we believe, before the author was poet-laureate, and
                    published certainly after he had resigned that situation, is supposed to portray
                    those sinister events which clouded the prospects of aggrandizement anticipated
                    by Joseph from his formidable league with Russia against the Turks.</p>
                <p>Casti having completed his great work of the <hi rend="italic">Anirnali</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Parianti,</hi> anew directed his attention to the composition and
                    publication of poetical novels. As far back as the year 1778 he had written
                    eighteen of these <hi rend="italic">Novelle Culanti,</hi> but his poetical
                    avocations at the imperial court had interrupted his progress; and meanwhile
                    those which he had composed were surreptitiously printed, both in Italy and
                    France, in a manner so inaccurate, and so much altered from the way in which
                    they had been originally written, that they could scarcely be recognised by the
                    author, as we learn from the <hi rend="italic">Protesta dell Autore.</hi></p>

                <p>Some, too, as <hi rend="italic">La Bella Circassa,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">La
                    Figlia che non ha Giudizio,</hi> which were not written by Casti, were added to
                    these surreptitious publications:</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> Saran belle e leggiadre poesie, </l>
                    <l part="N"> Tutto quel che si vuol; ma non son mie. </l>
                </lg>
                <p>In these circumstances, the injured poet assiduously prepared himself to enlarge
                    the number of his novels, and to collect the whole in an edition which might be
                    printed under his own immediate superintendence. He was prevented, however, by
                    his sudden death; but his novels, which, at the period of his decease, amounted
                    to forty-eight, were published by one of his Parisian friends, in 3 vols. 8vo,
                    1804, accompanied by a prefatory memoir of the author. The practice of
                    tale-writing, which commenced with the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cento</hi><hi rend="italic">Novelle</hi><hi rend="italic">Anticlie,</hi> and
                    was brought to such perfection by Boccaccio, had prevailed in Italy for nearly
                    five hundred years before the age of Casti. The Italian novelists invariably
                    copied from each other, and from those inexhaustible stores of fiction, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fabliaux</hi> of the Trouveurs. But the merit of Casti does not
                    consist in the invention of his stories, all of which are borrowed, but in being
                    the first among his countrymen who has clothed these tales in a poetical garb.
                    His novels are founded either on mythological stories, or on preceding Italian
                    tales. To the first class belong <hi rend="italic">Aurora,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >E Origine</hi><hi rend="italic">di Homa, Diana ed Endimione, Pľometeo e
                    Pandora.</hi> Almost all the rest are poetical versions from Boccaccio,
                    Mas-succio di Salerno, and other Italian novelists. The longest, <hi
                    rend="italic">La Papessa,</hi> which is divided into three parts, is founded on
                    the old story of Pope Joan. These tales are much admired by the Italians for
                    purity of language and harmony of versification, and they contain many ingenious
                    and sarcastic reflections on the hypocrisy, errors, and vices of men in every
                    age and condition of life. They are disfigured, however, by an unpardonable
                    licentiousness, which is carried much farther than that of almost any of the
                    prior novelists of Italy. Some of them also terminate rather flatly, and the
                    octave stanza, in which they are all written, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193349980" xml:id="kp-eb0706-9980-0229"/>and which has a certain
                    degree of heaviness, even in the hands of Ariosto and Berni, is ill adapted to
                    the gaiety and levity of the lightest of all species of composition. One cannot
                    mention the tales of Casti without being naturally led to compare them with
                    those of Fontaine, which are founded on similar originals, and written in
                    something of the same spirit. But, if there be more asperity and caustic
                    raillery in Casti, he is infinitely inferior to the French poet in case,
                    naivete, and grace. The language in which he was obliged to write, whatever may
                    be its other excellencies, is less expressive of playfulness than the French;
                    and the octave stanza, which he unfortunately chose, is not susceptible of the
                    buoyancy and lightness of Fontaine’s versification.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Animali Parianti</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Novelle</hi> are the best known and most popular works of Casti; but he is also
                    author of the <hi rend="italic">Poema</hi><hi rend="italic">Tartaro,</hi> a
                    satiric poem, in twelve cantos, on the court of Catherine II. The scene of
                    action, however, is laid in Asia, and all the names are fictitious. Russia is
                    called Mogollia; St Petersburg, Caracora; the Empress, Cattuna; the Grand Duke
                    Paul, afterwards Czar, Cajucco; Orloff, Cuslucco; and Potemkin, Toto Toctabei.
                    The first sketch of this mock heroic poem was made by the author during his
                    visit to St Petersburg, in the train of Count Kaunitz, the Austrian ambassador.
                    On his return to Vienna, the Emperor Joseph having manifested a desire to hear
                    it read, Casti new-modelled the composition, struck out whatever might be likely
                    to prove offensive to crowned heads in general, and inserted a complimentary
                    episode on the celebrated journey of his imperial patron into the Crimea.
                    Notwithstanding the approbation which his poem met with from the Austrian court,
                    Casti would not probably have published it during the life of the heroine; but
                    numerous manuscripts of it having been circulated, some of them found their way
                    to Italy, where it was repeatedly but very incorrectly printed, none of the
                    impressions having ever been subjected to the revisal of the author.</p>
                <p>In his capacity of poet-laureate, it was the duty of Casti to provide new
                    dramatic entertainments at stated occasions and periods. The court and public of
                    Vienna had probably grown weary, in the course of half a century, of the elegant
                    moral monotony of Metastasio; and Casti, whose genius was diametrically opposite
                    to that of his predecessor, could not have vied with him in the grand or serious
                    opera. He therefore resolved to excite the mirth of the spectators by the
                    revival of the <hi rend="italic">Opera Buffa,</hi> in which he obtained great
                    success. One of his productions in this line, entitled <hi rend="italic">La
                    Grata di Trofonio,</hi> is intended to ridicule the pretensions of false
                    philosophers. The subject of another, <hi rend="italic">Il lie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Teodora</hi><hi rend="italic">in Venezia,</hi> suggested by an
                    episode in Voltaire’s <hi rend="italic">Candide,</hi> was assigned to him by the
                    emperor himself, who is said to have been much entertained with the lines</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> Senza soldi e senza regno </l>

                </lg>
                <p>A third burlesque opera, of which Cicero is the principal character, is founded
                    on the plot of Catiline. Here the characters of the Roman senators and
                    conspirators, with the orations against Catiline, are so parodied as to produce
                    something of the same effect as our mock tragedies, or the ancient satiric drama
                    of the Greeks.</p>
                <p>On the whole, although neither the novel nor the apologue was by any means a new
                    species of composition among the Italians, yet Casti may be regarded as an
