                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">CARDINAL</label>, in a general sense, an appellation given to
                    things on account of their pre-eminence. The word is formed of the Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">cardo,</hi> a hinge; it being on these fundamental points that all
                    the rest of the same kind are supposed to turn. Thus, justice, prudence,
                    temperance, and fortitude, are denominated the four <hi rend="italic">cardinal
                    virtues,</hi> as being the basis of all the rest.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Cardinal</hi><hi rend="italic">Points,</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">Cosmography,</hi> are the four intersections of the horizon with
                    the meridian and the prime vertical circle. Of these, two, namely, the
                    intersections of the horizon and meridian, are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >North</hi> and <hi rend="italic">South,</hi> with regard to the poles they are
                    directed to. The other two, viz. the intersections of the horizon and first
                    vertical, are called <hi rend="italic">East</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >West.</hi></p>
                <p>The cardinal points, therefore, coincide with the four cardinal regions of the
                    heavens, and are 90° distant from each other. The intermediate points are called
                    <hi rend="italic">collateral points.</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cardinal,</hi> an ecclesiastical prince in the Romish
                    church, being one who has a voice in the conclave at the election of a pope.
                    Some say that the cardinals were so called from the Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >incardinatio,</hi> which signifies the adoption in any church of a priest of a
                    foreign church, driven thence by misfortune; and that the use of the word
                    commenced at Rome and Ravenna, which, as the revenues of the churches of those
                    cities were very great, became the common refuge of the unhappy priests of all
                    other churches.</p>
                <p>The cardinals compose the pope’s council or senate. In the Vatican there is a
                    constitution of Pope John, which regulates the rights and titles of the <hi
                    rend="italic">cardinals,</hi> and declares, that as the pope represents Moses,
                    so the cardinals represent the seventy elders, who, under the pontifical
                    authority, decide private and particular differences.</p>
                <p>Cardinals, in their first institution, were only the principal priests, or
                    incumbents, of the parishes of Rome. In the primitive church the chief priest of
                    a parish, who immediately followed the bishop, was called <hi rend="italic"
                    >presbyter</hi><hi rend="italic">cardinalis,</hi> to distinguish him from the
                    other petty priests, who had no church or preferment. The term seems to have
                    been first applied to them in the year 150; but some say that this took place
                    under Pope Silvester, in the year 300. These cardinal priests were alone allowed
                    to baptize and administer the cucharist. When the cardinal priests became
                    bishops, their cardinalate became vacant, as they were then supposed to be
                    raised to a higher dignity. Under Pope Gregory, cardinal priests and cardinal
                    deacons were only such priests and deacons as had a church or chapel under their
                    particular care; and this was the original use of the word. Leo IV. in the
                    council of Rome held in 853, calls them <hi rend="italic">presbyteros sui
                    cardinis;</hi> and their churches, <hi rend="italic">parochias
                    cardinales.</hi></p>
                <p>The cardinals continued on this footing till the eleventh century; but as the
                    grandeur and state of his holiness then became exceedingly augmented, he wished
                    his council of cardinals to make a better figure than the ancient priests had
                    done. It is true that they still preserved their ancient title, but the thing
                    expressed by it ceased to exist. It was a long time, however, before they had
                    the precedence over the bishops, or got the election of the pope into their
                    hands; but when they once became possessed of those privileges, they soon got
                    the red hat and purple; and growing still in authority, they became at length
                    superior to the bishops, by the sole quality of being cardinals.</p>
                <p>Du Cange observes, that there were originally three kinds of churches; the first
                    or genuine churches were properly called <hi rend="italic">parishes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> the second, which were chapels joined to hospitals, and
                    served by deacons, were denomi- <pb break="no" facs="nls:193348810"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-8810-0139"/><hi rend="italic">nateà deaconries</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> the third were simple <hi rend="italic">oratones,</hi>
                    where private masses were said, and were served by local and resident chaplains.
                    He adds, that to distinguish the principal or parish churches from the chapels
                    and oratories, the name <hi rend="italic">cardinales</hi> was given to them.
                    Accordingly, parish churches gave titles to cardinal priests; and some chapels
                    also, at length, gave the title of <hi rend="italic">cardinal deacons.</hi></p>
                <p>Others observe, that the term <hi rend="italic">cardinal</hi> was given not only
                    to priests, but also to bishops and deacons who were attached to certain
                    churches, to distinguish them from those who only served them <hi rend="italic"
                    >en</hi><hi rend="italic">passant,</hi> and by commission. Titular churches, or
                    benefices, were a kind of parishes, or churches, assigned each to a cardinal
                    priest, with some stated district depending on it, and a font for administering
                    of baptism, in cases where the bishop himself could not administer it. These
                    cardinals were subordinate to the bishops; and accordingly, in councils,
                    particularly that held at Rome in 868, subscribed after them.</p>
                <p>It was not, however, only at Rome that priests bore this name; for we find that
                    there were cardinal priests in France. Thus, the curate of the parish of St John
                    de Vignes is called in old charters the <hi rend="italic">cardinal priest</hi>
                    of that parish.</p>
                <p>The title of <hi rend="italic">cardinal</hi> is also given to'some bishops, <hi
                    rend="italic">quatenus</hi> bishops, as, for instance, to those of Mentz and
                    Milan. The Archbishop of Bourges is also, in ancient writings, called <hi
                    rend="italic">cardinal;</hi> and the church of Bourges a <hi rend="italic"
                    >cardinal church.</hi> The abbot of Vendome used to style himself <hi
                    rend="italic">cardinalis</hi><hi rend="italic">natus.</hi></p>
                <p>The cardinals arc divided into three classes or orders, containing six bishops,
                    fifty priests, and fourteen deacons, and making in all seventy, who constitute
                    what is called the <hi rend="italic">sacred college.</hi> The cardinal bishops,
                    who are as it were the pope’s vicars, bear the titles of the bishoprics assigned
                    to them, and the rest take such titles as are given them. The number of cardinal
                    bishops has been fixed, but that of cardinal priests and deacons, and
                    consequently the sacred college itself, is always fluctuating. Till the year
                    1125 the college consisted of fifty-two or fifty-three, and the council of
                    Constance reduced them to twenty-four; but Sixtus IV. without any regard to that
                    restriction, raised them again to fifty-three, and Leo to sixty-five. Thus, as
                    the number of cardinal priests was anciently fixed at twenty-eight, new titles
                    were to be established, in proportion as new cardinals were created. As for the
                    cardinal deacons, they were originally no more than seven for the fourteen
                    quarters of Rome; but they were afterwards increased to nineteen, and at a
                    subsequent period were again diminished.</p>
                <p>According to Onuphrius, it was Pope Pius IV. who first enacted, in 1562, that the
                    pope should be chosen only by the senate of cardinals, whereas till that time
                    the election was by all the clergy of Rome. Some say the election of the pope
                    rested in the cardinals, exclusively of the clergy, in the time of Alexander
                    III. in 1160. Others go higher still, and affirm that Nicholas II. having been
                    elected at· Sienna, in 1058, by the cardinals alone, occasioned the right of
                    election to be taken from the clergy and people of Rome, leaving them only that
                    of confirming him by their consent, which was at length, however, taken from
                    them. (See his decree for this purpose, issued in the Roman council of 1059, in
                    Hardouin’s <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi><hi rend="italic">Conciliorum,</hi> tom.
                    vi. part i. p. 1165.) It appears, indeed, that the cardinals who had the right
                    of suffrage in the election of his successors, were divided by this pontiff into
                    <hi rend="italic">cardinal bishops</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cardinal
                    clerks,</hi> meaning by the former the seven bishops who belonged to the city
                    and territory of Rome, and by the latter the <hi rend="italic">cardinal
                    presbyters,</hi> or ministers of the twenty-eight Roman parishes or principal
                    churches. To these were added, in process of time, under Alexander III. and
                    other pontiffs, new members, in orde r to appease the tumults occasioned by the
                    edict of Nicholas II.</p>
                <p>At the creation of a new cardinal, the pope performs the ceremony of opening and
                    shutting his mouth, which is done in a private consistory. The shutting his
                    mouth implies the depriving him of the liberty of giving his opinion in
                    congregations; and the opening his mouth, which is performed fifteen days after,
                    signifies the taking off this restraint. However, if the pope happens to die
                    during the time a cardinal’s mouth is shut, he can neither give his voice in the
                    election of a new pope, nor be himself advanced to that dignity.</p>
                <p>The dress of a cardinal is a red soutanne, a rocket, a short purple mantle, and a
                    red hat. The cardinals began to wear the red hat at the council of Lyons in
                    1243. The decree of Pope Urban VIII., by which it is appointed that the
                    cardinals be addressed by the title of <hi rend="italic">eminence,</hi> is of
                    the year 1630; till then they were called <hi rend="italic"
                    >illustrissimi.</hi></p>
                <p>When cardinals are sent to the courts of princes, it is in quality of legates <hi
                    rend="italic">α latere;</hi> and when they are appointed governors of towns,
                    their government is called by the name of <hi rend="italic">legation.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cardinal</hi> has also been applied to secular officers. Thus
                    the prime ministers in the court of the Emperor Theodosius were called <hi
                    rend="italic">cardinales.</hi> Cassiodorus, lib. vii. formul. 31, makes mention
                    of the cardinal prince of the city of Rome; and in the list of officers of the
                    Duke of Bretagne, in 1447, we meet with one Raoul de Thorel, cardinal of
                    Quillart, chancellor, and servant of the Viscount de Rohan, which shows it to
                    have been an inferior quality.</p>
