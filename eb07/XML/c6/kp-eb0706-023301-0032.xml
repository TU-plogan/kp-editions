                <p><label type="entry">CASTLE</label>, a fortress or place rendered defensible
                    either by nature or art. It frequently signifies with us the principal mansion
                    of a nobleman. In the time of Henry II. there was no less than 1115 castles in
                    England, each of which contained a manor.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Castles,</hi> walled with stone, and designed for residence
                    as well as defence, are for the most part, according to Mr Grose, of no higher
                    antiquity than the conquest; for although the Saxons, Romans, and even,
                    according to some writers on antiquity, the ancient Britons, had castles built
                    of stone, yet these were both few in number, and, at that period, through
                    neglect or invasions, either destroyed or so much decayed that little more than
                    their ruins remained. This is asserted by many of our historians and
                    antiquaries, and assigned as a reason for the facility with which William the
                    Norman made himself master of this country.</p>
                <p>This circumstance was not overlooked by so good a general as the conqueror; who,
                    in order effectually to guard against invasions from without, as well as to awe
                    his newly-acquired subjects, immediately began to erect castles all over the
                    kingdom, and likewise to repair and augment the old ones. Besides, as he had
                    parcelled out the lands of the English amongst his followers, they, to protect
                    themselves from the resentment of the despoiled natives, built strongholds and
                    castles on their estates. This caused a considerable increase of these
                    fortresses; and the turbulent and unsettled state of the kingdom in the
                    succeeding reigns served to multiply them prodigiously, every baron or leader of
                    a party building a castle; insomuch that towards the latter end of the reign of
                    King Stephen they amounted to the almost incredible number of 1115.</p>
                <p>As the feudal system gathered strength, these castles became the heads of
                    baronies. Each castle was a manor; and its castellan, owner, or governor, the
                    lord of that manor. Markets and fairs were directed to be held there; not only
                    to prevent frauds in the king’s duties or customs, but also as these were
                    esteemed places where the laws of the land were observed, and as such had a very
                    particular privilege. But this good order did not last long; for the lords of
                    castles began to arrogate to themselves a royal power, not only within their
                    castles, but likewise in their environs; exercising judicature both civil and
                    criminal, coining money, and arbitrarily seizing forage and provisions for the
                    subsistence of their garrisons, which they afterwards demanded as a right. At
                    length their insolence and oppression grew to such a pitch, that, according to
                    William of Newbury, “there were in England as many kings, or rather tyrants, as
                    lords of castles and Matthew Paris emphatically styles them nests of devils and
                    dens of thieves. Castles were not solely in the possession of the crown and the
                    lay barons, but even bishops had such fortresses; though it seems to have been
                    contrary to the canons, from a plea made use of in a general council in favour
                    of King Stephen, who had seized upon the strong castles of the Bishops of
                    Lincoln and Salisbury. This prohibition, if such existed, was, however, very
                    little regarded; and in the following reigns many strong places were held, and
                    even defended, by the ecclesiastics; nor was greater obedience afterwards paid
                    to a decree made by the pope at Viterbo, on the fifth of the kalends of June
                    1220, in which it was ordained that no person in England should keep in his
                    hands more than two of the king’s castles.</p>
                <p>The licentious behaviour of the garrisons of these places having become
                    intolerable, it was agreed, in the treaty between King Stephen and Henry II.
                    when only Duke of Normandy, that all the castles built within a certain period
                    should be demolished; in consequence of which many were actually rased, but not
                    the number stipulated.</p>
                <p>The few castles in being under the Saxon government were probably, on occasions
                    of war or invasion, garrisoned by the national militia, and at other times
                    slightly guarded by the domestics of the princes or great personages who resided
                    in them; but after the conquest, when all the estates were converted into
                    baronies held by knight’s service, castle-guard, coming under that denomination,
                    was among the duties to which particular tenants were made liable. From these
                    services the bishops and abbots, who till the time of the Normans had held their
                    lands in frank almoign, or free alms, were, by this new regulation, not
                    exempted; they were not, however, like the laity, obliged to render personal
                    service, it being sufficient that they provided fit and able persons to
                    officiate in their stead. This was at first stoutly opposed by Anselm,
                    archbishop of Canterbury, who being obliged to find some knights to attend King
                    William Rufus in his wars in Wales, complained of it as an innovation and
                    infringement of the rights and immunities of the church.</p>
                <p>It was no uncommon thing for the conqueror and the kings of those days to grant
                    estates to men of approved fidelity and valour, on condition that they should
                    perform castle-guard in the royal castles, with a certain number of men, for
                    some specified time; and sometimes they were likewise bound by their tenures to
                    keep in repair and guard some particular tower or bulwark, as was the case at
                    Dover Castle.</p>
                <p>In process of time these services were commuted for annual-rents, sometimes
                    styled <hi rend="italic">wardpenny,</hi> and waytſee, but commonly <hi
                    rend="italic">castle-guard</hi> rents, payable on fixed days, under prodigious
                    penalties called <hi rend="italic">sursizes.</hi> At Rochester, if a man failed
                    in the payment of his rent of castle-guard on the feast of St Andrew, his debt
                    was doubled every tide during the time for which the payment was delayed. These
                    were afterwards restrained by an act of parliament made in the reign of King
                    Henry VIII. and finally annihilated, with the tenures by knight’s service, in
                    the time of Charles II. Such castles as were private property were guarded
                    either by mercenary soldiers, or by the tenants of the lord or owner.</p>
                <p>Castles which belonged to the crown, or fell to it either by forfeiture or
                    escheat, circumstances that frequently happened in the distracted reigns of the
                    feudal times, were generally committed to the custody of some trusty person, who
                    seems to have been indifferently styled governor and constable. Sometimes also
                    they were put into the possession of the sheriff of the county, who often
                    converted them into prisons. That officer was then accountable at the exchequer
                    for the farm or produce of the lands belonging to the places intrusted to his
                    care, as well as for all other profits; and he was likewise, in case of war or
                    invasion, obliged to victual and furnish them with munitions out of the issues
                    of his county, to which he was directed by writ of privy seal.</p>

                <p>The materials of which castles were built varied according to the places of their
                    erection; but the manner of their construction seems to have been pretty
                    uniform. The outside of the walls was generally built of the stones nearest at
                    hand, laid as regularly as their shapes would admit; and the interior was filled
                    up with the like materials, mixed with a great quantity of fluid mortar, which
                    was called by the-workmen grout-work.</p>
                <p>The general shape or plan of these castles depended entirely on the caprice of
                    the architects, or the form of the ground intended to be occupied; neither do
                    they seem to have confined themselves to any particular figure in their towers;
                    square, round, and polygonal oftentimes occurring in the original parts of the
                    same building.</p>
                <p>The situation of the castles of the Anglo-Norman kings and barons was most
                    commonly on an eminence, and near a river; a situation on several accounts
                    eligible. The whole site of the castle, which was frequently of great extent and
                    irregular figure, was surrounded by a deep and broad ditch, sometimes filled
                    with water, and sometimes dry, called the <hi rend="italic">fosse.</hi> Before
                    the great gate was an outwork, called a <hi rend="italic">barhacan</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">anternural,</hi> which was a strong high wall, surmounted with
                    turrets, designed for the defence of the gate and drawbridge. On the inside of
                    the ditch stood the wall of the castle, about eight or ten feet thick and
                    between twenty and thirty feet high, with a parapet, and a kind of embrasures
                    called <hi rend="italic">crcnnels</hi> on the top. On this wall, at proper
                    distances, were built square towers of two or three stories high, which served
                    for lodging some of the principal officers of the proprietor of the castle, and
                    for other purposes; and on the inside were erected lodgings for the common
                    servants or retainers, granaries, storehouses, and other necessary offices. On
                    the top of this wall, and on the flat roofs of these buildings, stood the
                    defenders of the castle, when it was besieged, who thence discharged arrows,
                    darts, and stones on the besiegers. The great gate of the castle stood in the
                    course of this wall, and was strongly fortified with a tower on each side, and
                    rooms over the passage, which was closed with thick folding doors of oak, often
                    plated with iron, and with an iron portcullis or grate let down from above.
                    Within this outward wall was a large open space or court, called, in the largest
                    and most perfect castles, the <hi rend="italic">outer bayle,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">ballium,</hi> in which stood commonly a church or chapel. On the
                    inside of this outer bayle was another ditch, wall, gate, and towers, inclosing
                    the inner bayle or court, within which the chief tower or <hi rend="italic"
                    >keep</hi> was built. This was a large square fabric, four or five stories in
                    height, having small windows in prodigiously thick walls, which rendered the
                    apartments within it dark and gloomy. This great tower was the palace of the
                    prince, prelate, or baron, to w h0m the castle belonged, and the residence of
                    the constable or governor. Under ground were dismal dark vaults, for the
                    confinement of prisoners, and sometimes called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >dungeon</hi> or <hi rend="italic">donjon.</hi> In this building also was the
                    great hall, in which the owner displayed his hospitality, by entertaining his
                    numerous friends and followers. At one end of the great halls of castles,
                    palaces, and monasteries, there was a place raised a little above the rest of
                    the floor, called the <hi rend="italic">dais,</hi> where the chief table stood,
                    at which persons of the highest rank dined. Though there were unquestionably
                    great variations in the structure of castles, yet the most perfect and
                    magnificent of them seem to have been constructed nearly on the plan here
                    described. Such, for example, was the famous castle of Bedford, as appears from
                    the account of the manner in which it was taken by Henry III. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 1224. The castle fell after four assaults. In the
                    first was taken the barhacan; in the second the outer ballia; in the third
                    attack, the wall by the old tower was thrown down by the miners, where, with
                    great danger, they possessed themselves of the inner ballia, through a chink; in
                    the fourth assault the miners set fire to the tower, so that the smoke burst
                    out, and the tower itself was rent so as to show visibly some broad chinks; upon
                    which the enemy surrendered.</p>
                <p>Before the accession of James VI. to the throne of England, the situation of
                    Scotland was such that every baton’s house was more or less fortified, according
                    to the power or consequence of its lord, or according to the situation of the
                    castle. Near Edinburgh or Stirling, where the inhabitants were somewhat polished
                    in their manners, and overawed by the seat of government, no more was necessary
                    than towers capable of resisting the cursory attacks of robbers and thieves, who
                    never durst stop to make a regular investment, but plundered by surprise, and,
                    if repulsed, instantly fled. But, when further removed, as in Perthshire,
                    Inverness-shire, or Aberdeenshire, then it was necessary to be better defended;
                    and the aids of a peel or dungeon, with outer walls, moat, wet ditch, and
                    bar-nakin, were added, to enable the lord of the keep to resist the formidable
                    attack of his powerful adversary. The history of Scotland, so late as the reign
                    of the Stuart family, affords a number of melancholy instances of inveterate
                    feuds among the greater and lesser barons of that period, when every mode of
                    fortification then in use was seldom adequate to the defence of the castle
                    against the storm or blockade of the enraged chieftain. The third kind of
                    fortresses which we meet with in Scotland consists of those situated on the
                    borders of England, or on the sea-coasts of the kingdom, and in the Western
                    Isles, and in very remote places. Many of the old castles in Scotland were
                    situated on an island in a deep lake, or on a peninsula, which, by a broad deep
                    cut, was made an island. This kind of fortress was only accessible in <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> hard frost, or by boats, which were not easily transported
                    by a people destitute of good roads and wheel-carriages. In fact they could only
                    be taken by surprise or blockade, the first of which was difficult, and the
                    second tedious; so that, before the use of artillery, they might be deemed
                    almost impregnable. On this account their situation was very desirable in the
                    inland parts of Scotland. On the seacoasts of Scotland we generally find the
                    strongest and most ancient, as well as the most impregnable castles, since these
                    had to defend themselves from the invasion of the foreign enemy, as well as the
                    attacks of the domestic foe. Thus the barons, whose lands extended to the
                    seacoast, perched, like the eagle, on the most inaccessible rocks that lay
                    within their possessions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Castle,</hi> in ancient writers, denotes a town or village
                    surrounded with a ditch and wall, furnished with towers at intervals, and
                    guarded by a body of troops. The word is originally Latin, <hi rend="italic"
                    >castellum,</hi> a diminutive from <hi rend="italic">castrum. Castellum</hi>
                    seems originally to have signified a smaller fort for a little garrison; though
                    Suetonius uses the word where the fortification was large enough to contain a
                    cohort. The <hi rend="italic">castrlla,</hi> according to Vegetius, were often
                    like towns, built on the borders of the empire, where there w ere constant
                    guards and defences against the enemy. Horsley considers them as much the same
                    with what were otherwise denominated <hi rend="italic">stations.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Castle,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Castle-Steed,</hi> is also an
                    appellation given by the country people in the north to the Roman <hi
                    rend="italic">castella,</hi> as distinguished from the <hi rend="italic">castra
                    stativa,</hi> which they usually call <hi rend="italic">chesters.</hi> Horsley
                    represents this as a useful criterion, by which to discover or distinguish a
                    Roman camp or station. There are several of these castella on Severus’s wall.
