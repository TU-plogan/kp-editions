                <p><label type="entry">CAMUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles Stephen
                    Louis</hi></label>, a mathematician and mechanician, born at Cressy en Brie,
                    near Meaux, the 25th August 1699, son of Stephen Camus, a surgeon of that town,
                    and Margaret Maillard.</p>
                <p>FI is taste for practical mechanics was very early demonstrated by a singular
                    ingenuity in the construction of a variety of little machines, with which he
                    amused himself; and he soon felt so strongly the value of mathematical studies,
                    that he urged his parents to find the means of sending him to a school where he
                    might apply to them. In compliance with his wishes, he was placed, when he was
                    little more than ten years old, at the College de Navarre in Paris; and in two
                    years he acquired knowledge enough to become an instructor of others, and to
                    relieve his friends from all further expense in his education. He was assisted,
                    in the pursuit of the higher departments of the mathematics, by the celebrated
                    Μ. Varignon; and he particularly applied himself to civil and military
                    architecture, and to astronomy.</p>
                <p>1. The first result of his studies that was destined for the public eye, was an
                    essay <hi rend="italic">On the Masts of Ships,</hi> a subject which had been
                    proposed in 1727 as a prize question by the Academy of Sciences. This essay was
                    received with considerable approbation, and was inserted in the second volume of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Collection of Prize Memoirs.</hi> Shortly after, the
                    author was made an adjunct or sub-associate of the academy, in the department of
                    mechanics.</p>
                <p>2. In 1728 he brought forward a memoir on the <hi rend="italic">Living Force</hi>
                    of bodies in motion, in which he concludes, from considering the actions of
                    springs, and other similar powers, that its true measure is the product of the
                    mass into the square of the velocity, as Leibnitz maintained; this product being
                    also proportional to that of the force into the space through which it acts,
                    while the momentum is proportional to the force and the time conjointly. In
                    December 1730 Μ. Camus was appointed professor of geometry to the Academy of
                    Architecture, and a few years afterwards he became secretary to the same
                    body.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Academy</hi> for 1732 contain a short
                    paper on a <hi rend="italic">Problem proposed by Μ. Cramer,</hi> respecting the
                    determination of two curves bearing a particular relation to each other. It was
                    the custom of the age to consider exercises of this sort as trials of strength,
                    to which it was incumbent on all geometricians to submit, for the honour of the
                    countries in which they lived, and of the societies to which they belonged. The
                    author was elevated in 1733 to the rank of an associate of the academy, together
                    with Clairaut, over whom he even obtained some advantage in the ballot.</p>
                <p>4. He communicated to the academy, in the same year, a valuable paper on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Teeth of Wheels.</hi> La Hire had already laid the foundation of
                    the investigation on its true basis, and had pointed out the use of different
                    epicycloidal curves for the forms of the teeth of wheels in different
                    circumstances; and Μ. Camus in this essay enters into some further inquiries,
                    particularly with regard to the best proportions for the length of the teeth,
                    and the comparative diameters of the wheels; a discussion for which his intimate
                    acquaintance with the art of the clock-maker made him particularly well
                    qualified. In 1736 he accompanied Maupertuis and Clairaut in the expedition to
                    Lapland, for the measurement of a degree of the meridian; and he was enabled to
                    render them very essential service, not only as a geometrician and an
                    astronomer, but also by his skill in various departments of the mechanical arts,
                    which became particularly valuable in so remote a situation.</p>
                <p>5. Μ. Camus directed his attention in 1738 to the well known but interesting
                    mechanical phenomenon of a <hi rend="italic">pistol baU piercing an open
                    door</hi> without causing any very sensible motion in the door, and published a
                    paper on the subject in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Academy.</hi> He
                    justly observes, that the effect of any force depends, not only on its
                    magnitude, but also on the time for which it operates; and that though the
                    impulse of the ball must tend to carry the door before it, with a force
                    paramount to the resistance which it opposes to the ball, yet the time of the
                    action of this force is too short to produce a sensible effect on the whole mass
                    of the door. 6. 7. In 1739 he presented to the academy two hydraulic memoirs,
                    the one on <hi rend="italic">Water</hi><hi rend="italic">Sachets,</hi> the other
                    on <hi rend="italic">Pumps.</hi> In the latter he investigates the diameter of a
                    valve capable of transmitting the greatest quantity of water within a given
                    barrel; a valve which is too large not being at liberty to rise to a sufficient
                    height.</p>
                <p>8. He inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> for 1740 a confutation of a
                    <hi rend="italic">Mechanical Fallacy,</hi> which has misled many of the
                    enthusiasts who have bewildered themselves in the search of a perpetual motion;
                    demonstrating, that when a number of weights are caused to descend, in any
                    imaginable paths, at a greater distance from the centre of a wheel than they
                    ascend, the number of the weights descending at any one time must always be
                    smaller than those of the weights ascending,, and in such a proportion as
                    perfectly to compensate for the mechanical advantage apparently gained by the
                    greater distance. In the following year he was received into the number of the
                    academicians in the department of geometry, on occasion of the resignation of Μ.
                    Fontenelle. 9. He published also, in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> for
                    1741, an account of a <hi rend="italic">Gauging Rule</hi> for measuring barrels
                    of different forms, by simple inspection of the logarithmic scales engraved on
                    it, observing only some easy rules for their adjustment, according to the
                    general nature of the solid. 10. In 1746 he presented a report, in conjunction
                    with Μ. Hellot, on the <hi rend="italic">Length of the Standard Ell,</hi> which
                    was thought worthy of being inserted in the collection of the academy.</p>
                <p>11. We find among the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> for 1747 an essay of Μ.
                    Camus on the <hi rend="italic">Tangents of Curves</hi> having several branches
                    crossing each other, which frequently require for their determination the use of
                    fluxions of the higher orders, the first fluxions of the absciss and ordinate
                    vanishing together. Μ. Saurin had before given a similar solution <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193347705" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7705-0054"/>of the problem, but had not
                    attempted to explain the metaphysical ground upon which the apparent paradox is
                    reconciled to the general principles of the differential method.</p>
                <p>12. M. Camus also assisted in several determinations and reports which were
                    referred at various times to committees of the academy; and particularly in the
                    remeasurement of Μ. Picard’s base from Villejuif to Juvisy, which was performed
                    by eight members, and recorded in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> for
                    1754.</p>
                <p>13. The latter years of his life were much occupied in various engagements
                    connected with the offices of examiner in the schools of the Royal Engineers and
                    in that of the Artillery, to which he was nominated by the king. He undertook,
                    for the advantage of the students in these schools, the laborious task of
                    reducing into a uniform system a complete course of mathematical study, in which
                    the geometrical method was as much as possible observed, and which is considered
                    as highly creditable to his talents and exertions; it was entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Cours</hi><hi rend="italic">des Mathématiques,</hi> 4 vols. 8vo.
                    14. He also published an <hi rend="italic">Elementary work on
                    Arithmetic.</hi></p>
                <p>In person M. Camus was tall; his countenance was agreeable; his manners were
                    firm, and occasionally somewhat warm; but he was far from being either morose or
                    vindictive. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society of London in
                    January 1764. He married, in 1733, Mademoiselle Μ. A. Μ. Fourrier, and had four
                    daughters, the eldest of whom was married to Μ. Pagin; the others died young.
                    His last illness was supposed to have originated from a cold, taken in a
                    professional journey during the hard winter of 1766, and to have been aggravated
                    by affliction for the loss of his surviving daughter. He died a few months after
                    her, on the 4th of May 1768. He left a variety of manuscripts, demonstrative of
                    his habitual diligence, and of the extent of his researches; but not deemed of
                    sufficient importance to meet the hazards of posthumous publication. <hi

                    amount of about two hundred volumes. His definition of politics is remarkable.

                    fervour with which he attacked the abuses of his time. He died in 1652.</p>
