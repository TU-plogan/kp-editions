                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    rend="italic">Antiquity,</hi> a famous fort or castle, on the Mons Capitolinus
                    at Rome, in which was a temple dedicated to Jupiter (thence also denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">Capitolinus),</hi> where the senate anciently assembled. It had
                    its name of <hi rend="italic">capitol</hi> from <hi rend="italic">caput,</hi> a
                    man’s head, said to have been found fresh, and yet bleeding, upon digging the
                    foundation of the temple built in honour of Jupiter. Arnobius adds, that the
                    man’s name was <hi rend="italic">Tohos,</hi> whence <hi rend="italic"
                    >caput</hi><hi rend="italic">tolium.</hi> The first foundations of the capitol
                    were laid by Tarquin the Elder, in the year of Rome 139. His successor Servius
                    raised the walls, and Tarquin the Proud finished it in the year 221; but it was
                    not consecrated till the third year after the expulsion of the kings, and the
                    establishment of the consulate. The ceremony of the dedication of the temple was
                    performed by the consul Horatius in 246.</p>
                <p>The capitol consisted of three parts; a nave sacred to Jupiter, and two wings,
                    the one consecrated to Juno, the other to Minerva. It was ascended by stairs.
                    The frontispiece and sides were surrounded with galleries, in which those who
                    were honoured with triumphs entertained the senate at a magnificent banquet,
                    after the sacrifice had been offered to the gods. Both the inside and outside
                    were enriched with an infinity of ornaments, the most distinguished of which was
                    the statue of Jupiter with his golden thunderbolt, his sceptre, and crown. In
                    the capitol also were a temple dedicated to Jupiter the Guardian, and another to
                    Juno with the mint; and on the descent of the hill was the temple of Concord.
                    This beautiful edifice contained the most sacred deposits of religion, such as
                    the ancilia, the books of the Sibyls, &amp;c. The capitol was burnt under
                    Vitellius, and rebuilt under Vespasian. It was burnt a second time by lightning
                    under Titus, and restored by Domitian. The modern name is Campidoglio.</p>
