                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">CHASE, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Chace</hi></label>, is a place
                    of retreat for deer and wild beasts, of a middle kind between a forest and a
                    park, being usually less than a forest, and not possessed of so many privileges.
                    The following history of the English chase is given by Mr Pennant <hi
                    rend="italic">(British Zool.</hi> i. 42): “At first the beasts of chase had this
                    whole island for their range; they knew no other limits than the ocean, nor
                    confessed any particular master. When the Saxons had established themselves in
                    the heptarchy, they vyere reserved by each sovereign for his own particular
                    diversion. Hunting and war in those uncivilized ages were the only employ of the
                    great; their active but uncultivated minds being susceptible of no pleasures but
                    those of a violent kind, such as gave exercise to their bodies, and prevented
                    the pain of thinking.</p>
                <p>“But as the Saxon kings only appropriated those lands to the use of forests which
                    were unoccupied, so no individuals received any injury; but when the conquest
                    had settled the Norman line on the throne, this passion for the chase was
                    carried to an excess which involved every civil right in a general ruin: it
                    superseded the consideration of religion even in a superstitious age; the
                    village communities, nay, even the most sacred edifices, were turned into one
                    vast waste, to make room for animals, the objects of a lawless tyrant’s
                    pleasure. The New Forest in Hampshire is too trite an instance to be dwelt on;
                    sanguinary laws w ere enacted to preserve the game; and in the reigns of William
                    Rufus and Henry I. it was less criminal to destroy one of the human species than
                    a beast of chase. Thus it continued while the Norman line filled the throne; but
                    when the Saxon line was restored under Henry II. the rigour of the forest laws
                    was immediately softened.</p>
                <p>“When our barons began to form a power, they claimed a vast but more limited
                    tract for a diversion that the English were always fond of. They were very
                    jealous of any encroachments on their respective bounds, which were often the
                    cause of deadly feuds. Such a one gave cause to the fatal battle of <hi
                    rend="italic">Chevy-chase,</hi> a fact which, though recorded only in a ballad,
                    may, from what we know of the manners of the times, be founded on truth; not
                    that it was attended with all the circumstances which the author of that natural
                    but heroic composition has given it; for on that day neither a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Percy</hi> nor a <hi rend="italic">Douglas</hi> fell. Here the poet seems to
                    have claimed his privilege, and mixed with this fray some of the events of the
                    battle of <hi rend="italic">Otterbourne.</hi></p>
                <p>“When property became happily more divided by the relaxation of the féodal
                    tenures, those extensive hunting grounds became more limited; and as tillage and
                    husbandry increased, the beasts of chase were obliged to give way to others more
                    useful to the community. The vast tracts of land before dedicated to hunting w
                    ere then contracted, and, in proportion as the useful arts gained ground, either
                    lost their original destination, or gave rise to the invention of <hi
                    rend="italic">parks.</hi> Liberty and the arts seem coeval; for when once the
                    latter got footing, the former protected the labours of the industrious from
                    being ruined by the licentious sportsman, or being devoured by the objects of
                    his diversion. For this reason the subjects of a despotic government still
                    experience the inconveniences of vast wastes and forests, the terrors of the
                    neighbouring husbandmen, while in our well-regulated monarchy very few chases
                    remain. The English still indulge themselves in the pleasures of hunting, but
                    confine the deer kind to parks, of which England boasts of more than any other
                    kingdom in Europe. The laws allow every man his pleasure, but confine them in
                    such bounds as to prevent them from being injurious to the meanest of the
                    community. Before the reformation the prelates seem to have guarded sufficiently
                    against this want of amusement, the see of Norwich in particular being possessed
                    about that time of thirteen parks.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chase,</hi> in the sea language, is to pursue a ship, which

                    >Chase-Guns</hi> are guns which are either in the head, when they are used in
                    chasing others, or in the stern, where they are only useful in the event of

                <p><hi rend="italic">Wild-goose</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Chase,</hi> a term
                    used to express a sort of racing on horseback formerly practised, resembling the
                    flying of wild geese; those birds generally going in a train one after another,
                    not in confused flocks as other birds do. In this sort of race the two horses,
                    after running twelve score yards, had liberty, which horse soever could get the
                    lead, to take what ground the jockey pleased, the hindmost horse being bound to
                    follow him within a certain distance agreed on by the articles, or else to be
                    whipped in by the triers and judges who rode by; and whichever horse could
                    distance the other won the race. This sort of racing was not long in common use;
                    for it was found inhuman, and destructive of good horses, when two such were
                    matched together. For in this case neither was able to distance the other till
                    they were both ready to sink under their riders; and often two very good horses
                    were both spoiled, and the wagers forced to be drawn at last. The mischief of
                    this sort of racing soon brought in the method now in use, of only running over
                    a certain quantity of ground, and determining the plate or wager by coming in
                    first at the winning-post.</p>
