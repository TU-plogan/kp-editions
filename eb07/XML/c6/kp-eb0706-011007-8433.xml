                <p>1. When a solid body is partially plunged in a fluid, the level surface near it
                    is disturbed, and the fluid is observed either to ascend or descend, so as to
                    form a ring round the part immersed. If a tube of glass be inserted in a vessel
                    containing water, the liquid will rise in a concave ring, both on the outside
                    and the inside; and if the tube be small enough, the cylinder of water within it
                    will be elevated above the general level, and the elevation will be greater
                    nearly in the same proportion that the bore is less. On the other hand, if the
                    tube be plunged in mercury, the fluid in contact with the glass will be
                    depressed, forming a hollow ring with the convexity upward; and when the
                    diameter is very small, the cylinder of mercury in the inside will sink below
                    the level on the outside. In all these appearances the physical cause is the
                    same, and it has received the name of Capillary Action, because its effects are
                    most remarkable in the case of tubes with extremely minute diameters.</p>
                <p>No part of natural philosophy has been the subject of a greater variety of
                    researches than capillary action. It has been viewed in almost every possible
                    light, and it would be difficult to suggest a new principle that has not been
                    proposed by some philosopher in order to account for the observed appearances.
                    One advantage has resulted from repeated discussion; for by this means the true
                    cause of the phenomena is no longer doubtful, although there is still
                    considerable difference of opinion with regard to the manner in which the
                    effects are produced. It is now universally allowed, that the suspension of
                    fluids in capillary tubes is to be ascribed to the attraction observed to take
                    place between the elementary particles of which bodies are composed. We shall
                    not stop to detail the different experiments which prove the reality of this
                    attractive force, and we shall at once assume that the two following facts,
                    which are the fundamental principles of this theory, are fully established;
                    namely, that glass and other solid bodies attract the particles of fluids with
                    which they are in contact, and that the particles of fluids attract one another.
                    Admitting these two kinds of attraction, it remains to investigate the
                    consequences that flow from them.</p>
                <p>2. Corpuscular attraction acts with great intensity in contact, or at the nearest
                    distances, but it decreases very rapidly as the distance increases, and, on the
                    whole, is confined within a very small range. Clairaut supposed that the sides
                    of a capillary tube extend their action to the central parts of the contained
                    cylinder of fluid. But in this opinion he is singular. All other philosophers
                    confine the sphere of attraction within much narrower limits. They suppose that
                    the corpuscular force has produced its full effect, and has become evanescent,
                    at a distance so small that it cannot be appreciated by the senses. But <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193348446" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8446-0111"/> from this we are
                    not to conclude that a particle attracts those only which are quite contiguous
                    to it; its action, although confined within a sphere of a very small radius,
                    nevertheless extends to some distance, and reaches to the particles beyond the
                    nearest.</p>
                <p>As corpuscular attraction extends its influence to a distance, it must vary,
                    within the sphere of its action, according to some law, which is unknown, and in
                    all probability will never be discovered. But a knowledge of this law is not
                    necessary to explain the capillary phenomena; for these are caused by the
                    accumulated action of the force in its whole range, and are independent of the
                    intermediate variations of intensity which it may undergo. In this respect
                    capillary action resembles the attraction by which transparent bodies refract
                    the rays of light. In both cases, what we observe is the total effect of the
                    attractive energy, which may remain the same, although the intermediate degrees
                    of intensity be infinitely varied.</p>
                <p>3. Conceive a fluid mass (Plate CXLV. fig. 1), the particles of which attract one
                    another, but which is subjected to the action of no other forces, not even to
                    that of gravity; and let an imaginary surface be traced through the fluid,
                    having at every part a depth equal to the utmost range of the corpuscular force.
                    Then a particle placed within the imaginary surface may be considered as
                    occupying the centre of a sphere of the fluid, described with a radius equal to
                    the greatest distance to which attraction reaches; whence it is manifest that
                    the particle will be urged with equal forces in all opposite directions. If the
                    particle be placed between the boundaries of the superficial stratum or film,
                    the sphere of which it is the centre will extend above the fluid’s surface; and,
                    on account of the defect of matter, the particle will be less attracted outward
                    than inward. Let N be a particle so situated, and suppose that <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> is another particle as much elevated above the fluid’s surface as N is
                    immersed below it; and trace the surface PQ in the fluid as far below N as that
                    particle itself is below the outer boundary of the fluid mass. Then the particle
                    N will be in equilibrium with regard to the attraction of all the fluid above
                    PQ; but it will be urged inward by the force with which it is attracted by the
                    fluid below PQ; and as the particles at N and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> are
                    similarly situated with regard to the whole fluid mass, and the part of it below
                    the surface PQ, it is manifest that the attraction of the whole mass upon the
                    particle at <hi rend="italic">η</hi> is equal to the force which urges the
                    particle at N inward. From this it follows, that all particles placed in a
                    stratum which is everywhere at the same depth below the fluid’s surface, arc
                    drawn inward with the same force, equal to that with which the whole mass
                    attracts a particle placed at an equal height above the fluid’s surface.</p>
                <p>If now we conceive a canal passing through the interior of the fluid, and
                    terminating both ways in the surface, it follows, from what has been said, that
                    the attraction of the whole mass upon the superficial drops placed at the two
                    orifices will propagate equal pressures in opposite directions through the
                    canal. In order to estimate the force of compression, we may denote by K the
                    pressure inward, caused by the attraction of the whole fluid upon a square inch
                    of the superficial film; then a portion of the fluid within the canal will be
                    compressed by the equal forces, K, acting in opposite directions. This is true
                    of all portions of the fluid within the superficial stratum; between the
                    boundaries of that stratum the compressive force is less, being always of the
                    same intensity at the same depth, but decreasing rapidly in approaching the
                    surface, where it is evanescent.</p>
                <p>We may now conceive a fluid mass, whatever be its figure, to consist of a central
                    part, surrounded by an indefinite number of thin beds or strata, placed at equal
                    depths below the surface; and it will follow, from what has been proved, that
                    the compression is constant in all the central part; and likewise that it is
                    uniformly of the same intensity throughout every superficial stratum, varying
                    from one stratum to another, and decreasing very rapidly near the surface. Such
                    a body of fluid will therefore be in equilibrium whatever be its figure; in
                    other words, the corpuscular attraction will oppose no resistance to a change of
                    figure in the fluid, nor obstruct, in any degree, the perfect mobility of the
                    particles among one another.</p>
                <p>It must be observed, however, that the conclusion just obtained is exact only
                    when we confine our attention to the direct action of the attractive forces, as
                    is done in the theory of the figure of the earth. But there is another effect
                    caused by the direct attraction of the particles of a fluid, to be afterwards
                    considered, which takes place only at the surface, and from which this
                    consequence results, that a body of fluid subjected to no forces but the
                    attraction of its own particles will no longer be indifferent to any figure, but
                    will arrange itself in a perfect sphere.</p>
                <p>A change in the temperature of a fluid mass will produce an alteration in the
                    cohesive force; but it appears ∣ very difficult, if not impossible, to estimate,
                    in any satis- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> factory manner, the effect arising
                    from this cause.</p>
                <p>A variation of temperature will affect the attraction of the particles of a fluid
                    by the change of density which it induces. When two portions of a fluid attract
                    one another, if we conceive one of them to have its density changed, while that
                    of the other remains unaltered, it is evident that their cohesion will be
                    proportional to the number of particles of the first portion placed within the
                    sphere of action of the second; that is, it will vary in the direct proportion
                    of the density. Again, if we now suppose the density of the second portion to
                    vary, the attractive force will on this account also suffer a proportional
                    change. Wherefore, when both portions undergo an equal change of temperature,
                    their cohesion will vary as the square of the density.</p>
                <p>Again, the variations in the mutual distances of the particles of a fluid, caused
                    by changes of temperature, must bear a finite proportion to the range of the
                    corpuscular force; and, on this account, a change in the fluid’s cohesion will
                    take place, depending upon the law that attraction follows in regard to the
                    distance. At a given temperature, and under a given pressure, the particles are
                    separated from one another to a certain distance, at which there is an
                    equilibrium between the attractive force which impels them to one another, and
                    the repulsive power attending the action of heat. In these circumstances, the
                    actual cohesion is due to that part only of the whole corpuscular force which is
                    exerted upon the particles placed beyond the limit of approach allowed by the
                    given degree of temperature. The cohesion, too, is diminished not only by the
                    decreased intensity of the attractive force, but also by the increased repulsion
                    of heat. Our ignorance of the laws that regulate the action of these forces
                    makes it impossible to subject to calculation the effect of a change of
                    temperature; but, when we consider that corpuscular attraction decreases very
                    rapidly as the distance increases, it is extremely probable that the cohesion of
                    a fluid undergoes much greater changes from this cause than from the variations
                    of density.</p>
                <p>But capillary action arises from the cohesion between the particles of a fluid,
                    and the attraction that takes place between them and the solid bodies with which
                    they are brought into contact. Experiments show that these forces continue to
                    act so long as the state of fluidity endures; their action is constant under the
                    same temperature; and they are affected in degree only by the variations of
                    heat. In the further prosecution of this inquiry we shall therefore<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193348459" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8459-0112"/> throw out of view
                    the effect of temperature, and shall confine our attention to develope the
                    consequences of corpuscular attraction.</p>
                <p>4. The attraction of a solid body on every particle of a fluid within the sphere
                    of its action, is a force perpendicular to the surface of the solid. This is
                    manifest from the homogeneity of the solid when its surface is a plane; for, on
                    account of the uniform arrangement of the parts, there is no reason why the
                    attractive force should decline from the perpendicular to one side rather than
                    to another. And when the solid is bounded by a curve of any kind, we may still
                    consider the extremely small part of the surface which acts on a particle, as
                    coinciding with the tangent plane; whence we may conclude thdt, in all cases,
                    the attraction on every particle is perpendicular to the surface of the
                    attracting body. The same thing is true in the action of transparent bodies on
                    light; for, if the motion of a ray be decomposed into two parts, one parallel to
                    the refracting surface, and the other perpendicular to it, the observed law of
                    refraction implies that the velocity of the first part will remain unchanged,
                    while the velocity of the other part will be increased or diminished by the
                    refracting force.</p>
                <p>If a smooth plate of glass be laid horizontally upon the surface of water, it is
                    found that the glass will adhere to the water. The adhesion is not produced by
                    the pressure of the atmosphere, for the fact is equally true in the vacuum of an
                    air-pump. There is, therefore, evidently an attraction between the glass and the
                    water, acting perpendicularly to the plate, and causing it to adhere to the
                    water.</p>
                <p>If the plate, instead of being laid horizontally upon the water, be immersed
                    vertically in it, the part below the surface will exert the same attractions as
                    it did in the former position. Every particle of the fluid within the sphere of
                    action of the glass will be drawn perpendicularly towards it, and a thin coating
                    of the fluid will attach itself to all the immersed surface of the plate.</p>
                <p>5. Although the attractive force exerted by a solid body on a fluid is confined
                    to insensible distances, it must still be considered as penetrating in some
                    degree into the fluid mass. The thin film on which it acts retains possession of
                    all the properties of a fluid. The particles of water in contact with the glass
                    press upon its surface; the particles farther off press upon those nearer; and
                    the whole film is in a state of compression. But it is a distinguishing property
                    of a fluid, arising from the perfect mobility of its particles, that a pressure
                    in one direction will cause an equal pressure in all directions; and hence we
                    must infer that the thin film of water, at the same time that it is compressed
                    by the direct attraction of the glass, will likewise press laterally, or will
                    make an effort to spread itself towards every side on the surface of the plate.
                    If the film, instead of being attracted by the plate, were pressed against its
                    surface by a weight, the lateral pressure, estimated on a given superficial
                    space, would be the same with the direct pressure. But as the strata at
                    different distances from the plate are attracted in unequal degrees, the whole
                    lateral force can be found only by summing up the lateral pressures arising from
                    the attraction upon each stratum.</p>
                <p>Let AB (fig. 2) be a plate of glass on which there stands an upright vessel or
                    tube, containing water; and let GH be a thin section or elementary part of the
                    water within the tube, parallel to the glass, and so near it as to be attracted
                    by it. Suppose that <hi rend="italic">ιv</hi> denotes the area of the section,
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> its distance from the plate, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >da</hi> its thickness; and let T («) represent the attraction of the whole
                    matter of the plate upon a single particle of water placed at the distance <hi
                    rend="italic">a.</hi> Then the density being constant and equal to unit, the
                    attractive force of the plate upon the thin elementary section will be equal
                    to</p>
                <p>T(α) X <hi rend="italic">wda</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and hence the
                    attraction of the plate upon all the water in the tube will be equal to the
                    integral <hi rend="italic">w</hi> X^⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> (α)∙i⅛</p>
                <p>generated while <hi rend="italic">a</hi> increases from 0 to be infinitely great.
                    The expression <hi rend="italic">J Υ(a)∙da,</hi> which we may denote by K', is
                    therefore the force with which the attraction of the glass causes the fluid to
                    press upon a square inch of the plate, or it is the measure of that force. If
                    the particles of the fluid were attracted by the matter of the plate with an
                    intensity equal to their own cohesive force, then K' would be equal to K, that
                    is, it would be equal to the force with which an indefinite mass of the fluid
                    causes the superficial stratum to press inward.</p>
                <p>In the inside periphery of the tube, assume any determinate length <hi
                    rend="italic">ab,</hi> equal to λ, and let the lines <hi rend="italic">ac,
                    bd,</hi> be drawn in the interior surface at right angles to <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab.</hi> The area of the space <hi rend="italic">abdc</hi> is equal to λ × <hi
                    rend="italic">a;</hi> and because fluids press equally in all directions, the
                    attraction which urges the elementary section towards the plate AB will cause
                    the fluid below the section to press upon the space <hi rend="italic">abdc</hi>
                    with a force which is to the attractive force urging the section downward, as λ
                    × <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to the area of the section. Hence the pressure on the
                    space <hi rend="italic">abdc,</hi> caused by the .attraction of the glass on the
                    elementary section GFI, is equal to x × <hi rend="italic">^Υ(ayada.</hi></p>
                <p>This expression would evidently denote the pressure upon the surface <hi
                    rend="italic">abdc,</hi> if the fluid below the section were impelled towards
                    the plate by a piston exactly fitted to the orifice of the tube. But there is no
                    difference between the action of such a piston and that of the thin elementary
                    section when urged by attraction with equal force in the same direction. The
                    total force acting laterally in the length λ, is therefore equal to the
                    fluent</p>

                    infinitely great. Hence, if we put H' = <hi rend="italic">J'^Υ(pyada</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> then H' will be the measure of the lateral force in the
                    length equal to unit.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that the direct attraction between two portions of a fluid, as well
                    as that between a solid and a fluid, is attended with a lateral pressure. <hi
                    rend="italic">If we</hi> denote by H what H' becomes when the matter of the
                    plate attracts the fluid with the same intensity that the fluid attracts its own
                    particles, then II will be the measure of the lateral force arising from the
                    direct attraction of the fluid, and it will have the same relation to K that H'
                    has to K'.</p>
                <p>The lateral force is always very small when compared with the direct pressure.
                    For the function <hi rend="italic">^'i(a)</hi> has a conceivable value only when
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is so small as to be imperceptible to the senses; in
                    such circumstances the product ψ(α) X <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is very small
                    when compared with ψ(α); and, consequently, <hi rend="italic">CC-J'V(p)ada</hi>
                    is considerable in respect of K'=y^i'(α)∙i∕α.</p>
                <p>The smallness of the lateral in comparison of the direct pressure arises from
                    this, that every elementary part of the latter is estimated on the same finite
                    area, while the simultaneous element of the former is confined to a space
                    incomparably less. These two pressures resemble the power in the hydrostatic
                    paradox, and the effect which it produces. In both cases we have a small
                    pressure applied <pb break="no" facs="nls:193348472"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-8472-0113"/>to a surface extremely minute, in equilibrium with
                    a great pressure distributed over a comparatively large area.</p>
                <p>When a piece of glass is partially plunged in water in a vertical direction, the
                    thin film which is attracted by the immersed surface endeavours to spread itself
                    on the glass with an effort more or less in proportion to the compressive force.
                    Below the surface of the water the lateral actions of the parts in contact
                    mutually counteract one another; but at the surface the expansive force meets
                    with no opposition. The film will therefore be pushed above the general level;
                    and as it acts by cohesion on the contiguous fluid, it will draw up a portion of
                    it, and form a ring surrounding the immersed part of the glass. The small fluid
                    mass on which the glass exerts its attraction performs the office of a machine,
                    which changes a horizontal force into one having a vertical direction. In the
                    mechanical properties of a fluid we thus have a principle adequate to account
                    for what we observe in capillary action. But although the general view here
                    given of the cause of the capillary phenomena is so far satisfactory, a great
                    deal of discussion is still necessary, in order to deduce from it a clear
                    explanation of the laws observed in the appearances that take place in different
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>The idea of accounting for capillary action by means of the lateral force
                    produced by the direct attraction of a solid body upon a fluid, is due to
                    Professor Leslie, a philosopher to whom physical science is indebted for more
                    than one discovery. It is developed and applied, to explain some of the
                    principal phenomena, in a short dissertation published in 1802 in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosopliical Magazine.</hi> This dissertation is written with
                    the same ability that characterizes all the productions of the author; and
                    nothing more was necessary than to pursue the observation he had made, in order
                    to obtain a complete theory of this branch of natural philosophy. It happens
                    that, in this instance, the views of the philosopher are confirmed by the most
                    abstruse and refined mathematical investigation. The formula found by Laplace
                    for the attractive force of a fluid bounded by a curve surface, consists of two
                    parts, one of which is the same for all surfaces, and the other varies with the
                    curvature in each particular ease. The first of these terms is the attractive
                    force of an indefinite mass of the fluid bounded by a plane. The other term,
                    which depends upon the curvature, is composed of a constant quantity multiplied
                    into half the sum of the reciprocals of the radii of the circles, which have the
                    same curvature with any two sections of the curve surface made by planes,
                    perpendicular to one another and to the curve surface; and, on examination, this
                    constant quantity will be found to coincide with the measure of the lateral
                    tendency of the fluid caused by the direct action of the first force. Thus it
                    appears that the two quantities which enter into the formula of Laplace are no
                    other than the measures of the two kinds of force which we have been
                    considering; the one denoting the direct pressure caused by the attraction of a
                    fluid mass bounded by a plane, and the other signifying the derivative force
                    acting laterally, which is a necessary consequence of the direct pressure. In a
                    subsequent part of this article, what has now been advanced will be proved, by
                    deducing the formula of Laplace in a direct and satisfactory manner from the two
                    kinds of force, with the consideration of which we have been occupied.</p>
                <p>i 6. Imagine a large vessel DGHF (fig. 3), which contains a fluid subjected to no
                    forces but gravity and the attraction of its own particles, and consequently
                    having its surface DF horizontal; let AB represent a rectangular plate partially
                    plunged in the fluid which it attracts; and supposing the surface of the fluid
                    to remain level, let it be proposed to investigate the force with which the
                    attraction of the plate tends to disturb the equilibrium of the fluid.</p>
                <p>Suppose a horizontal plane, rζ∕i to be traced in the fluid, at a depth equal to
                    the range of the corpuscular force; then this plane will separate all the
                    superficial strata, in which the pressure is variable, from the rest of the
                    mass. Below the plane <hi rend="italic">of,</hi> the fluid particles cohere with
                    the same force in every part, and they are likewise attracted with equal
                    intensity by all the points of the plate with which they arc in contact; above
                    the same plane the attractive force of the plate remains unchanged, but the
                    pressure of the fluid in the different strata is variable, gradually becoming
                    less and less as we approach the surface. It will therefore be proper, first to
                    examine what tendency the part of the plate below the plane &lt;7∕ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> has to disturb the equilibrium; and, secondly, to
                    consider the effect of the plate’s attraction upon the superficial film or
                    stratum.</p>
                <p>If the matter of the plate have the same attraction for the particles of the
                    fluid that they have for one another, we may consider the plate as a body of the
                    fluid that has congealed without any other change; in which case it is evident
                    that, below the superficial stratum, the cohesive force of the fluid particles
                    will be equal to their adhesion to the plate, and the action of the solid matter
                    will nowise disturb the equilibrium of the fluid in the vessel.</p>
                <p>If the plate be supposed to have no attraction for the fluid, a canal having one
                    end in the surface of the fluid, and the other end on the plate, will be similar
                    to a canal terminating both ways in the fluid’s surface. It will be in
                    equilibrium by the mutual attractions of the particles within it, and will exert
                    no pressure whatever upon the plate.</p>
                <p>If the solid matter attract the particles of the fluid, but with less intensity
                    than they attract one another, there will be an adhesion of the fluid to the
                    plate in proportion to the attractive force. In this case we may distinguish the
                    attraction between the fluid particles into two parts, one of which is equal to
                    and in equilibrium with the attraction of solid matter; while the other part,
                    which is over and above what balances the attraction of the solid matter, is in
                    equilibrium by the mutual action of the particles upon one another.</p>
                <p>The solid matter acts immediately upon a thin portion of the fluid in contact
                    with it; that portion attracts another contiguous portion; and in this manner
                    the attraction of the plate reaches to any distance in the fluid mass. But from
                    this it is manifest that the whole of a force greater than the mutual attraction
                    of the particles cannot be propagated to a distance. Part of it must remain
                    confined to the sphere of immediate action. Hence, if the plate attract the
                    particles of the fluid with greater intensity than they attract one another, a
                    part only of the attraction of the solid matter will balance the whole
                    attraction of the fluid; and the remaining part will not penetrate beyond the
                    range of the eorpuscular force, but will act only upon a thin film of the fluid
                    in contact with the plate. In this ease, therefore, the plate’s attraction
                    produces a force which is not absorbed by the fluid. As this force compresses
                    the thin film on which it acts upon the plate’s surface, it will be attended
                    with a lateral pressure, or an effort of the film to spread itself on all sides;
                    and it may at first be thought that this lateral tendency, by acting upon the
                    superficial stratum, will disturb the equilibrium. But it will immediately
                    occur, that the effort which the edge of the film adhering to the plate below
                    the plane <hi rend="italic">of</hi> makes to raise up the superficial stratum,
                    is counteracted by the opposite effort of the fluid situated immediately above
                    the plane <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Thus, in every relation that can subsist
                    between the attractive powers of the plate and the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193348485" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8485-0114"/>fluid, that part of the solid
                    which is immersed below the superficial stratum has no tendency to disturb the
                    equilibrium of the fluid in the vessel.</p>
                <p>Some philosophers account for capillary action by means of attractions between
                    the plate and the fluid, which are supposed to take place, partly at the surface
                    of the fluid, and partly at the bottom of the plate. Laplace, in particular, has
                    grounded his second or more popular theory entirely on such attractions. He
                    observes, that the part of the plate’s vertical plane immersed in the water
                    attracts the fluid in contact with it as much upward as downward, and therefore
                    has no effect in causing either· an elevation or a depression; but the part
                    above the water attracts a thin film in contact with the plate upward; and the
                    whole vertical side of the plate likewise attracts in the same direction the
                    fluid below it, and situated in its prolongation. According to Laplace, it is
                    the united effect of these two attractions which supports the suspended ring.
                    The whole of this reasoning appears to us gratuitous. No part of the fluid is
                    attracted by the solid matter in a vertical direction, but in a direction
                    perpendicular to the plate’s surface. The immersed part of the solid presents a
                    continuous surface to the fluid, attracting it with the same intensity at every
                    point; whereas Laplace neglects the action of the plate’s horizontal boundary,
                    and seems to suppose that the attractive energy of the solid matter resides only
                    in the vertical sides. We have endeavoured to prove that the thin film or
                    coating of fluid which covers the part of the solid immersed below the
                    superficial stratum, is everywhere in a state of equilibrium and of equal
                    compression by the attractions which act upon it. There is, therefore, no force
                    produced at the bottom of the plate by the attraction between the solid matter
                    and the particles of the fluid which can contribute to support the weight of the
                    ring raised above the level.</p>
                <p>We proceed now to consider the action of the plate upon the superficial stratum.
                    Trace a canal at right angles to the plate, of the same depth with the
                    superficial film, and having its horizontal width equal to unit, and continue
                    the canal till it terminate in a vertical plane PS, parallel to the plate. Let
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi> be the small portion of the canal within the sphere of
                    the plate’s attraction, and suppose the canal to be divided in its whole length
                    into the parallelopipeds m,m, <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> &amp;c., each equal to
                    <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> It is plain that the attractions of the fluid below
                    the canal, and on the two sides of it, have no tendency to impel it in any
                    direction, nor to impede the motion of the fluid along it. The canal is also in
                    equilibrium with regard to gravity, since by the hypothesis it is horizontal.
                    The rectangular wedge of fluid beyond the plane PS will attract the small
                    parallelopiped contiguous to it with a force proportional to ^K, because K
                    denotes the attractive force of two rectangular wedges, sect. 5; and the same
                    parallelopiped will also be attracted with an equal force in the opposite
                    direction by the one next to it. In like manner, every parallelopiped in the
                    canal is attracted with equal forces by those contiguous to it on opposite
                    sides, except the one in contact with the plate, which is attracted in the
                    direction of the canal with the force ⅜K, and towards the plate with the force
                    K', depending upon the intensity of the plate’s attraction for the fluid.</p>
                <p>Now, if K' be just equal to ∣∙K, which will happen when the intensity of the
                    plate’s attraction is half that of the fluid, the parallelopiped <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> will be situated, with regard to the forces that act upon
                    it, similarly to the others in the canal; in this case, therefore, the insertion
                    of the plate will not disturb the equilibrium of the fluid, the surface of which
                    will remain horizontal.</p>
                <p>If K' be greater than ⅜K, it may be resolved into two parts, ∣K + (K' — ⅛K), of
                    which one will counterbalance the opposite force, and reduce the canal to
                    equilibrium; and the other part, K' = ∣K, will act only upon the parallclopiped
                    <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> and will compress it upon the surface of the plate.
                    The compression will produce a lateral force proportional to H' — ∙^H, which
                    urges the small fluid mass to spread itself towards every side; and as this
                    force is unopposed vertically upward, the equilibrium of the fluid will be
                    disturbed; the superficial film will ascend all round the plate, and, by means
                    of the force of cohesion, will carry with it a portion of the fluid till the
                    suspended weight is sufficient to counterbalance the force acting upward.</p>
                <p>When K' is less than ∣K, the parallelopi ped in contact with the plate will be
                    more attracted in the direction of the canal than towards the plate. When this
                    happens the fluid is depressed below the level by capillary action; but we shall
                    leave this case to be afterwards considered, and at present confine our
                    attention to the former case, when the fluid is elevated above the level.</p>
                <p>7. When the immersion of the plate causes an elevation, the fluid will assume the
                    form of a concave ring, as KLM (fig. 4). If we suppose a superficial canal
                    divided into parallelopipeds as before, we may prove by like reasoning that the
                    attraction of the solid matter has no tendency to disturb the equilibrium of the
                    fluid except by the lateral force which it communicates to the small
                    parallelopiped in contact with it. And since the attractive force of the plate
                    upon the particles of the fluid depends only upon their perpendicular distance
                    from its surface, it readily follows that the lateral force will undergo no
                    variation, but will remain constantly equal to H'—^H, both during the rising of
                    the ring, and when it has attained the greatest elevation. The reciprocal
                    attraction of all the fluid in the vessel likewise produces pressures that are
                    propagated inward from the surface of the fluid, and from the sides and bottom
                    of the vessel, sect. 3; but these forces cannot be in equilibrium with the ring
                    and the disturbing force arising from the plate’s attraction. For the former
                    forces have no tendency to move the centre of gravity of the whole mass, whereas
                    the latter tend to produce motion in that point, each in its own direction. In
                    the case of equilibrium, therefore, the vertical force arising from the plate’s
                    attraction must be equal to the weight of the suspended ring; or, which is the
                    same thing, H'—ļ-II will express the weight of a portion of the ring in every
                    unit of the horizontal extent</p>
                <p>The vertical force produced by the attraction of the solid matter begins to act
                    the instant the fluid comes into contact with the solid; it first causes the
                    ring to rise, and then keeps it suspended.</p>

                    of a section of the ring made by a vertical plane perpendicular to the surface

                    >m</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> X 1, will be the volume of a
                    portion of the fluid equal in weight to H'-—∣H.</p>
                <p>If two parallel plates, AB and CD (fig. 5), very near one another, have their
                    lower ends immersed in a fluid, it is observed that the fluid will rise between
                    them above the natural level. Conceive a superficial canal extending between the
                    plates in a direction at right angles to their surfaces, having its depth equal
                    to the greatest range of the corpuscular force, and its horizontal width equal
                    to unit; then all the fluid below the canal will be in equilibrium with respect
                    to the attractive forces that act upon it, and therefore the suspended weight
                    must be supported by the action of the two plates upon the canal. Of the forces
                    which act upon the canal, we may neglect the attraction of the fluid below it,
                    which causes the particles in the inside to press perpendicularly on the bottom.
                    At each end it is attracted by the plates with a force equal to K', or
                    &lt;∣K+(K'—⅛K), and, at the vertical sides between the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193348498" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8498-0115"/>plates, by the fluid on the
                    outside with a force equal ∣K. Wherefore, when the canal is reduced to
                    equilibrium by equalizing the pressure upon its sides, there will remain at each
                    end an excess of force equal to K'—∣K, which compresses the fluid upon the
                    plates; and the compressive force is necessarily accompanied with a lateral
                    pressure equal to H'—⅜H, which tends upwards and supports the weight of the
                    fluid suspended below the canal.</p>
                <p>Hence the weight elevated between the plates, in the horizontal length λ, is
                    equal to 2(H ’ —ļH) × λ; and, since “i <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> X 1 is the
                    volume corresponding to the weight (H'—^H) × <hi rend="smallcaps">1j</hi> the
                    volume corresponding to the weight 2(H'—∣H) × λ will be equal to 2wz <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> × λ. Let D denote the distance of the plates, and Q
                    the least height of the curve surface between them above the natural level;
                    then, if we conceive a horizontal plane touching the curve surface at its lowest
                    point, the whole fluids between the plates in the length λ will be composed of a
                    small curved portion in the shape of a meniscus, and a parallelopiped equal in
                    volume to λ× D X Q. Now, when the plates are very near one another, and the
                    elevation is considerable in comparison of their distance, the meniscus will be
                    so small that the parallelopiped alone may be reckoned equal to the whole volume
                    of the fluid. Hence, if we equate the two expressions of the same bulk, we shall
                    get</p>
                <p>D×Q=2oe <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>; which proves that the elevations of a
                    fluid between plates of the same matter are reciprocally proportional to the
                    distances of the plates; and this agrees with observation.</p>
                <p>When a capillary tube, or one with a bore less than one tenth of an inch, is
                    partly plunged in a fluid, the fluid will rise within the tube above the level
                    on the outside. Let AB and CD (fig. 5) represent the sides of such a tube, MHN
                    the curve surface of the elevated column, having below it an imaginary surface
                    at a depth equal to the range of the corpuscular force, and conceive two planes
                    intersecting one another in the axis of the tube at any angle, then all the
                    fluid below the superficial stratum will be in equilibrium with regard to the
                    attractions to which it is subjected; and the triangular portion of that
                    stratum, bounded by the inside of the tube, and the two planes intersecting in
                    the axis, would likewise be in equilibrium, if the pressures upon all its
                    vertical sides were equal. But the side in contact with the tube is attracted
                    with a force equal to K', or ⅛K + (K'—∣K); and each of the other two sides is
                    attracted with a force equal to ⅛K; therefore, when the equilibrium of the
                    attracting forces is provided for, there will remain an unbalanced pressure,
                    proportional to K'—gK, upon the inside of the tube; and this direct compressive
                    force is accompanied with a lateral tendency, proportional to H'—⅜H, which is
                    directed upward, and sustains the elevated fluid between the two intersecting
                    planes.</p>

                    the expression formerly obtained for two plates, we shall get</p>
                <p>H×Q = r×&lt;7,∙ and this shows that a fluid will rise between two plates, to the
                    same height it would do in a tube of the same matter having its radius equal to
                    the distance of the plates.</p>
                <p>The deductions that have now been drawn from the principle of a corpuscular
                    attraction evanescent at all sensible distances, are equivalent to the account
                    of capillary action founded on the hypothesis of Dr Jurin. Whatever may be
                    thought of the physical principle advanced by this philosopher, it must be
                    allowed that his theory agrees well with observation; and it cannot be denied
                    that he has, with great sagacity, inferred from his experiments the true place
                    in which the capillary force resides. But it is impossible to accede to his
                    opinion, that, when a capillary tube of glass is immersed in water, the water
                    within the tube is attracted upward by a narrow ring of glass immediately above
                    the surface of the liquid. If the glass attract the water, the attraction must
                    be perpendicular to the surface of the glass; the force acting on the fluid
                    cannot be vertical, it must be horizontal; and if we would reason strictly, the
                    proper inference must be, that an attraction between the glass and the water is
                    alone insufficient to account for capillary action. In order to explain the
                    phenomena, it is necessary to attend to the remark of Professor Leslie, founded
                    on the properties essential to fluidity, namely, that a fluid cannot be
                    attracted horizontally by a solid body, without having a vertical force
                    communicated to it. It is certainly not a little surprising, that an observation
                    made in 1802, so well calculated to remove all the difficulties of the theory,
                    should have passed entirely unnoticed, although, since that period, the subject
                    has engaged the attention of the first philosophers of the age.</p>
                <p>In what goes before, it has been shown that, in many cases, the height to which a
                    fluid will rise may be found with considerable exactness, by comparing the bulk
                    as determined by the magnitude of the capillary force with the same bulk deduced
                    from the figure which the displaced fluid is constrained to assume; but a
                    rigorous investigation of all the circumstances attending the capillary
                    phenomena requires further, that we know the nature of the curve assumed by that
                    part of the fluid’s surface which is free to obey the impulse of all the forces
                    that act upon it; and it is to this branch of the subject that we are now to
                    proceed.</p>
                <p>8. Resuming the first and simplest case of a single plate immersed in a fluid,
                    which rises upon its surface in a concave ring, let a vertical plane PL (fig.
                    4), parallel to the plate, and at a distance from its surface greater than the
                    range of the corpuscular force, be drawn to intersect the curve; then the part
                    of the ring cut off, being without the sphere of the plate’s attraction, must be
                    supported by the force with which it is attracted by the fluid between the plate
                    and the plane. Now, all the fluid below the superficial stratum is in
                    equilibrium with regard to the corpuscular forces to which it is subjected; and
                    hence it is the attraction of the fluid between the plate and the plane upon the
                    superficial stratum which supports the part of the ring below the plane, in the
                    same manner that the attraction of the plate upon the same stratum supports the
                    whole ring. All the fluid in the vessel being supposed in equilibrium, w ʹ e may
                    conceive that the portion of it between the plate and the plane is converted
                    into a solid without any other change of its properties; then if we consider
                    that part of the superficial canal which lies between the vertical plane and the
                    level surface of the fluid, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193348511"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-8511-0116"/>the upper end of it will be pressed against the
                    imaginary solid by the attraction of an obtuse-angled wedge of the fluid, while
                    the pressure upon all the other vertical sides ,is only equal to the attraction
                    of a right-angled wedge; and the difference of these forces remaining
                    unbalanced, generates the force which tends upward, and supports the weight of
                    the part of the ring situated below the point of its action.</p>
                <p>It is now necessary to determine the attractive force of a portion of a fluid, in
                    the shape of a wedge, contained in any proposed angle. Suppose that a fluid mass
                    bounded by the plane AB (fig. 6) is divided by the plane PQ; and let it be
                    required to find the force with which the attraction of the particles contained
                    in each of the wedges APQ and BPQ will cause a small drop placed at P to press
                    upon the plane AB. Draw PN and PG to bisect the angles APQ, BPQ; let the line
                    PH, perpendicular to the plane AB, represent the force K, or the pressure of the
                    drop caused by the attraction of all the fluid below the plane, sect. 3; and
                    draw HN and HG perpendicular to PN and</p>
                <p>PG. It is manifest that the attraction of all the particles in the wedge APQ is a
                    force in the direction PN; and, in like manner, the attraction of the particles
                    in the wedge BPQ is a force in the direction PG. Wherefore, since</p>
                <p>PH, the united effect of both attractions, is resolved into the forces PN and PG,
                    it follows that PN will represent the attraction of the obtuse-angled wedge upon
                    the drop, and PG that of the acute-angled wedge. Draw NO and GL perpendicular to
                    PH; then PO is the part of the force PN acting at right angles to the plane AB,
                    and PL is the like part of the force PG. Draw NG, and let <hi rend="italic"
                    >φ</hi> denote the angle HPQ, or the difference of each of the angles APQ and
                    BPQ from a right angle. Then NG and PH are equal and bisect one another. Also,
                    the angle PHG ~ BPG, each being the complement of HPG. Wherefore GCP = 2PHG =
                    2BPG = BPQ; and, taking the complements of the equal angles, CGL = CNO - HPQ =
                    <hi rend="italic">&lt;p.</hi> Now GC = ⅛PH = ⅜K; hence CL=CO = ⅜K sin. <hi
                    rend="italic">φ∙,</hi> therefore PO = ∙IK + ⅛K sin. <hi rend="italic">φ,</hi>
                    and PL = ⅜K — ∙∣∙K sin. <hi rend="italic">&lt;p.</hi> Thus the pressure of the
                    drop upon the plane AB, caused by the attraction of the obtuse-angled wedge, is
                    equal to ⅛K + ^K sin. <hi rend="italic">&lt;p</hi>; and that caused by the
                    attraction of the acute-angled wedge is equal to ⅛K — ∣K sin. <hi rend="italic"
                    >φ.</hi></p>
                <p>Returning now to the canal below the vertical plane PL (fig. 4), and the level
                    surface of the fluid, let <hi rend="italic">ô</hi> denote the inclination of the
                    curve at L to the horizon; the canal would be in equilibrium with respect to the
                    corpuscular forces that act upon it, if the attractions upon all its vertical
                    sides were equal. But, according to what has just been investigated, the upper
                    end is attracted by the fluid beyond the vertical plane PL, with a force equal
                    to ⅜K + ⅜K sin. <hi rend="italic">ô·,</hi> and the attraction upon each of the
                    remaining sides is only equal to ļK; wherefore there is an excess of attraction

                <p>Let ∕3- ’ × 1 denote the volume of a portion of the fluid equal in weight to ⅜H.
                    Then ļ-H sin. <hi rend="italic">ô</hi> will be the weight, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >β</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi> sin. <hi rend="italic">â</hi> the
                    bulk, of the partial ring cut off by the plane PL in the horizontal extent equal

                    the curve, formed by the intersection of the ring, with a vertical plane
                    perpendicular to the plate; and let <hi rend="italic">x</hi> be the
                    corresponding horizontal ordinate, or the distance of <hi rend="italic">y</hi>
                    from the plate. Then the area of the curve below the point L is equal to <hi

                    level surface of the fluid.</p>
                <p>In like manner, we may investigate the curve formed by the intersection of the
                    fluid between two parallel plates and a vertical plane perpendicular to the
                    plates. Let <hi rend="italic">y</hi> denote the height above the natural level
                    of a point in the curve, and <hi rend="italic">x</hi> the distance of <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> from the middle of the plates, or from the point where <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> is least. Suppose two vertical planes, PO and QR (fig. 5),
                    parallel to the plates and at equal distances from them; then, as before, the
                    fluid on the outside of the planes PO and QR will attract the ends of the
                    superficial canal between them with a force equal to J-K + ∣K sin. d; and, as
                    the part ŷK is alone sufficient for the equilibrium of the canal, it follows
                    that the other part -ļ-K sin. <hi rend="italic">è</hi> will compress the fluid
                    in contact with the two planes, producing thereby a lateral pressure that tends
                    upward and sustains the weight of the suspended fluid. Hence the weight of the
                    fluid suspended between the planes PO and QR, in every unit of the horizontal
                    length, is equal to 2 × -∣H sin. 0; and its bulk is equal to 2∕3 <hi

                <p>. In the case of a capillary tube, conceive an imaginary tube, of which the sides
                    are PO and QR (fig. 5), within the real one, and let <hi rend="italic">ô</hi>
                    denote the inclination of the curve surface to the horizon at the points P and
                    Q. The elevated column within the imaginary tube is supported by the attraction
                    of the fluid between the two tubes, in the same manner that the whole capillary
                    column is supported by the attraction of the solid matter of the real tube. The
                    fluid in contact with the imaginary tube on the outside having the shape of a
                    wedge contained in the obtuse angle 90° + ∂, will attract the fluid in the
                    inside in a horizontal direction with a force equal to ⅜K + ∣K sin. <hi
                    rend="italic">Ô</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and of this force, the part ∣K sin.
                    <hi rend="italic">ô</hi> will compress the fluid ring on which it acts,
                    producing, by this means, a lateral tendency upward, proportional to ∣H sin. ∂,
                    which supports the weight of the suspended column. If <hi rend="italic">r</hi>
                    denote the radius of the imaginary tube, then ⅜H sin. <hi rend="italic">ô ×
                    rπr</hi> will be equal to the weight, and <hi rend="italic">β</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> sin. i∣Xrσ to the bulk of the elevated column
                    within that tube; and if <hi rend="italic">y</hi> be the vertical ordinate of a
                    point in the curve surface, or the height above the natural level, and <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> the horizontal distance of <hi rend="italic">y</hi> from
                    the axis of the tube, the bulk of the same column will be equal to <hi

                <p>Wherefore, by equating the equivalent expressions, we shall get the following
                    equations, which determine the nature of the curve surface, viz.</p>

                <p>9. Having explained the most remarkable instances of elevation by capillary
                    action, we must now turn our atten- tion to the cases where a fluid is depressed
                    below the level "by the same cause. It has been shown that an elevation ‘will
                    always take place when K'and H'are greater than ⅜K and įH. and that the fluid
                    will remain level when the same quantities are equal. It follows, therefore,
                    that the fluid will sink below the level when the former quantities are less
                    than the latter; or otherwise there could not be an equilibrium. The shortest
                    and most perspicuous manner of explaining the cases when a fluid is depressed is
                    to compare them with the similar cases of an elevation. Suppose that AB and <hi
                    rend="italic">ab</hi> (fig. 7 and 8) are two plates of different kinds of matter
                    immersed in the same fluid, which they attract with intensities equally above
                    and below the mean quantity ⅜K, we shall prove that the same curve which is
                    formed above the level on the surface of the one, will be in equilibrium by the
                    action of the other when placed upon its surface in a reversed position below
                    the level.</p>
                <p>Conceive the two curves to be intersected at intervals equal to the range of the
                    eorpuscular force by an indefinite number of planes parallel to the plates; and
                    let the curves at L and <hi rend="italic">l</hi> have the same inclination, <hi
                    rend="italic">ô,</hi> to the. horizon. In the curve above the level (fig. 7), it
                    has been shown that the force which tends .upward, and supports the part of the
                    ring below L, is equal to ∣H sin. <hi rend="italic">ô</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and, in like manner, the force which supports the part of the ring below
                    the point 0, indefinitely near L, is equal to ⅛H . (sin. ∂ + <hi rend="italic"
                    >cl</hi> sin. d). Therefore the difference of these forces, or ģH ∙ <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> sin. <hi rend="italic">ô,</hi> which may be considered as a
                    force urging the curvilineal element OL upward, is equal to the weight of the
                    fluid elevated between the planes passing through 0 and L. In effect, if we put
                    <hi rend="italic">y</hi> and <hi rend="italic">x</hi> to denote the vertical and
                    horizontal ordinates of the point L, and equate the two expressions of the bulk
                    of the small portion of fluid above mentioned, we shall get <hi rend="italic"
                    >β</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> sin. <hi
                    rend="italic">6~β</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >dzz=,ydx,</hi> which is no other than the differential of the equation formerly
                    obtained (sect. 7). We may therefore conceive that every element of the curve is
                    urged upward with a force equal to the weight of the elevated fluid below it,
                    the attraction of the plate supplying the force necessary to sustain the
                    accumulated weight of all the suspended fluid.</p>
                <p>In the curve below the level (fig. 8), the fluid on the same side of the plane
                    <hi rend="italic">tl</hi> with the plate <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> attracts
                    th.e particles on the other side of that plane; and as the attracting fluid
                    forms an acute-angled wedge contained in the angle ∕if t=90° — <hi rend="italic"
                    >6,</hi> the horizontal attraction will be equal to {-K—-⅛K sin. <hi
                    rend="italic">ð;</hi> and the lateral force thence arising, and acting
                    vertically, to ⅛II—jH sin. <hi rend="italic">ô.</hi> The point <hi rend="italic"
                    >l</hi> of the curve is therefore urged upward by the attraction of the fluid
                    between it and the plate <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> with a force equal to
                    ∣H—-’-II sin. d; and in like manner, the point <hi rend="italic">o</hi>
                    indefinitely near <hi rend="italic">l,</hi> tends upwards with the force ,}H—∣H
                    ∙ (sin. <hi rend="italic">ô + d</hi> sin. d).. The difference of these forces,
                    which may be considered as a force applied to the curvilineal element <hi
                    rend="italic">ol,</hi> is equal to — <hi rend="italic">ļHd</hi> sin. <hi
                    rend="italic">ô ∙,</hi> and it is the same in quantity as in the other curve,
                    but has an opposite direction. The difference in the directions of the two
                    forces acting upon the elements of the two curves arises from this, that, in the
                    curve above the level, the force acting upward continually increases from the
                    level surface to the plate, whereas, in the curve below the level, it
                    continually decreases. Again, because OL and <hi rend="italic">ol</hi> are
                    placed at equal distances above and below the general level of the fluid, the
                    weight drawing the element OL downward will be just equal to the vertical
                    pressure caused by the superincumbent fluid, and urging the element <hi
                    rend="italic">ol</hi> upward. It thus appears that the forces which act upon the
                    like elements of the two curves are the same in quantity, but that they have
                    their directions reversed; which proves that, because the one curve is in
                    equilibrium, the other will be so too; at least this will be the case if the
                    attraction of the plate <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> be sufficient to maintain the
                    lowest point of the convex curve in its place.</p>
                <p>The parts of the curves between the level surface of the fluid and the planes TL
                    and <hi rend="italic">tl</hi> are kept in their places by the horizontal
                    attraction of the fluid on the other side of the same planes. These attractions
                    are respectively equal to ^K + ^∙ K sin. <hi rend="italic">ô,</hi> and ⅜K—^K
                    sin. <hi rend="italic">ô;</hi> and the one as much exceeds the mean quantity ∣K
                    as the other falls short of it. Now, in place of the attractions of the fluid
                    particles contained in the wedges KLT and <hi rend="italic">hlt,</hi> we may
                    substitute the attractions of two solid plates that act upon the fluid with
                    equal forces; and these plates will come under the condition we have supposed
                    with respect to the attractions of the plates AB and <hi rend="italic">ab.</hi>
                    It follows, therefore, that, because the attraction of the plate AB maintains<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193348537" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8537-0118"/> the concave curve
                    in its place, the attraction of the plate <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> will be
                    sufficient to maintain the convex curve in its place.</p>
                <p>It is evident that the same reasoning which has been applied to two solid plates
                    will apply equally in all other cases, and we may lay down this general
                    proposition, viz. If two solid bodies, perfectly equal and similar, but composed
                    of different kinds of matter, be immersed in a fluid which they attract with
                    intensities equally different from the mean quantity ∣K, the fluid will be
                    raised above the level by the action of the one, and depressed below the level
                    by the action of the other, and the convex curve below the level will differ
                    from the concave curve above the level in no respect, except that it will have
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> reversed position.</p>
                <p>As no bounds can be set to the attractive force which a solid body exerts upon
                    the particles of a fluid, it may be asked, will the weight displaced by
                    capillary action increase in proportion to the attraction of the solid? or, are
                    there any conditions that confine the effect within a certain limit, however
                    great may be the attraction of the solid? In answer to this, it must be
                    observed, that the action of the solid matter is confined to a thin film of the
                    fluid in contact with it; and that it is this film alone which acts on the
                    partieles beyond it, and keeps them suspended by means of the force of cohesion.
                    Hence the weight maintained above the level can never exceed what this last
                    force is able to support. The elevation of the fluid will there be regulated by
                    the attractive force of the solid matter, only so long as that force is less
                    than the mutual attraction of the fluid particles; and the fluid will always
                    rise to the same height when the attraction of the solid matter is either equal
                    to or greater than the fluid’s cohesion. In all these cases, the solid is wetted
                    by the fluid, and we may conceive that it becomes covered with a coating of
                    sufficient thickness to shield the particles on the outside from the attraction
                    of the solid matter, a new body being thus formed, which attracts the fluid with
                    a force equal to its own cohesive power.</p>
                <p>From the relation that has been shown to take place between the cases of equal
                    elevation and depression, it follows that the greatest depression will take
                    place when a solid has no attraction for the partieles of a fluid. If we go
                    beyond this limit, and suppose that the solid matter repels the fluid, the
                    capillary effect will not be heightened; for the repulsive force will be
                    confined to the particles within the range of its action; beyond this insensible
                    distance the repelling power will produce no effect, and the fluid will be left
                    to assume the same figure it would do if no such power existed.</p>
                <p>10. In the several cases that have been considered, the weight of the fluid
                    suspended below that point of the curve surface which is inclined to the horizon
                    in the angle <hi rend="italic">û,</hi> has been found to be equal to <hi
                    rend="italic">į</hi> FI sin. <hi rend="italic">ð·,</hi> wherefore, if s denote
                    the angle of contact, or the angle in which the surface of the fluid intersects
                    the solid, then 90° —ε will be the limit of <hi rend="italic">ð,</hi> or what
                    <hi rend="italic">ð</hi> becomes at the surface of the solid; and consequently
                    the weight of the whole fluid suspended by capillary action will be equal to ļ
                    FI cos. s; but, as has likewise been proved (sect. 7), the same weight is also
                    equal to H'—1FI; and hence, by equating the equivalent quantities, we get</p>
                <p>Fľ— H cos. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∣ε.</p>
                <p>This expression is possible only when IF is not greater than H; but we must not
                    infer that the theory leads to any contradiction in the case where a solid body
                    attracts the particles of a fluid with an intensity greater than their own
                    mutual action upon one another. The equation is a consequence of the equality
                    that takes place between the vertical force H'—⅛II derived from the attraction
                    of the solid, and the weight <hi rend="italic">of the</hi> displaced fluid
                    deduced from the figure which the attraction of its own particles causes it to
                    assume. It is, therefore, only the effective part of the force H'—⅛H, or that
                    which is really employed in displacing the fluid, that can enter into the
                    equation; and when a part of the same force has no effect in elevating or
                    depressing the fluid, that part must be neglected. Now it has been proved that,
                    however great the force H' — ∣H may be, the capillary effect can never exceed
                    that produced by the force H' — ģH (sect. 9); and hence it appears, from the
                    principle on which the investigation proceeds, that, in the equation, H' must be
                    limited not to exceed FI, which must be taken for its value in all cases when
                    the solid matter acts upon the fluid particles with an intensity either equal to
                    or greater than their own mutual attraction.</p>
                <p>From this equation it follows that the angle of contaet is always the same when
                    different solids of the same attractive powers are immersed in the same fluid, a
                    property that was first noticed by Dr Young.</p>
                <p>The weight of the displaced fluid being equal to ļH cos. 8, is in every case
                    proportional to the cosine of the angle of contact.</p>
                <p>11. In order still farther to illustrate and confirm the principles of the theory
                    we have been explaining, we shall conclude this article with applying them to
                    demonstrate the formula found by Laplace for the attraction of a fluid mass
                    bounded by a curve surface.</p>
                <p>Conceive a fluid mass bounded by a curve surface concave outward, and let the
                    plane MAN (fig. 9) be a tangent, and the straight line AO a normal, to the curve
                    surface at any point A; through AO draw any two planes perpendicular to one
                    another, which cut the surface of the fluid in the curve lines BA and CA, and
                    let DC and DB be two other sections of the fluid’s surface made by planes
                    parallel to the first planes, and indefinitely near them. Put <hi rend="italic"
                    >ds</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dd</hi> for the small curve lines AB and AC; and
                    <hi rend="italic">d∂</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dff</hi> for the measures of the
                    small angles which the tangents drawn to the curve lines from the points B and C
                    make with the tangent plane MAN. The four planes intersecting the fluid contain
                    within them a rectangular prism, standing upon the base ABDC, and extending into
                    the interior of the fluid mass at right angles to the curve surface: it is
                    required to find the force which urges the prism outward above the tangent
                    plane.</p>
                <p>Conceive a surface intersecting the prism at a depth below its base equal to the
                    range of the corpuscular force; then all the fluid of the prism below this
                    imaginary surface being an equilibrium with regard to the attractions to which
                    it is subjected, we have only to examine the forces that act upon the
                    superficial stratum. It is attracted by the particles below the imaginary
                    surface, and by the fluid on the outside of the force bounding planes. The
                    attraction of the particles below the imaginary surface is at every point
                    perpendicular to that surface; and therefore the stratum would be in
                    equilibrium, if the attractions upon its four sides were equal. The fluid on the
                    outside of each of the two planes AB and AC is a rectangular wedge; and
                    consequently the attractions upon the particles within the stratum causing them
                    to press perpendicularly upon these planes, are each proportional to ļ-K. On the
                    outside of the plane DC, the fluid is a wedge contained in the obtuse angle <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">90° + ć/ö';</hi> and on the outside of the plane BD, it is a
                    wcdge contained in the obtuse angle 90° + ćZd; the attraction is therefore
                    proportional to -∣K + &lt;}KrZ0' in the first case, and to ⅛K + <hi
                    rend="italic">ļ Kdð</hi> in the other case. Hence, after the attractions upon
                    the sides of the stratum are equalized, there is an excess of force
                    perpendicular to each of the planes CD and DB, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193348550" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8550-0119"/>amounting respectively to
                    ⅛K&lt;70' and -∣KiZd. These direct forces produce the corresponding lateral
                    pressures ^Hcřd' and|Híft); of which the first is the force in the length equal
                    to unit, urging the fluid in contact with the plane CD to ascend above the
                    tangent plane, and the second is the like force acting upon the fluid in contact
                    with the plane BD. Therefore the actual forces which, in the lengths DC and DB,
                    impel the superficial stratum, and consequently the prism attached to it by
                    cohesion, above the tangent plane, are respectively equal to <hi rend="italic"
                    >^Wdò'ds</hi> and ∣ Heads'. It must be observed that these forces, like the
                    curvatures from which they arise, are independent of one another; and that any
                    alteration in the intensity of one will in no degree affect the action of the
                    other. We may therefore conceive them to be applied to the prism one after the
                    other; in which case the centre of gravity of the prism will have the same
                    motion communicated to it as it would have if it were acted upon by the sum of
                    both, or by the single force, <hi rend="smallcaps">JįHċZ</hi> d’d’s +
                    ļHd’&amp;Zs'; and this must therefore be considered as the effective force which
                    pushes the prism above the tangent plane.</p>
                <p>Let R and IV be the radii of the circles that have the same curvature with the
                    sections BA and CA, at the point A; then the small arcs AB and AC will subtend
                    angles at the centres of the circles respectively, equal to <hi rend="italic"
                    >dô</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dlf∙,</hi> consequently <hi rend="italic">ds =

                <p><hi rend="italic">d∂'=~∙,</hi> and if these values be substituted in the
                    expression of the force, it will become</p>
                <p>⅜H∙⅛+⅛}∙Ak.</p>
                <p>Since <hi rend="italic">ds</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ds</hi> ’ are entirely
                    arbitrary, we may suppose that <hi rend="italic">dsdsl,</hi> the base of the
                    prism, is constant or equal to unit; then the measure of the attractive force
                    arising from the curvature of the surface, and lifting the prism above the
                    tangent plane, will be equal to</p>
                <p>J-H ∙ f— +—ſ .</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> I R IV J</p>
                <p>This expression would not be a proper measure of the attractive force, unless -Ļ
                    + -į-have the same value at K JLv the same point of the curve surface, for any
                    two planes perpendicular to one another and to the curve surface; but this is a
                    well-known property belonging to all curve surfaces.</p>
                <p>If the surface of the fluid be convex outward, the preceding expression will
                    become negative, and the force will change its direction and draw the prism
                    inward, below the tangent plane.</p>
                <p>The force arising from the curvature of the surface is independent of the direct
                    attraction of the fluid mass upon the prism. This last force is proportional to
                    K; it is the same whatever be the figure of the fluid, and it is always directed
                    inward. (Sect. 3.) The whole force which draws inward a column upon a given base
                    is, therefore, proportional to <hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> k</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">→</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> h</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">∙{⅛+⅛}∙</hi></p>
                <p>This is the formula of Laplace; and the manner in which we have attained it
                    proves clearly that the symbol which makes its appearance in the analytical
                    operations of the illustrious geometer, is, in reality, the measure of the
                    lateral pressure necessarily attending the direct attraction of the particles of
                    a fluid.</p>
                <p>In a fluid mass, which is subjected to no forces but the attractions of its own
                    particles, and which is in equilibrium, if we conceive a slender canal passing
                    through the interior and forming a communication between any two points of the
                    surface, the canal will be in equilibrium taken separately (fig. 1). Of the
                    forces in action at the ends, those which arise from the direct attraction of
                    the whole mass, being equal and opposite, counteract one another in all
                    positions of the canal; but the other forces, which depend on the curvature, and
                    which in reality are nothing more than the lateral tendencies outward, produced
                    by the direct attraction of the particles surrounding the two orifices, cannot
                    be equal to one another in all positions of the canal, unless the function</p>
                <p>± <hi rend="subscript"> +</hi> ±</p>
                <p>K <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> R' have the same value at all points of the
                    curve surface, which is the case in no solid figure except a sphere. Such a body
                    of fluid, therefore, cannot be in equilibrium, unless its form be perfectly
                    spherical.</p>
                <p>The formula of Laplace must be considered as a great step made in this branch of
                    natural philosophy, not only because it ascertains the connection between the
                    pressure and the curvature, in which it agrees with the hypothesis of Segner and
                    Dr Young; but also because it brings into view the forces K and H, and draws the
                    attention to the relation they have to one another, and to the primitive
                    attraction of the particles. The labours of philosophers have discovered the
                    facts of capillary action, which have been verified by innumerable experiments;
                    but if the truth is to be told, it may be affirmed, that, reckoning back from
                    the present time to the speculations of the Florentine academicians, the formula
                    of Laplace, and the remark of Professor Leslie relating to the lateral force,
                    are the only approaches that have been made to a sound physical account of the
                    phenomena.</p>

                <p>It remains to ascertain in what cases this last formula may be safely used.</p>
                <p>If we make <hi rend="italic">l</hi> successively equal to ∙3 and ∙4, we shall
