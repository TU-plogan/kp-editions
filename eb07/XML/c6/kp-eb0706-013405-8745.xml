                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable

                    the East, signifies a company or assembly of travellers and pilgrims, and more
                    particularly of merchants, who, for their greater security, and in order to
                    assist each other, march in a body through the deserts, and other dangerous
                    places, which are infested with Arabs or robbers.</p>
                <p>There are four regular caravans which go yearly to Mecca; the first from
                    Damascus, composed of the pilgrims from Europe and Asia; the second from Cairo,
                    composed of the Mahommedans of Barbary; the third from Zibith, a place near the
                    mouth of the Red Sea, where those of Arabia and India meet; the fourth from
                    Babylon, where the Persians assemble. Most of the inland commerce of the East is
                    carried on by caravans. The Czar Peter the Great established a trade between
                    Russia and China by means of a caravan. M. Bougnon, geographer to the Duke of
                    Lorrain, published a treatise of the caravans of merchants in Asia; in which he
                    shows of what they are composed, how many sorts there are, the several uses of
                    the different sorts of animals in them, the prices given for them, the officers
                    and men appointed to conduct them, and the pay of each, with their manner of
                    marching, halting, fighting, retreating, and the like. Caravans of this kind are
                    large convoys of armed men, merchants, and travellers, with diverse sorts of
                    animals for the carriage of their provisions. There are commonly four chief
                    officers of a caravan, viz. the caravan bachi, or chief, the captain guide,
                    captain of rest, and captain of distribution. The first has absolute command
                    over all the rest; the second is absolute in the march; the office of the third
                    only commences when the caravan stops and makes a stay; to the fourth belongs
                    the disposition of every part of the corps in case of an attack or battle, and
                    he has also the inspection of the distribution of provisions, which is made
                    under him by several distributors, who give security to the master of the
                    caravan, and have each of them a certain number of persons, elephants,
                    dromedaries, &amp;c. to take care of at their peril. The treasurer of the
                    caravan is a fifth officer, who has under him several agents and interpreters,
                    who keep journals of all that passes, for the satisfaction of those concerned in
                    fitting out the caravan. Any dealer is at liberty to form a company in order to
                    make a caravan. He in whose name it is raised is considered as the caravan
                    bachi, or chief of the caravan, unless he appoint some other person in his
                    place. If there are several merchants equally concerned, they elect a caravan
                    bachi; after which they appoint officers to conduct the caravan, and decide all
                    controversies that may arise during the journey.</p>
                <p>There are also sea caravans, established on the same footing, and for the same
                    purpose; such is the caravan of vessels from Constantinople to Alexandria.</p>
