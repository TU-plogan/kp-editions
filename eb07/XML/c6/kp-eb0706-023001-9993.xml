                    Earth,</hi> is the running of metals between two frames or moulds, filled with
                    sand or earth, in which the figure that the metal is to take has been impressed

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Casting,</hi> among sculptors, implies the taking of casts
                    and impressions of figures, busts, medals, leaves, or the like.</p>
                <p>The method of taking casts of figures and busts is most generally by the use of
                    plaster of Paris, that is, alabaster calcined by a gentle heat. The advantage of
                    using this substance in preference to others is, that notwithstanding a slight
                    calcination reduces it to a pulverized state, it becomes again a tenacious and
                    cohering body, by being moistened with water, and afterwards suffered to dry; by
                    which means either a concave or a convex figure may be given by a proper mould
                    or model to it when wet, and retained by the hardness it acquires when dry; and,
                    from these qualities, it is fitted for the double purpose of making both casts,
                    and moulds for forming casts. The particular manner of making casts depends on
                    the form of the subject to be taken. Where there are no projecting parts, it is
                    very simple and easy; as likewise where there are such as form only a right or
                    any greater angle with the principal surface of the body; but where parts
                    project in lesser angles, or form a curve inclined towards the principal surface
                    of the body, the work is more difficult.</p>
                <p>The first step to be taken is the forming of the mould. In order to this, if the
                    original or model be a bas-relief, or any other piece of a flat form, having its
                    surface first well greased, it must be placed on a proper table, and surrounded
                    by a frame, the sides of which must be at such a distance from it as will allow
                    a proper thickness for the sides of the mould. As much plaster as will be
                    sufficient to cover and rise to such a thickness as to give the necessary
                    strength to the mould, as also to fill the hollow betwixt the frame and the
                    model, must be moistened with water, till it be just of such consistence as will
                    allow it to be poured upon the model. This must be done as soon as possible; or
                    the plaster w ill concrete or set, so as to become more troublesome in the
                    working, or unfit to be used. The whole must then be suffered to remain in this
                    condition till the plaster has attained its hardness; and then the frame being
                    taken away, the preparatory cast or mould thus formed may be taken off from the
                    subject entire.</p>
                <p>Where the model or original subject is of a round or erect form, a different
                    method must be pursued, and the mould must be divided into several pieces; or if
                    the subject consists of detached and projecting parts, it is frequently most
                    expedient to cast such parts separately, and afterwards join them together.</p>
                <p>Where the original subject or mould forms a round or spheroid, or any part of
                    such round or spheroid, more than one half the plaster must be used without any
                    frame to keep it round the model, and must be tempered with water to such a
                    consistence that it may be wrought with the hand like very soft paste; but
                    though it must not be so fluid as when prepared for flat-figured models, it must
                    yet be as moist as is compatible with its cohering sufficiently to hold
                    together; and being thus prepared, it must be put upon the model, and compressed
                    with the hand, or any flat instrument, that the parts of it may adapt themselves
                    in the most perfect manner to those of the subject, as well as to be compact
                    with respect to themselves. When the model is so covered to a convenient
                    thickness, the whole must be left at rest till the plaster be set and firm, so
                    as to bear dividing without falling to pieces, or being liable to be put out of
                    its form by slight violence; it must then be divided into pieces, in order to
                    its being taken off from the model, by cutting it with a knife having a very
                    thin blade; and being divided, it must be cautiously taken off, and kept till
                    dry; but it must be always carefully observed, before the separation of the
                    parts be made, to notch them across the joints or lines of the division, at
                    proper distances, that they may with ease and certainty be properly conjoined
                    again; which would be much more precarious and troublesome without such
                    directive marks. The art of properly dividing the moulds, in order <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193350006" xml:id="kp-eb0706-0006-0231"/> to make them
                    separate from the model, requires more ' dexterity and skill than any thing else
                    in the art of casting, and does not admit of rules for the most advantageous
                    conduct of it in every case. Where the subject is of a round or spheroidal form,
                    it is best to divide the mould into three parts, which will then easily come off
                    from the model; and the same will hold good of a cylinder or any regular curved
                    figure.</p>
                <p>The mould being thus formed and dried, and the parts put together, it must be
                    greased, and placed in such a position that the hollow may lie upwards, and then
                    filled with plaster mixed with water, in the same proportion and manner as was
                    directed for the casting of the mould; and when the cast is perfectly set and
                    dry, it must be taken out of the mould, and repaired where it is necessary;
                    which finishes the operation.</p>
                <p>This is all that is required with respect to subjects where the surfaces have the
                    regularity above mentioned; but where they form curves which intersect each
                    other, the conduct of the operation must be varied with respect to the manner of
                    taking the cast of the mould from off the subject or model; and where there are
                    long projecting parts, such as legs or arms, they should be wrought in separate
                    casts. The operator may easily judge from the original subjects what parts will
                    come off together, and what may require to be separated. The principle of the
                    whole consists only in this, that where under-workings, as they are called,
                    occur, that is, wherever a straight line drawn from the basis or insertion of
                    any projection would be cut or crossed by any part of such projection, this part
                    cannot be taken off without a division, which must be made either in the place
                    where the projection would cross the straight line, or, as that is frequently
                    difficult, the whole projection must be separated from the main body, and
                    divided also lengthwise into two parts; and where there are no projections from
                    the principal surfaces, but the body is so formed as to render the surface a
                    composition of such curves, that a straight line being drawn parallel to the
                    surface of one part would be cut by the outline in one or more places of another
                    part, a division of the whole should be made, so as to reduce the parts of it
                    into regular curves, which must then be treated as such.</p>
                <p>In larger masses, where there would otherwise be a great thickness of the
                    plaster, a core or body may be put within the mould, in order to produce a
                    hollow in the cast, which both saves the expense of the plaster, and renders the
                    cast lighter.</p>
                <p>This core may be of wood where the forming of a hollow of a straight figure or a
                    conical one with the basis outward will answer the end; but if the cavity
                    require to be round, or of any curve figure, the core cannot then be drawn while
                    entire, and consequently should be of such matter as may be taken out
                    piece-meal. In this case the core is best formed of clay, which must be worked
                    upon wires to give it a tenacity, and suspended in the hollow of the mould by
                    cross wires lying over the mouth; and when the plaster is sufficiently set to
                    bear handling, the clay must be picked out by a proper instrument.</p>
                <p>Where it is desired to render the plaster harder, the water with which it is
                    tempered should be mixed with parchment size properly prepared, which will make
                    it very firm and tenacious.</p>
                <p>In the same manner, figures, busts, and the like, may be cast of lead or any
                    other metal in the moulds of plaster, only the expense of plaster, and the
                    tediousness of its becoming sufficiently dry, when in a very large mass, to bear
                    the heat of melted metal, render the use of clay, compounded with some other
                    proper materials, preferable where large subjects are in question. The clay in
                    this case should be washed over till it be perfectly free from gravel or stones,
                    and then mixed with a third or more of fine sand to prevent it cracking; or,
                    instead of sand, coal ashes sifted fine may be used. Whether plaster or clay be
                    employed for the casting in metal, it is extremely necessary to have the mould
                    perfectly dry, otherwise the moisture, being rarefied, will cause an explosion
                    that will blow the metal out of the mould, and endanger the operator, or at
                    least crack the mould in such a manner as to frustrate the operation. Where the
                    parts of a mould are large, or project much, and consequently require a greater
                    tenacity of the matter they are formed of to keep them together, flocks of
                    cloth, prepared like those designed for paper hangings, or fine cotton plucked
                    or cut till it is very short, should be mixed with the ashes or sand before they
                    are added to the clay to make the composition for the mould. The proportion
                    should be according to the degree of cohesion required; but a small quantity
                    will answer the end if the other ingredient of the composition be good, and the
                    parts of the mould properly linked together by means of the wires above
                    directed.</p>
                <p>There is a method of taking casts in metals from small animals, and the parts of
                    vegetables, which may be practised for some purposes with advantage,
                    particularly for the decorating of grottos or rock works, where nature is
                    imitated. The proper kinds of animals are lizards, snakes, frogs, birds, or
                    insects, the casts of which, if properly coloured, will be exact representations
                    of the originals.</p>
                <p>This is to be performed by the following method: A coffin or proper chest for
                    forming the mould being prepared of clay, or four pieces of boards fixed
                    together, the animal or parts of vegetables must be suspended in it by a string,
                    and the leaves, tendrils, or other detached parts of the vegetables, or the
                    legs, wings, and other parts of the animals, properly separated and adjusted in
                    their right position by a small pair of pincers; a due quantity of plaster of
                    Paris and calcined talc, in equal quantities, with some alumen plumosum, must
                    then be tempered with water to the proper consistence for casting, and the
                    subject from which the cast is to be taken, as also the sides of the coffin,
                    moistened with spirit of wine. The coffin or chest must then be filled with the
                    tempered composition of the plaster and talc, putting at the same time a piece
                    of straight stick or wood to the principal part of the body of the subject, and
                    pieces of thick wire to the extremities of the other parts, in order that they
                    may form, when drawn out after the matter of the mould is properly set and firm,
                    a channel for pouring in the melted metal, and vents for the air, which
                    otherwise, by the rarefaction it would undergo from the heat of the metal, would
                    force its way out or burst the mould. In a short time the plaster and talc will
                    set and become hard, when the stick and wires may be drawn out, and the frame or
                    coffin in which the mould was cast taken away; and the mould must then be put
                    first into a moderate heat, and afterwards, when it is as dry as it can be
                    rendered by that degree of heat, removed into a greater, which may be gradually
                    increased till the whole be red hot. The animal or part of any vegetable which
                    was included in the mould will then be burnt to a coal, and may be totally
                    calcined to ashes, by blowing for some time gently into the channel and passages
                    made for pouring in the metal, and giving vent to the air, which will, at the
                    same time that it destroys the remainder of the animal or vegetable matter, blow
                    out the ashes. The mould must then be suffered to cool gently, and will be
                    perfect, the destruction of the substance of the animal or vegetable having
                    produced a hollow of a figure correspondent to it; but it may be nevertheless
                    proper to shake the mould, and turn it upside down, as also to blow with the
                    bellows into each of the air-vents, in order to free it wholly from any
                    remainder of the ashes; or where there may be an opportunity <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193350019" xml:id="kp-eb0706-0019-0232"/>of filling the hollow with
                    quicksilver without expense, it will be found a very effectual method of
                    clearing the cavity, as all dust, ashes, or small detached bodies, will
                    necessarily rise to the surface of the quicksilver, and be poured out with it.
                    The mould being thus prepared, it must be heated very hot when used if the cast
                    be made with copper or brass; but a less degree will serve for lead or tin; and
                    the matter being poured in, the mould must be gently struck, and then suffered
                    to rest till it be cold, at which time it must be carefully taken from the cast,
                    but without the least force; for such parts of the matter as appear to adhere
                    more strongly must be softened by soaking in water till they be entirely
                    loosened, that none of the more delicate parts of the cast may be broken off or
                    bent.</p>
                <p>Where the <hi rend="italic">alumen plumosum</hi> cannot easily be procured, the
                    plaster may be used alone; but it is apt to be calcined by the heat used in
                    burning the animal or vegetable from which the cast is taken, and to become of
                    too incohering and crumbly a texture; or, for cheapness, Stourbridge or any
                    other good clay, washed over till it be perfectly fine, and mixed with an equal
                    portion of sand, and some flocks cut small, may be employed. Pounded
                    pumice-stone and plaster of Paris, taken in equal quantities, and mixed with
                    washed clay in the same proportion, is said to make excellent moulds for this
                    and similar purposes.</p>
                <p>Casts of medals, or such small pieces as are of a similar form, may be made in
                    plaster by the method directed for bas-reliefs. Indeed nothing more is required
                    than to form a mould by laying them on a proper board, and having surrounded
                    them by a rim made by a piece of card, or any other pasteboard, to fill the rim
                    with soft tempered plaster of Paris; which mould, when dry, will serve for
                    several casts. It is nevertheless a better method to form the mould of melted
                    sulphur, which will produce a sharper impression in the cast, and be more
                    durable than those made of plaster. Casts are likewise frequently made of
                    sulphur, which being melted, must be treated exactly in the same manner as
                    plaster.</p>
                <p>For taking casts from medals Dr Lewis recommends a mixture of flowers of
                    brimstone and red lead. Equal parts of these are to be put over the fire in a
                    ladle till they soften to the consistence of pap; then they are to be kindled
                    with a piece of paper, and stirred for some time. The vessel being afterwards
                    covered close, and continued on the fire, the mixture grows fluid in a few
                    minutes. It is then to be poured on the metal, previously oiled and wiped clean.
                    The casts are very neat; and their colours sometimes a pretty deep black,
                    sometimes a dark gray. They are very durable; and when soiled, may be washed
                    clean in spirits of wine.</p>
                <p>Dr Lettsom recommends tin-foil for taking off casts from medals. The thinnest
                    kind is to be used. It should be laid over the subject from which the impression
                    is to be taken, and then rubbed with a brush, the point of a skewer, or a pin,
                    till it has perfectly received the impression. The tin-foil should now be pared
                    close to the edge of the medal, till it be brought to the same circumference.
                    The medal must then be reversed, and the tin-foil will drop off into a chip box
                    or mould placed ready to receive it. Thus the concave side of the foil will be
                    uppermost, and upon this plaster of Paris, prepared in the usual manner, may be
                    poured. When dry the whole is to be taken out, and the tin-foil sticking on the
                    plaster will give a perfect representation of the medal, almost equal in beauty
                    to silver. If the box or mould is a little larger than the medal, the plaster
                    running round the tin-foil will give the appearance of a white frame or circular
                    border; and hence the new made medal will appear neater and more beautiful.</p>
                <p>Casts may likewise be made with iron prepared in the following manner: “Take any
                    iron bar, or piece of a si milar form, and, having heated it red hot, hold it
                    over a vessel containing water, and touch it very slightly with a roll of
                    sulphur, which will immediately dissolve it, and make it fall in drops into the
                    water. As much iron as may be wanted being thus dissolved, pour the water out of
                    the vessel, and pick the drops formed by the melted iron from those of the
                    sulphur, which contain little or no iron, and will be distinguishable from the
                    other by their colour and weight.” The iron will by this means be rendered so
                    fusible that it will run with less heat than is required to melt lead, and may
                    be employed for making casts of medals, and many other such purposes, with great
                    convenience and advantage.</p>
                <p>Impressions of medals having the same effect as casts may be made also of
                    isinglass-glue, by the following means: Melt the isinglass, beaten, as when
                    commonly used, in an earthen pipkin, with the addition of as much water as will
                    cover it, stirring it gently till the whole is dissolved; then with a brush of
                    camel’s hair cover the medal, which should be previously well cleansed and
                    warmed, and then laid horizontally on a board or table, greased in the part
                    around the medal. Let them rest afterwards till the glue be properly hardened;
                    and then, with a pin, raise the edge of it, and separate it carefully from the
                    medal. The cast will be thus formed by the glue as hard as horn; and so light
                    that a thousand will scarcely weigh an ounce. In order to render the relief of
                    the medal more apparent, a small quantity of carmine may be mixed with the
                    melted isinglass; or the medal may be previously coated with leaf-gold by
                    breathing on it, and then laying on the leaf, which will by that means adhere to
                    it; but the use of leaf gold is apt to impair a little the sharpness of the
                    impression.</p>
                <p>Impressions of medals may likewise be taken in putty; but it should be the true
                    kind, made of calx of tin and drying oil. These may be formed in the moulds,
                    previously taken in plaster or sulphur; or moulds may be made in its own
                    substance, in the manner directed for those of the plaster. These impressions
                    will be very sharp and hard; but the greatest disadvantage that attends them is
                    their drying very slowly, and being liable in the mean time to be damaged.</p>
                <p>Impressions of prints or other engravings maybe taken from copperplates, by
                    cleansing them thoroughly, and pouring plaster upon them; but the effect in this
                    way is not strong enough for the eye; and therefore the following method is
                    preferable, where such impressions on plaster are desired: Take vermilion, or
                    any other coloured pigment, finely powdered, and rub it over the plate. Then
                    pass a folded piece of paper, or the flat part of the hand, over the plate, to
                    take off the colour from the lights or parts where there is no engraving; the
                    proceeding must then be the same as where no colour is used. This last method is
                    also applicable to the making of impressions of copperplates on paper with dry
                    colours; for the plate being prepared as here directed, and laid on the paper
                    properly moistened, and either passed under the rolling press, or any other way
                    strongly forced down on the paper, an impression of the engraving will be
                    obtained.</p>
                <p>Impressions may likewise be taken from copperplates, either on plaster or paper,
                    by means of the smoke of a candle or lamp; if, instead of rubbing them with any
                    colour, the plate be held over the candle or lamp till the whole surface become
                    black, and then wiped off by the flat of the hand, or paper.</p>
                <p>These methods are not, however, of great use in the case of copperplates, except
                    where impressions may be desired on occasions where printing ink cannot be
                    procured. But as they may be applied likewise to the taking of impressions from
                    snuff-boxes, or other engraved subjects, by which means designs may be instantly
                    borrowed by <pb break="no" facs="nls:193350032" xml:id="kp-eb0706-0032-0233"
                    />artists or curious persons, they may in such instances be very useful.</p>
                <p>The expedient of taking impressions by the smoke of a candle or lamp may be
                    employed also for botanical purposes in the case of leaves, as a perfect and
                    durable representation not only of the general figure, but of the contexture and
                    disposition of the larger fibres, may be extemporaneously obtained at any time.
                    The same may be nevertheless done in a more perfect manner by the use of linseed
                    oil, either alone, or mixed with a small proportion of colour, where the oil can
                    be conveniently procured; but the other method is valuable on account of its
                    being practicable at almost all seasons, and in all places, within the time that
                    the leaves will keep fresh and plump. In taking these impressions it is proper
                    to bruise the leaves, so as to take off the projections of the large ribs, which
                    might prevent the other parts from plying to the paper.</p>
