                <p><label type="entry">CALENDAR</label>.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="smallcaps">calendar</hi> is a method of distributing time into
                    certain periods adapted to the purposes of civil life, as hours, days, weeks,
                    months, years, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Of all the periods marked out by the motions of the celestial bodies, the most
                    conspicuous, and the most intimately connected with the affairs of mankind, are
                    the <hi rend="italic">solar day,</hi> which is distinguished by the diurnal
                    revolution of the earth and the alternation of light and darkness, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">solar year,</hi> which completes the circle of the seasons. But in
                    the early ages of the world, when mankind were chiefly engaged in rural
                    occupations, the phases of the moon must have been objects of great attention
                    and interest; hence the <hi rend="italic">month,</hi> and the practice adopted
                    by many nations of reckoning time by the motions of the moon, as well as the
                    still more general practice of combining lunar with solar periods. The solar
                    day, the solar year, and the lunar month, or lunation, may therefore be called
                    the <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> divisions of time. All others, as the hour,
                    the week, and the civil month, though of the most ancient and general use, are
                    only arbitrary and conventional.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The true solar day is the
                    interval of time which elapses between two consecutive returns of the same
                    terrestrial meridian to the sun, and therefore, by reason of the inclined
                    position of the ecliptic, and the unequal progressive motion of the earth in its
                    orbit, is not always of the same absolute length. But as it would be hardly
                    possible, in the artificial measurement of time, to have regard to this small
                    inequality, which is besides constantly varying, the <hi rend="italic">mean
                    solar day</hi> is employed for all civil purposes. This is the time in which the
                    earth <hi rend="italic">would</hi> make one revolution on its axis, as compared
                    with the sun, if the earth moved at an equable rate in the plane of the equator.
                    The mean solar day is therefore a result of computation, and not marked by any
                    astronomical phenomenon; but its difference from the true solar or apparent day
                    is so small as to escape ordinary observation.</p>
                <p>The subdivision of the day into twenty-four parts, or hours, has prevailed since
                    the remotest ages, though different nations have not agreed either with respect
                    to the epoch of its commencement or the manner of distributing the hours.
                    Europeans in general, like the ancient Egyptians, place the commencement of the
                    civil day at midnight, and reckon twelve morning hours from midnight to midday,
                    and twelve evening hours from midday to midnight. Astronomers, after the example
                    of Ptolemy, regard the day as commencing with the sun’s culmination, or noon,
                    and find it most convenient for the purposes of computation to reckon through
                    the whole twenty-four hours. Hipparchus reckoned the twenty-four hours from
                    midnight to midnight. Some nations, as the ancient Chaldeans and the modern
                    Greeks, have chosen sunrise for the commencement of the day; others, again, as
                    the Italians and Bohemians, suppose it to commence at sunset. In all these cases
                    the beginning of the day varies with the seasons at all places not under the
                    equator. In the early ages of Rome, and even down to the middle of the fifth
                    century after the foundation of the city, no other divisions of the day were
                    known than sunrise, sunset, and midday, which was marked by the arrival of the
                    sun between the Rostra and a place called Graecostasis, where ambassadors from
                    Greece and other countries used to stand. The Greeks divided the natural day and
                    night into twelve equal parts each, and the hours thus formed were denominated
                    <hi rend="italic">temporary hours,</hi> from their varying in length according
                    to the seasons of the year. The hours of the day and night were of course only
                    equal at the time of the equinoxes. The whole period of day and night they
                    called <hi rend="italic">Wχ6ημιζOV.</hi><hi rend="italic">Weck.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> The week is a period of seven days, having no reference
                    whatever to the celestial motions; a circumstance to which it owes its
                    unalterable uniformity. Although it did not enter into the calendar of the
                    Greeks, and was not introduced at Rome till after the reign of Theodosius, it
                    has been employed from time immemorial in almost all eastern countries; and as
                    it forms neither an aliquot part of the year nor of the lunar month, those who
                    reject the Mosaic recital will be at a loss, as Delambre remarks, to assign to
                    it an origin having much semblance of probability. It might have been suggested
                    by the phases of the moon, or by the number of the planets known in ancient
                    times, an origin which is rendered more probable from the names universally
                    given to the different days of which it is composed. In the Egyptian astronomy,
                    the order of the planets, beginning with the most remote, is Saturn, Jupiter,
                    Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, the Moon. Now, the day being divided into
                    twenty-four hours, each hour was consecrated to a particular planet, namely, one
                    to Saturn, the following to Jupiter, the third to Mars, and so on according to
                    the above order; and the day received the name of the planet which presided over
                    its first hour. If, then, the first hour of a day was consecrated to Saturn,
                    that planet would also have the 8th, the 15th, and the 22d hour; the 23d would
                    fall to Jupiter, the 24th to Mars, and the 25th, or the first hour of the second
                    day, would belong to the Sun. In like manner the first hour of the 3d day would
                    fall to the Moon, the first of the 4th day to Mars, of the 5th to Mercury, of
                    the 6th to Jupiter, and of the 7th to Venus. The cycle being completed, the
                    first hour of the 8th day would return to Saturn, and all the others succeed in
                    the same order. According to Dio Cassius, the Egyptian week commenced with
                    Saturday. On their flight from Egypt, the Jews, from hatred to their ancient
                    oppressors, made Saturday the last day of the week.</p>
                <p>The English names of the days are derived from the Saxon. The ancient Saxons had
                    borrowed the week from some eastern nation, and substituted the names of their
                    own divinities for those of the gods of Greece. In legislative and justiciary
                    acts the Latin names are still retained.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Month.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Long before the exact
                    length of the year was determined, it must have been perceived that the synodic
                    revolution of the moon is accomplished in about 29-t∙ days. Twelve lunations,
                    therefore, form a period of 354 days, which differs only by about lli days from
                    the solar year. From this circumstance has arisen the practice, perhaps
                    universal, of dividing the year into twelve <hi rend="italic">months.</hi> But
                    in the course of a few years the accumulated difference between the solar year
                    and twelve lunar months would become considerable, and have the effect of
                    transporting the commencement of the year to a different season. The
                    difficulties that arose in attempting to avoid this inconvenience induced some
                    nations to abandon the moon altogether, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193347055"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-7055-0004"/>and regulate their year by the course of the sun.
                    The month, however, being a convenient period of time, has retained its place in
                    the calendars of all nations; but, instead of denoting a synodic revolution of
                    the moon, it is usually employed to denote an arbitrary number of days
                    approaching to the twelfth part of a solar year.</p>
                <p>Among the ancient Egyptians, the month consisted of thirty days invariably; and
                    in order to complete the year, five days were added at the end, called
                    supplementary days. They made use of no intercalation, and by losing a fourth of
                    a day every year, the commencement of the year went back one day in every period
                    of four years, and consequently made a revolution of the seasons in 1461 years.
                    Hence 1461 Egyptian years are equal to 1460 Julian years of 365^- days each.
                    This year is called <hi rend="italic">vague,</hi> by reason of its commencing
                    sometimes at one season of the year, and sometimes at another.</p>
                <p>The Greeks divided the month into three decades, or periods of ten days; a
                    practice which was imitated by the French in their unsuccessful attempt to
                    introduce a new calendar at the period of the revolution. This division offers
                    two advantages; the first is, that the period is an exact measure of the month
                    of thirty days; and the second is, that the number of the day of the decade is
                    connected with and suggests the number of the day of the month. For example, the
                    5th of the decade must necessarily be the 5th, the 15th, or the 25th of the
                    month; so that when the day of the decade is known, that of the month can
                    scarcely be mistaken. In reckoning by weeks, it is necessary to keep in mind the
                    day of the week on which each month begins.</p>
                <p>The Romans employed a division of the month and a method of reckoning the days
                    which appears not a little extraordinary, and must, in practice, have been
                    exceedingly incommodious. Instead of distinguishing the days by the ordinal
                    numbers first, second, third, &amp;c. they counted <hi rend="italic"
                    >backwards</hi> from three fixed epochs, namely, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Calends,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Nones,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ides.</hi> The Calends were placed invariably on the first day of the month,
                    and were so denominated because it had been an ancient custom of the pontiffs to
                    call the people together on that day, to apprize them of the festivals, or days
                    that were to be kept sacred during the month. The Ides (from an obsolete verb
                    <hi rend="italic">iduare,</hi> to divide) were at the middle of the month,
                    either the !3th or the 15th day; and the Nones were the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ninth</hi> before the Ides, counting inclusively. From these three terms the
                    days received their denomination in the following manner :—Those which were
                    comprised between the Calends and the Nones were called <hi rend="italic">the
                    days before the Nones</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> those between the Nones and
                    the Ides were called <hi rend="italic">the days before the Ides</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and, lastly, all the days after the Ides to the end of the
                    month were called <hi rend="italic">the days before the Calends</hi> of the
                    succeeding month. In the months of March, May, July, and October, the Ides fell
                    on the 15th day, and the Nones consequently on the 7th; so that each of these
                    months had six days named from the Nones. In all the other months the Ides were
                    on the 13th and the Nones on the 5th; consequently there were only four days
                    named from the Nones. Every month had eight days named from the Ides. The number
                    of days receiving their denomination from the Calends depended on the number of
                    days in the month and the day on which the Ides fell. For example, if the month
                    contained 31 days, and the Ides fell on the 13th, as was the case in January,
                    August, and December, there would remain 18 days after the Ides, which, added to
                    the first of the following month, made 19 days of Calends. In January,
                    therefore, the 14th day of the month was called the <hi rend="italic">nineteenth
                    before the Calends of February</hi> (counting inclusively), the 15th was the
                    18th before the Calends, and so on to the 30th, which was called the third
                    before the Calends <hi rend="italic">(tertio Calendas),</hi> the last being the
                    second of the Calends, or the day before the Calends <hi rend="italic">(pridie
                    Calendas).</hi> As frequent allusion is made by classical writers to this
                    embarrassing method of computation, which is carefully retained in the
                    ecclesiastical calendar, we will here give a table showing the correspondence of
                    the Roman months with those of modern Europe.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Year.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The year is either
                    astronomical or civil. The solar astronomical year is the period of time in
                    which the earth performs a revolution about the sun, or passes from any point of
                    the ecliptic to the same point again; and consists of 365 days 5 hours 48
                    minutes and 49*62 seconds of mean solar time. The civil year is that which is
                    employed in chronology, and varies among different nations, both in respect of
                    the season at which it commences, and of its subdivisions. When regard is had to
                    the sun’s motion alone, the regulation of the year, and the distribution of the
                    days into months, may be effected without much trouble; but the difficulty is
                    greatly increased when it is sought to reconcile solar and lunar periods, or to
                    make the subdivisions of the year depend on the moon, and at the same time to
                    preserve the correspondence between the whole year and the seasons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Solar Year.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In the
                    arrangement of the civil year, two objects are sought to be accomplished: the
                    first is, the equable distribution of the days among twelve months; and the
                    second is, the preservation of the beginning of the year at the same distance
                    from the solstices or equinoxes. Now, as the year consists of 365 days and a
                    fraction, and 305 is a number not divisible by 12, it is impossible that the
                    months can all be of the same length, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193347068"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-7068-0005"/>and at the same time include all the days of the
                    year. By reason also of the fractional excess of the length of the year above
                    365 days, it likewise happens that the years cannot all contain the same number
                    of days if the epoch of their commencement remains fixed; for the day and the
                    civil year must necessarily be considered as beginning at the same instant; and
                    therefore the extra hours cannot be included in the year till they have
                    accumulated to a whole day. As soon as this has taken place, an additional day
                    must be given to the year.</p>
                <p>The civil calendar of all European countries has been borrowed from that of the
                    Romans. Romulus is said to have divided the year into ten months only, including
                    in all 304 days, and it is not very well known how the remaining days were
                    disposed of. The ancient Roman year commenced with March, as is indicated by the
                    names September, October, November, December, which the four last months still
                    retain. July and August, likewise, were anciently denominated Quintilis and
                    Sextilis, their present appellations having been bestowed in compliment to
                    Julius Caesar and Augustus. In the reign of Numa two months were added to the
                    year, January at the beginning, and February at the end; and this arrangement
                    continued till the year 452 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.,</hi> when the Decemvirs
                    changed the order of the months, and placed February after January. The months
                    now consisted of twenty-nine and thirty days alternately, to correspond with the
                    synodic revolution of the moon, so that the year contained 354 days; but a day
                    was added to make the number odd, which was considered more fortunate, and the
                    year therefore consisted of 355 days. This differed from the solar year by ten
                    whole days and a fraction; but, to restore the coincidence, Numa ordered an
                    additional or intercalary month to be inserted every second year between the 23d
                    and 24th of February, consisting of twenty-two and twenty-three days
                    alternately, so that four years contained 1465 days, and the mean length of the
                    year was consequently 366į days. The additional month was called <hi
                    rend="italic">Mercedinus,</hi> or J∕erce- <hi rend="italic">donius,</hi> from
                    <hi rend="italic">merces,</hi> wages, probably because the wages of workmen and
                    domestics were usually paid at this season of the year. Accordiĥg to the above
                    arrangement, the year was too long by one day, which rendered another correction
                    necessary. As the error amounted to twenty-four days in as many years, it was
                    ordered that every third period of eight years, instead of containing four
                    intercalary months, amounting in all to ninety days, should contain only three
                    of those months, consisting of twenty-two days each. The mean length of the year
                    was thus reduced to 365į days; but it is not certain at what time the octennial
                    periods, borrowed from the Greeks, were introduced into the Roman calendar, or
                    whether they were at any time strictly followed. It does not even appear that
                    the length of the intercalary month was regulated by any certain principle, for
                    a discretionary power was left with the pontiffs, to whom the care of the
                    calendar was committed, to intercalate more or fewer days according as the year
                    was found to differ more or less from the celestial motions. This power was
                    quickly abused to serve political objects, and the calendar consequently thrown
                    into confusion. By giving a greater or less number of days to the intercalary
                    month, the pontiffs were enabled to prolong the term of a magistracy, or hasten
                    the annual elections; and so little care had been taken to regulate the year,
                    that, at the time of Julius Caesar, the civil equinox differed from the
                    astronomical by three months, so that the .winter months were carried back into
                    autumn, and the autumnal into summer.</p>
                <p>In order to put an end to the disorders arising from the negligence or ignorance
                    of the pontiffs, Caesar abolished the use of the lunar year and the intercalary
                    month, and regulated the civil year entirely by the sun. With the advice and
                    assistance of Sosigenes, he fixed the mean length of the year at 365⅜ days, and
                    decreed that every fourth year should have 366 days, the other years having each
                    365. In order to restore the vernal equinox to the 25th of March, the place it
                    occupied in the time of Numa, he ordered two extraordinary months to be inserted
                    between November and December in the current year, the first to consist of
                    thirty-three, and the second of thirty-four days. The intercalary month of
                    twenty-three days fell into the year of course, so that the ancient year of 355
                    days received an augmentation of ninety days; and the year on that occasion
                    contained in all 445 days. This was called the last year of confusion. The first
                    Julian year commenced with the 1st of January of the 46th before the birth of
                    Christ, and the 708th from the foundation of the city.</p>
                <p>In the distribution of the days through the several months, Caesar adopted a
                    simpler and more commodious arrangement than that which has since prevailed. He
                    had ordered that the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months,
                    that is January, March, May, July, September, and November, should have each
                    thirty-one days, and the other months thirty, excepting February, which in
                    common years should have only twenty-nine, but every fourth year thirty days.
                    This order was interrupted to gratify the vanity of Augustus, by giving the
                    month bearing his name as many days as July, which was named after the first
                    Caesar. A day was accordingly taken from February and given to August; and in
                    order that three months of thirty-one days might not come together, September
                    and November were reduced to thirty days, and thirty-one given to October and
                    December. For so frivolous a reason was the regulation of Caesar abandoned, and
                    a capricious arrangement introduced, which it requires some pains to
                    remember.</p>
                <p>The additional day which occurred every fourth year was given to February, as
                    being the shortest month, and was inserted in the calendar between the
                    twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth day. February having then twenty-nine days, the
                    twenty-fifth was the sixth of the calends of March, <hi rend="italic"
                    >sexto</hi><hi rend="italic">calendas</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the
                    preceding, which was the additional or intercalary day, was called <hi
                    rend="italic">bis-sextο</hi><hi rend="italic">calendas,</hi> hence the term <hi
                    rend="italic">bissextile,</hi> which is still employed to distinguish the year
                    of 366 days. The English denomination of <hi rend="italic">LeapYear</hi> would
                    have been more appropriate if that year had differed from common years in <hi
                    rend="italic">defect,</hi> and contained only 364 days. In the ecclesiastical
                    calendar the intercalary day is still placed between the 24th and 25th of
                    February; in the civil calendar it is the 29th.</p>
                <p>The regulations of Caesar were not at first sufficiently understood; and the
                    pontiffs, by intercalating every third year instead of every fourth, at the end
                    of thirty-six years had intercalated twelve times instead of nine. This mistake
                    having been discovered, Augustus ordered that all the years from the
                    thirty-seventh of the era to the forty-eighth inclusive should be common years,
                    by which means the intercalations were reduced to the proper number of twelve in
                    forty-eight years. No account is taken of this blunder in chronology; and it is
                    tacitly supposed that the calendar has been correctly followed from its
                    commencement.</p>
                <p>Although the Julian method of intercalation is perhaps the most convenient that
                    could be adopted, yet, as it supposes the year too long by 11 minutes 10∙35
                    seconds, it could not without correction very long answer the purpose for which
                    it was devised, namely, that of preserving always the same interval of time
                    between the commencement of the year and the equinox. Sosigenes could scarcely
                    fail to know that his year was too long; for it had been shown <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193347081" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7081-0006"/>long before, by the
                    observations of Hipparchus, that the excess of 3651 days above a true solar year
                    would amount to a day in 300 years. The real error is indeed more than double of
                    this, and amounts to a day in 129 years; but in the time of Caesar the length of
                    the year was an astronomical element not very well determined. In the course of
                    a few centuries, however, the equinox sensibly retrograded towards the beginning
                    of the year. When the Julian calendar was introduced, the equinox fell on the
                    25th of March. At the time of the Council of Nice, which was held in 325, it
                    fell on the 21st; and when the reformation was made in 1582, it had retrograded
                    to the 11th. In order to restore the equinox to its former place, Pope Gregory
                    XIII. directed ten days to be suppressed in the calendar; and as the error of
                    the Julian intercalation was now found to amount to three days in 400 years, he
                    ordered the intercalations to be omitted on all the centenary years excepting
                    those which are multiples of 400. According to the Gregorian rule of
                    intercalation, therefore, every year of which the number is divisible by four
                    without a remainder, is a leap year, excepting the centurial years, which are
                    onlyleap years when divisible by four after suppressing the two zeros. Thus 1600
                    was a leap year, but 1700, 1800, and 1900, are common years; 2000 will be a leap
                    year, and so on.</p>
                <p>As the Gregorian method of intercalation has been adopted in all Christian
                    countries, Russia excepted, it becomes interesting to examine with ∖vhat degree
                    of accuracy it reconciles the civil with the solar year. According to the best
                    determinations of modern astronomy (Bailli’s <hi rend="italic">Tables,</hi> p.
                    16), the solar year consists of 365 days 5 h. 48 min. 49 ’ 62 sec. or 365∙242241
                    days. Now the Gregorian rule gives 97 intercalations in 400 years; 400 years
                    therefore contain 365 X 400⅛ 97, that is, 146,097 days; and consequently one
                    year contains 365 ’ 2425 days, or 365 d. 5 h. 49 min. 12 sec. This exceeds the
                    true solar year by 22 ’ 38 seconds, which amount to a day in 3866 years. It is
                    perhaps unnecessary to make any formal provision against an error which can only
                    happen after so long a period of time; but as 3866 differs little from 4000, it
                    has been proposed to correct the Gregorian rule by making the year 4000 and all
                    its multiples common years. With this correction the rule of intercalation is as
                    follows :—</p>
                <p>Every year the number of which is divisible by 4 is a leap year; excepting the
                    last year of each century, which is a leap year only when the number of the
                    century is divisible by 4: but 4000, and its multiples, 8000, 12,000, 16,000,
                    &amp;c. are common years. Thus the uniformity of the intercalation, by
                    continuing to depend on the number four, is preserved, and by adopting the last
                    correction the commencement of the year would not vary more than a day from its
                    present place in a thousand centuries.</p>
                <p>In order to discover whether the coincidence of the civil and solar year could

                <p>The fraction — offers a convenient and very accurate method of intercalation. It
                    implies a year differing in excess from the true year only by 15∙38 seconds,
                    while the Gregorian year is too long by 25∙38 seconds. In a period of
                    thirty-three years, therefore, it produces a nearer coincidence between the
                    civil and solar years than the Gregorian method in 400 years; and, by reason of
                    its shortness, confines the evagations of the mean equinox from the true within
                    much narrower limits. It has been stated by Scaliger, Weidlar, Montucla, and
                    others, that the modern Persians actually follow this method, and intercalate
                    eight days in thirty-three years. The statement has, however, been contested on
                    good authority; and it seems proved (sec Delambre, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Astronomie</hi><hi rend="italic">moderne,</hi> tom. i. p. 81) that the Persian

                <p>nation of the length of the tropical year has been extremely exact. The discovery
                    of the period of thirty-three years is ascribed to Omar Cheyam, one of the eight
                    astronomers appointed by Gelal-Eddin Malech Schah, sultan of Khorassan, to
                    reform or construct a calendar, about the year 1079 of our era.</p>
                <p>If the commencement of the year, instead of being retained at the same place in
                    the seasons by a uniform method of intercalation, were made te depend on
                    astronomical phenomena, the intercalations would succeed each other in an
                    irregular manner, sometimes after four years and sometimes after five; and it
                    would occasionally, though rarely indeed, happen, that it would be impossible to
                    determine the day on which the year ought to begin. In the calendar, for
                    example, which was attempted to be introduced in France in 1793, the beginning
                    of the year was fixed at the midnight preceding the day in which the true
                    autumnal equinox falls. But supposing the instant of the sun’s entering into the
                    sign Libra to be very near midnight, the small errors of the solar tables might
                    render it doubtful to which day the equinox really belonged; and it would be in
                    vain to have recourse to observation to obviate the difficulty. It is therefore
                    infinitely more commodious to determine the commencement of the year by a fixed
                    rule of intercalation; and of the various methods <pb break="no"

                    one, perhaps, is on the whole more easy of application, or better adapted for
                    the purposes of computation, than the Gregorian.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Lunar Year and Luni-solar Periods.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> The lunar year, consisting of twelve lunar months, contains only 354
                    days; its commencement consequently anticipates that of the solar year by eleven
                    days, and passes through the whole circle of the seasons in about thirty-four
                    lunar years. It is therefore so obviously ill adapted to the computation of
                    time, that, excepting the modern Jews and Mahommedans, almost all nations who
                    have regulated their months by the moon have employed some method of
                    intercalation by means of which the beginning of the year is retained at nearly
                    the same fixed place in the seasons.</p>
                <p>In the early ages of Greece the year was regulated entirely by the moon. Solon
                    divided the year into twelve months, consisting alternately of twenty-nine and
                    thirty days, the former of which were called <hi rend="italic">deficient</hi>
                    months, and the latter <hi rend="italic">full</hi> months. The lunar year,
                    therefore, contained 354 days, exceeding the exact time of twelve lunations by
                    about 8∙8 hours. The first expedient adopted to reconcile the lunar and solar
                    years seems to have been the addition of a month of thirty clays to every second
                    year. Two lunar years would thus contain 25 months, or 738 days, while two solar
                    years, of 365J, days each, contain 730į days. The difference of 7-⅛ days was
                    still too great to escape observation; it was accordingly proposed by
                    Cleostratus of Tenedos, who flourished shortly after the time of Thales, to omit
                    the biennary intercalation every eighth year. In fact, the 7ļ days by which two
                    lunar years exceeded two solar years, amounted to thirty days, or a full month,
                    in eight year⅛. By inserting, therefore, three additional months instead of four
                    in every period of eight years, the coincidence between the solar and lunar year
                    would have been exactly restored if the latter had contained only 354 days,
                    inasmuch as the period contains 354 × 8 + 3 X 30 = 2922 days, corresponding with
                    eight solar years of 365j-days each. But the true time of 99 lunations is
                    2923∙528 days, which exceeds the above period by 1∙528 days, or thirty-six hours
                    and a few minutes. At the end of two periods, or sixteen years, the excess is
                    three days, and at the end of 160 years, thirty days. It was therefore proposed
                    to employ a period of 160 years, in which one of the intercalary months should
                    be omitted; but as this period was too long to be of any practical use, it was
                    never generally adopted. The common practice was to make occasional corrections
                    as they became necessary, in order to preserve the relation between the
                    octennial period and the state of the heaven; but these corrections being left
                    to the care of incompetent persons, the calendar soon fell into great disorder,
                    and no certain rule was followed till a new division of the year was proposed by
                    Meton and Euctemon, which was immediately adopted in all the states and
                    dependencies of Greece.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Metonic Cycle,</hi> which may be regarded as the <hi
                    rend="italic">chef</hi><hi rend="italic">d’oeuvre</hi> of ancient astronomy, is
                    a period of nineteen solar years, after which the new moons again happen on the
                    same days of the year. In nineteen solar years there are 235 lunations, a number
                    which, on being divided by nineteen, gives twelve lunations for each year, with
                    seven of a remainder, to be distributed among the years of the period. The
                    period of Meton, therefore, consisted of twelve years, containing twelve months
                    each, and seven years containing thirteen months each; and these last formed the
                    third, fifth, eighth, eleventh, thirteenth, sixteenth, and nineteenth years of
                    the cycle. As it had now been discovered that the exact length of the lunation
                    is a little more than twenty-nine and a half days, it became necessary to
                    abandon the alternate succession of full and deficient months; and, in order to
                    preserve a more accurate correspondence between the civil month and the
                    lunation, Meton divided the cycle into 125 full months of thirty days, and 110
                    deficient months of twenty-nine days each. The number of days in the period was
                    therefore 6940. In order to distribute the deficient months through the period
                    in the most equable manner, the whole period may be regarded as consisting of
                    235 full months of thirty days, or of 7050 days, from which 110 days are to be
                    deducted. This gives one day to be suppressed in sixty-four; so that if we
                    suppose the months to contain each thirty days, and then omit every sixty-fourth
                    day in reckoning from the beginning of the period, those months in which the
                    omission takes place will be the deficient months of course.</p>
                <p>The number of days in the period being known, it is eassy to ascertain its
                    accuracy both in respect of the solar and lunar motions. The exact length of
                    nineteen solar years is 19 × 365 ’ 24224 = 6939∙60l56 days, or 6939 days 14
                    hours 26∙275 minutes; hence the period, which is exactly 6940 days, exceeds
                    nineteen revolutions of the sun by nine and a half hours nearly. On the other
                    hand, the exact time of a synodic revolution of the moon is 29∙5305887 days; 235
                    lunations, therefore, contain 235 × 29∙5305887 = 6939∙68834 days, or 6939 days
                    16 hours 31∙2 minutes, so that the period exceeds 235 lunations only by seven
                    and a half hours.</p>
                <p>After the Metonic cycle had been in use about a century, a correction was
                    proposed by Calippus. At the end of four cycles, or seventy-six years, the
                    accumulation of the seven and a half hours of difference between the cycle and
                    235 lunations amounts to thirty hours, or one whole day and six hours. Calippus,
                    therefore, proposed to quadruple the period of Meton, and deduct one day at the
                    end of that time by changing one of the full months into a deficient month. The
                    period of Calippus, therefore, consisted of three Metonic cycles of 6940 days
                    each, and a period of 6939 da] s; and its error in respect of the moon,
                    consequently, amounted only to six hours, or to one day in 304 years. This
                    period exceeds seventy-six true solar years by fourteen hours and a quarter
                    nearly, but coincides exactly with seventy-six Julian years; and in the time of
                    Calippus the length of the solar year was almost universally supposed to be
                    exactly 365^ days. The Calippic period is frequently referred to as a date by
                    Ptolemy.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Alahommedan Year,</hi> which is regulated entirely by the
                    moon, consists of twelve months, containing twenty-nine and thirty days
                    alternately; and in order to preserve the correspondence between the civil month
                    and the lunation, a method of intercalation is employed, which, in point of
                    accuracy, could scarcely be surpassed. The moon’s synodic revolution is
                    performed in 29 days 12 hours 44 min. 2∙8 sec.·, whereas the civil month
                    supposes it only 29ģ days. Now the excess, which is 44 min. 2 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 8 sec., amounts to 8 hours 48 min. 35 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 6 sec. in a year, and, neglecting the seconds, to 264
                    hours, or eleven days, in thirty years. Hence, eleven times in thirty years one
                    day is added to the last month; so that in a period of thirty years there are
                    nineteen simple years of 354 days and eleven intercalary years of 355 days. The
                    average length of the year, therefore, differs from twelve lunations only by
                    35∙6 seconds. The eleven intercalary years are the second, fifth, seventh,
                    tenth, thirteenth, sixteenth, eighteenth, twenty-first, twenty-fourth,
                    twenty-sixth, and twenty-ninth, of each cycle of thirty years.</p>

                    regulated partly by the solar, and partly by the lunar year; a circumstance
                    which gives rise to the distinction between the movable and immovable feasts. So
                    early as the second century of our era, great disputes had arisen among the
                    Christians respecting the proper time of celebrating Easter, which governs all
                    the other movable feasts. The Jews celebrated their passover on the 14th day of
                    the <hi rend="italic">first month,</hi> that is to say, the lunar month of which
                    the fourteenth day either falls on, or next follows, the day of the vernal
                    equinox. Most Christian sects agreed that Easter should be celebrated on a
                    Sunday. Others followed the example of the Jews, and adhered to the 14th of the
                    moon; but these, as usually happened to the minority, were accounted heretics,
                    and received the appellation of Quarto-decimantes. In order to terminate
                    dissensions, which produced both scandal and schism in the church, the council
                    of Nice, which was held in the year 325, ordained that the celebration of Easter
                    should thenceforth always take place on the Sunday which immediately follows the
                    full moon that happens upon, or next after, the day of the vernal equinox.
                    Should the fourteenth of the moon, which is regarded as the day of full moon,
                    happen on a Sunday, the celebration of Easter was deferred to the Sunday
                    following, in order to avoid concurrence with the Jews and the above-mentioned
                    heretics. The observance of this rule renders it necessary to reconcile three
                    periods which have no common measure, namely, the week, the lunar month, and the
                    solar year; and as this can only be done approximately, and within certain
                    limits, the determination of Easter is an affair of considerable nicety and
                    complication. It is to be regretted that the reverend fathers who formed the
                    council of Nice were not advised to abandon the moon altogether, and appoint
                    Easter to be celebrated on the first or second Sunday of April. The
                    ecclesiastical calendar would in this case have possessed all the simplicity and
                    uniformity of the civil calendar, which only requires the adjustment of the
                    civil to the solar year; but they were probably not sufficiently versed in
                    astronomy to be aware of the practical difficulties which their regulation had

                    with the year, or to find the day of the week corresponding to a given day of
                    any year of the era. As the number of days in the week and the number in the
                    year are prime to one another, two successive years cannot begin with the same
                    day; for if a common year begins, for example, with Sunday, the following year
                    will begin with Monday, and if a leap year begins with Sunday, the year
                    following will begin with Tuesday. For the sake of greater generality, the days
                    of the week are denoted by the first seven letters of the alphabet, A, B, C, D,
                    E, F, G, which are placed in the calendar beside the days of the year, so that A
                    stands opposite the first day of January, B opposite the second, and so on to G,
                    which stands opposite the seventh; after which A returns to the eighth, and so
                    on through the 365 days of the year. Now, if one of the days of the week, Sunday
                    for example, is represented by E, Monday will be represented by F, Tuesday by G,
                    Wednesday by A, and so on; and every Sunday through the year will have the same
                    character E, every Monday F, and so with regard to the rest. The letter which
                    denotes Sunday is called the <hi rend="italic">Dominical Letter,</hi> or the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sunday Letter</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and when the dominical
                    letter of the year is known, the letters which respectively correspond to the
                    other days of the week become known at the same time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Solar Cycle.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In the Julian
                    calendar the dominical letters are readily found by means of a short cycle, in
                    which they recur in the same order without interruption. The number of years in
                    the intercalary period being four, and the days of the week being seven, their
                    product is 4 × 7=28; twenty-eight years is therefore a period which includes all
                    the possible combinations of the days of the week with the commencement of the
                    year. This period is called the <hi rend="italic">Solar Cycle,</hi> or the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cycle of the Sun,</hi> and restores the first day of the year to
                    the same day of the week. At the end of the cycle the dominical letters return
                    again in the same order on the same days of the month; hence a table of
                    dominical letters, constructed for twenty-eight years, will serve to show the
                    dominical letter of any given year from the commencement of the era to the
                    reformation. The cycle, though probably not invented before the time of the
                    council of Nice, is regarded as having commenced nine years before the era, so
                    that the year <hi rend="italic">one</hi> was the tenth of the solar cycle. To
                    find the year of the cycle, we have therefore the following rule: <hi
                    rend="italic">Add nine to the date, divide the sum by twenty-eight</hi><hi
                    rend="italic smallcaps"> ;</hi><hi rend="italic">the quotient is the number of
                    cycles elapsed, and the remainder is the year of the cycle.</hi> Should there be
                    no remainder, the proposed year is the twenty-eighth or last of the cycle. This
                    rule is conveniently expressed by the</p>
                <p>(&lt;zľ “Ί“θ∖</p>
                <p>—ğÿ— ], in which <hi rend="italic">x</hi> denotes the date, and the symbol <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> denotes that the remainder, which arises from the division
                    of .τ + 9 by 28, is the number required. Thus, for <hi rend="subscript"> lo4n
                    1</hi> 1840 + 9 <hi rend="subscript"> ρρλ u c</hi> /1840 + 91</p>
                <p>1840, we have = 66⅛, therefore ( — ∣</p>
                <p>= 1, and the year 1810 is the first of the solar cycle.</p>
                <p>In order to make use of the solar cycle in finding the dominical letter, it is
                    necessary to know that the first year of the Christian era began ⅛vith Saturday.
                    The dominical letter of that year, which was the tenth of the cycle, was
                    consequently B. The following year, or the 11th of the cycle, the letter was A;
                    then G. The fourth year was bissextile, and the dominical letters were F, E; the
                    following year D, and so on. In this manner it is easy to find the dominical
                    letter belonging to each of the twenty-eight years of the cycle. But at the end
                    of a century the order is interrupted in the Gregorian calendar by the secular
                    suppression of the leap year; hence the cycle can only be employed during a
                    century. In the reformed calendar the intercalary period is four hundred years,
                    which number being multiplied by seven, gives two thousand eight hundred years
                    as the interval in which the coincidence is restored between the days of the
                    year and the days of the week. This long period, however, may be reduced to four
                    hundred years; for since the dominical letter goes back five places every four
                    years, its variation in four hundred years, in the Julian calendar, was five
                    hundred places, which is equivalent to only three places (for five hundred
                    divided by seven leaves three); but the Gregorian calendar suppresses exactly
                    three intercalations in four hundred years, so that after four hundred years the
                    dominical letters must again return in the same order.</p>
                <p>Hence the following table of dominical letters for four hundred years will serve
                    to show the dominical letter of any year in the Gregorian calendar for ever. It
                    contains four columns of letters, each column serving for a century. In order to
                    find the column from which the letter in any given case is to be taken, strike
                    off the two last figures of the date, divide the preceding figures by four, and
                    the remainder will indicate the column. The symbol X, employed in the formula at
                    the top of the column, denotes the date after the two last figures have been
                    suppressed. For example, required the dominical letter of the year 1839? In this
                    case X = 18, therefore <hi rend="superscript"> =</hi> 2; and in the second
                    column of letters, opposite 39, we find F, which is the letter of the proposed
                    year.</p>

                <p>It deserves to be remarked, that as the dominical letter of the first year of the
                    era was B, the first column of the above table will give the dominical letter of
                    every year from the commencement of the era to the reformation. For this purpose
                    divide the date by 28, and the letter opposite the remainder, in the first
                    column of figures, is the dominical letter of the year. For example, suppose the
                    date to be 1148. On dividing this number by 28, the remainder is 0, or 28; and
                    opposite 28, in the first column of letters, we find D, C, which, therefore, are
                    the dominical letters of the year 1148.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lunar Cycle and Golden Number.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In
                    connecting the lunar month with the solar year, the framers of the
                    ecclesiastical calendar adopted the period of Meton, which they supposed to be
                    exact. A different arrangement has, however, been followed with respect to the
                    distribution of the months. The lunations are supposed to consist of twenty-nine
                    and thirty days alternately, or the lunar year of 354 days; and in order to make
                    up nineteen solar years, six embolismic or intercalary months, of thirty days
                    each, are introduced in the course of the cycle, and one of twenty-nine days at
                    the end. This gives 19 × 354 + 6 × 30 + 29 = 6935 days, to be distributed among
                    235 lunar months. But every leap year one day must be added to the lunar month
                    in which the 29th of February is included. Now if leap year happens on the
                    first, second, or third year of the period, there will be five leap years in the
                    period, but only four when the first leap year falls on the fourth. In the
                    former case the number of days in the period becomes 6940, and in the Jatter
                    6939. The mean length of the cycle is therefore 6939^ days, agreeing exactly
                    with nineteen Julian years.</p>
                <p>By means of the lunar cycle the new moons of the calendar were indicated before
                    the reformation. As the cycle restores these phenomena to the same days of the
                    civil month, they will fall on the same days in any two years which occupy the
                    same place in the cycle; consequently a table of the moon’s phases for 19 years
                    will serve for any year whatever when we know its number in the cycle. This
                    number is called the <hi rend="italic">Golden Number.,</hi> either because it
                    was so termed by the Greeks, or because it was usual to mark it with red letters
                    in the calendar. The Golden Numbers were introduced into the calendar about the
                    year 530, but disposed as they would have been if they had been inserted at the
                    time of the council of Nice. The cycle is supposed to commence with the year in
                    which the new moon falls on the 1st of January, which took place the year
                    preceding the commencement of our era. Hence, to find the Golden Number N, we
                    have N = ( —ļō—) , which gives the following rule: <hi rend="italic">Add</hi> 1
                    <hi rend="italic">to the date, divide the sum by</hi> 19; <hi rend="italic">the
                    quotient is the number of cycles elapsed, and the remainder is the Golden
                    Number.</hi> When the remainder is 0, the proposed year is of course the last or
                    19th of the cycle. It ought to be remarked that the new moons, determined in
                    this manner, may differ from the astronomical new moons sometimes so much as two
                    days. The reason is, that the sum of the solar and lunar inequalities, which are
                    compensated in the whole period, may amount in certain cases to 10°, and thereby
                    cause the new moon to arrive on the second day before or after its mean
                    time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dionysian Period.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The cycle of the
                    sun brings back the days of the month to the same day of the week; the lunar
                    cycle restores the new moons to the same day of the month; therefore 28 × 19 =
                    532 years, includes all the variations in respect of the new moons and the
                    dominical letters, and is consequently a period after which the new moons again
                    occur on the same day of the month and the same clay of the week. This is called

                <p><hi rend="italic">Cycle of Indiction.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Besides the
                    solar and lunar cycles, there is a third of 15 years, called the cycle of
                    indiction, frequently employed in the computations of chronologists. This period
                    is not astronomical, like the two former; but has reference to certain judicial
                    acts which took place at stated epochs under the Greek emperors. Its
                    commencement is referred to the 1st of January of the year 313 of the common
                    era. By extending it backwards, it will be found that the first of the era was
                    the fourth of the cycle of indiction. The number of any year in this cycle will

                    proposed by the celebrated Joseph Scajiger as an universal measure of
                    chronology, is formed by taking the continued product of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193347133" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7133-0010"/>the three cycles of the sun,
                    of the moon, and of the indiction, and is consequently 28 × 19 × 15 = 7980
                    years. In the course of this long period no two years can be expressed by the
                    same numbers in all the three cycles. Hence, when the number of any proposed
                    year in each of the cycles is known, its number in the Julian period can be
                    determined by the resolution of a very simple problem of the indeterminate
                    analysis. It is unnecessary, however, in the present case, to exhibit the
                    general solution of the problem, because when the number in the period
                    corresponding to any one year in the common era has been ascertained, it is easy
                    to establish the correspondence for all other years, without having again
                    recourse to the direct solution of the problem. We shall therefore find the
                    number of the Julian period corresponding to the first of our era.</p>
                <p>We have already seen that the year 1 of the era had 10 for its number in the
                    solar cycle, 2 in the lunar cycle, arid 4 in the cycle of indiction: the
                    question is therefore to find a number such, that when it is divided by the
                    three numbers 28, 19, and 15 respectively, the three quotients shall be 10, 2,
                    and 4.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">x, y,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">z,</hi> be the three
                    quotients of the divisions; the number sought will then be expressed by 28 <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> + 10, by 19 <hi rend="italic">y</hi> + 2, or by 15 <hi
                    rend="italic">z</hi> + 4. Hence the two equations 28 <hi rend="italic">x</hi> +
                    10 - 19 <hi rend="italic">y</hi> + 2 = 15 <hi rend="italic">z</hi> + 4.</p>
                <p>To resolve the equation 28 <hi rend="italic">x</hi> + 10 = 19 <hi rend="italic"

                    wanted) is therefore 4; for 15 × 4 = 60. Assuming therefore <hi rend="italic"
                    >p'</hi> = 4, we have m' = 60 — 52 = 8; and consequently, since <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> = 19 m' + 15, <hi rend="italic">x</hi> = 19 × 8 + 16 = 168.
                    The number required is consequently 20 × 168 + 10 = 4714.</p>
                <p>Having found the number 4714 for the first of the era, the correspondence of the
                    years of the cra and of the period is as follows:</p>
                <p>Period, 4714, 4715, 4716,...4713 + a·; from which it is evident, that if we take
                    P to represent the year of the Julian period, and Y the corresponding year of
                    the Christian era, we shall have</p>
                <p>P = 4713 + Y, and Y = P — 4713.</p>
                <p>With regard to the numeration of the years previous to the commencement of the
                    era, the practice is not uniform. Chronologists, in general, reckon the year
                    preceding the first of the era —1, the next preceding — 2, and so on. In this
                    case</p>
                <p>Era, —1, —2, —3,... — <hi rend="italic">x,</hi></p>
                <p>Period, 4713, 4712, 4711, ...4714— <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>P = 4714 — Y, and Y = 4714 — P.</p>
                <p>But astronomers, in order to preserve the uniformity of computation, make the
                    series of years proceed without interruption, and reckon the year preceding the
                    first of the era 0. In this case</p>
                <p>Era, 0, —1, —2,... — <hi rend="italic">x,</hi></p>
                <p>Period, 4713, 4712, 4711,...4714— <hi rend="italic">x;</hi> therefore</p>
                <p>P = 4713 — Y, and Y = 4713 — P.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Reformation of the Calendar.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    ancient church calendar was founded on two suppositions, both erroneous, namely,
                    that the year contains 365^ days, and that 235 lunations are exactly equal to
                    nineteen solar years. It could not therefore long continue to preserve its
                    correspondence with the seasons, or to indicate the days of the new moons with
                    the same accuracy. About the year 730, the venerable Bede had already perceived
                    the anticipation of the equinoxes, and remarked that these phenomena then took
                    place about three days earlier than at the time of the council of Nice. Five
                    centuries after the time of Bede, the divergence of the true equinox from the
                    21st of March, which now amounted to seven or eight days, was pointed out by
                    John of Sacrobosco, in a work published under the title <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Anni Ratione</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and by Roger
                    Bacon, in a treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Reformatione
                    Calendarii,</hi> which, though never published, was transmitted to the pope.
                    These works were probably little regarded at the time; but as the errors of the
                    calendar went on increasing, and the true length of the year, in consequence of
                    the progress of astronomy, became better known, the project of a reformation was
                    again revived in the fifteenth century; and in 1474 Pope Sextus IV. invited
                    Regiomontanus, the most celebrated astronomer of the age, to Rome, to
                    superintend the reconstruction of the calendar. The premature death of
                    Regiomontanus caused the design to be suspended for the present; but in the
                    following century numerous memoirs appeared on the subject, among the authors of
                    which were Stoeffler, Albert Pighius, John Schoener, Lucas Gauricus, and other
                    mathematicians of celebrity. At length Pope Gregory XIII. perceiving that the
                    measure was likely to confer a great eclat on his pontificate, undertook the
                    long-desired reformation; and having found the governments of the principal
                    catholic states ready to adopt his views, he issued a brief in the month of
                    March 1582, in which he abolished the use of the ancient calendar, and
                    substituted that which has since been received in almost all Christian countries
                    under the name of the <hi rend="italic">Gregorian Calendar</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">New Style.</hi> The author of the system adopted by Gregory was
                    Aloysius Lilius, or Luigi Lilio Ghiraldi, a learned astronomer and physician of
                    Naples, who died, however, before its introduction; but the individual who most
                    contributed to give the ecclesiastical calendar its present form, and who was
                    charged with all the calculations necessary for its verification, was Clavius,
                    by whom it was completely developed and explained in a great folio treatise of
                    800 pages, published in 1603, the title of which is given at the end ol this
                    article.</p>
                <p>It has already been mentioned that the error of the Julian year was corrected in
                    the Gregorian calendar by the suppression of three intercalations in 400 years.
                    In order to restore the commencement of the year to the same place in the
                    seasons that it had occupied at the time of the council of Nice, Gregory
                    directed the day following the feast of St Francis, that is to say the 5th of
                    October, to be reckoned the 15th of that month. By this regulation <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193347146" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7146-0011"/> the vernal
                    equinox, which now happened on the 11th of March, was restored to the 21st. From
                    1582 to 1700, the difference between the old and new style continued to be ten
                    days; but 1700 being a leap year in the Julian calendar, and a common year in
                    the Gregorian, the difference of the styles during the eighteenth century was
                    eleven days. The year 1800 was also common in the new calendar, and,
                    consequently, the difference in the present century is twelve days. From 1900 to
                    2100 it will be thirteen days.</p>
                <p>The restoration of the equinox to its former place in the year, and the
                    correction of the intercalary period, were attended with no difficulty; but
                    Lilius had also to adapt the lunar year to the new rule of intercalation. The
                    lunar cycle contained 6939 days 18 hours, whereas the exact time of 235
                    lunations, as we have already seen, is 235 × 29∙5305887 =6939 days 16 hours 31 ’
                    2 minutes. The difference, which is 1 hour 28∙8 minutes, amounts to a day in 308
                    years, so that at the end of this time the new moons occur one day earlier than
                    they are indicated by the golden numbers. During the 1257 years that elapsed
                    between the council of Nice and the reformation, the error had accumulated to
                    four days, so that the new moons, which were marked in the calendar as
                    happening, for example, on the 5th of the month, actually fell on the first. It
                    would have been easy to correct this error by placing the golden numbers four
                    lines higher in the new calendar; and the suppression of the ten days had
                    already rendered it necessary to place them ten lines lower, and to carry those
                    which belonged, for example, to the 5th and 6th of the month, to the 15thand
                    16th. But, supposing this correction to have been made, it would have again
                    become necessary, at the end of 308 years, to advance them one line higher, in
                    consequence of the accumulation of the error of the cycle to a whole day. On the
                    other hand, as the golden numbers were only adapted to the Julian calendar,
                    every omission of the centenary intercalation would require them to be placed
                    one line lower, opposite the 6th, for example, instead of the 5th of the month;
                    so that, generally speaking, the places of the golden numbers would have to be
                    changed every century. On this account Lilius thought fit to reject the golden
                    numbers from the calendar, and supply their place by another set of numbers
                    called <hi rend="italic">Epacts,</hi> the use of which we shall now proceed to
                    explain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Epacts.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Epact is a word of Greek
                    origin, employed in the calendar to signify the moon’s age at the end of the
                    year. The common solar year containing 365 days, and the lunar year only 354
                    days, the difference is eleven; whence, if a new moon fall on the 1st of January
                    in any year, the moon will be eleven days old on the first day of the following
                    year, and twenty-two days on the first of the third year. The numbers eleven and
                    twenty-two are therefore the epacts of those years respectively. Another
                    addition of eleven gives thirty-three for the epact of the fourth year; but in
                    consequence of the insertion of the intercalary month in each third year of the
                    lunar cycle, this epact is reduced to three. In like manner the epacts of all
                    the following years of the cycle are obtained by successively adding eleven to
                    the epact of the former year, and rejecting thirty as often as the sum exceeds
                    that number. They are therefore connected with the golden numbers by the formula
                    ' <hi rend="superscript"> n w</hi> hich <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> * <hi
                    rend="superscript"> s an</hi> y whole number; and for a whole lunar cycle
                    (supposing the first epact to be 11), they are as follows: 11, 22, 3, 14, 25, 6,
                    17, 28, 9, 20, 1,12, 23, 4, 15, 26, 7, 18, 29. But the order is interrupted at
                    the end of the cycle; for the epact of the following year, found in the same
                    manner, would be 29 + 11 = 40 = 10, whereas it ought again to be 11 to
                    correspond with the moon’s age and the golden number 1.</p>
                <p>The reason of this is, that the intercalary month, inserted at the end of the
                    cycle, contains only twenty-nine days instead of thirty; whence, after 1J has
                    been added to the epact of the year corresponding to the golden number 19, we
                    must reject twenty-nine instead of thirty, in order to have the epact of the
                    succeeding year; or, which comes to the same thing, we must add twelve to the
                    epact of the last year of the cycle, and then reject thirty as before.</p>
                <p>This method of forming the epacts might have been continued indefinitely if the
                    Julian intercalation had been followed without correction, and the cycle been
                    perfectly exact; but as neither of these suppositions is true, two equations or
                    corrections must be applied, one depending on the error of the Julian year,
                    which is called the solar equation; the other on the error of the lunar cycle,
                    which is called the lunar equation. The solar equation occurs three times in 400
                    years, namely, in every secular year which is not a leap year; for in this case
                    the omission of the intercalary day causes the new moons to arrive one day later
                    in all the following months, so that the moon’s age at the end of the month is
                    one day less than it would have been if the intercalation had been made, and the
                    epacts must accordingly be all diminished by unity. Thus the epacts 11, 22, 3,
                    14, &amp;c. become 10, 21, 2, 13, &amp;c. On the other hand, when the time by
                    which the new moons anticipate the lunar cycle amounts to a whole day, which, as
                    we have seen, it does in 308 years, the new moons will arrive one day earlier,
                    and the epacts must consequently be increased by unity. Thus the epacts 11, 22,
                    3, 14, &amp;c. in consequence of the lunar equation, become 12, 23, 4, 15,
                    &amp;c. In order to preserve the uniformity of the calendar, the epacts are
                    changed only at the commencement of a century; the correction of the error of
                    the lunar cycle is therefore made at the end of 300 years. In the Gregorian
                    calendar this error is assumed to amount to one day in 312į years, or eight days
                    in 2500 years, an assumption which requires the line of epacts to be changed
                    seven times successively at the end of each period of 300 years, and once at the
                    end of 400 years; and, from the manner in which the epacts were disposed at the
                    reformation, it was found most correct to suppose one of the periods of 2500
                    years to terminate with the year 1800.</p>
                <p>The years in which the solar equation occurs, counting front the reformation, are
                    1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500, &amp;c. Those in which the lunar
                    equation occurs are 1800, 2100, 2400, 2700, 3000, 3300, 3600, 3900, after which,
                    4300, 4600, and so on. When the solar equation occurs, the epacts are diminished
                    by unity; when the lunar equation occurs, the epacts are augmented by unity; and
                    when both equations occur together, as in 1800, 2100, 2700, &amp;c. they
                    compensate each other, and the epacts are not changed.</p>
                <p>In consequence of the solar and lunar equations, it is evident that the epact, or
                    moon’s age at the beginning of the year, must, in the course of centuries, have
                    all different values from one to thirty inclusive, corresponding to the days in
                    a full lunar month. Hence, for the construction of a perpetual calendar, there
                    must be thirty different sets or lines of epacts. These are exhibited in the
                    subjoined table (Table II.), called the <hi rend="italic">Extended Table of
                    Epacts,</hi> which is constructed in the following manner. The series of golden
                    numbers is written in a line at the top of the table, and under each golden
                    number is a column of thirty epacts, arranged in the order of the natural
                    numbers, beginning at the bottom and proceeding to the top of the column. The
                    first column, under the golden number 1, contains the epacts 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c.
                    to 30 or 0. The second column, corresponding to the following year in the lunar
                    cycle, must have all its epacts augmented by 11; the low - <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193347159" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7159-0012"/>est number therefore in the
                    column is 12, then 13,14,15, and so on. The third column, corresponding to the
                    golden number 3, has for its first epact 12 + 11 = 23; and in the same manner
                    all the nineteen columns of the table are formed. Each of the thirty lines of
                    epacts is designated by a letter of the alphabet, which serves as its index or
                    argument. The order of the letters, like that of the numbers, is from the bottom
                    of the column upwards.</p>

                </table>
                <p>In the tables of the church calendar the epacts are usually printed in Roman
                    numerals, excepting the last, which is designated by an asterisk (*), used as an
                    indefinite symbol to denote 30 or 0; and 25, which in the eight last columns is
                    expressed in Arabic characters, for a reason that will immediately be explained.
                    In the table here given, this distinction is made by means of an accent placed
                    over the last figure.</p>
                <p>At the reformation the epacts were given by the line D. The year 1600 was a leap
                    year; the intercalation accordingly took place as usual, and there was no
                    interruption in the order of the epacts; the line D was employed till 1700. In
                    that year the omission of the intercalary day rendered it necessary to diminish
                    the epacts by unity, or to pass to the line C. In 1800 the solar equation again
                    occurred, in consequence of which it was necessary to descend one line to have
                    the epacts diminished by unity; but in this year the lunar equation also
                    occurred, the anticipation of the new moons having amounted to a day; the new
                    moons accordingly happened a day earlier, which rendered it necessary to take
                    the epacts in the next higher line. There was consequently no alteration; the
                    two equations destroyed each other. The line of epacts belonging to the present
                    century is therefore C. In 1900 the solar equation occurs, after which the line
                    is B. The year 2000 is a leap year, and there is no alteration. In 2100 the
                    equations again occur together and destroy each other, so that the line B will
                    serve three centuries, from 1900 to 2200. From that year to 2300 the line will
                    be A. In this manner the line of epacts belonging to any given century is easily
                    found, and the method of proceeding is obvious. When the solar equation occurs
                    alone, the line of epacts is changed to the next lower in the table; when the
                    lunar equation occurs alone, the line is changed to the next higher; when both
                    equations occur together, no change takes place. In order that it may be
                    perceived at once to what centuries the different lines of epacts respectively
                    belong, we have placed them in a column on the left hand side of the above
                    table.</p>
                <p>The use of the epacts is to show the days of the new moons, and consequently the
                    moon’s age on any day of the year. For this purpose they are placed in the
                    calendar <pb break="no" facs="nls:193347172" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7172-0013"
                    />(Table III.) along with the days of the month and dominical letters, in a
                    retrograde order, so that the asterisk stands beside the 1st of January, 29
                    beside the 2d, 28 beside the 3d, and so on to 1, which corresponds to the 30th.
                    After this comes the asterisk, which corresponds to the 31st of January, then
                    29, which belongs to the 1st of February, and so on to the end of the year. The
                    reason of this distribution is evident. If the last lunation of any year ends,
                    for example, on the 2d of December, the new moon falls on the 3d; and the moon’s
                    age on the 31st, or at the end of the year, is twenty-nine days. The epact of
                    the following year is therefore twenty-nine. Now that lunation having commenced
                    on the 3d of December, and consisting of thirty days, will end on the 1st of
                    January. The 2d of January is therefore the day of the new moon, which is
                    indicated by the epact twenty-nine. In like manner, if the new moon fell on the
                    4th of December, the epact of the following year would be twenty-eight, which,
                    to indicate the day of next new moon, must correspond to the 3d of January.</p>

                </table>
                <p>When the epact of the year is known, the days on which the new moons occur
                    throughout the whole year are shown by this table, which is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gregorian Calendar of Epacts.</hi> For example, the epact of the
                    year 1832, as found in Table IL, is twenty-eight. This epact occurs at the 3d of
                    January, the 2d of February, the 3d of March, the 2d of April, the 1st of May,
                    &amp;c.; and these days are consequently the days of the ecclesiastical new
                    moons in 1832. The astronomical new moons generally take place one or two days,
                    sometimes even three days, earlier than those of the calendar.</p>
                <p>There are some artifices employed in the construction of this table, to which it
                    is necessary to pay attention. The thirty epacts correspond to the thirty days
                    of a full lunar month; but the lunar months consist of twenty-nine and thirty
                    days alternately; therefore in six months of the year the thirty epacts must
                    correspond only to twenty-nine days. For this reason the epacts twenty-five and
                    twenty-four are placed together, so as to belong only to one day in the months
                    of February, April, June, August, September, and November, and in the same
                    months another 25', distinguished by an accent, or by being printed in a
                    different<pb break="no" facs="nls:193347185" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7185-0014"/>
                    character, is placed beside 26, and belongs to the same day. The reason for
                    doubling the 25 was to prevent the new moons from being indicated in the
                    calendar as happening twice on the same day in the course of the lunar cycle, a
                    thing which actually cannot take place. For example, if we observe the line B in
                    Table IL, we shall see that it contains both the epacts twenty-four and
                    twenty-five, so that if these correspond to the same day of the month, two new
                    moons would be indicated as happening on that day within nineteen years. Now the
                    three epacts 24, 25, 26, can never occur in the same line; therefore in those
                    lines in which 24 and 25 occur, the 25 is accented, and placed in the calendar
                    beside 26. When 25 and 26 occur in the same line of epacts, the 25 is not
                    accented, and in the calendar stands beside 24. The lines of epacts in which 24
                    and 25 both occur, are those which are marked by one of the eight letters <hi
                    rend="italic">b, e, h, n, r,</hi> B, E, N, in all of which 25' stands in a
                    column corresponding to a golden number higher than 11. There are also eight
                    lines in which 25 and 26 occur, namely, <hi rend="italic">c,f l, p,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">s,</hi> C, F, P. In the other 14 lines, 25 either does not occur
                    at all, or it occurs in a line in which neither 24 nor 26 is found. From this it
                    appears, that if the golden number of the year exceeds 11, the epact 25, in six
                    months of the year, must correspond to the same day in the calendar as 26; but
                    if the golden number does not exceed 11, that epact must correspond to the same
                    day as 24. Hence the reason for distinguishing 25 and 25'. In using the
                    calendar, if the epact of the year is 25, and the golden not above 11, take 25;
                    but if the golden number exceeds 11, take 25'.</p>
                <p>Another peculiarity requires explanation. The epact 19' (also distinguished by an
                    accent or different character) is placed in the same line with 20 at the 31st of
                    December. It is, however, only used in those years in which the epact 19 concurs
                    with the golden number 19. When the golden number is 19, that is to say, in the
                    last year of the lunar cycle, the supplementary month contains only 29 days.
                    Hence, if in that year the epact should be 19, a new moon would fall on the 2d
                    of December, and the lunation would terminate on the 30th, so that the next new
                    moon would arrive on the 31st. The epact of the year, therefore, or 19, must
                    stand beside that day, whereas, according to the regular order, the epact
                    corresponding to the 31st of December is 20; and this is the reason for the
                    distinction.</p>
                <p>As an example of the use of the preceding tables, suppose it were required to
                    determine the moon’s age on the 10th of April 1832. In 1832 the golden number is
                    (1832 + 1∖</p>
                <p>—∙ —) = θ, <hi rend="superscript"> ar,</hi> d the line of epacts belonging to the
                    century is C. In Table II. under 9, and in the line C, we find the epact 28. In
                    the calendar, Table III. look for April, and the epact 28 is found opposite the
                    second day. The 2d of April is therefore the first day of the moon, and the 10th
                    is consequently the ninth day of the moon. Again, suppose it were required to
                    find the moon’s age on the 2d of December in the year 1916. In this case the
                    golden number is <hi rend="superscript"> = an</hi> ^ <hi rend="superscript">
                    t</hi> ^ <hi rend="superscript"> ιe</hi> ^ <hi rend="superscript"> ne</hi>
                    epacts is B. Under 17, in line B, the epact is 25'. In the calendar this epact
                    first occurs before the 2d of December at the 26th of November. The 26th of
                    November is consequently the first day of the moon, and the 2d of December is
                    therefore the seventh day.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Easter.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The next, and indeed the
                    principal use of the calendar, is to find Easter, which, according to the
                    regulation of the council of Nice, must be determined from the following
                    conditions: First, Easter must be celebrated on a Sunday; second, this Sunday
                    must <hi rend="italic">follow</hi> the 14th day of the paschal moon, so that if
                    the 14th of the paschal moon falls on a Sunday, then Easter must be celebrated
                    on the Sunday following; third, the paschal moon is that of which the 14th day
                    falls on or next follows the day of the vernal equinox; fourth, the equinox is
                    fixed invariably in the calendar on the 21st of March.</p>
                <p>From these conditions it follows, that the paschal full moon, or the 14th of the
                    paschal moon, cannot happen before the 21 st of March, and that Easter in
                    consequence cannot happen before the 22d of March. If the 14th of the moon falls
                    on the 21st, the new moon must' fall on the 8th; for 21 — 13 = 8; and the
                    paschal new moon cannot happen before the 8th; for suppose the new moon to fall
                    on the 7th, then the full moon would arrive on the 20th, or the day before the
                    equinox. The following moon would be the paschal moon. But the fourteenth of
                    this moon falls at the latest on the 18th of April, or 29 days after the 20th of
                    March; for by reason of the double epact that occurs at the 4th and 5th of
                    April, this lunation has only 29 days. Now, if in this case the 18th of April is
                    Sunday, then Easter must be celebrated on the following Sunday, or the 25th of
                    April. Hence Easter Sunday cannot happen earlier than the 22d of March, or later
                    than the 25th of April.</p>
                <p>Hence we derive the following rule for finding Easter Sunday from the tables,
                    lsŕ, Find from Table II. the epact of the proposed year. 2<hi rend="italic"

                    first of the moon; the following will be the fourteenth of the moon, or the day
                    of the full paschal moon. 4∕A, Find from Table I. the dominical letter of the
                    year, and observe in the calendar the first day after the fourteenth of the
                    moon, which corresponds to the dominical letter; this will be Easter Sunday.</p>

                    the calendar (Table III.) at the !9th. Therefore, in 1840, Easter Sunday falls
                    on the 19th of April.</p>
                <p>Such is the very complicated and artificial, though highly ingenious method,
                    invented by Lilius, for the determination of Easter and the other movable
                    feasts. Its principal, though perhaps least obvious advantage, consists in its
                    being entirely independent of astronomical tables, or indeed of any celestial
                    phenomena whatever; so that all chances of disagreement arising from the
                    inevitable errors of tables, or the uncertainty of observation, are avoided, and
                    Easter determined without the possibility of mistake. But this advantage is only
                    procured by the sacrifice of some accuracy: for notwithstanding the cumbersome
                    apparatus employed, the conditions of the problem are not always exactly
                    satisfied, nor is it possible that they can be always satisfied by any similar
                    method of proceeding. The equinox is fixed on the 21st of March, though the sun
                    enters Aries generally on the 20th of that month, sometimes even on the 19th. It
                    is therefore quite possible that a full moon may arrive after the true equinox,
                    and yet precede the 21st of March. This therefore would not be the paschal moon
                    of the calendar, though it undoubtedly ought to be so, if the intention of the
                    council of Nice were rigidly followed<pb break="no" facs="nls:193347198"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-7198-0015"/>. The new moons indicated by the epacts also
                    differ from the astronomical new moons, and even from the mean new moons, in
                    general by one or two days. In imitation of the Jews, who counted the time of
                    the new moon, not from the moment of the actual phase, but from the time the
                    moon first became visible after the conjunction, the fourteenth day of the moon
                    is regarded as the full moon; but the moon is in opposition generally on the
                    16th day; therefore, when the new moons of the calendar nearly concur with the
                    true new moons, the full moons are considerably in error. The epacts are also
                    placed so as to indicate the full moons generally one or two days after the true
                    full moons; but this was done purposely, to avoid the chance of concurring with
                    the Jewish passover, which the framers of the calendar seem to have considered a
                    greater evil than that of celebrating Easter a week too late.</p>
                <p>We will now show in what manner this whole apparatus of methods and tables may be
                    dispensed with, and the Gregorian calendar reduced to a few simple formulae of
                    easy computation. And, first, to find the dominical letter.</p>
                <p>Let L denote the number of the dominical letter of any given year of the era.
                    Then, since every year which is not a leap year ends with the same day as that
                    with which it began, the dominical letter of the following year must be (L — 1),
                    retrograding one letter every common year. After <hi rend="italic">x</hi> years,
                    therefore, the number of the letter will be (L — <hi rend="italic">xp</hi> But
                    as L can never exceed 7, the number <hi rend="italic">x</hi> will always exceed
                    L after the first seven years of the era. In order therefore to render the
                    subtraction possible, L must be increased by some multiple of 7, as <hi
                    rend="italic">7m,</hi> and the formula then becomes <hi rend="italic">(7m</hi> +
                    L — <hi rend="italic">x).</hi> In the year preceding the first of the era, the
                    dominical letter was C; for that year, therefore, we have L = 3; consequently
                    for any succeeding year <hi rend="italic">x, L = (7m</hi> + 3 — <hi
                    rend="italic">x),</hi> the years being all supposed to consist of 365 days. But
                    every fourth year is a leap year, and the effect of the intercalation is to
                    throw the dominical letter one place farther back. The above expression must
                    therefore be dimi-</p>
                <p>X iχ∖</p>
                <p>nished by the number of units in -, or by ſ-1 (this notation being used to denote
                    the quotient, <hi rend="italic">in a whole number,</hi> that arises from
                    dividing <hi rend="italic">x</hi> by 4). Hence in the Julian calendar the
                    dominical letter is given by the equation L = 7m + 3 — <hi rend="italic">x—</hi>
                    β) .</p>
                <p>∖4∕w</p>
                <p>This equation gives the dominical letter of any year from the commencement of the
                    era to the reformation. In order to adapt it to the Gregorian calendar, we must
                    first add the 10 days that were left out of the year 1582; in the second place
                    we must add one day for every century that has elapsed since 1600, in
                    consequence of the secular suppression of the intercalary day; and lastly, we
                    must deduct the units contained in a fourth of the same number, because every
                    fourth centesimal year is still a leap year. Denoting therefore the number of
                    the century (or the date after the two right-hand digits have been struck out)
                    by <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> the value of L must be increased by 10 + (c — 16) —

                <p>This formula is perfectly general, and easily calculated.</p>
                <p>As an example, let us take the year 1839. In this case, *= <hi rend="superscript"

                    =0. Hence</p>
                <p>∖ 4 <hi rend="italic">Jw</hi></p>
                <p>L = <hi rend="italic">7m</hi> + 6 — 1839 — 459 + 2 — 0. L <hi rend="italic">=
                    7m</hi> — 2290 = 7 × 328 — 2290. L = 6 = F.</p>
                <p>The year therefore begins with Monday. It will be remembered that in a leap year
                    there are always two dominical letters, one of which is employed till the 29th
                    of February, and the other till the end of the year. In this case, as the
                    formula supposes the intercalation already made, the resulting letter is that
                    which applies after the 29th of February. Before the intercalation the dominical
                    letter had retrograded one place less. Thus for 1840 the formula gives D; during
                    the first two months, therefore, the dominical letter is E.</p>
                <p>In order to investigate a formula for the epact, let us make</p>
                <p>E = the true epact of the given year;</p>
                <p>J = the Julian epact, that is to say, the number the epact would have been if the
                    Julian year had been still in use, and the lunar cycle had been exact;</p>
                <p>S — the correction depending on the solar year; M = the correction depending on
                    the lunar cycle; then the equation of the epact will be</p>
                <p>E = J + s + Μ; so that E will be known when the numbers J, S, and M, are
                    determined.</p>
                <p>The epact J depends on the golden number N, and must be determined from the fact
                    that in 1582, the first year of the reformed calendar, N was 6, and J = 26. For
                    the following years, therefore, the golden numbers and epacts are as
                    follows:</p>
                <p>1583, N = 7, J = 26 + 11 — 30 = 7;</p>
                <p>1584, N= 8, J= 7 + 11 =18;</p>
                <p>1585, N= 9, J = 18+11 =29;</p>
                <p>1586, N= 10, J = 29 + 11 — 30 = 10; <hi rend="smallcaps">, . ,t</hi> ∕26+11(N-6)∖
                    ŋ , and in general J = { — - . But the nume-</p>

                    fraction becomes by reduction 11 N — 40 = 11 N — 10 (the 30 being rejected, as
                    the remainder only is sought) = N + 10 (N — 1); therefore, ultimately <hi
                    rend="subscript"> T</hi> _ ∕N+ 10(N-1)∖ <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> k 30 <hi
                    rend="italic">Jr</hi></p>
                <p>On account of the solar equation S, the epact J must be diminished by unit every
                    centesimal year, excepting always the fourth. After <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    centuries, therefore, it must be diminished by a: — . Now, as 1600 was a leap
                    year, the first correction of the Julian intercalation took place in 1700;
                    hence, taking <hi rend="italic">c</hi> to denote the number of the century as
                    before, the correction becomes (c — 16) — (-—r— ì , which must be deducted from
                    J. We</p>

                <p>With regard to the lunar equation M, we have already stated that in the Gregorian
                    calendar the epacts are increased by unit at the end of every period <hi
                    rend="italic">of 300</hi> years, seven times successively, and the following
                    increase takes place at the end of400 years. This gives eight to be added in a
                    period of twenty-five centuries, and — in <hi rend="italic">x</hi>

                    twelve times in 3700 years, or eleven times successively at the end of 300
                    years, and then at the end of 400. In strict accuracy, therefore, <hi

                    exhibited under a variety of forms, but the above is perhaps the best adapted

                <p>Having determined the epact of the year, it only remains to find Easter Sunday

                <p>P=the number of days from the 21st of March to the 15th of the paschal moon,

                    since Easter is the Sunday following the 14th of the moon, we have p=P +
                    (L-Z).</p>
                <p>The value of L is always given by the formula for the dominical letter, and P and
                    <hi rend="italic">l</hi> are easily deduced from the epact, as will appear from
                    the following considerations.</p>
                <p>When P=l, the full moon is on the 21 st of March, and the new moon on the eighth
                    (21 —13=8), therefore the moon’s age on the 1st of March (which is the same as
                    on the 1st of January) is twenty-three days; the epact of the year is
                    consequently twenty-three. When P=2 the new moon falls on the ninth, and the
                    epact is consequently twenty-two; and, in general, when P becomes 1 +x, E
                    becomes 23— <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> therefore P + E = l + &lt;r + 23 — <hi

                    D is the dominical letter of the calendar belonging to the 22d of March. But it
                    is evident that when <hi rend="italic">l</hi> is increased by unity, that is to
                    say, when the full moon falls a day later, the epact of the year is diminished
                    by unity; therefore, in general, when Z=4+a?, E=23— <hi rend="italic">-x,</hi>
                    whence Z+E=27 and Z=27—E. But P can never be less than 1 nor <hi rend="italic"
                    >l</hi> less than 4, and in both cases E=23. When, therefore, E is greater than
                    23, we must add 30 in order that P and <hi rend="italic">l</hi> may have
                    positive values in the formula P=24 — E and Z=27—E. Hence there are two
                    cases.</p>

                    or the number of days from the 21st of March to Easter Sunday. It will be
                    remarked, that as (L — Z) cannot either be 0 or negative, we must add 7 to L as
                    often as may be necessary, in order that (L — Z) may be a whole positive
                    number.</p>
                <p>By means of the formulae which we have now given for the dominical letter, the
                    golden number, and the epact, Easter Sunday may be computed for any year after
                    the reformation, without the assistance of any tables whatever. As an example,
                    suppose it were required to compute Easter for the year 1840. By substituting
                    this number in the formula for the dominical letter, we have a? =1840, (1 P∖</p>

                <p>The Gregorian calendar was introduced into Spain, Portugal, and part of Italy,
                    the same day as at Rome. In France it was received in the same year in the month
                    of December, and by the Catholic states of Germany the year following. In the
                    Protestant states of Germany the Julian calendar was adhered to till the year
                    1700, when it was decreed by the diet of Ratisbon that the new style and the
                    Gregorian correction of the intercalation should be adopted. Instead, however,
                    of employing the golden numbers and epacts for the determination of Easter and
                    the movable feasts, it was resolved that the equinox and the paschal moon should
                    be found by astronomical computation from the Rudolphine tables. But this
                    method, though at first view it may appear more accurate, was soon found to be
                    attended with numerous inconveniences, and was at length, in 1774, abandoned at
                    the instance of Frederic II. king of Prussia. In Denmark and Sweden the reformed
                    calendar was received about the same time as in the Protestant states of
                    Germany. Russia still adheres to the Julian reckoning.</p>
                <p>In Great Britain the alteration of the style was for a long time successfully
                    opposed by popular prejudice. The inconvenience, however, of using a different
                    date from that employed by the greater part of Europe, in matters of history and
                    chronology, began to be generally felt; and at length, in 1751, an act of
                    parliament was passed for the adoption of the new style in all public and legal
                    transactions. The difference of the two styles, which then amounted to eleven
                    days, was removed by ordering the day following the 2d of September of the year
                    1752 to be accounted the 14th of that month; and in order to preserve uniformity
                    in future, the Gregorian rule of intercalation respecting the secular years was
                    adopted. At the same time, the commencement of the legal year was changed from
                    the 25th of April to the 1st of January. With respect to the movable feasts,
                    Easter is determined by the rule laid down by the council of Nice; but instead
                    of employing the new moons and epacts, the golden numbers are prefixed to the
                    days of <hi rend="italic">doe full</hi> moons. In those years in which the line
                    of epacts is changed in the Gregorian calendar, the golden numbers are removed
                    to different days, and of course a new table is required whenever the solar or
                    lunar equation occurs. The golden numbers have been placed so that Easter may
                    fall on the same day as in the Gregorian calendar. The calendar of the church of
                    England is therefore from century to century the same in form as the old Roman
                    calendar, excepting that the golden numbers indicate the full moons instead of
                    the new moons.</p>
