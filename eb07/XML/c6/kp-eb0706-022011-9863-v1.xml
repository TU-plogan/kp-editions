                <p><label type="entry">CASTE</label>. By this term is here meant the classification
                    and distribution of the members of a community into certain classes or orders,
                    for the performance of certain functions, with the enjoyment of certain
                    privileges, or the endurance of certain burthens; and the establishment of
                    hereditary permanence in these orders, the son being ordained to perform the
                    functions, to enjoy the privileges, or sustain the burthens, of the father, and
                    to marry only in his own tribe, without mixture of classes, in regular
                    succession, throughout all ages.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">Caste</hi> is borrowed from the Portuguese. It ∣ was
                    the term applied by that people, who first of the, European nations formed
                    establishments in India, to the classes which they found established upon this
                    principle among the inhabitants of that portion of the globe; and from them, as
                    it was owing to their intercourse that the rest of the nations of modern Europe
                    first derived their familiarity with the manners and institutions of the people
                    of India, the term made its way, and became established in the other languages
                    of Europe.</p>
                <p>The institution itself appears to have been very extensively introduced even in
                    the early ages of society.</p>
                <p>In regard to the ancient Egyptians, the fact is universally and familiarly known.
                    The President de Goguet, who, with singular industry, and no ordinary judgment
                    and sagacity, explored the remains of ancient times, comprises a great body of
                    history in <hi rend="italic">a few</hi> words. “We may farther observe,” says
                    he, “that, in the Assyrian empire, the people were distributed into a number of
                    tribes, and that professions were hereditary, that is to say, children were not
                    permitted to quit their father’s occupation and embrace another. Wc know not the
                    time nor the author of this institution, which from the highest antiquity
                    prevailed over almost all Asia, as well as in several other countries.” It is
                    not necessary here to surcharge the reader ⅜vith the authorities which he
                    quotes. The passage itself (p. i. b. i. ch. i. art. 3) will be consulted by all
                    who distrust the legitimacy of his inference, or desire to prosecute the
                    inquiry.</p>
                <p>It is stated in the common histories of Greece that Cecrops distributed into four
                    hereditary classes or tribes all <pb break="no"

                    inhabitants of Attica. And we are informed by Plutarch, in his Life of Theseus,
                    that by this prince the class of priests, and that of nobles, in other words,
                    the magistrates or military leaders, were united into one, and therefore the
                    society was composed of three classes: 1, The sacerdotal, legislating, and
                    ruling class; 2, the class of husbandmen; and, 3, the class of tradesmen. “To
                    the nobility,” says the illustrious biographer, “he committed the choice of
                    magistrates, the teaching and dispensing of the laws, and the interpretation of
                    all holy and religious things; the whole city, as to all other matters, being as
                    it were reduced to an exact equality; the nobles excelling the rest in honour,
                    the husbandmen in profit, and the artificers in number. And Theseus was the
                    first who, as Aristotle says, out of an inclination to popular government,
                    parted with the regal power; which Homer also appears to attest in his catalogue
                    of the ships, where he gives the name of <hi rend="smallcaps">People</hi> to the
                    Athenians alone.” There is a passage near the beginning of Plato’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Timaeus,</hi> which, though in a work of fancy, is not without
                    some weight, as evidence either of conclusions which were drawn by men of
                    research, or of traditions which were current among the people. In this passage
                    not only is it asserted, that in the primeval state of the inhabitants of Attica
                    they ιe-sembled the Egyptians in their division into hereditary classes and
                    professions, but a very accurate description is given of those classes, five in
                    number, viz. 1, The class of priests; 2, The class of handicrafts; 3, The class
                    of shepherds and hunters; 4, The class of ploughmen; 5, The military class.

                <p>It is worthy of observation that certain vestiges at least of that ancient
                    institution are still visible in Egypt. “La distinction par familles,” says
                    General Reynier <hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic">l'Egypte,</hi> p.
                    56), <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> se retrouve encore dans les villes:
                    ľéxercisc des arts ct metiers est héréditaire: le fils imite les procédés de son
                    père, et ne les perfectionne pas.”</p>
                <p>We have a remarkable passage to prove that among the ancient Persians the same
                    division into castes existed which still obtains among the Hindus. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Zendavesta,</hi> as translated by M. Anquetil Duperron, it is
                    said,—“Ormusd declared, there are three measures (literally weights, that is,
                    tests or rules) of conduct, four states, and five places of dignity. The states
                    are, that of the priest; that of the soldier; that of the husbandman, the source
                    of riches; and that of the artizan or labourer.” “We are told,” says Sir John
                    Malcolm <hi rend="italic">(Hist, of Persia,</hi> i. 205), “that Jemsheed divided
                    his subjects into four classes, and that he allotted to each a separate and
                    fixed station in life, which seems to imply that the condition of the ancient
                    Persians was like that of the modern Hindus; and that the extraordinary
                    institution of cast which now exists in India was once known in Persia.” Sir
                    John proceeds to state some reasons which induce him to doubt the reality of the
                    fact; in not one of which, however, is there a particle of weight.</p>
                <p>Sir John quotes and translates for us a passage from Strabo, which asserts that a
                    similar institution existed in Iberia. “Four kinds or classes of people
                    inhabited that country. From what they consider the first class, they appoint
                    their kings, according to nearness of kindred and seniority; these administer
                    justice, and head their armies. The second is of priests, who take charge of
                    their political rights with respect to their neighbours; the third of soldiers
                    and husbandmen; the fourth of the people in general, who are slaves of the king,
                    and perform every menial office.” This account of the distinctions of the castes
                    is evidently incorrect, and by a man who was not well informed. The fact of the
                    Iberians being distributed in a remarkable and uncommon manner he knew,
                    otherwise there would have been no occasion to single out the fact in the
                    description of this particular people. He knew also that they were divided into
                    four principal classes. With regard to the matters of detail, however, his words
                    bear internal evidence that either his information had been vague and
                    inaccurate, or that his recollection had become so.</p>
                <p>From a dissertation of Mr Joinville on the religion and manners of the people of
                    Ceylon <hi rend="italic">(Asiatic</hi><hi rend="italic">Researches,</hi> vii.
                    430), we find that there is sufficient evidence to prove the existence of a
                    similar institution anciently among the Buddhists of Ceylon, and by consequence
                    to infer it among the other Buddhists spread over so large a portion of
                    Asia.</p>
                <p>After this evidence of the general diffusion of the institution of castes in the
                    rude ages of the world, especially in Asia, <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> there
                    is a temptation, from the follow ing passage σf Herodotus (lib. i. cap. 101), to
                    infer its existence among the Medes at the commencement of the monarchy. Eďn δ⅛'

                    the passage which serves to fix the meaning of the word jwrø; and the names, it
                    is plain, are words of the ancient Median language. But we know that the Mαyo∕
                    were the priests; and hence there is reason to conclude that the other words
                    also are names of classes and professions; in other words, of hereditary
                    castes.</p>
                <p>The institution of castes may be traced in places with which we are more
                    intimately connected. Mr Millar, to w'hom the world is indebted for almost the
                    first lessons which it received, in tracing the facts of history up to the
                    general laws of the human mind, has called our attention to the fact, that in
                    the ancient condition of our Saxon ancestors they were divided into four
                    classes: 1, The artificers and tradesmen; 2, the husbandmen; 3, those who
                    exercised the honourable profession of arms; and, 4, the clergy. Mr Millar adds
                    <hi rend="italic">(Historical View of the English Government,</hi> b. i. ch.
                    ii.), “From the natural course of things, it should seem, that in every country
                    where religion has had so much influence as to introduce a great body of
                    ecclesiastics, the people, upon the first advances made in agriculture and in
                    manufactures, are usually distributed into the same number of classes or orders.
                    This distribution is accordingly to be found, not only in all the European
                    nations formed upon the ruins of the Roman empire, but in other ages and in very
                    distant parts of the globe. The ancient inhabitants of Egypt are said to have
                    been divided into the clergy, the military people, the husbandmen, and the
                    artificers. The establishment of the four great <hi rend="italic">castes,</hi>
                    in the country of Indostan, is precisely of the same nature.”</p>
                <p>Human nature is very uniform in the phenomena which it exhibits. The new world
                    displays a striking resemblance to the old. The same stage of society presents
                    nearly the same results. There is reason to conclude that something which
                    resembled the institution of castes existed among the ancient inhabitants of
                    Peru and Mexico. The Count Carli, the celebrated author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lettres Américaines,</hi> when treating (Lett, xiii. and xiv.) of the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193349889?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-9889-0222"/>
                    laws of the Peruvians, says, “Les citoyens furent distribués en classes ou
                    tribus. Il n’étoit pas permis, ni par mariage, ni par changement d’habitation,
                    de confondre une classe avec l’autre; car la loi defendoit de se marier dans une
                    autre famille que celle d’où l'on sortoit.</p>
                <p>N’oublions pas le soin qu’on avoit de l’éducation des enfans. C’étoit toujours le
                    père qui élevoit son fils. L’éducation consistoit à apprendre aux enfans
                    roturiers le metier que chaque père de famille exerçoit,” &amp;c. We are
                    informed by Clavigero <hi rend="italic">(flist. of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mexico,</hi> b. iv. § 5), that “the sons in general learned the trades of their
                    fathers, and embraced their professions; thus they perpetuated the arts in
                    families, to the advantage of the state.”</p>
                <p>Such is the extent to which this institution has existed on the surface of the
                    globe. We shall next endeavour to ascertain the state and condition of the human
                    mind, to which it may be considered as owing its origin.</p>
                <p>[ The lowest and rudest state in which the human race are found to exist, may, in
                    a certain general way, be described as the hunter state. That of the shepherd is
                    ’ the next stage in the progress toward the advantages ’ of civilized life. The
                    agricultural state succeeds; when men begin to cultivate the ground for the
                    means of subsistence, and experience the benefit of fixed habitations. As long
                    as they continue in the condition of hunters or of shepherds, the division of
                    labour is unknown, and all the multitude of blessings which it brings. Every
                    family is itself the author of all the simple accommodations which it knows. The
                    tent or hovel, the waggon or cart, is constructed by the men; the coarse garment
                    is spun and even woven by the women. In this situation of things, the
                    accommodations with which it is possible for human beings to supply themselves
                    are few and imperfect, and life is a scene of privation.</p>
                <p>When population has so far multiplied as to render the produce of flocks and
                    herds insufficient for the means of subsistence, and the cultivation of the land
                    has become necessary, the inconveniences arising from the want of the division
                    of labour become still more sensible and oppressive. The labours of the field
                    are neglected while the family are engaged at the loom or in repelling the
                    incursions of an enemy. The accommodations of lodging, of clothing, of taste,
                    and fancy, are wretchedly supplied, when the business of extracting the means of
                    subsistence from the soil requires the greater part of their time and
                    attention.</p>
                <p>The progress, however, of human improvement, though not necessarily, is commonly,
                    in point of fact, at least in the more uncultivated ages, exceedingly slow. Men
                    continue to suffer under the inconveniences which their present condition
                    imposes upon them, complaining of their miseries, but unable to form a clear
                    conception of the means of exemption, and doubtful of all the remedies which are
                    pointed out to their attention. In the mean time, as the human mind is
                    essentially progressive, and, unless in very extraordinary circumstances, never
                    fails to make progression, the uneasiness which is felt under the inconveniences
                    of a state to which the mind has become superior, and above which it is rising
                    higher and higher every day, is continually increasing, and at last rises to
                    such a height that some change is unavoidable; and the society are prepared to
                    welcome the most plausible of the schemes which are proposed to them.</p>
                <p>The grand steps which are made in improving the condition of mankind, though
                    essentially the result of a progression in the minds of the society taken as a
                    whole, are commonly the immediate suggestion of some one individual, or small
                    number of individuals, whose conception of the necessity of a change, and of the
                    means of relief, is more clear and determinate than that of the rest of the
                    community.</p>
                <p>In the earliest stages, when the human mind is weak, and prone to superstition,
                    the individuals who project the great improvements in the state of society
                    endeavour to accelerate the consent of the people, and overcome their reluctance
                    to innovation, by giving to their projects the character of a divine revelation
                    and command. The first legislators of almost every country we find to have
                    represented themselves as depositaries of the divine will, and intrusted with a
                    revelation from heaven.</p>
                <p>If we take the Hindus as a model, the people divided into castes with whom our
                    acquaintance is the most complete, we shall conclude that some individual, wise
                    enough to perceive the cause of the inconveniences under which men suffer while
                    the division of labour is unknown, and placed in circumstances which enabled him
                    to clothe himself with a divine authority, overcame in most places the
                    reluctance of the people to so great a change of their manners and habits, and
                    accelerated the date of their improvement, by persuading them that the divine
                    power or divine powers now commanded them to be divided into classes for the
                    performance of certain offices.</p>
                <p>In the early stages of society, however, the wants of men are few; and the ideas
                    of the legislator himself are incapable of extending to a great variety of
                    cases. In such periods the power of superstition is always exceedingly great.
                    Unacquainted with the laws of nature, and exposed to the most dreadful
                    vicissitudes, which they are altogether unable to foresee, human life appears to
                    men in that situation to hang altogether upon invisible powers. The human mind
                    is incessantly occupied with conjectures respecting what those unknown powers
                    will produce, and with tormenting apprehensions that they will produce evil
                    rather than good. The persons who, in this state of things, are skilful enough
                    to create a persuasion that they are better acquainted than others with the will
                    of these powers, more especially if accompanied with a persuasion that they have
                    an influence over that will, and can turn it more or less whichever way they
                    please, become an object of supreme regard. Nothing can be done without them.
                    They are the most important class in the community. When society is first
                    divided into classes for the sake of the division of labour, the priests,
                    therefore, are always a separate class, and always in the place of highest
                    distinction.</p>
                <p>After the evils to which men in the,rude state of society conceive themselves
                    liable from the unknown and invisible authors of physical events, the evils to
                    which they are liable from the incursions of hostile men appear the next in
                    magnitude. While the institutions of society are imperfect, and the human mind
                    is weak, these evils are very great, and present a terrific picture to an
                    imagination perpetually haunted with fear; and, in the same circumstances, the
                    advantages derivable from hostile incursions upon others appear the greatest. In
                    the rude ages of society, therefore, the soldier is always a character of great
                    importance. He is the barrier against those evils which rank next in order after
                    the evils against which the priest affords relief. When classes are first
                    formed, the military are, therefore, always a separate class, and next in rank
                    and veneration to the class of the priests. It is remarkable that the rank and
                    consequence of both classes are chiefly founded upon fear. It is also
                    remarkable, though a natural consequence, that, in all ages, they are most apt
                    to be venerated by the most timid persons, the most timid sex, for example, over
                    whose imagination the priest and the soldier have a proverbial sway. It is
                    further observable, and a necessary consequence, that since the fears with
                    respect to invisible powers, and with respect to the incursions of hostile men,
                    gradually decline as society advances, and have less and less effect upon the
                    imaginations even of those who are most apt to be governed by <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193349902?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-9902-0223"/> the passion of
                    fear, the respect for the castes of priest and soldier are destined to sink in
                    relative importance as the institutions of society are improved, and the human
                    mind becomes strong.</p>
                <p>After provision is made, in that early stage of society which we are endeavouring
                    to describe, against the two classes of fears to which the priest and the
                    soldier oppose their respective shields, the care of subsistence is the object
                    of greatest importance. A class of husbandmen, therefore, is a necessary and
                    never-failing institution; and, in the scale of rank and consequence, this order
                    follows immediately after the sacerdotal and the military castes.</p>
                <p>Besides the means of subsistence, other accommodations are required. But at first
                    very few are so much as known, and, by consequence, very few are demanded. One
                    class of the community are, therefore, supposed to be sufficient for the supply
                    of all other wants, and the performance of all other serviees.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, that reflection upon the laws of human nature would lead us to
                    draw a picture nearly the same with this, if we were called upon to describe the
                    state of society at the time when the division of labour is first introduced,
                    even if we had no specific facts to direct our inquiries. In a remarkable
                    passage in Plato, in his second book <hi rend="italic">De Republica,</hi> he
                    ascribes the origin of political association and laws to the benefits which are
                    sought for by the division of labour. Γ∕yy≡rα∕ woλ∕g, <hi rend="italic">ως

                    >ivδsης.</hi> As men cannot be supplied with accommodations in any tolerable
                    degree but by the division of labour and employments, one man producing one
                    thing, another producing another, and every man getting what he wants, by
                    exchange with other men, an association of a certain number of men is necessary
                    for the common well-being; and hence society and laws. In exact coincidence with
                    the deduction which we have presented above, he says that the simplest form of a
                    society would consist of four or five orders of mcn. Αλλα <hi rend="italic"

                    the practice; between what is in this manner inferred, and what is recorded of
                    ancient nations, and witnessed among the Hindus.</p>
                <p>Amidst all the difficulties under which, especially in rude ages, human society
                    and the human mind make progress, small are the steps which can be taken at
                    once. When professions were separated, and the vast benefits derived from the
                    separation began to be ťclt, the human mind was not sufficiently strong to
                    perceive that there was no danger whatsoever that they should ever again be
                    combined and confounded. No; it was imagined to be another grand effort of the
                    same wisdom which had made the separation, to take care of its permanence, and
                    to make provision for securing the benefits of it throughout all ages. With this
                    view it was thought necessary to ordain and sanction, by divine authority, that
                    the son should follow the profession of the father, and be subject to the
                    severest punishment if he engaged in any other occupation. To secure also, in
                    each profession, the due succession of sons to fathers, it was necessary that
                    marriage should be strictly regulated; and the method which obviously enough
                    suggested itself for that purpose was, that the members of each class, male and
                    female, should be compelled, under the severest penalties, to marry only among
                    themselves, and never, by intermarriage, to ruin and confound the separate
                    castes.</p>
                <p>So far the aim, at any rate, was good. The benefit of the whole society was the
                    object which all these regulations were accounted useful to promote; and no
                    degradation of any of the classes was either intended by any of these
                    enactments, or necessary for the ends which they were destined to serve.</p>
                <p>The degradation of one set of the castes, in comparison of another, was the
                    result of an after-thought, and in the pursuit of ends of a different
                    description. When one of the castes, as that of the priests, or the soldiers,
                    found itself possessed of an influence over the minds of the rest of the
                    community, such that it could establish certain points of belief in its own
                    favour, it was never long before it availed itself of that advantage, and pushed
                    it to the utmost. If it could inspire the belief that it was more noble, and
                    worthy of higher privileges and greater honour, than the rest of the community,
                    it never failed to get this point established as an incontrovertible right, not
                    the result of the mere will of the community, but of an absolute law of nature,
                    or even a revelation and command from God.</p>
                <p>As every elevation ofonc class implies a correspondent degradation of another,
                    and as there is no end to the elevation which one class will aim at, there is no
                    end to the degradation which will be imposed upon another, if the state of the
                    human mind is sufficiently weak to give to one class an unbounded influence over
                    the belief of another. How naturally this extreme degradation is grafted upon
                    the institution of castes, will immediately appear.</p>
                <p>As we derive our most minute and practical acquaintance with the shape into which
                    society is moulded by the establishment of castes, from our intercourse with the
                    Hindus, the particulars which are at this day exhibited in Hindustan, and
                    provided for by their laws, afford the rpost certain means of acquiring precise
                    and specific ideas concerning this remarkable institution.</p>
                <p>According to the sacred law book, entitled the <hi rend="italic">Ordi- .nanccs of
                    Menu,</hi> the Creator, “that the human race might be multiplied, caused the
                    Brahmin, the Cshatriya, the Vaisya, and the Sudra (so named from <hi
                    rend="italic">scripture, protection, wealth,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >labour),</hi> to proceed from his mouth, his arm, his thigh, and his foot.”
                    “For the sake of preserving this universe, the Being, supremely <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> glorious, allotted separate duties to those who
                    sprung respectively from his mouth, his arm, his thigh, and his foot. To
                    Brahmins lie assigned the duties of reading the Veda, of teaching it, of
                    sacrificing, of assisting others to sacrifice, of giving alms if they be rich,
                    and, if indigent, of receiving gifts; to defend the people, to give alms, to
                    sacrifice, to read the Veda, to shun the allurements of sensual gratification,
                    arc, in a few words, the duties of a Cshatriya; to keep herds of cattle, to
                    bestow largesses, to sacrifice, to read the Scripture, to carry on trade, to
                    lend at interest, and to cultivate land, arc prescribed or permitted to a
                    Vaisya. One principal duty the Supreme Ruler assigns to a Sudra, namely, to
                    serve the before-mentioned classes, without depreciating their worth.” Such is
                    the employment of the castes, and such the authority whence it is derived.</p>
                <p>The next great peculiarity is, the degree of elevation which one set of the
                    castes was enabled to usurp, and the correspondent degradation of the
                    others.</p>
                <p>1. The Brahmins, or the priests. “Since the Brahmin sprung from the most
                    excellent part,” says the same divine code immediatcly quoted, “since he was the
                    first born, and since he possesses the Veda, he is by right the chief of this
                    whole creation. Him the Being who exists of himself produced in the beginning,
                    from his own mouth, that having pcrformcd holy rites, he might present clarified
                    butter to the gods, and cakcs of rice to the progenitors of mankind, for the
                    preservation of this world. What created being, then, can surpass him, with
                    whose mouth the gods of the firmament continually feast on clarified butter, and
                    the manes of ancestors on hallowed cakes? Of created things, the most excellent
                    are those which are animated<pb break="no" facs="nls:193349915?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-9915-0224"/>; of the animated, those which subsist by
                    intelligence; of the intelligent, mankind; and of men, the sacerdotal class.
                    When a Brahmin springs to light he is born above the world, the chief of all
                    creatures. Whatever exists in the universe, is all in effect the wealth of the
                    Brahmin; since the Brahmin is entitled to it all by his primogeniture and
                    eminence of birth.”</p>
                <p>As the Brahmin exclusively, or at least to a supreme degree, engrosses the regard
                    and favour of the deity, so he is entitled to the respect and veneration of
                    mortals. Kings themselves, and the most exalted of men, are infinitely inferior
                    to the meanest of the Brahmins. “Let the king,” we again quote the ordinances of
                    Menu, <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> having risen at early dawn, respectfully
                    attend to Brahmins learned in the three Vedas, &amp;c. . . . and by their
                    decision let him abide. Constantly must he show respect to Brahmins who have
                    grown old, who know the Scriptures, who are pure.” “The king must appoint seven
                    or eight ministers, &amp;c To one learned Brahmin, distin guished among them
                    all, let the king impart his momentous counsel. To him, with full confidence,
                    let him intrust all his transactions; and with him, having taken his final
                    resolution, let him begin all his measures.” “Let him not, although in the
                    greatest distress, provoke Brahmins to anger, by whom Brahma, the all-devouring
                    fire, was created, the sea with waters not drinkable, and the moon with its wane
                    and increase. What prince would gain wealth by oppressing those who, if angry,
                    could frame other worlds, and agents of worlds,—could give being to new gods and
                    mortals? What men desirous of life would injure those by the aid of whom worlds
                    and gods perpetually subsist,—those who are rich in the knowledge of the Veda? A
                    Brahmin, whether learned or ignorant, is a powerful divinity, even as fire is a
                    powerful divinity, whether consecrated or popular. Thus, though Brahmins employ
                    themselves in all sorts of mean occupations, they must invariably be honoured;
                    for they are something transcendently divine.”</p>
                <p>The least disrespect shown to one of the sacred order is the most atrocious of
                    crimes. “For contumelious language to a Brahmin,” says the code of Menu, “a
                    Sudra must have an iron style, ten fingers long, thrust red-hot into his mouth;
                    and for offering to give instruction to priests, hot oil must be poured into his
                    mouth and ears.”</p>
                <p>The laws give to the Brahmins the most remarkable advantages over the other
                    classes of the community. Neither the person, nor so much as the property of the
                    Brahmin, can ever be touched, in awarding punishment for the most atrocious
                    crimes. “Never shall the king,” says one of the ordinances of Menu, ^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ti</hi> slay a Brahmin, though convicted of all possible
                    crimes; let him banish the offender from his realm, but with all his property
                    secure, and his body unhurt.” This privileged order was entirely exempt from
                    taxes. One of the most important of all duties is to bestow wealth upon the
                    Brahmins, by incessant gifts and donations. See article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Brahmin.</hi></p>
                <p>2. The Cshatriyas, or the military caste. Though the Brahmins look down upon this
                    class, they are looked up to by all the rest of the classes with a veneration
                    inferior only to that with which the Brahmins are regarded. The difference of
                    rank in India is not a mere ceremonial distinction. The advantages which are
                    conferred by it, or the injuries endured, are immense, and to the suffering
                    party unspeakably degrading. Any infringement, even of the external marks of the
                    abjectness of the degraded party, is punished as a heinous crime. “If a man of
                    an inferior caste,” says Halheďs <hi rend="italic">Gentoo Code,</hi> “proudly
                    affecting an equality' with <hi rend="italic">a</hi> person of superior caste,
                    should speak at the same time with him, the magistrate in that case shall punish
                    him to the extent of his abilities.” It is’ unnecessary, under this head, to
                    enter into details, which would occupy a disproportionate space.</p>
                <p>3. The Vaisyas, the agricultural and commercial class. It is still less necessary
                    to multiply particulars under this head. When the two extremes are sufficiently
                    explained, what modifications of respect or disrespect belong to the
                    intermediate stages may be easily inferred.</p>
                <p>4. As much as the Brahmin is an object of intense veneration, so much is the
                    Sudra an object of contempt, and even of abhorrence, to the other classes of his
                    countrymen. The business of the Sudras is servile labour, and their degradation
                    inhuman. The most abject and grovelling submission is imposed upon them as a
                    religious duty, and enforced by the most dreadful punishments. They are so
                    completely deprived of an equal share in the advantages of the social union,
                    that few of those advantages are reserved to them. The classes above them are
                    restrained from injuring them, even in the case of the greatest crimes, by
                    punishments far slighter than those which are appointed for injuries done to the
                    superior classes. The crimes which they commit are punished with much heavier
                    inflictions than equal crimes committed by individuals of the classes above
                    them. Neither their persons nor their labour is free. “A man of the servile
                    caste,” says the sacred ordinance of Menu, “whether bought or unbought, a
                    Brahmin may compel to perform servile duty; because such a man was created by
                    the Self-existent for the purpose of serving Brahmins.”</p>
                <p>According to the principles of the same code, the Sudra was excluded from the
                    benefits of property'. “No collection of wealth must be made by a Sudra, even
                    though he has power, since a servile man who has amassed riches gives pain even
                    to Brahmins.” “A Brahmin may seize without hesitation the goods of his Sudra
                    slave; for as that slave can have no property, his master may take his
                    goods.</p>
                <p>The degradation of the wretched Sudra extends not only to every thing in this
                    life, but even to religion, and the prospect of future happiness. “Let not a
                    Brahmin,” says the above code, “give advice, nor what remains from his table,
                    nor clarified butter of which part has been offered, nor let him give spiritual
                    counsel to such a man, nor inform him of the legal expiation for his sin; surely
                    he who declares the law to a servile man, and he who instructs him in the mode
                    of expiating sin, sinks with that very man into the hell named Asamvrita.” Not
                    only are the Sudras not allowed to read any of the sacred books; but, “if,” says
                    the <hi rend="italic">Gentoo Code,</hi> “a man of the Sooder reads the Beids of
                    the Shaster, or the Pooran, to a Brahman, a Chehteree, or a Bice” (Halheďs mode
                    of spelling the names of the four castes), “then the magistrate shall heat some
                    bitter oil, and pour it into the aforesaid Sooder’s mouth; and if a Sooder
                    listens to the Beids of the Shaster, then the oil, heated as before, shall be
                    poured into his ears, andarzeez and wax shall be melted together, and the
                    orifice of his ears shall be stopped up therewith. If a Sooder gets by heart the
                    Beids of the Shaster, the magistrate shall put him to death. . If a Sooder gives
                    much and frequent molestation to a Brahman, the magistrate shall put him to
                    death.” From this specimen of particulars a judgment may be formed with regard
                    to the rest.</p>
                <p>Though this is tbeprimary and original formation ofcastes, the institution,
                    unless where it happens to be early broken up, does not rest here. The
                    distribution of the members of the community into four classes only, and the
                    appropriation of their services to four species of employment, though a great
                    step in improvement at the time they were instituted, must have become
                    productive of many inconveniences as the wants of society multiplied. The bare
                    necessaries of life, with a few of the rudest accommodations, are all the means
                    of gratification which it affords<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193349928?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-9928-0225"/>, or is capable
                    of affording, to mankind. As the desires of mankind, however, speedily extend
                    beyond such narrow limits, a struggle must have early ensued between the first
                    principles of human nature and those of the political establishment.</p>
                <p>And this was not the only evil to which, <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> under this
                    primary institution, society was exposed. The different castes were strictly
                    commanded to marry with those exclusively of their own class and profession; and
                    the mixture of the classes by the union of the sexes was guarded against by the
                    most sanguinary laws. This, however, was a result which laws were not
                    sufficiently powerful to prevent. Irregularities occurred, and children were
                    born who belonged to no caste, and for whom there was no occupation. A more
                    calamitous event could not fall upon human society. Unholy and infamous, on
                    account of that violation of the sacred law to which they owed their unwelcome
                    birth, these wretched outcasts had no resource for subsistence except two;
                    either the bounty of the regular classes, to whom they were objects of contempt
                    and abhorrence, notof sympathy; or the plunder of thoseclasses by whom they were
                    oppressed—a resource to which they would naturally betake themselves with all
                    the ingenuity <hi rend="italic">of</hi> necessitous, and all the ferocity of
                    injured men.</p>
                <p>When a class of this description became numerous, they must have filled society
                    with the greatest disorders. The nature of the case would have drawn the
                    philosophical mind to this conclusion had no testimony existed. It so happens,
                    however, that this is one of the few facts in the ancient history of the Hindus
                    which can be ascertained from their record. In the preface to that compilation
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Hindu Laics</hi> which was translated by Mr Halhed, it
                    is stated that, after a succession of good kings, who secured obedience to the
                    laws, and under whom the people enjoyed felicity, came a monarch, evil and
                    corrupt, under whom the laws were violated, the mixture of the classes was
                    perpetrated, and a new and impious race were produced. The Brahmins put this
                    wicked king to death, and, by an effect of miraculous power, created a
                    successor, endowed with the most excellent qualities. Nevertheless the kingdom
                    did not prosper, by reason of the Burren Sunker (so were the impure and
                    irregular brood denominated); and it required all the wisdom of this sage and
                    virtuous king to devise a remedy. He resolved to form a classification of the
                    mixed race, and to assign them occupations. This accordingly was the
                    commencement of arts and manufactures. The Burren Sunker became all manner of
                    artizans and handicrafts. Of the classes into which they were distributed, one
                    was appointed to the weaving of cloth, another to works in iron, and so in all
                    other cases, till the subdivisions of the race were exhausted, and the wants of
                    the community were provided for. Among the Hindus thirty-six castes of the
                    impure race are enumerated, all inferior in rank and privileges even to the
                    Sudra. To proceed farther in the detail would be inconvenient and useless. By
                    this supplement to the institution of the four primary castes, two great evils
                    were remedied at once; the increasing wants of an improving society were
                    supplied, and a class of men, who had been the pest of the community, were
                    converted to its service.</p>
                <p>How nearly the actual state of things among the Hindus did ever correspond with
                    the written accounts of the institution of castes, we do not know. But even at
                    the time when Europeans first became acquainted with them, many points of the
                    separation were disregarded; and this has been in constant progress; so that at
                    present the principal interruptions to the business of life, occasioned by the
                    niceties of caste, are removed; and the distinctions are felt on certain limited
                    occasions only.</p>
                <p>The only remaining inquiry with respect to the institution of castes, which seems
                    appropriate to this article, is that of its utility or inutility as a part of
                    the social establishment. And a few words will, we think, suffice to convey
                    clear and determinate ideas upon this subject.</p>
                <p>It is the distinction of man’s nature, that he is a pro-∣ gressive being. It is
                    by this grand characteristic that he is separated so widely from the inferior
                    animals. When found in circumstances and situations in which the benefits of
                    progression seem not to have been reaped, he is raised but a slight degree above
                    the condition of some of the more perfect of the inferior animals. His
                    peculiarity is, that he is susceptible of progression, and, unless when he is
                    placed in circumstances whioh impose extraordinary restraints upon the
                    principles of his nature, does invariably and incessantly make progress. Even
                    when he originates in a state little above that of the inferior animals, he
                    rises, and gradually ascends from one stage to another, till his elevation above
                    all the other inhabitants of this globe is immense; nor is there any limit which
                    our knowledge permits us to set to his final attainments and felicity. In
                    whatever state the other animals originate, in that state they remain throughout
                    all ages, and seem altogether incapable of improvement.</p>
                <p>In regard to man, therefore, considered as a class of beings or an order of
                    existence, every thing is to be considered as beneficently important in
                    proportion as it favours his progression; every thing is to be considered as
                    mischievously important in proportion as it obstructs and impedes that
                    progression. And it is by this grand test of all that is good and evil in human
                    institutions that we shall endeavour to estimate the effects of the
                    establishment of castes.</p>
                <p>We shall not here adduce the elevation of one set of the classes, and the
                    correspondent degradation of another, obviously the cause of infinite evil;
                    because it may be with justice maintained, that this horrid elevation, and
                    equally horrid depression, are not essential parts of the institution of caste,
                    but arise from other causes, and may, in fact, be separated from that
                    institution.</p>
                <p>First of all, it is evident, that at the time when the number of castes and
                    professions is established, unless it could be foreseen what are all the species
                    of operations or arts by which the desires of man, in all their possible
                    varieties, are capable of being gratified, and what are all the possible
                    divisions of labour from which any good can arise, the appointment of fixed,
                    unalterable castes and professions must oppose an insuperable barrier to human
                    advancement in these two grand instruments of progression, the division of
                    labour and the practice of new arts, as invention may suggest them, or the
                    multiplying desires of an improving society may create the demand. Since it is
                    obviously impossible that all these things can be foreseen, it is abundantly
                    certain that the institution of any fixed number of arts and trades is exactly
                    an institution for preventing the progression of mankind. This deduction appears
                    to be conclusive, and, if there were no other argument, affords a complete
                    answer to the question respecting the utility of castes.</p>
                <p>Even in the trades and arts which are known and provided for at the time of the
                    <hi rend="subscript"> v</hi> institution, it is by no means certain that this
                    fixed order of the persons who are to practise them is a contrivance well
                    adapted for carrying these arts themselves, whether large in number or small, to
                    their highest state of perfection. It by no means follows that a man will do any
                    thing better than any other man, because his father did it before him. To
                    establish a caste for any particular art or profession, is giving a sort of
                    monopoly to that particular description of men. It is a wide monopoly, to be
                    sure; but, as far as the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193349941?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-9941-0226"/> appropriation of the art to onc class is
                    calculated to have any effects, they must so far be such as it is of the nature
                    of a monopoly to produce, and hence unfavourable to the progress of the art. The
                    way which presents itself to the reasoning mind, as that which is best
                    calculated for improving every branch of human industry or skill, is to open, as
                    widely as possible, the doors to competition; not to exclude any man, of
                    whatever origin, who may appear to have an extraordinary genius for any
                    particular thing, but to allow him, through competition, to reap the reward of
                    his superiority, and hence to feel all the motives that can prompt him to excel.
                    The acquirements of onc generation are not transmitted to another more surely
                    when they are transmitted from father to son, than when they are transmitted in
                    the way of promiscuous instruction. Nor does it necessarily, or even commonly,
                    happen, that the learner gets more careful instruction from his father, than he
                    would from a man who is not his father; or that he himself is more intent in his
                    application, and careful to learn, because it is his father who instructs
                    him.</p>
                <p>In the sciences and the fine arts, the power of excelling in which depends upon
                    rare combinations of circumstances, to limit the number of competitors, and shut
                    up the field from all but the members of a particular tribe, is obviously a
                    powerful expedient for diminishing the chance of progression. In regard to
                    literature and knowledge the case is clear and decisive. To confine the
                    prosecution of it to a particular tribe, is to insure a perpetuity of ignorance
                    and misery to the human race. It will be decidedly the interest of the knowing
                    class to maintain as much ignorance as possible among the rest of the community,
                    that they may bc able the more easily to turn and wind them conformably to their
                    own purposes; and, for that end, to study, not real knowledge, nor the means of
                    making mankind wiser and happier, but the means of deluding and imposing upon
                    them the arts of imposture. With this clear and incontrovertible inference, how
                    exactly does the historical fact correspond? How truly and faithfully have the
                    Brahmins acted up to that rule? They have made it a law revealed from heaven to
                    keep the great bulk of the community in ignorance. And what branch of knowledge
                    have they ever studied but the science of delusion? There is first their
                    theology; a mass of absurd fictions, to chain the imagination of ignorant and
                    foolish men. And then there is astrology, which concludes the circle of all
                    their studies, and may be justly styled the second part of the act of imposture;
                    even their mathematics, in which they made some little progress, being studied
                    in no other shape than as a part of the business of astrology.</p>
                <p>Another circumstance appears to merit no slight regard. The institution of castes
                    is calculated to multiply the evils, so dreadful in magnitude, which are apt to
                    arise from the principles of population, and is opposed to the measures which
                    are calculated to lessen or prevent them. The evils which are apt to be produced
                    by an occasional superabundance of people in any one of the departments of
                    industry and subsistence, are exceedingly diminished when the greatest possible
                    facility is given to the supernumerary individuals, of distributing themselves
                    through all the other departments of industry and subsistence. And these evils,
                    it is obvious, are all raised to the greatest height when the possibility of
                    that distribution is taken away; and individuals, in whatsoever degree
                    superabundant, are still confined to their own department. As this is a topic,
                    the elucidation of which it is easy to carry on, we shall content ourselves with
                    the bare hint which has thus been given, and leave the development to the
                    reflections of the reader.</p>
                <p>It may be added, as a supplement to what was said about the obstruction which, by
                    the institution of castes, is given to progression, not only in the division of
                    labour and the multiplication of arts, but even in perfecting the arts which are

                    ment of one tribe of men to one tribe of operations must have a strong tendency
                    to create a habit of routine, and hence an aversion to all innovation; a
                    disposition to acquiesce in what has constantly been done, and hence to deaden
                    that activity of mind which is on the alert to catch at every chance of
                    improvement,—that admirable temper, on which the greatest rapidity in the march
                    of human amelioration essentially depends.</p>
                <p>It was intended, after thus presenting the reasons on which we conclude that the
                    institution of castes is an arrangement altogether opposite to the interests of
                    human nature, to have stated and answered the reasons which have been advanced
                    by Dr Robertson, in the appendix to his <hi rend="italic">Historical
                    Disquisition concerning India,</hi> and more recently by the Abbé Dubois in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Description of the Character, fyc. of the People of
                    India,</hi> to prove that the institution of castes is really beneficial. But
                    after looking over these reasonings with a view to that answer, they have
                    appeared to us to be so weak and insignificant as to be altogether unworthy the
                    trouble of transcription. A sufficient answer to every point which they adduce
                    will be found in the considerations which we have already urged upon the
                    subject; and we doubt not that we may safely intrust the decision to the
                    judgment of the reader. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. a. a.)</hi></p>
