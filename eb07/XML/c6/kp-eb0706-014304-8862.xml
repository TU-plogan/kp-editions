                <p><label type="entry">CARLOW</label>, an inland county in the province of Leinster,
                    in Ireland, is formed somewhat in the shape of a wedge, having its base to the
                    north, on which side it abuts on the counties of Kildare and Wieklow, while on
                    the east it is bounded by the latter of those counties, on the southeast by
                    Wexford, and on the south-west and west by Kilkenny and Kildare. Its greatest
                    length from north to south is thirty-three miles, and, though in one part of its
                    breadth from east to west it measures twenty-three miles, its average extent in
                    that direction is considerably less. Its surface is estimated to contain 222,915
                    acres, or about 348 square miles.</p>
                <p>This district, according to Ptolemy, was formerly inhabited by the Brigantes and
                    Cauci. In the middle ages it comprehended the territories of Hy Kavenagh and Hy
                    Drone, being the most northern part of the principality of Hy Kinselagh. Its
                    most ancient families of Irish name were the Kavenaghs, descended from the
                    celebrated Mae-murrough, king of Leinster, who invited Henry II. to take
                    possession of the kingdom; the O’Ryans, the O’Nolans, and the O’Mores. After the
                    English settlement, the families of St Aubins, De la Frayne, Bermingham, Carew,
                    De la Landes, Grace, and Butler, held extensive possessions there. In the time
                    of Queen Elizabeth the names of most note were those of Bagnal, Eustace, Burton,
                    O’Brien, Ponsonby, Hamilton, Coke, Bernard, Vigors, Burdett, Bunbury, Beresford,
                    Bruen, Bagot, and Browne. The chief proprietors of the present period are the
                    families of Kavenagh, Bruen, Burton, and Rochfort.</p>
                <p>Carlow was made shire ground by King John under the name of Catherlogh, since
                    contracted into its present appellation. It was then one of the nine counties
                    palatine which enjoyed exclusive jurisdictions in Ireland. It is now divided
                    into the six baronies of Carlow, Forth, Idrone East, Idrone West, Rathvilly, and
                    St Mullins. These are again subdivided into thirty-six entire parishes, and
                    seven parts of parishes, the remaining parts of which are in some of the
                    adjoining counties.</p>
                <p>The numbers and qualifications of the electors of Carlow, previously to the
                    disfranchisement of the forty-shilling freeholders, were, of L.50 freeholders,
                    two hundred and eighty-one; of L.20, sixty-seven; and of L.2, eleven hundred and
                    sixty-two; total fifteen hundred and ten. But subsequently to the passing of the
                    act of 1829, the numbers were altered to two hundred and ninety-eight of L.50,
                    ninety-three of L.20, and a hundred and thirty-nine of L.10, total five hundred
                    and thirty; being a reduction of nearly two thirds of the whole constituency.
                    Before the year 1829 there was one elector to fifty-four souls in the county;
                    since that period the proportion is as one to about a hundred and fifty-five
                    souls. Previously to the union, Carlow returned six members, two for the county
                    at large, two for the borough of Carlow, and two for that of Leighlin. This
                    county sends two members to the imperial parliament, who are elected according
                    to the new act.</p>
                <p>The general aspect of the country is very pleasing, as it is throughout
                    diversified with hills and valleys; the latter overspread with herbage, and
                    interspersed with trees; the former generally carrying vegetation to their
                    summits, except in the southern extremity, where the lofty range of Mount
                    Leinster, and the Blackstairs Mountain, of precipitous ascent and sombre hue,
                    forms between this county and that of Wexford a barrier which would be
                    impenetrable as to all purposes of commercial intercourse, were it not for three
                    passes through it, the first or most eastern formed by the river Slaney, the
                    second a land passage called Scullogh Gap, and the third or most western formed
                    by the river Barrow. The chain extends still further westward into the county of
                    Kilkenny, where it assumes the name of the Brandon Mountain. This range is
                    wholly of granite formation. The western extremity of the county, which lies
                    beyond the Barrow, differs materially in appearance from the other parts; but
                    here the deficiencies in agricultural produce and scenic beauty are compensated
                    by the treasures which lie beneath its surface; for the great coal district of
                    Leinster, which commences here, and extends westward and southward into
                    Kilkenny, supplies an abundance of cheap fuel to the surrounding population. The
                    coal found here is of the carbonaceous or stony formation. The county is
                    intersected from north to south by two large rivers; the Barrow in the west,
                    which is navigable throughout the whole extent of the county, and affords means
                    of inland navigation to the port of Waterford; and the Slaney on the east, which
                    passes out of Carlow into Wexford at the town of Newtownbarry. Each of these
                    rivers is enlarged in its course by several smaller tributary streams.</p>
                <p>Although agriculture is the chief occupation of the inhabitants, tillage is still
                    in a backward state, much greater t exertions of skill and industry than what
                    are now applied being necessary to draw forth from the soil the full produce to
                    be expected from its natural richness. Barley is the favourite crop, yet not to
                    the exclusion of the other kinds of grain. Large tracts of fine pasture land are
                    occupied as dairy farms, and the butter made in them is in high reputation in
                    the Dublin market. The dairies are usually let out at an annual rent, rated
                    according to the number of cows. The farms are frequently large, and
                    occasionally stocked with flocks of long-woolled sheep, which are reared both
                    for their fleece and for the supply of the flesh market. Great attention is paid
                    to the breeding of cattle. The lowland parts of the county are embellished with
                    numerous seats of the resident gentry, whose elegant mansions and ornamental
                    plantations add considerably to the rural beauties of this part of the country.
                    Among these Borris Castle, the seat of the Kavenaghs, is universally allowed to
                    be most worthy of notice.</p>

                <p>The manners and appearance of the peasantry differ little from those of the
                    agricultural parts of the southern portion of Ireland. The people are, generally
                    speaking, peaceable and industrious, exhibiting few indications of a tendency to
                    agitation or turbulence. They dwell chiefly in detached cottages, or in small
                    villages, as there are but three towns, Carlow, Tullow, and Leighlin Bridge, the
                    population of which exceeds 2000 souls, and very few villages of any size. The
                    Roman Catholic is the prevailing religion. Its proportion to the Protestant, as
                    far as can be inferred from a calculation of the number of children receiving
                    instruction, as stated in the reports of the commissioners of education in 1824
                    and 1826, may be estimated to be in the proportion of five to one. The number of
                    Presbyterians and other Protestant dissenters is very trifling.</p>
                <p>According to the returns just referred to, the number of children receiving
                    education in public schools is 8600, being somewhat less than one tenth of the
                    whole population, or one third of those within the period of life usually
                    devoted to literary instruction. Of these, the number of Protestants attending
                    school is about 1500, and of Catholics 7100. The number of pupils in schools
                    supported by grants of public money is 1600, in those supported by voluntary
                    contributions 1100; the remainder, amounting to 5900, pay for their instruction.
                    The number of schools of the first of these classes is twenty, of the second
                    nine, and of the third a hundred and thirty-seven.</p>
                <p>Among the relics of remote antiquity in this county may be noted a cromlech near
                    the town of Carlow, said to be one of the largest in Ireland. It is formed of an
                    immense slab, twenty-three feet long, eighteen broad, and four and a half thick,
                    elevated on three supporters, each five and a half feet high. At some distance
                    is a solitary pillar, nearly round, and about five feet high. A rath near
                    Leighlin Bridge, when explored, was found to contain several urns of baked
                    earth, within which nothing was discovered but a small quantity of dust. At
                    Kellystown, five miles from Carlow, are the remains of a round tower, twelve
                    feet diameter in the inside. It stands in an elevated situation; and near it are
                    the ruins of an old church. Both buildings are dedicated to St Patrick, to whom
                    their foundation is also attributed.</p>
                <p>The population of this county, at the several periods at which enumerations were
                    taken by authority of parliament, was as follows ;—</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Carlow.</hi> The town or borough of Carlow is situated in
                    the heart of the beautifuI and highly cultivated vale formed by the river
                    Barrow, which is here navigable for small craft, and thus renders the town an
                    emporium for the trade of the surrounding districts. Its population, according
                    to the census of 1821, is estimated at 8025 souls. It is a neat, and in some
                    parts a well-built town. The principal buildings are the college, founded and
                    maintained by the voluntary contributions of the Roman Catholic gentry, for the
                    literary and scientific instruction of a hundred pupils, fifty of whom are
                    prepared for the priesthood. The buildings are spacious, but without any
                    pretensions to architectural beauty, and, together with a chapel, cemetery, and
                    exercise ground of seven acres, are surrounded by a lofty wall. The court-house,
                    where the assizes for the county are held, is small but commodious, and has a
                    good ballroom attached to it. The parish church is chieflyremark-able for a
                    spire of bulky and ungraceful proportions. The Roman Catholic chapel is a large
                    and elegant structure.</p>
                <p>There are also a cavalry barrack, meeting-houses, a Magdalen asylum, and a
                    news-room. This town was formerly a place of considerable importance. In the
                    reign of Edward III. the king’s exchequer was removed to it; and L.500, a large
                    sum at that period, was applied towards surrounding it with a wall. In the early
                    part of Queen Elizabeth’s reign, it was taken and burned by the Irish chieftain
                    Rory og O’More. When summoned by Cromwell during the disastrous wars of 1641, it
                    submitted to his arms without resistance. In the insurrection of 1798 it was
                    attacked by a tumultuary body of insurgents, who were soon ŗepulsed. A dreadful
                    carnage ensued, for no quarter was given; and many in the confusion of their
                    flight took refuge in the houses of some of the streets, to which the king’s
                    troops immediately set fire, “in order,” says Sir Richard Musgrave, thehistorian
                    of that calamitous period, with great want of feeling, “to make them bolt.” But
                    the most singular monument of the former greatness of this town was its castle,
                    the erection of which is generally, though not upon any conclusive evidence,
                    attributed to King John. It stood on a slight eminence overhanging the Barrow,
                    and consisted of a quadrangle, having a circular tower at each corner. The doors
                    were low and narrow, the windows, or, more properly speaking, the apertures for
                    light, mere loopholes. In the year 1814 the new proprietor of the castle made
                    such alterations in its fabric, with a view to fit it up as a lunatic asylum,
                    that the walls, massive as they were, gave way, and the greater part of the
                    building suddenly fell to the ground, leaving only the western side with two of
                    the' angular towers standing, to show to posterity where and what it had been.
                    Carlow obtained a charter at an early period, and was re-incorporated with
                    enlarged privileges by James I., who allowed it to return two members to the
                    Irish parliament. It is governed by a sovereign and two serjeants. The town
                    sends one member to the imperial parliament.</p>
