                <p><label type="entry">CHRISTIANS</label>, those who profess the religion of Jesus
                    Christ. The name Christians, as we read in the Acts of the Apostles, was first
                    given at Antioch, in the year 42, to those who believed in Jesus Christ. Till
                    that time they were called <hi rend="italic">disciples.</hi></p>
                <p>The first Christians distinguished themselves in the most remarkable manner by
                    their conduct and their virtues. The faithful, whom the preaching of St Peter
                    had converted, hearkened attentively to the exhortations of the apostles,
                    who'failed not carefully to instruct them, as persons who were entering upon an
                    entirely new course of life. They went every day to the temple with one heart
                    and one mind, and continued in prayers; doing nothing different from the other
                    Jews, because the time had not yet come to separate from them. But they made a
                    still greater progress in virtue; for they sold all that they possessed, and
                    distributed their goods in proportion to the wants of their brethren. They “ate
                    their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God, and having
                    favour with all the people.”</p>
                <p>The Jews were the first and the most inveterate enemies of the Christians, whom
                    they put to death as often as they had it in their power; and when they revolted
                    against the Romans in the time of the emperor Adrian, Barcochebas, the head of
                    that revolt, employed against the Christians the most barbarous punishments, in
                    order to compel them to blaspheme and renounce Jesus Christ. We find indeed
                    that, even in the third century, they endeavoured to get into their hands
                    Christian women, in order to scourge and stone them in their synagogues. They
                    cursed the Christians solemnly three times a day in their synagogues, and their
                    rabbin would not suffer them to converse with Christians upon any occasion. Nor
                    were they contented merely to hate and detest them. They dispatched emissaries
                    all over the world in order to defame the Christians, and to spread all sorts of
                    calumnies against them; they accused them of many things absurd or detestable,
                    and, among these, of worshipping the sun and the head of an ass; they reproached
                    them with idleness, and with being a useless unprofitable race; they charged
                    them with treason, and with endeavouring to erect a new monarchy in opposition
                    to that of Rome; they affirmed, that, in celebrating their mysteries, they used
                    to kill a child and eat its flesh; and they accused them of the most shocking
                    incests, and of beastly intemperance in their feasts of charity. But the lives
                    and behaviour of the first Christians were sufficient to refute all that was
                    said against them, and evidently demonstrated that these accusations were mere
                    calumnies and the effect of inveterate malice.</p>
                <p>Pliny the Younger, who was governor of Pontus and Bithynia between the years 103
                    and 105, gives a particular account of the Christians of that province, in a
                    letter which he wrote to the emperor Trajan, of which the following is an
                    extract t “I take the liberty to give you an account of every difficulty which
                    arises to me. 1 have never been present at the examination of the Christians;
                    for which reason 1 know not what questions have been put to them, nor in what
                    manner they have been punished. My behaviour towards those who have been accused
                    to me has been this. 1 have interrogated them in order to know whether they were
                    really Christians. When they have confessed it, 1 have repeated the same
                    question two or three times, threatening them with death if they did not
                    renounce this religion. Those who have persisted in their confession, have been,
                    by my order, led to punishment. I have even met with some Roman citizens guilty
                    of this phrenzy, whom, in regard to their quality, 1 have set apart from the
                    rest, in order to send them to Rome. These persons declare, that their whole
                    crime, if they are guilty, consists in this, that, on certain days, they
                    assemble before sunrise, to sing alternately the praises of Christ, as of a God,
                    and to oblige themselves, by the performance of their religious rites, not to be
                    guilty of theft or adultery, to observe inviolably their word, and to be true to
                    their trust. This· deposition has obliged me to endeavour to inform<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193355193" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5193-0630"/> myself still
                    further of this matter, by putting to the torture two of their women servants,
                    whom they call <hi rend="italic">deaconesses</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but I
                    could learn nothing more from them than that the superstition of these people is
                    as ridiculous as their attachment to it is astonishing.”</p>
                <p>There is still extant a justification, or rather panegyric, of the Christians,
                    pronounced by the mouth of a heathen prince. It is a letter of the emperor
                    Antoninus, written in the year 152, in answer to a charge by the states of Asia,
                    which had accused the Christians of being the cause of some earthquakes which
                    had happened in that part of the world. The emperor advises them to “take care,
                    lest, in torturing and punishing those whom they accused of Atheism (meaning the
                    Christians), they should render them more obstinate, instead of prevailing upon
                    them to change their opinion; since their religion taught them to suffer with
                    pleasure for the sake of God.” As to the earthquakes which had happened, he put
                    them in mind, that “they themselves are always discouraged, and sink under such
                    misfortunes; whereas the Christians never discovered more cheerfulness and
                    confidence in God than upon such occasions.” He tells them, that “they pay no
                    regard to religion, and neglect the worship of the Eternal; and, because the
                    Christians honour and adore Him, therefore they are jealous of them, and
                    persecute them even to death.” He concludes with these words: “Many of the
                    governors of provinces have formerly written to my father concerning them; and
                    his answer always was, that they should not be molested or disturbed, provided
                    they quietly submitted to the authority of the government. Many persons have
                    likewise consulted me upon this affair, and I have returned the same answer to
                    them all; namely, that if any one accuses a Christian merely on account of his
                    religion, the accused person shall be acquitted, and the accuser himself
                    punished.” This ordinance, according to Eusebius, was publicly displayed at
                    Ephesus, in an assembly of the states.</p>
                <p>It is not a difficult matter to discover the causes of the many persecutions to
                    which the Christians were exposed during the first three centuries. The purity
                    of the Christian morality, being in direct contrast with the corruption of the
                    heathens, was doubtless one of the most powerful motives of the public aversion;
                    and to this may be added the many calumnies unjustly spread abroad concerning
                    them by their enemies, particularly the Jews; a circumstance which occasioned so
                    strong a prejudice against them, that the Pagans condemned them without
                    inquiring into their doctrine, or permitting them to defend themselves. Besides,
                    their worshipping Jesus Christ as God was contrary to one of the most ancient
                    laws of the Roman empire, which expressly forbade the acknowledging of any God
                    who had not been approved as such by the senate.</p>
                <p>But notwithstanding the violent opposition made to the establishment of the
                    Christian religion, it gained ground daily, and very soon made a surprising
                    progress in the Roman empire. In the third century, there were Christians in the
                    camp, in the senate, in the palace, in short, everywhere but in the temples and
                    the theatres; they filled the towns, the country, the islands; men and women of
                    all ages and conditions, and even those of the first dignities, embraced the
                    faith; insomuch that the Pagans complained that the revenues of their temples
                    were ruined. They were in so great numbers in the empire, that, as Tertullian
                    expresses it, were they to have retired into another country, they would have
                    left the Romans only a frightful solitude.</p>
