                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">CHIAPA</label>, an intendancy of Mexico is bounded on the
                    north by Tabasco, on the north-east by Yucatan, on the west by Oaxaca and Vera
                    Cruz, and on the south by So-conusco. This province, lying alike contiguous to
                    Mexicoand the central states, was claimed by both; but the option being given to
                    the inhabitants, Chiapa declared its wish to join the Mexican union, while the
                    district of So-conusco adhered to the central federation. The climate of this
                    intendancy is hot and moist; but there are large tracts of mountainous country
                    covered with forests of cedar, cypress, pine, and walnut trees. In the lower
                    regions there are also extensive woods, in which the American lion, the ounce,
                    the wild boar, parrots of great beauty, and numbers of serpents, abound. Goats,
                    sheep, and pigs of the European breed have greatly multiplied in this
                    intendancy, and its horses are so highly esteemed that colts are sent to Mexico
                    The chief productions are cotton, cocoa, maize, cochineal, honey, and aromatic
                    gums. Chiapa contains one city, one town, and an immense number of villages,
                    with about 128,000 inhabitants, of whom a great number are Indians. Near the
                    borders of Yucatan, the vestiges of a considerable Indian capital were
                    accidentally discovered about the middle of the last century. They stand in the
                    midst of a fertile and salubrious tract of country, but which is almost entirely
                    depopulated<pb break="no" facs="nls:193353776" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3776-0521"/>.
                    The hieroglyphics, emblems, and architectural remains, are of a highly
                    interesting kind. The former are said by a learned Spaniard to resemble the
                    Egyptian.</p>

                    about 130 leagues north-west of the city of Guatimala. It contains only one
                    parish, that of the cathedral; but there are four convents, a nunnery, a church
                    dedicated to Our Lady of Charity, two other chapels without the walls, and five
                    for the Indians. It is <hi rend="italic">a</hi> place of some trade. The

                    situated in a valley near the banks of the river Tabasco. The inhabitants are
                    chiefly Indians, but they are reported to be rich; and a great quantity of sugar
                    is raised in the district. The heat is excessive during the day, but the nights
                    are cool. This place enjoys many privileges, and is rising into importance. The
                    inhabitants are about 15,000 in number. Long. 93. 53. W. Lat. 17. 5. N.</p>
