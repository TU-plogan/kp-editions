                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    du</hi></label>, one of the most learned writers of his time, was born at Amiens
                    on the 18th December 1610. His father, who was royal provost of Beauquesne, sent
                    him at an early age to the Jesuits’ College in Amiens, where he soon
                    distinguished himself by his application and quickness of apprehension. Having
                    completed the usual course at this seminary, he applied himself to the study of
                    law at Orleans, and afterwards went to Paris, where he was received as advocate
                    before <pb facs="nls:193348043" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8043-0080"/> the parliament in
                    August 1631. He frequented the courts for some time ; but meeting with little or
                    no success as a barrister, he returned to his native country, where he applied
                    himself to the study of history in all its branches. After the death of his
                    father, Du Cange married, on 19th July 1638, Catherine Du Bos, daughter of a
                    treasurer of France, at Amiens; and seven years afterwards, in 1647, he
                    purchased the same office, the duties of which in no degree interfered with or
                    retarded the great literary works in which he had engaged. The plague, which in
                    1668 desolated the city, forced him to leave Amiens, and go to establish himself
                    at Paris, where he was enabled to consult charters, diplomas, titles,
                    manuscripts, and a multitude of printed documents, which were not to be met with
                    elsewhere. Μ. d’Héronval, his friend, procured for him many curious pieces, and
                    often aided him in his researches. In 1688 he was seized with stranguary, and
                    died of the effects of that malady on the 23d October the same year. To the
                    attributes of a good son, a good husband, and a good father, Du Cange united
                    those of extreme gentleness, affability, and modesty. His industry was exemplary
                    and unremitting ; and notwithstanding the length to which his career extended,
                    the number of his literary works would be incredible, if the originals, all
                    written in his own hand, were not still extant. In his productions are united
                    the characters of a consummate historian, an exact geographer, a profound
                    jurist, an enlightened genealogist, a learned antiquary, and one deeply versed
                    in the science of medals and inscriptions. He knew almost all languages,
                    possessed a thorough acquaintance with the belles-lettres, and from a vast
                    number of manuscripts and original documents drew much curious information
                    respecting the manners and customs of the darkest ages. The learned prefaces of
                    his glossaries afford ample proofs of his philosophical genius, and are, of
                    their kind, models in point both of matter and of style. “ Where,” said Bayle, “
                    is the learned man among the nations most distinguished for their perseverance
                    in labour, and the patience necessary for copying and making extracts, who does
                    not admire the talents of Du Cange in this respect, and consider him as
                    unrivalled in the pursuits to which he devoted himself? If any one has doubts on
                    the subject, it is only necessary to send him <hi rend="italic">ad
                    peenam</hi><hi rend="italic">libri</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> let him turn
                    over the leaves of these dictionaries, and, be he ever so little learned, he
                    will see that they could not have been composed, except by one of the most
                    laborious and most patient men the world ever produced.” Du Cange published the
                    following works : 1. Histoire de l’Empire de Constantinople sous les Empereurs
                    François. Paris, 1657, folio. 2. Traité Historique du Chef de S. Jean-Baptiste.
                    Paris, 1666, 4to. 3. Histoire de S. Louis, Roi de France, écrite par Jean, sire
                    de Joinville. Paris, 1668, folio. 4. Joannis Cinnami Historiarum de rebus gestis

                    Recueildes Historiens de France, avec le plan général de ce Recueil, inserted in

                    Scriptores mediæ et infimæ Græcitatis. Paris, 2 vols. fol. 11. Chronico Paschale
                    à Mundo condito ad Heraclii Imperatoris annum vigesimum. Paris, 1689, fol. This
                    last work was passing through the press when Du Cange died ; and, on his demise,
                    it was edited by Baluze, who published it with an éloge of the author prefixed.
                    After the death of this remarkable man, his manuscript autographs, and his
                    extensive and valuable library, passed to his eldest son, Philip du Fresne, a
                    man of information, but who died, unmarried, four years after his father.
                    Francis du Fresne, the second son, and two sisters, then received the succession
                    and sold the library, when the greater part of the manuscripts was purchased by
                    the Abbé du Champs, who made no use of them, but handed them over to a
                    bookseller called Mariette, who re-sold part of them to Baron Hohendorf. The
                    remaining part was acquired by D’Ηozier, the genealogist. But the French
                    government, sensible of the importance of all the writings of Du Cange,
                    succeeded, after much trouble, in collecting the greater portion of the
                    manuscript autographs of this eminent scholar; and although they had been
                    scattered in Paris, Amiens, and Vienna, very few of them were lost. Among these
                    manuscripts was one, entitled <hi rend="italic">Gallia,</hi> a work of
                    incredible erudition, being a history of France, divided into seven epochs, with
                    a number of dissertations, the greater part of which are finished and ready for
                    the press, whilst, in regard to those which are not so, abundant materials have
                    been provided for completing the author’s design. <hi rend="smallcaps"
