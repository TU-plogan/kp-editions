                    of Tonking, and everywhere else by the sea. The country is diversified with
                    hills and plains, and the soil is in general so fertile that it produces two
                    crops annually. See <hi rend="smallcaps">China.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Canton,</hi> a large commercial and populous city of China, in the province of
                    Quang-tong, situated on the eastern bank of the Pekiang river, which at Canton
                    is somewhat broader than the Thames at London Bridge, and is navigable 300 miles
                    farther into the interior. It has an additional course of eighty miles to the
                    sea, near its junction with which it takes among foreigners the name of Bocca
                    Tigris, or the mouth of the Tigris, from the appearance of one of the islands at
                    its entrance. The town stretches about five miles along the side of the river,
                    and nearly three miles in an opposite direction. It is defended towards the
                    water by two high walls, having cannon mounted, and two strong castles built on
                    two islands in the river; on the land side it has a strong wall and three forts.
                    The wall of the city is about five miles in circumference, with a broad and deep
                    ditch close to it, and several gates, within each of which is a guard-house; and
                    no European is permitted, without the order of a mandarin, to enter the Tartar
                    city, all foreigners being confined entirely to the suburbs. With a view to
                    defence, however, these fortifications would be totally unavailing; and their
                    only utility consists in preventing the intrusion of strangers. The Chinese
                    portion of the city, in its building and exterior appearance, entirely resembles
                    the suburbs; and in these the streets are long, straight, and very narrow, some
                    of the principal not exceeding fifteen or twenty feet in breadth; but they are
                    clean, and well paved with little round stones, and flagged close to the sides
                    of the houses, which are in general small, seldom consisting of more than two
                    stories, the lower story serving as a shop in which goods are exhibited for
                    sale, and the rest of the house, with the court behind, being used as a
                    warehouse. Particular streets are allotted for the supply of strangers, others
                    to particular classes of artizans. The principal street appropriated to
                    Europeans is denominated China Street. Here are to be found the productions of
                    every quarter of the globe; and the merchants are in general extremely attentive
                    and civil. The Chinese are remarkably expert men of business, and of the most
                    assiduous habits, and one of them is always seen sitting on his counter, and
                    using every effort to attract the attention of the British seamen, who are in
                    the habit of frequenting this quarter of Canton. They have an English name
                    painted on the outside of their shops, besides a number of advertisements
                    composed for them by the sailors in their peculiar idiom. They contrive in this
                    manner to draw the seamen into their shops, and occasionally to impose upon them
                    by their specious manners and command of temper. The factories of the different
                    European powers who are permitted to trade here extend a considerable distance
                    along the banks of the river, fronting the city at about a hundred yards from
                    the water. They consist of large and handsome houses, on which are hoisted the
                    respective flags of the different nations. These factories are named by the
                    Chinese, hongs, and resemble long courts without a thoroughfare, which generally
                    contain four or five separate houses. They are built on a fine quay, and a broad
                    parade extends along the river in front of the factories, whither the European
                    merchants, commanders, and officers of ships resort to enjoy the cool of the
                    evening. The British factory far surpasses all others in elegance and extent. It
                    has a large verandah, reaching nearly down to the water’s edge, raised on
                    handsome pillars, and paved with marble, and commanding an extensive view along
                    the river banks. There are spacious warehouses in the neighbourhood for the
                    reception of goods, and dwellings of the Chinese, which are hired out to
                    merchants who visit Canton. For the space of four or five miles opposite Canton
                    boats and vessels are ranged parallel to each other in such close order that it
                    resembles a floating city; and these marine dwellings are occupied by numerous
                    families, who reside almost constantly on the water. In the middle of the river
                    lie the Chinese junks, which trade to the eastern islands and Batavia, and which
                    are moored head and stern, some of them of the burden of 600, and even of 1000
                    tons.</p>
                <p>Canton, from the number and size of the vessels in the river, the variety and
                    decorations of the boats, the superior architecture of the European factories,
                    and the general bustle of a numerous and busy population, has all the appearance
                    of a great commercial city; and Mr Ellis<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Journal of an Embassy to
                    China.</hi></p></note> expresses his belief that “in the wealth of the
                    inhabitants at large, the skill of the artificers, and the variety of the
                    manufactures, it yields not, with the exception of the capital, to any city in
                    the empire.” The suburbs are frequented by foreigners from all parts of the
                    world; and from their various languages, dresses, and deportment, a stranger
                    would be at a loss to say to which nation the town belonged. Canton carries on a
                    very extensive commerce, and, with the exception of the port of Amoy, in the
                    province of Fokien, to which the Spaniards have still the privilege of trading,
                    though they make no use of it, is the only port in the Chinese dominions which
                    is open to the ships of Europeans. According to the policy of the Chinese
                    government, it is only a limited number of merchants, who are called the hong or
                    security merchants, that are allowed to trade with foreigners. Their number
                    formerly amounted to eight, and sometimes to twelve; but from bankruptcies among
                    them, they are now reduced to seven.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    integrity in their transactions. All foreign cargoes pass through the hands of
                    these merchants, and by them also the return cargoes are furnished. They become
                    security for the payment of duties, and it is treason for any other merchant to
                    engage in the trade with foreigners. This severe law, however, it appears, has
                    from time immemorial been evaded; for other merchants, called “outside
                    merchants,” who carry on their transactions outside of the harbour of Canton, or
                    shopmen, are in the practice of dealing with foreigners, either through the
                    medium of the hong merchants, under whose pass the goods are imported or
                    exported, or clandestinely; and more recently the trade has been sanctioned by
                    the Chinese authorities. In 1828 a proclamation was issued, specifying a list of
                    twenty-four articles of export, in which alone the hongs were to deal; and an
                    additional list of fifty-three articles of import, which were left free to all

                <p>Canton is about fifteen miles above Whampoa, and in this distance are five
                    custom-houses or chops where boats are examined. There is a custom-house officer
                    named the hoppo, whose business it is to regulate the duties which are paid by
                    the hong merchant, the importer remaining entirely ignorant of their amount.
                    Accounts are kept in tales, mace,candarines, and cash;—ten cash being one
                    can-darine, ten candarines one mace, ten mace one tale, which last is converted
                    into English money at 6s. 8d., though it is intrinsically worth only 6s. There
                    is but one kind of Chinese money called cash, which is of base metal, cast, not
                    coined, and very brittle. It is of small value, and varies accordingly in the
                    market from 750 to 1000 cash for a tale. Its chief use is in making small
                    payments among the lower classes. Spanish and other silver coins are current,
                    and are estimated by their weight; every merchant carrying scales and weights
                    with him. All the dollars that pass through the hands of the hong merchants bear
                    their stamp, and when they lose their weight in the course of circulation they
                    are cut in pieces for small change. The duties are paid to government in sycee,
                    or pure silver, which is taken by weight. In delivering a cargo, English weights
                    and scales are used, which are afterwards reduced to Chinese catties and peculs.
                    A pecul weighs 133∣ pounds English, and a catty 1⅜ pound. Gold and silver are
                    also weighed by the tale and catty, 100 tales being reckoned equal to 120 ounces
                    16 pennyweights troy. All goods are sold by weight in China, even articles of
                    food, such as fowls, hogs, and the like.</p>
                <p>The foreign trade of Canton is very extensive; but the great article of export is
                    tea, the demand for which, in Europe, has been increasing for more than a
                    century past. This article is monopolized in Britain by the East India Company;
                    and from their accounts it appears that they import annually into this country
                    about thirty millions of lbs. From papers laid before parliament, their annual
                    sales of tea bring a return of between two and three millions sterling, though
                    the article is burdened, in addition to the exorbitant price charged by the
                    Company, with the enormous duty of 96 per cent, on all teas under two shillings
                    per lb. and of 100 per cent, on all above that price. We have no exact data for
                    estimating the total quantity of tea exported from Canton. The quantity taken
                    away by the Americans amounted, on an average of six years from the year 1827,
                    to 11,066,666 lbs. Tea is not very generally used on the Continent of Europe.
                    The annual importation of tea into Holland, on an average of ten years, was
                    14,814 chests.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Parliamentary Papers relating to the Trade and Finances of India.</p></note> In
                    France it is by no means in common use; and, estimating the consumption of the
                    Continent at seven or eight millions of pounds, the total amount of tea exported
                    from Canton may be stated at about fifty millions of pounds. The other articles
                    of export are China ware, gold in bars, sugar, sugar candy, rhubarb, China root,
                    snake root, sarsaparilla, leather, tutenague, Japan copper, varnished and
                    lacquered ware, drugs, leaf gold, utensils of white and red copper, cast iron,
                    raw and wrought silk, thread, nankeens, mother of pearl, gamboge, quicksilver,
                    alum, dammer red lead, vermillion, furniture, toys, a great variety of drugs,
                    and dollars of sycee or pure silver, and also of Peruvian silver. The Canton
                    junks bring to Singapore coarse earthenware for the use of the Chinese settlers,
                    some raw silk, nankeens, tobacco, sacrificial paper, &amp;c. The imports from
                    Bombay and the Malabar coast consist chiefly of cotton, pepper, sandal wood,
                    putchuck, sharks’ fins, olibanum, elephants’ teeth, rhinoceros’ horns, pearls,
                    cornelians, and beads. With the eastern islands, namely the Philippines, the
                    Soo-loo islands, Celebes, the Moluccas, Borneo, Java, Sumatra, Singapore, the
                    east coast of the Malayan peninsula, Siam, Cochin-China, Cambodia, Tonquin, and
                    Japan, Canton carries on trade by means of junks; and the imports from these
                    countries are tin, ivory, pepper, betel nut, rattans, sea-slug or biche de mer,
                    a variety of drugs, edible bird-nests, a favourite luxury at the Chinese tables,
                    spices, &amp;c. The principal articles imported by the East India Company are
                    woollen clothes, long ells, camlets, lead, tin, and iron; cotton from Bengal,
                    Madras, and Bombay. The following is a statement of the British trade to and
                    from Canton in 1828; first, of the Company’s trade; and secondly, of the private
                    trade :—</p>

                <p>From this statement it appears, that the extent of the private trade, both to and
                    from Canton, greatly exceeds that of the East India Company, notwithstanding the
                    advantage of the monopoly of tea; the imports of the Company only amounting in
                    value to L.901,791, and those of the private trader, including the contraband
                    trade in opium, to L.3,169,128; and the exports by the Company to L. 1,753,033,
                    while those of the private trader exceed two millions.</p>
                <p>The Americans carry on an extensive trade with Canton, which appears to fluctuate
                    greatly, though it has on the whole been decidedly on the increase since its
                    commencement, about the year 1785. In 1826-7, owing to overtrading, the American
                    merchants engaged in this trade sustained heavy losses, and a serious stagnation
                    followed, which, however, was not of long duration, the exports having increased
                    the following year to nearly their average amount. We subjoin, from
                    parliamentary papers, the following account of the American trade to Canton at
                    different periods:</p>

                <p>The American imports into Canton are chiefly bullion; but furs, opium, and
                    ginseng, which is not esteemed by the Chinese equal to that which they procure
                    from Tartary, and of which the emperor has a monopoly, arc also imported; and
                    within these twelve or thirteen years they have carried out British woollen
                    manufactures and cotton stuffs, iron, copper, quicksilver, cochineal, opium,
                    linens, watches, and tin plates; and it is singular, nay a complete illustration
                    of the nature of monopoly, that at the time the export of woollens by the East
                    India Company was attended with loss, and had in consequence fallen off, private
                    traders exported these articles with a profit, and have consequently continued
                    the trade.</p>
                <p>The intercourse carried on with Canton by the other nations of Europe, namely,
                    the Portuguese, the Spaniards, French, Swedes, Danes, and Dutch, is
                    inconsiderable and fluctuating; and is not nearly equal to that of the British
                    or the Americans.</p>
                <p>The Chinese are, according to all accounts, an industrious and trading people;
                    and ready on every occasion, as far as they can, to counteract the barbarous and
                    anti-commercial spirit of the government. All the different traders who have
                    frequented the port of Canton agree that great facilities are given for the
                    dispatch of business, and that no trader has the least difficulty in disposing
                    of his goods, and in procuring a return cargo. There are certain port duties to
                    which all vessels are liable, in proportion to the Chinese measurement of its
                    tonnage, which is from the centre of the fore mast to the centre of the mizzen
                    mast for the length, and close abaft the main mast from the outside, taking the
                    extreme, for the breadth. The length is then multiplied by the breadth, and
                    divided by ten, which is their mode of ascertaining the mensuration of a ship.
                    At the custom-house ships are classed under three denominations, namely, first,
                    second, and third rates, which last rate must be paid by all ships, however
                    small, as there is no lower rate; and in like manner no higher rate is ever paid
                    on any ship of the first class, however large. The first rates are seventy-four
                    cubits long and twenty-three broad; and they pay per cubit seven tales, seven
                    mace, seven candarines, and seven cash. The second are seventy-one to
                    seventy-four cubits, and from twenty-two to twenty-three broad; and they pay
                    seven tales, one mace, four candarines, and two cash. The third rates, which are
                    sixty-five to seventy-one cubits, and from twenty to twenty-two broad, pay five
                    tales. Ships are besides liable to the kumshaw, which is an imposition under the
                    name of a present to the great mandarins, and which is now regularly claimed
                    along with all the other port-dues: on British vessels it is 1950 tales. The
                    duties on ships of the smallest class amount on an average to about 4000
                    dollars, and ships of larger dimensions do not pay a great deal more. Small
                    country ships frequently lie off about Linting Fora, or Large Bay, until some of
                    the large China ships from Europe come in sight, when they shift their cargoes
                    on board of them, which are then usually carried up to Canton for one per cent.;
                    and in this manner the duties, customs, and measurement of the ship, are saved,
                    as well as the emperor’s present.</p>
                <p>The establishment of the East India Company at Canton consists of twelve
                    supercargoes and twelve writers, who transact the Company’s business with the
                    hong merchants. They are politically the representatives of the British
                    authority at Canton. They are paid by a double commission of two per cent, on
                    the price of the goods imported into Canton by the Company, and on the price of
                    tea at the Company’s sales in London; and three per cent, com mission defrays
                    the whole annual expense of the establishment, amounting to about L.150,000. The
                    writers have a fixed salary and a free table, and they succeed by rotation to
                    the situations of supercargoes, who have also a free table, and annually divide
                    among them, in shares proportioned to their seniority, a sum of from L.50,000 to
                    L.80,000 sterling. The three senior supercargoes constitute the select
                    committee, the chief of which has generally an income of L.8000 per annum; the
                    second and third members L.7100; and the income of the junior members declines
                    in a graduated proportion to L.1500 per annum. They have besides a free house
                    and table, and their services given in return are not certainly laborious in
                    proportion. Their duty is to reside four months of the year at Canton, during
                    the season when they have to transact business with the hong merchants; after
                    which they retire to Macao for the rest of the year, having little or no
                    occupation, and no society except among themselves. It is to pay for such
                    expensive establishments, and for other modes of wasteful management, as the
                    useless size and cost of their ships, and their extravagant outfit, that the
                    people of Great Britain are taxed in the monopoly price of tea, an article in
                    universal use, and now considered as a necessary, and by no means therefore a
                    fit subject for an exorbitant tax.</p>
                <p>Provisions and refreshments of all sorts are abundant at Canton, and in general
                    are excellent in quality and moderate in price. It is a singular fact, that the
                    Chinese make no use of milk, either in its natural state, or in the form of
                    butter or cheese. Among the delicacies of a Chinese market, are to be seen
                    horse-flesh, dogs, cats, hawks, owls, and edible bird-nests, which are so much
                    sought after that they sell for their weight in silver. The Chinese, however,
                    who are settled in Batavia and Singapore show no aversion to European luxuries;
                    and are particularly fond of spirits and wine. The business at Canton is
                    generally transacted in a jargon of broken English, the Chinese being extremely
                    ready in acquiring such a smattering of English words as to render themselves
                    intelligible; and the lower classes of them are frequently hired as servants by
                    the Europeans.</p>
                <p>The intercourse between China and Europe by the way of the Cape of Good Hope
                    began in 1517, when Emanuel, king of Portugal, sent a fleet of eight ships, with
                    an ambassador, who was conveyed to Pekin, and who obtained the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193348355" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8355-0104"/>sanction of the emperor to
                    establish a trade at Canton. It was in 1596, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth,
                    that the English first attempted with two ships to open an intercourse with
                    China; but they were lost in the outward voyage. About 1634 several English
                    ships visited Canton; but a misunderstanding having occurred with the Chinese
                    authorities, by the treachery of the Portuguese, a rupture and a battle took
                    place, and it was with difficulty that this misunderstanding was rectified.
                    China was again visited in 1673 by an English ship that was refused admission
                    into Japan. In 1677 a factory was established at Amoy; but in 1680 the factory
                    was destroyed by an irruption of the Tartars, and it was not till 1685 that the
                    emperor permitted any trade with the Europeans. Upon the union of the two East
                    India Companies in London, an imperial edict was issued, restricting the
                    European commerce to the port of Canton. Tea was first imported about the year
                    1667. The commerce with Canton has in the course of the last century
                    progressively increased, though it has occasionally met with interruptions; as
                    in 1784, and in 1801 when two of the Chinese were killed by shots from British
                    vessels; and in 1806, when Macao was occupied by British troops. At that time
                    the trade was stopped; but the troops being withdrawn, harmony was restored, and
                    the trade placed on its former footing. Disagreements have also occasionally
                    taken place between the select committee and the Chinese functionaries; but no
                    material interruption to the trade has ever arisen from this source. The
                    Europeans in Canton know little of the interior, being rigidly excluded from all
                    intercourse with the inhabitants. A great number of troops are said to be
                    quartered in the province of Canton, as a precaution against any danger from the
                    great influx of foreigners. The sea-coast has been so much infested with
                    pirates, as to threaten the almost total extinction of the Chinese coasting
                    trade. No correct estimate of the population of Canton has ever been obtained;
                    but it is known to be very great, probably equal to Calcutta, or any other of
                    the great cities of the East. Long. 113. 14. E. Lat. 23. 7. N. (Milburn’s <hi

                    ingenious natural philosopher, was born at Stroud, in Gloucestershire, in 1718.
                    Among those with whom he became acquainted in early life was Dr Henry Miles of
                    Tooting, a learned and respectable member of the Royal Society, and of approved
                    eminence in natural knowledge. This gentleman perceiving that Mr Canton
                    possessed abilities too promising to be confined within the narrow limits of a
                    country town, prevailed on his father to permit him to go to London. Accordingly
                    he arrived at the metropolis in March 1737, and resided with Dr Miles at Tooting
                    till the 6th of May following, when he articled himself for the term of five
                    years as a clerk to Mr Samuel Watkins, master of the academy in Spital Square.
                    In this situation his ingenuity, diligence, and good conduct were so well
                    displayed, that on the expiration of his clerkship in May 1742 he was taken into
                    partnership with Mr Watkins for three years; which gentleman he afterwards
                    succeeded in Spital Square, and there continued during his whole life. In 1744
                    he married Penelope, the eldest daughter of Mr Thomas Colbrooke, and niece to
                    James Colbrooke, Esq. banker in London.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of 1745, electricity, which seems early to have engaged Mr
                    Canton’s notice, received a very capital improvement by ihe discovery of the
                    Leyden phial. This event turned the thoughts of most of the philosophers of
                    Europe to that branch of natural philosophy; and our author, who was one of the
                    first to repeat and to pursue the experiment, found his assiduity and attention
                    rewarded by many valuable discoveries. Towards the end of 1749 he was concerned
                    with his friend, Mr Benjamin Robins, in making experiments in order to determine
                    to what height rockets may be made to ascend, and at what distance their light
                    may be seen. In 1750 was read at the Royal Society Mr Canton’s “method of making
                    artificial Magnets, without the use of, and yet far superior to, any natural
                    ones.” This paper procured him the honour of being elected a member of the
                    society, and the present of their gold medal. The same year he was complimented
                    with the degree of Μ. A. by the University of Aberdeen, and in 1751 he was
                    chosen one of the council of the Royal Society.</p>
                <p>In 1752 Mr Canton was so fortunate as to be the first person in England who, by
                    attracting the electric fire from the clouds during a thunder storm, verified Dr
                    Franklin’s hypothesis of the similarity of lightning and electricity. Next year
                    his paper entitled “Electrical Experiments, with an attempt to account for their
                    several phenomena,” was read at the Royal Society. In the same paper Mr Canton
                    mentioned his having discovered, by a great number of experiments, that some
                    clouds were in a positive, and some in a negative, state of electricity. Dr
                    Franklin, much about the same time, made a similar discovery in America. This
                    circumstance, together with our author’s constant defence of the doctor’s
                    hypothesis, induced that excellent philosopher, immediately on his arrival in
                    England, to pay Mr Canton a visit, and gave rise to a friendship which ever
                    afterwards continued without interruption or diminution. In the Lady’s Diary for
                    1756 our author answered the prize question that had been proposed in the
                    preceding year. The question was, “how can what we call the shooting of stars be
                    best accounted for; what is the substance of this phenomenon; and in what state
                    of the atmosphere doth it most frequently' show itself?” and the solution,
                    though anonymous, proved so satisfactory to his friend, Mr Thomas Simpson, who
                    then conducted that work, that he sent Mr Canton the prize, accompanied ŵith a
                    note, in which he said, he was sure that he was not mistaken in the author of
                    it, as no one besides, that he knew of, could have answered the question. Our
                    philosopher’s next communication to the public was a letter in the “Gentleman’s
                    Magazine for September 1759,” on the electrical properties of the tourmalin, in
                    which the laws of that wonderful stone are laid down in a very concise and
                    elegant manner. On the 13th December, in the same year, was read at the Royal
                    Society, “An attempt to account for the regular diurnal variation of the
                    Horizontal Magnetic Needle; and also for its irregular variation at the time of
                    an Aurora Borealis.” A complete year’s observations of the diurnal variations of
                    the needle are annexed to the paper. On the 5th November 1761, our author
                    communicated to the Royal Society an account of the Transit of Venus, 6th June
                    1761, observed in Spital Square. Μ. Canton’s next communication to the Society
                    was a letter addressed to Dr Benjamin Franklin, and read in February 1762,
                    containing some remarks on Mr Delaval’s electrical experiments. On the 16th
                    December in the same year another curious addition was made by him to
                    philosophical knowledge, in a paper entitled “Experiments to prove that water is
                    not incompressible.” These experiments are a complete refutation of the famous
                    Florentine experiments, which so many philosophers have mentioned as a proof of
                    the incompressibility of water. On St Andrew’s day 1763 our author was for the
                    third time elected one of the council of the Royal Society; and, on the 8th
                    November in the following year, were read before that learned body his further
                    “Experiments and observations on the compressibility<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193348368" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8368-0105"/> of water and some other
                    fluids.’ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> The establishment of this fact, in
                    opposition to the received opinion, formed on the hasty decision of the
                    Florentine Academy, was thought to be deserving of the society’s gold medal. It
                    was accordingly moved for in the council of 1764; and after several invidious
                    delays, which terminated much to the honour of Mr Canton, it was presented to
                    him on the 30th November 1766.</p>
                <p>The next communication of our ingenious author to the Royal Society was made in
                    December 1763, being “An easy method of making a phosphorus that will imbibe and
                    emit light like the Bolognian stone; with experiments and observations.” When he
                    first showed to Dr Franklin the instantaneous light acquired by some of this
                    phosphorus from the near discharge of an electrified bottle, the doctor
                    immediately exclaimed, “And God said, let there be light, and there was light.”
                    The dean and chapter of St Paul’s having, in a letter to the president, dated
                    5th March 1769, requested the opinions of the Royal Society relative to the best
                    and most effectual method of fixing electrical conductors to preserve that
                    cathedral from damage by lightning, Mr Canton was one of the committee appointed
                    to take the letter into consideration, and to report their opinion upon it. The
                    gentlemen joined with him in this business were, Dr Watson, Dr Franklin, Mr
                    Delaval, and Mr Wilson. Their report was made on the 8th of June following, and
                    the method recommended by them has been carried into execution. The last paper
                    of our author’s which was read before the Royal Society was on the 21st December
                    1769, and contained “Experiments to prove that the Luminousness of the Sea
                    arises from the putrefaction of its animal substances.” In the account now given
                    of his communications to the public, we have chiefly confined ourselves to such
                    as were the most important, and which threw new and unexpected light on various
                    objects in the philosophical world. Besides these, he wrote a number of papers
                    both in earlier and in later life, which appeared in several publications, and
                    particularly in the Gentleman’s Magazine.</p>
                <p>The close and sedentary life of Mr Canton, arising from an unremitted attention
                    to the duties of his profession, and to the prosecution of his philosophical
                    inquiries and experiments, probably contributed to shorten his days. The
                    disorder into which be fell, and which carried him off, was a dropsy. His death
                    happened on the 22d of March 1772, in the fifty-fourth year of his age.</p>
