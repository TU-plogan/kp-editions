                <p><label type="entry">CANON LAW</label> is a term used to denote the ecclesiastical
                    law sanctioned by the church of Rome, and possessing more or less direct
                    influence in all countries which acknowledge the authority of the pope. The word
                    καvω∣∕ signifies a rule, and this word was not at first considered as too feeble
                    to express the claims of the church to the obedience of her children; but, in
                    the progress of priestly usurpation, the successor of St Peter began to arrogate
                    a more ample and definite jurisdiction, and to extend his regulations to many
                    causes which are not strictly ecclesiastical. The stupendous fabric of papal
                    dominion attained its full height in the eleventh century, under the auspices of
                    Hildebrand, who was elected in the year 1073, and assumed the name of Gregory
                    VII. It was one of his dictates, that the church of Rome has never erred, and,
                    according to the testimony of Scripture, never shall err;<note anchored="true"

                    admitted, nothing remained to obstruct the progress of spiritual arrogance. What
                    had formerly been described as a <hi rend="italic">rule,</hi> was now dignified
                    with the name of <hi rend="italic">law</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and from
                    this period, a period of the deepest ignorance and superstition, the canon law
                    obtained great influence in most countries of Europe. After the foundation of
                    those seminaries of learning which we denominate universities, it acquired a
                    distinguished place among the other faculties; and a knowledge of the canon law
                    became a common road to the highest honours. It is a maxim of the commentators,
                    that a Doctor of the Canon Law is to be preferred to a Doctor of Divinity in
                    such dioceses as do not contain many heretics.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The canon law is derived from many different sources. The authority of the
                    Scriptures cannot be entirely disregarded; but the writings of the fathers and
                    doctors of the church, the decrees of councils, and the decretals of popes, are
                    much better adapted to the general views of the canonists. The canon is to a
                    great extent to be considered as the spurious offspring of the civil law: what
                    is most valuable it has derived from the Roman jurisprudence; and its own
                    peculiar maxims and rules have all the same general tendency towards the power
                    and aggrandizement of churchmen.</p>
                <p>The Greek church has bequeathed various reliques, which cannot be safely
                    neglected by those who investigate the history of the canon law, as well as the
                    general history of the church. Its <hi rend="italic">Codex Canonun</hi><note

                    branch of enquiry, but shall merely direct the reader’s attention to two very
                    elaborate publications. The first of these is the “Bibliotheca Juris Canonici

                    the other we are indebted to Dr Beveridge, the very learned bishop of St Asaph:
                    “2υwδ∕κo∣∕, sive Pandectae Canonum SS. Apostolorum, et Conciliorum ab Ecclesia
                    Graeca receptorum; nec non canonicarum SS. Patrum Epistolarum: una cum scholiis

                    1672, 2 tom. fol. This publication was followed by his “Codex Canonum Ecclesiae
                    pri-mitivae vindicatus et illustratus.” Lond. 1678, 4to. Nor must we here
                    neglect to mention a very recent work by Professor Biener of Berlin: “De
                    Collectionibus Canonum Ecclesiae Graecae Schediasma litterarium.” Berolini,
                    1827, 8vo.</p>
                <p>Of the rules or laws received by the Latin church, there were many ancient
                    collections. Dionysius Exiguus, an abbot who flourished about the beginning of
                    the sixth century, formed two different compilations, one of the canons of the
                    church, another of the decretals of the bishop of Rome; and this was the
                    earliest collection of decretals. These were followed by the collections of
                    Fulgentius Ferrandus, who flourished soon afterwards; of Isidorus Hispalensis,
                    who was bishop of Seville from 595 to 636; of Cresconius, who flourished about
                    the year 690; of Isidorus Mercator, otherwise called Peccator, who wrote about
                    the year 800, and is described as “impostor nequissimus and of various other
                    compilers, whose labours we have not at present an opportunity of reviewing.
                    Burchardus, who was bishop of Worms from 996 to 1025, formed a compilation of
                    the canon law, described as “Magnum Decretorum Volumen,” and divided into twenty
                    books. Ivo Carnotensis, bishop of Chartres from 1092 to 1115, was the author of
                    a similar compilation, which bears the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Decretum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and to him is ascribed another work on
                    the canon law, sometimes called <hi rend="italic">Pannomia,</hi> and sometimes
                    <hi rend="italic">Pannormia.</hi> Both these works have been repeatedly
                    printed.</p>
                <p>Ivo was followed by Gratian, whose <hi rend="italic">Decretum</hi> forms the
                    first and most ample part of the <hi rend="italic">Corpus Juris</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Canonici.</hi> He was a native of Clusium, or Chiusi, near
                    Florence, and, according to a very improbable account, was the brother of Petrus
                    Lombardus and Petrus Comestor. One of these three individuals was a native of
                    Tuscany, another, as his name denotes, of Lombardy, and the third of France;
                    but, in order to remove the difficulty which arises from this variety in the
                    places of their nativity, some writers do their mother the honour of supposing
                    that her three distinguished sons were the fruit of her unlawful intercourse
                    with three different fathers, at different periods, and in different places.
                    Gratian was a Benedictine monk of the monastery of St Felix and St Nabor at
                    Bologna. His work has long been commonly known by the,, title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Decretum,</hi> but is more correctly described as “Decretorum
                    Collectanea;” and it is remarked by the very learned archbishop of Tarragona,
                    that the old manuscripts scarcely ever bear the former title, but generally that
                    of “Concordia discordantium Canonum.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the year 1151: this may indeed have been the period of its completion, but it
                    evidently was not the labour of a single year. Cardinal Bellarmin has
                    endeavoured to reconcile two conflicting authorities, by supposing that Gratian
                    commenced his work in 1127, and completed it in 1151, thus allowing a period of
                    twenty-four years for its composition.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    although it is thus to be regarded as the work of a private individual, it
                    speedily secured, and has ever since maintained, a degree of authority which
                    makes a near approach to that which belongs to written law.<note anchored="true"

                    method of quoting the Decretum and other portions of the canon law, the reader

                    Roman Civil Law,</hi> p 2.</p></note> Gratian, who wrote in an unenlightened
                    age, is chargeable with many errors of ignorance or inadvertence, which the
                    canonists have not scrupled to detect and expose. Augustinus has composed a
                    series of dialogues <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Emendatione
                    Gratiani,</hi> in which the reader will find much learned and curious
                    disquisition; and many other writers, editors as well as commentators, have
                    endeavoured to rectify errors and supply defects. “To the compilations of
                    Isidore and Gratian,” says a catholic lawyer, “one of the greatest misfortunes
                    of the church, the claim of the popes to temporal power by divine right, may in
                    some measure be attributed. That a claim so unfounded and so impious, so
                    detrimental to religion, and so hostile to the peace of the world, should have
                    been made, is strange—stranger yet is the success it met with.”<note

                    plan he employed Raymundus de Penyafort, a learned Spaniard, who was afterwards

                    various titles. “Epistolae decretales” are rescripts of the popes, in answer to
                    prelates or other individuals by whom they have been consulted. They are
                    sometimes called Decretalia, but commonly Decretales, the words Rescripta and
                    Epistolae being respectively understood. The work however is not strictly
                    conformable to· its title; for although the greater part of it is composed of
                    decretals, the compiler has had recourse to various other authorities.</p>
                <p>Gregory’s decretals are followed by <hi rend="italic">Liber</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sextus Decretalium</hi><hi rend="italic">D. Bonifacii Papae VIII.</hi> which,
                    notwithstanding the general title, is divided into five books. It was intended
                    as supplementary to the other collection, and was compiled under the authority
                    of Boniface, whose pontificate extended from 1294 to 1303. Besides the decretals
                    of Boniface himself, and of preceding popes, ascending <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193348212" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8212-0093"/> to Gregory IX., it includes
                    decrees of the two general councils held at Lyons in 1245 and 1274.</p>
                <p>The next work in the series bears the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Constitutiones</hi><hi rend="italic">Clementis Papce V. in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Concilio</hi><hi rend="italic">Vienensi editae,</hi> and is
                    likewise divided into five books. Clement, whose residence was at Avignon,
                    presided in the council of Vienne in the year 1312; and in addition to the
                    constitutions there enacted, his collection comprehends some other constitutions
                    and decretals which he himself divulged before or after the holding of that
                    council. After his death, these <hi rend="italic">Clementìnoe</hi> were
                    promulgated in the year 1317 by his successor John the Twenty-first, otherwise
                    called John the Twenty-second.</p>
                <p>Of the same pope, who likewise resided at Avignon, there is a collection of
                    twenty consitutions, which bear the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Extravagantes</hi><hi rend="italic">Joanms XXII.</hi> They were so called,
                    because for some time they wandered beyond the limits of the collection which
                    contained the works already enumerated as belonging to the body of the canon
                    law. The next work, which is entitled <hi rend="italic">Extravagantes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Communes,</hi> and is divided into five books, comprehends the
                    constitutions of various popes, concluding with Sixtus IV. whose pontificate
                    extended from 1471 to 1484.</p>
                <p>These are all the different compilations which constitute what is denominated the
                    body of the canon law. It may be proper to add that the best edition bears this
                    title: “Corpus Juris Canonici, Gregorii XIII. Pont. Max jussu editum: a Petro
                    Pithoeo et Francisco fratre, Jurisconsultis, ad veteres codices manuscriptos

                    as well as more early date, there are many other editions which we cannot here
                    enumerate; and we shall only mention another, which was published by a

                <p>The Institutes of Jo. Paulus Lancelottus, divided into four books, are inserted
                    in different editions of the Corpus; and this circumstance has led some
                    individuals, superficially acquainted with the subject, to suppose that they
                    form an essential part of the authorized collection. They are however the
                    production of a private lawyer, and having never received the sanction of the
                    pope, they possess no authority beyond that which belongs to the character of
                    the author as an able interpreter of the canon law. This work was undertaken
                    with the approbation of Paul IV.: fifteen years elapsed before its completion;
                    and Lancelottus, having at length submitted it to the papal censors, and
                    lingered two years in Rome, was compelled to abandon the hope of obtaining the
                    sanction of his holiness Pius IV. The book was published in 1563, a few months
                    before the dissolution of the council of Trent. The only favour which the author
                    could obtain was that his Institutes might be added to the Corpus, but without
                    any confirmation of their authority. They are sometimes inserted, and sometimes
                    omitted; nor do they occur in that edition which we have already mentioned as
                    the best. As they do not include the changes and modifications introduced by the
                    council of Trent, they require the aid of a perpetual commentary. The Institutes
                    of Lancelottus are closely modelled upon those of Justinian. His subject does
                    not easily admit of any high degree of classical purity, but the work is at
                    least written with much neatness and perspicuity. The notes of Doujat form a
                    very important addition: they evidently proceed from a man of ability and
                    learning, and are generally composed in a style of pregnant brevity.</p>
                <p>The subsequent progress of the canon law, together with the more recent method of
                    expounding it, must be learned from other writers. The most distinguished
                    canonist of the last century was Dr Van Espen, professor of the canon law in the
                    university of Louvain, whose works extend to five volumes in folio. His <hi

                    has described as “a work which, for depth and extent of research, clearness of
                    method, and perspicuity of style, equals any work of jurisprudence which has
                    issued from the press; but which, in some places, where the author’s dreary
                    Jansenism prevails, must be read with disgust.”<note anchored="true"

                    the canon law which we must recommend to the student’s notice. “Caroli
                    Sebastiani Berardi Commentaria in Jus Ecclesiasticum universum.” Venetiis, 1789,
                    4 tom. 4to. “Joannis Devoti Institutionum Canonicarum libri IV.” Florentiae,
                    1816-7, 4 tom. 8vo. Neither of these is the earliest edition. Those who have any
                    wish to ascertain how the canon law is now taught by the catholics of Germany,
                    may consult the following works. “Mauri de Schenkl Institutiones Juris
                    Ecclesiastici communis: editio emendata et valde adaucta a Josepho Scheill.”
                    Landishuti in Bavaria, 1830, 2 tom. 8vo. “Fundamenta Juris Ecclesiastici
                    Catholicorum: in usus scholastico conscripsit Jos. Anton. Sauter.” Rotwilae,
                    1825-6, 2 tom. 8vo. The canon law was ably illustrated by some of the German
                    protestants, particularly by Ziegler, Thomasius, and Böhmer. Such was the
                    reputation enjoyed by the last of these individuals, that difficult and
                    intricate processes were frequently transmitted from Italy, to be decided by the
                    law-faculty of the university of Halle, during the period when Böhmer was dean.
                    Nor is this ' study neglected by the protestants of our own age. Dr Walter,
                    professor of law in the university of Bonn, is the author of a work, published
                    for the fourth time, under the title of “Lehrbuch des Kirchenrechts aller
                    Christlichen Confessionem” Bonn, 1829, 8vo. And a similar work has more recently
                    been published by Eichhorn of Göttingen, well known for his history of the
                    German law.</p>
                <p>While the papal power was yet in its meridian height, this system of
                    jurisprudence could only claim the proper force of law within the papal
                    dominions. It maintained a very powerful and direct influence in every other
                    country which acknowledged the bishop of Rome’s supremacy; but its dictates were
                    controlled by the legislative authority, and modified by the practice of the
                    courts, in each of the countries where it found admission. Thus the canon law of
                    France differed in many respects from that of Spain, and the canon law of
                    England from that of Austria. “All the strength,” says Sir Matthew Hale, “that
                    either the papal or imperial laws have obtained in this kingdom, is only because
                    they have been received and admitted either by the consent of parliament, and so
                    are part of the statute law’s of the kingdom, or else by immemorial usage and
                    custom in some particular cases in courts, and no otherwise, and therefore so
                    far as such laws are received and allowed here, so far they obtain, and no
                    further; and the authority and force they have here is not founded on, or
                    derived from themselves; for so they bind no more with us than our laws bind in
                    Rome or Italy.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hale’s

                <p>The influence of the canon law in countries which have long abjured the authority
                    of the pope, renders it even there a study of occasional importance to lawyers.
                    “So deep,” says Lord Stair, “hath this canon law been rooted, that even where
                    the pope’s authority is rejected, yet consideration must be had to these laws,
                    not only as those by which church benefices have been erected and ordered, but
                    as likewise containing many equitable and profitable laws, which, because of
                    their weighty matter, and their being once received, may more fitly be retained
                    than rejected.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Stair’s
                    Institutions of the Law of Scotland, b. i. tit. i. § 14.</p></note> We cannot
                    refrain from adding, that some knowledge of the canon law, at least of its
                    history and external form, is of no small consequence to those who wish to
                    understand the history and literature of the middle ages. This remark we shall
                    endeavour to confirm by one or two examples. Winton, the venerable prior of
                    Lochleven, after having mentioned the irregular manner in which Walter
                    Danielstoun took possession of "the see of St χAndrews, subjoins this

                <p>This passage, which to most readers must appear sufficiently obscure, the very
                    accurate and intelligent editor, Macpherson, has left without explanation or
                    conjecture. It bears an allusion to the <hi rend="italic">Decretales</hi><hi

                    title, or subdivision of the book. Danielstoun, whose election had not been
                    confirmed by the pope, evidently relied on the authority of the subsequent
                    passage: “Ita quod interim valde remoti, videlicet ultra Italiam constituti, si
                    electi fuerint in concordia, dispensative propter necessitates ecclesiarum et
                    utilitates, in spiritualibus et temporalibus administrent, sic tamen ut de rebus
                    ecclesiasticis nihil penitus aliènent.”</p>
                <p>Sir David Lindsay, another Scotish poet, makes the following allusion to the
                    inordinate pretensions of the pope:</p>

                    supposed himself to be a man of learning, has subjoined this curious annotation.
                    “The allusion is to the works of Pomponius Sextus, the great jurist of the third
                    century.” It is first to be remarked that Pomponius did not flourish in the
                    third, but in the second century;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    he speaks so familiarly, had actually written in the third century, how could he
                    have illustrated the temporal power and splendour of the pope before
                    Christianity was established in the Roman empire? The <hi rend="italic"
