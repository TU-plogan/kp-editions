                    noble family in Devonshire. Having dissipated his fortune, he resolved to repair
                    it at the expense of the Spaniards. He sailed from Plymouth with two small ships
                    in 1586, passed through the Straits of Magelhaens, took many rich prizes along
                    the coasts of Chili and Peru, and near California possessed himself of the St
                    Ann, an Acapulco ship, with a cargo of immense value. Having completed the
                    circumnavigation of the globe, he returned home round the Cape of Good Hope, and
                    reached Plymouth again in September 1588. On his arrival it is said that his
                    soldiers and sailors were clothed in silk, his sails were damask, and his
                    top-mast was covered with cloth of gold. But his hastily acquired riches did not
                    last long; for in 1591 he had reduced himself to the necessity of <pb break="no"

                    which was far from being so successful as the former. He proceeded no farther
                    than the Straits of Magelhaens, where the weather obliging him to return, he
                    died of grief on the coast of Brazil.</p>

                    of an ancient and honourable family, was born about the year 1505, being the
                    second son of Thomas Cavendish of Cavendish in Suffolk, clerk of the pipe in the
                    reign of Henry VIII. Having had a liberal education, he was taken into the
                    family of Cardinal Wolsey, whom he served in the capacity of gentleman-usher of
                    the chamber, wjιen that magnificent prelate maintained the style and dignity of
                    a prince. In 1527 he attended his master on his splendid embassy to France,
                    returned with him to England, and was one of the few who continued faithful to
                    him in his disgrace. Mr Cavendish was with him when he died, and delayed going
                    to court till he had performed the last duty of a faithful servant, by seeing
                    his remains decently interred. The king was so far from disapproving of his
                    conduct, that he immediately took him into his household, made him treasurer of
                    his chamber and a privy counsellor, and afterwards conferred on him the order of
                    knighthood. He was also appointed one of the commissioners for receiving the
                    surrender of religious houses. In 1540 he was nominated one of the auditors of
                    the court of augmentations, and soon afterwards obtained a grant of several
                    considerable lordships in Hertfordshire. In the reign of Edward VI. his estates
                    were much increased by royal grants in seven different counties; and he appears
                    to have continued in high favour at court during the reign of Queen Mary. He
                    died in the year 1557. Sir William was the founder of Chatsworth, and ancestor
                    of the Dukes of Devonshire. He wrote <hi rend="italic">The Life and Death of

                    Colchester. She married the Duke of Newcastle abroad in 1645; and on their
                    return after the restoration, spent the remainder of her life in writing plays
                    and poems, together with the life of her husband, to the amount of about a dozen
                    of folios. “What gives the best idea of her unbounded passion for scribbling,”
                    says Mr Walpole, “was her seldom revising the copies of her works, lest, as she
                    said, it should disturb her following conceptions.” She died in 1673.</p>

                    Duke of Devonshire, and one of the most distinguished of British patriots, was
                    born in 1640. In 1677, being then member for Derby, he vigorously opposed the
                    venal measures of the court; and the following year he was one of the committee
                    appointed to draw up articles of impeachment against the lord-treasurer Danby.
                    In 1679, being re-elected to serve for Derby in a new parliament, Charles II.
                    thought proper to make him a privy counsellor; but he soon withdrew from the
                    board with his friend Lord Russell, when he found that the Popish interest
                    prevailed. He carried up the articles of impeachment to the House of Lords
                    against Lord Chief-justice Scroggs, for his arbitrary and illegal proceedings in
                    the court of king’s bench; and when the king declared his resolution not to sign
                    the bill for excluding the Duke of York, afterwards James IL, he moved the House
                    of Commons that a bill might be brought in for the association of all his
                    majesty’s Protestant subjects. He also openly denounced the king’s evil
                    counsellors, and voted for an address to remove them from his presence and
                    councils forever. He nobly appeared at Lord Russell’s trial in defence of that
                    great man, at a time when it was scarcely more criminal to be an accomplice than
                    a witness. The same fortitude, activity, and love of his coun try, animated this
                    illustrious patriot to oppo⅛&gt; the arbitrary’ proceedings of James II.; and
                    when he saw t»at there was no other mode of saving the nation from impending

                    Charles Cavendish, and grandson of William, second duke of Devonshire; born the
                    lOth of October 1731, at Nice, where his mother, Lady Anne Grey, daughter of
                    Henry duke of Kent, had gone, though ineffectually, for the recovery of her
                    health.</p>
                <p>Of a man whose rank among the benefactors of science and of mankind is so
                    elevated as that of Cavendish, we are anxious to learn all the details both of
                    intellectual cultivation and of moral character, which the labours of a
                    biographer can discover and record. Little, however, is known respecting his
                    early education. He was for some time at Newcombe’s school, an establishment of
                    considerable reputation at Hackney, and he afterwards went to Cambridge; but it
                    is probable that he acquired his taste for experimental investigation in a great
                    measure from his father, who was in the habit of amusing himself with
                    meteorological observations and apparatus, and to whom we are indebted for a
                    very accurate determination of the depression of mercury in barometrical tubes,
                    which has been made the basis of some of the most refined investigations of
                    modern times. “It has been observed,” says Μ. Cuvier, “that more persons of rank
                    enter seriously into science and literature in Great Britain than in other
                    countries; and this circumstance may naturally be explained from the
                    constitution of the British government, which renders it impossible for birth
                    and fortune alone to attain to distinction in the state without high cultivation
                    of mind; so that amidst the universal diffusion of solid learning which is thus
                    rendered indispensable, some individuals are always found who are more disposed
                    to occupy themselves in the pursuit of the eternal truths of nature, and in the
                    contemplation of the finished productions of talent and genius, than in the
                    transitory interests of the politics of the day.” Mr Cavendish was neither
                    influenced by the ordinary ambition of becoming a distinguished statesman, nor
                    by a taste for expensive luxuries or sensual gratifications; so that, enjoying a
                    moderate competence during his father’s life, and being elevated by his birth
                    above all danger of being despised for want of greater affluence, he felt
                    himself exempted from the necessity of applying to any professional studies, of
                    courting the approbation of the public either by the parade of literature or by
                    the habits of conviviality, or of ingratiating himself with mixed society by the
                    display of superficial accomplishments. It is difficult to refrain from
                    imagining that his mind had received some slight impression from the habitual
                    recurrence to the motto of his family; the words <hi rend="italic">cavendο
                    tutus</hi> must have occurred perpetually to his eyes; and all the operations of
                    his intellectual powers exhibit a degree of <hi rend="italic">caution</hi>
                    almost unparalleled in the annals of science; for there is scarcely a single
                    instance in which he had occasion to retrace his steps or to recal his opinions.
                    In 1760 he became a fellow of the Royal Society, and continued <pb break="no"

                    and unaffected modesty, and exhibiting a precision of experimental
                    demonstration, commensurate to the judicious selection of the methods of
                    research, and to the accuracy of the argumentative induction; and which have
                    been considered, by some of the most enlightened historians, as having been no
                    less instrumental in promoting the further progress of chemical discovery, by
                    banishing the vague manner of observing and reasoning that had too long
                    prevailed, than by immediately extending the bounds of human knowledge with
                    respect to the very important facts which are first made public in these
                    communications.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Three Papers, containing Experiments on Factitious Air.
                    Phil. Trans.</hi> 1766, p. 141. It had been observed by Boyle, that some kinds
                    of air were unfit for respiration; and Hook and Mayow had looked still farther
                    forwards into futurity with prophetic glances, which seem to have been soon lost
                    and forgotten by the inattention or want of candour of their successors. Hales
                    had made many experiments on gases, but without sufficiently distinguishing
                    their different kinds, or even being fully aware that fixed air was essentially
                    different from the common atmosphere. Sir James Lowther, in 1733, had sent to
                    the Royal Society some bladders filled with coal damp, which remained
                    inflammable for many weeks; little imagining the extent of the advantages which
                    were one day to result to his posterity from the labours of that society, by the
                    prevention of the fatal mischiefs which this substance so frequently occasioned.
                    Dr Seip had soon afterwards suggested that the gas which stagnated in some
                    caverns near Pyrmont was the cause of the briskness of the water; Dr Brownrigg
                    of Whitehaven had confirmed this opinion by experiments in 1741; and Dr Black,
                    in 1755, had explained the operation of this fluid in rendering the earths and
                    alkalies mild. Such was the state of pneumatic chemistry when Mr Cavendish began
                    these experimental researches. He first describes the apparatus now commonly
                    used in processes of this kind, a part of which had been before employed by
                    Hales and others, but which he had rendered far more perfect by the occasional
                    employment of mercury. He next relates the experiments by which he found the
                    specific gravity of inflammable air to be about <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> th of that of common air,
                    whether it was produced from zinc or otherwise: first weighing a bladder filled
                    with a known bulk of the gas, and then in a state of collapse; and also
                    examining the loss of weight during the solution of zinc in an acid, having
                    taken care to absorb all the superfluous moisture of the gas by means of dry
                    potass. He also observed, that the gas obtained during the solution of copper in
                    muriatic acid was rapidly absorbed by water, but he did not inquire further into
                    its nature. The second paper relates to fixed air, which was found to undergo no
                    alteration in its elasticity when kept a year over mercury; to be absorbed by an
                    equal bulk of water, or of olive oil, and by less than half its bulk of spirit
                    of wine; to exceed the atmospheric air in specific gravity by more than one
                    half, and to render this fluid unfit for supporting combustion, even when added
                    to it in the proportion of 1 to 9 only. Mr Cavendish ascertained the quantity of
                    this gas contained in marble and in the alkalies; but his numbers fell somewhat
                    short of those which have been determined by later experiments. He also observed
                    the solubility of the supercarbonate of magnesia. In the third part, the air
                    produced by fermentation and putrefaction is examined. Macbride had shown that a
                    part of it was-fixed air; and our author finds that sugar and water, thrown into
                    fermentation by yeast, emit this gas, without altering the quantity or quality
                    of the common air previously contained in the vessel, which retains its power of
                    exploding with hydrogen, exactly like common air. He also shows that the gas
                    thus emitted is identical with the fixed air obtained from marble; and that the
                    inflammable air extricated during putrefaction resembles that which is procured
                    from zinc, although it appears to be a little heavier.</p>

                    p. 92. In this paper Mr Cavendish shows the solubility of the supercarbonate of
                    lime, which is found in several waters about London, and is decomposed by the
                    process of boiling, the simple carbonate being deposited in the form of a crust.
                    The addition of pure lime water also causes a precipitation of a greater
                    quantity of lime than it contains. These conclusions are confirmed by
                    synthetical experiments, in which the supercarbonate is formed, and remains in
                    solution.</p>

                    Electricity by means of an Elastic Fluid. Phil. Trans.</hi> 1771, p. 584. Our
                    author’s theory of electricity agrees with that which had been published a few
                    years before by Aepinus, but he has entered more minutely into the details of
                    calculation; showing the manner in which the supposed fluid must be distributed
                    in a variety of cases, and explaining the phenomena of electrified and charged
                    substances, as they are actually observed. There is some degree of unnecessary
                    complication, from the great generality of the determinations; the law of
                    electric attraction and repulsion not having been at that time fully
                    ascertained, although Mr Cavendish inclines to the true supposition, of forces
                    varying inversely as the square of the distance. This deficiency he proposes to
                    supply by future experiments, and leaves it to more skilful mathematicians to
                    render some other parts of the theory still more complete. He probably found,
                    that the necessity of the experiments which he intended to pursue was afterwards
                    superseded by those of Lord Stanhope and Μ. Coulomb; but he had carried the
                    mathematical investigation somewhat farther at a later period of his life,
                    though he did not publish his papers; an omission, however, which is the less to
                    be regretted, as Μ. Poisson, assisted by all the improvements of modern
                    analysis, afterwards treated the same subject in a very masterly manner. The
                    acknowledged imperfections in some parts of Mr Cavendish’s demonstrative
                    reasoning, have served to display the strength of a judgment and sagacity still
                    more admirable than the plodding labours of an automatical calculator. One of
                    the corollaries seems at first sight to lead to a mode of distinguishing
                    positive from negative electricity, which is not justified by experiment; but
                    the fallacy appears to be referable to the very comprehensive character of the
                    author’s hypothesis, which requires some little modification to accommodate it
                    to the actual circumstances of the electric fluid, as it must be supposed to
                    exist in nature.</p>

                    the facility with which animal substances in general conduct the fluid. The
                    shock of a torpedo, producing a strong sensation, but incapable of being

                    battery; and an artificial torpedo of wood being made part of the circuit, the
                    shock diffused itself very perceptibly through the water in which it was placed;
                    but the experiment succeeded better when the instrument was made of wet leather,
                    which conducts rather better than wood, the battery being more highly charged,

                    different modes of mixing the elastic fluids; and he justly attributes them to

                    It is remarkable that one of the first of Sir Humphry Davy’s objects, at the
                    very beginning of his singularly brilliant career of refined investigation and
                    fortunate discovery, was the confirmation of this almost forgotten opinion of Mr
                    Cavendish; and for this purpose lie devised the very ingenious experiment of
                    melting two pieces of ice by their mutual friction in a room below the freezing
                    temperature, which is certainly incompatible with the common doctrine of
                    caloric, unless we admit that caloric could have existed in the neighbouring
                    bodies in the form of cold, or of something else that could be converted into
                    caloric by the operation; and this transmutation would still be nearly
                    synonymous with generation in the sense here intended. However this may be, it
                    is certain that, notwithstanding all the experiments of Count Rumford, Dr
                    Haldalt, and others, Sir Humphry was less successful in persuading his
                    contemporaries of the truth of Mr Cavendish’s doctrine of heat, than in
                    establishing the probability of his opinions respecting the muriatic acid.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Experiments on Air. Phil. Trans.</hi> 1784, p. 119. This
                    paper contains an account of two of the greatest discoveries in chemistry that
                    have ever yet been made public; the composition of water, and that of the nitric
                    acid. The author first establishes the radical difference of hydrogen from
                    nitrogen or azote; he then proceeds to relate his experiments on the combustion
                    of hydrogen with oxygen, which had partly been suggested by a cursory
                    observation of Mr Warltire, a lecturer on natural philosophy, and which prove
                    that pure water is the result of the process, provided that no nitrogen be
                    present. These experiments were first made in 1781, and were then mentioned to
                    Dr Priestley; and when they were first communicated to Lavoisier, he found some
                    difficulty in believing them to be accurate. The second series of experiments
                    demonstrates, that when phlogisticated air, or nitrogen, is present in the
                    process, some nitric acid is produced; and that this acid may be obtained from
                    atmospheric air, by the repeated operation of the electrical spark.</p>
                <p>It has been supposed by one of Mr Cavendish’s biographers, that if Mr Kirwan,
                    instead of opposing, had adopted his chemical opinions, “he would never have
                    been obliged to yield to his French antagonists, and the antiphlogistic theory
                    would never have gained ground.” But in this supposition there seems to be a
                    little of national prejudice. Mr Cavendish by no means dissented from the whole
                    of the antiphlogistic theory; and in this paper he has quoted Lavoisier and
                    Scheele in terms of approbation, as having suggested the opinion “that
                    dephlogisticated and phlogisticated air are quite distinct substances, and not
                    differing only in their degree of phlogistication, and that common air is a
                    mixture of the two.” He afterwards mentions several memoirs of Lavoisier in
                    which phlogiston is entirely discarded; and says that “not only the foregoing
                    experiments, but most other phenomena of nature, seem explicable as well, or
                    nearly as well, upon this as upon the commonly believed principle of phlogiston
                    and after stating a slight conjectural objection, derived from the chemical
                    constitution<pb break="no" facs="nls:193350422" xml:id="kp-eb0706-0422-0263"/>
                    of vegetables, he proceeds finally to observe, that “Lavoisier endeavours to
                    prove that dephlogisticated air is the acidifying principle.” This is no more
                    than saying that acids lose their acidity by uniting to phlogiston, which, with
                    regard to the nitrous, vitriolic, phosphoric, and arsenical acids, is certainly
                    true; and probably with regard to the acid of sugar; “but as to the marine acid,
                    and acid of tartar, it does not appear that they are capable of losing their
                    acidity by any union with phlogiston;” and the acids of sugar and tartar become
                    even less acid by a further de-ρhlogistication. It is obvious that this argument
                    amounts only to an exception, and not to a total denial of the truth of the
                    theory. Μ. Cuvier has even asserted that the antiphlogistic theory derived its
                    first origin from one great discovery of Mr Cavendish, that of the nature of
                    hydrogen gas, and owed its complete establishment to another, that of the
                    composition of water; but it would be unjust to deny to Lavoisier the merit of
                    considerable originality in his doctrines respecting the combinations of oxygen;
                    and however he may have been partly anticipated by Hook and Mayow, it was
                    certainly from him that the modern English chemists immediately derived the true
                    knowledge of the constitution of the atmosphere, which they did not admit
                    without some hesitation, but which they did ultimately admit when they found the
                    evidence irresistible. On the other hand, it has been sufficiently established,
                    since Mr Cavendish’s death, by the enlightened researches of the most original
                    of all chemists, that Lavoisier had carried his generalization too far; and it
                    must ever be remembered, to the honour of Mr Cavendish, and to the credit of
                    this country, that we had not all been seduced, by the dazzling semblance of
                    universal laws, to admit facts as demonstrated which were only made plausible by
                    a slight and imperfect analogy.</p>

                    inaccurate experiments, had objected to those conclusions which form the
                    principal basis of the antiphlogistic theory. Mr Cavendish repeated such of
                    these experiments as seemed to be the most ambiguous, and repelled the
                    objections; showing, in particular, that when fixed air was derived from the
                    combustion of iron, it was only to be referred to the plumbago shown by Bergmann
                    to exist in it, which was well known to be capable, in common with other

                    subjected to the operation of the electric spark; the fixed air sometimes
                    obtained during the process being wholly dependent on the presence of some

                    congelation are still further investigated, and illustrated by comparison with
                    Mr Keir’s experiments on the sulphuric acid. It was found that the nitric acid
                    was only liable to the aqueous congelation, unless it was strong enough to
                    dissolve one fourth of its weight of marble; and that it had a point of easy
                    congelation, when it was capable of dissolving 415/1000, the frozen part
                    exhibiting, in other cases, a tendency to approach to this standard. Mr Keir had
                    found that sulphuric acid of the specific gravity I∙78 froze at 46°; and that it
                    had another minimum when it was very highly concentrated.</p>

                    breadth, so that they are never seen at places far remote from the direction of
                    the surface; and hence it is difficult to procure observations sufficiently
                    accurate for determining their height upon so short a base; but in the present
                    instance there is reason to believe that the height must have been between
                    fifty-two and seventy-one miles.</p>

                    an Account of three Almanacs belonging to Charles Wilkins, Esq. Phil.
                    Trans.</hi> 1792, p. 383. The subject of this paper is more intricate than
                    generally interesting; but it may serve as a specimen of the diligence which the
                    author employed in the investigation of every point more or less immediately
                    connected with his favourite objects. The month of the Hindus is lunar in its
                    duration, but solar in its commencement; and its periods are extremely
                    complicated, and often different for different geographical situations. The day
                    is divided and subdivided sexagesimally. The date of the year, in the epoch of
                    the Kaly Yug, expresses the ordinal number of years elapsed, as it is usual with
                    our astronomers to reckon their days; so that the year 100 would be the
                    beginning of the second century, and not the 100th year, or the end of the first
                    century, as in the European calendar; in the same manner as, in astronomical
                    language, 1817 December 31d. 18h. means six o’clock in the morning of the 1st of
                    January 1818.</p>

                    Trans.</hi> 1798, p. 469. The apparatus with which this highly important
                    investigation was conducted had been invented and constructed many years before
                    by the reverend John Michell, who did not live to perform the experiments for
                    which he intended it. Mr Cavendish, however, by the accuracy and perseverance
                    with which he carried on a course of observations of so delicate a nature, as
                    well as by the skill and judgment with which he obviated the many unforeseen
                    difficulties that occurred in its progress, and determined the corrections of
                    various kinds which it was necessary to apply to the results, has deserved no
                    less gratitude from the cultivators of astronomy and geography than if the idea
                    had originally been his own. The method employed was to suspend by a vertical
                    wire a horizontal bar, having a leaden weight at each end; to determine the
                    magnitude of the force of torsion by the time occupied in the lateral vibrations
                    of the bar; and to measure the extent of the change produced in its <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193350435" xml:id="kp-eb0706-0435-0264"/> situation by the
                    attraction of two large masses of lead placed on opposite sides of the case
                    containing the apparatus, so that this attraction might be compared with the
                    weight of the balls, or, in other words, with the attraction of the earth. In
                    this manner the mean density of the earth was found to be five and a half times
                    as great as that of water; and although this is considerably more than had been
                    inferred from Dr Maskelyne’s observations on the attraction of Shichallain, yet
                    the experiments agree so well with each other, that we can scarcely suppose any
                    material error to have affected them. Mr Michell’s apparatus resembled that
                    which M. Coulomb had employed in his experiments on magnetism, but he appears to
                    have invented it some time before the publication of M. Coulomb’s Memoirs.</p>

                    Phil. Trans.</hi> 1809, p. 221. The merits of this improvement have not been
                    very highly appreciated by those who are in the habit of executing the divisions
                    of circular arcs. It consists in a mode of employing a microscope, with its
                    cross wires, as a substitute for one of the points of a beam compass, while
                    another point draws a faint line on the face of the instrument in the usual
                    manner. The Duke de Chaulnes had before used microscopal sights for dividing
                    circles, but his method more nearly resembled that which has been brought
                    forward in an improved form by Captain Kater; and Mr Cavendish, by using a
                    single microscope only, seems to have sacrificed some advantages which the other
                    methods appear to possess; but none of them has been very fairly tried; and our
                    artists have hitherto continued to adhere to the modes which they had previously
                    adopted, and which it would perhaps have been difficult for them to abandon,
                    even if they had been convinced of the advantages to be gained by some partial
                    improvements.</p>
                <p>Such were the diversified labours of a philosopher who possessed a clearness of
                    comprehension, and an acuteness of reasoning, which had been the lot of very few
                    of his predecessors since the days of Newton. Maelaurin and Waring, perhaps also
                    Stirling and Landen, were incomparably greater mathematicians; but none of them
                    attempted to employ their powers of investigation in the pursuit of physical
                    discovery. Euler and Lagrange on the Continent had carried the improvements of
                    analytical reasoning to an unparalleled extent; and they both, as well as Daniel
                    Bernoulli and D’Alembert, applied these powers with marked success to the
                    solution of a great variety of problems in mechanics and in astronomy. But they
                    made no experimental discoveries of importance; and the splendid career of
                    chemical investigation which has since been pursued with a degree of success
                    unprecedented in history, may be said to have been first laid open to mankind by
                    the labours of Mr Cavendish; although the further discoveries of Priestley,
                    Scheele, and Lavoisier, soon furnished, in rapid succession, a superstructure
                    commensurate to the extent of the foundations so happily laid. “Whatever the
                    sciences revealed to Mr Cavendish,” says Cuvier, “appeared always to exhibit
                    something of the sublime and the marvellous; he weighed the earth; he rendered
                    the air navigable; he deprived water of the quality of an element and he denied
                    to fire the character of a substance. “The clearness of the evidence on which he
                    established his discoveries, new and unexpected as they were, is still more
                    astonishing than the facts themselves which he detected; and the works in which
                    he has made them public are so many masterpieces of sagacity and of methodical
                    reasoning, each perfect as a whole and in its parts, and leaving nothing for any
                    other hand to correct, but rising in splendour with each successive year that
                    passes over them, and promising to carry down his name to a posterity far more
                    remote than his rank and connections could ever have enabled him to attain
                    without them.”</p>
                <p>In his manners Mr Cavendish had the appearance of a quickness and sensibility
                    almost morbid, united tea slight hesitation in his speech, which seems to have
                    depended more on the constitution of his mind than on any deficiency of his
                    organic powers, and to an air of timidity and reserve, which sometimes afforded
                    a contrast, almost ludicrous, with the sentiments of profound respect which were
                    professed by those with whom he conversed. It is not impossible that he may have
                    been indebted to his love of severe study, not only for the decided superiority
                    of his faculties to those of the generality of mankind, but even for his
                    exemption from absolute eccentricity of character. His person was tall, and
                    rather thin; his dress was singularly uniform, although sometimes a little
                    neglected. His pursuits were seldom interrupted by indisposition; but he
                    suffered occasionally from calculous complaints. His retired habits of life, and
                    his disregard of popular opinion, appear to have lessened the notoriety which
                    might otherwise have attached to his multiplied successes in science; but his
                    merits were more generally understood on the Continent than in this country,
                    although it was not till he had passed the age of seventy that he was made one
                    of the eight foreign associates of the institute of France.</p>
                <p>Mr Cavendish was not less remarkable, in the latter part of his life, for the
                    immense accumulation of his pecuniary property, than for his intellectual and
                    scientific treasures. His father died in 1783, being at that time eighty years
                    old, and the senior member of the Royal Society; but he is said to have
                    succeeded at an earlier period to a considerable inheritance left him by one of
                    his uncles. He resided principally at Clapham Common; but his library was
                    latterly at his house in Bedford Square; and his books were at the command of
                    all men of letters, either personally known to him, or recommended by his
                    friends; indeed the whole arrangement was so impartially methodical, that he
                    never took down a book for his own use, with≈ out entering it in the loan book;
                    and after the death of a German gentleman, who had been his librarian, he
                    appointed a day on which he attended in person to lend any work for the
                    accommodation of the few who thought themselves justified in applying to him for
                    such books as they wished to consult. He was constantly present at the meetings
                    of the Royal Society, as well as at the conversations held at the house of the
                    president; and he dined every Thursday with the club composed of its members. He
                    had little intercourse with general society, or even with his own family, and
                    saw only once a year the person whom he had made his principal heir. He is said
                    to have assisted several young men whose talents recommended them to his notice,
                    in obtaining establishments in life; but in his later years such instances were
                    certainly very rare. His tastes and his pleasures do not seem to have been in
                    unison with those which are best adapted to the generality of mankind; and
                    amidst the abundance of all the means of acquiring every earthly enjoyment, he
                    must have wanted that sympathy which alone is capable of redoubling our
                    delights, by the consciousness that we share them in common with a multitude of
                    our friends, and of enhancing the beauties of all the bright prospects that
                    surround us, when they are still more highly embellished by reflection “from
                    looks that we love.” He could have had no limitation either of comfort or of
                    luxury to stimulate him to exertion; even his riches must have deprived him of
                    the gratification of believing, that each new triumph in science might promote
                    the attainment of some great object in life that he earnestly desired; a
                    gratification generally indeed illusory, but which does not cease to beguile us
                    till we become callous<pb break="no" facs="nls:193350448"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-0448-0265"/> as well to the pleasures as to the sorrows of
                    existence. But in midst of this “painful pre-eminence,” he must still have been
                    capable of extending his sensibility over a still wider field of time and space,
                    and of looking forward to the approbation of the wise and the good of all
                    countries and of all ages; and he must have enjoyed the highest and purest of
                    all intellectual pleasures, arising from the consciousness of his own
                    excellence, and from the certainty that, sooner or later, all mankind must
                    acknowledge his claim to their profoundest respect and highest veneration.</p>
                <p>“It was probably either the reserve of his manners,” says Cuvier, “or the modest
                    tone of his writings, that procured him the uncommon distinction of never having
                    his repose disturbed either by jealousy or by criticism. Like his great
                    countryman Newton, whom he resembled in so many other respects, he died full of
                    years and honours, beloved even by his rivals, respected by the age which he had
                    enlightened, celebrated throughout the scientific world, and exhibiting to
                    mankind a perfect model of what a man of science ought to be, and a splendid
                    example of that success which is so eagerly sought, but so seldom obtained.” The
                    last words that he uttered were characteristic of his unalterable love of method
                    and subordination; he had ordered his servant to leave him, and not to return
                    till a certain hour, intending to pass his latest moments in the tranquillity of
                    perfect solitude; but the servant’s impatience to watch his master diligently
                    having induced him to infringe the order, he was severely reproved for his
                    indiscretion, and took care not to repeat the offence until the scene was
                    finally closed. Mr Cavendish died on the 24th of February 1810, and was buried
                    in the family vault at Derby. He left a property in the funds of about
                    L.700,000, which he divided into six equal parts, giving two to Lord George
                    Cavendish, the son of his first cousin, one to each of his sons, and one to the
                    Earl of Bessborough, whose mother was also his first cousin. Some other personal
                    property devolved to Lord George as residuary legatee; and a landed estate of
                    L.6000 a year descended to his only brother, Mr Frederic Cavendish of Market
                    Street, Herts, a single man, and of habits of life so peculiarly retired, that
                    any further increase of income would have been still more useless to him than it
                    had been to the testator.</p>
                <p>Much as Mr Cavendish effected for the promotion of physical science throughout
                    his life, it has not been unusual, even for his warmest admirers, to express
                    some regret that he did not attempt to do still more after his death by the
                    appropriation of a small share of his immense and neglected wealth to the
                    perpetual encouragement of those objects which he had himself pursued with so
                    much ardour. But however we might be disposed to lament such an omission, we
                    have surely no reason to complain of his determination to follow more nearly the
                    ordinary course of distribution of his property, among those whose relationship
                    would have given them a legal claim to the succession if he had not concerned
                    himself in directing it. We may observe on many other occasions that the most
                    successful cultivators of science are not always the most strenuous promoters of
                    it in others; as we often see the most ignorant persons, having been rendered
                    sensible by experience of their own deficiencies, somewhat disposed to overrate
                    the value of education, and to bestow more on the improvement of their children
                    than men of profounder learning, who may possibly have felt the insufficiency of
                    their own accomplishments for insuring success in the world. But even if Mr
                    Cavendish had been inclined to devote a large share of his property to the
                    establishment of fellowships or professorships, for the incitement of men of
                    talents to a more complete devotion of their lives to the pursuit of science, it
                    is very doubtful whether he could have entertained a reasonable hope of
                    benefiting his country by such an institution; for the highest motives that
                    stimulate men to exertion are not those which are immediately connected with
                    their pecuniary interests. The senators and the statesmen of Great Britain are
                    only paid in glory; and where we seek to obtain the co-operation of the best
                    educated and the most enlightened individuals in any pursuit or profession, we
                    must hold out as incentives the possession of high celebrity and public respect,
                    assured that they will be incomparably more effectual than any mercenary
                    considerations, which are generally found to determine a crowd of commercial
                    speculators to enter into competition for the proposed rewards, and to abandon
                    all further concern with the objects intended to be pursued as soon as their
                    avarice is gratified. To raise the rank of science in civil life is therefore
                    most essentially to promote its progress; and when we compare the state not only
                    of the scientific associations, but also of the learned professions, in this
                    country and among our neighbours, we shall feel little reason to regret the
                    total want of pecuniary patronage that is remarkable in Great Britain with
                    respect to every independent department of letters, while it is so amply
                    compensated by the greater degree of credit and respectability attached to the
                    possession of successful talent. It must not however be denied, that even in
                    this point of view there might be some improvement in the public spirit of the
                    country. Mr Cavendish was indeed neither fond of giving nor of receiving praise;
                    and he was little disposed to enliven the intervals of his serious studies by
                    the promotion of social or convivial cheerfulness; but it would at all times be
                    very easy for an individual, possessed of high rank and ample fortune, of
                    correct taste and elegant manners, to confer so much dignity on science and
                    literature, by showing personal testimonies of respect to acknowledged merit, as
                    greatly to excite the laborious student to the unremitting exertions of patient
                    application, and to rouse the man of brilliant talent to the noblest flights of
                    genius. <hi rend="smallcaps">(l. l.)</hi></p>
