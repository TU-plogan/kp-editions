                <p><label type="entry">CHRISTIANITY</label>, the religion of Christians. The word is
                    analogically derived, as other abstracts from their concretes, from the
                    adjective <hi rend="italic">Christian,</hi> which again is formed from the name
                    X^∕(iroς, <hi rend="italic">Christus,</hi> the Anointed. The Saviour of the
                    world was so called, from a custom which prevailed extensively in antiquity, and
                    was originally said to be of divine institution, of anointing persons in the
                    sacerdotal or regal character, as a public mark of their consecration to these
                    important offices, and as a testimony that heaven itself was the guarantee of
                    that relation which then commencedbetween the personsthus consecrated andtheir
                    subordinates.</p>
                <p>The disciples of Jesus, after the death of their teacher, were for some time
                    called Nazarenes, from Nazareth in Galilee, where he dwelt; a name which
                    afterwards became the designation of a particular sect. They who adopted the
                    principles and professed the religion which he taught were first distinguished
                    by the name of Christians at Antioch. That profession, and those doctrines, we
                    now proceed briefly to describe.</p>
                <p>When a Christian is interrogated concerning the nature and foundation of his
                    faith and practice, his ultimate reference and last appeal is to the facts, the
                    doctrines, and the injunctions, contained in the books of the Old and New
                    Testament. From these, therefore, and from these alone, must every fair account,
                    or the materials of which it is composed, be extracted or deduced. Other
                    formularies, or confessions of faith, may deserve more or less attention, as
                    they are more or less immediately contained or implied in the Scriptures. But
                    whatever is not actually expressed in, or deducible by fair and necessary
                    consequence from these writings, must be regarded as merely human, and can have
                    no other title to our assent and observation than what it derives from its
                    conformity with the Scriptures, as faithfully and honestly interpreted. But as
                    the books from which the Christian derives his principles of belief and rules of
                    conduct have been variously interpreted by different professors and
                    commentators, these diversities have given birth to a multiplicity of different
                    sects. It cannot, therefore, be expected, that any one who undertakes to give an
                    account of Christianity, should advert to all the writings and opinions which
                    have been propagated and exhibited by historical, systematical, or polemical
                    authors. These, if at all contained <pb break="no" facs="nls:193355076"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-5076-0621"/>in such a work as this, should be ranged under
                    their proper articles, whether scientific, controversial, or biographical. It is
                    our present business, if possible, to confine ourselves to a detail of such
                    facts and doctrines as, in the strict and primitive sense of the word, are <hi
                    rend="italic">catholic,</hi> or, in other words, to such as uniformly have been,
                    and still continue to be, recognized and admitted by the whole body of
                    Christians.</p>
                <p>It has already been said that these, or at least the greatest number of them,
                    appeal to the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament as the ultimate standard
                    and only infallible rule of faith and manners. If the question be asked, by what
                    authority these books claim an absolute right to determine the consciences and
                    understandings of men with regard to what they should believe and what they
                    should do,—the answer will be, that all Scripture, whether for doctrine,
                    correction, or reproof, has been given by immediate inspiration from God. If,
                    again, it be asked how those books called <hi rend="italic">Scripture</hi> are
                    authenticated, the reply will be, that the evidences by which the Old and New
                    Testament are proved to be the word of God, are either external or internal. The
                    <hi rend="italic">external</hi> may again be divided into direct or collateral.
                    The direct evidences are such as arise from the nature, consistency, and
                    probability, of the facts, and from the simplicity, uniformity, competency, and
                    fidelity, of the testimonies by which they are supported. The collateral events
                    are either the same occurrences supported by heathen testimonies, or others
                    which concur with and corroborate the history of Christianity. The <hi
                    rend="italic">internal</hi> evidence arises either from its exact conformity
                    with the character of God, from its aptitude to the frame and circumstances of
                    man, or from those supernatural convictions and assistances which are impressed
                    on the mind by the immediate operation of the divine spirit. But these can only
                    be mentioned cursorily in a detail so concise as the present.</p>
                <p>Such facts as are related in the history of his religion the Christian asserts to
                    be consistent with themselves and and with one another. Hence it is that, by a
                    series of antecedents and consequences, they corroborate each other, and form a
                    chain which cannot be broken except by an absolute subversion of all historical
                    authority. Nor is this all. According to him, the facts on which Christianity is
                    founded, not only of themselves constitute a series, but are likewise, in
                    several periods, the best resources for supplying the chasms in the history of
                    our species, and preserving the tenor of its annals entire. The facts themselves
                    are either natural or supernatural. By natural facts we mean such occurrences as
                    happen or may happen by the operation of mechanical laws, or the interposition
                    of natural agents, without higher assistants. Such are all the common
                    occurrences of history, whether natural or civil. By supernatural facts we mean
                    such as could not have been produced without the immediate interposition of
                    Deity, or at least of powers superior to the laws of mechanism, or the agency of
                    human instruments. Among these may be reckoned the immediate change of water
                    into wine, the instantaneous cure of diseases without the intervention of
                    medicine, the resuscitation of the dead, and other acts of the same kind. In
                    this order of occurrences may likewise be numbered the exertion and exhibition
                    of prophetic power, in circumstances where the persons by whom this
                    extraordinary gift was displayed could neither by penetration nor conjecture
                    unravel the mazes of futurity, and trace the events of which they spoke from
                    their primary causes to their remote consequences; so that persons thus gifted
                    must have been the passive organs of some superior being, to whose view the
                    whole concatenation of causes and effects operating from the origin to the
                    consummation of nature, lay naked and open.</p>
                <p>It has already been hinted, that the facts which we have called <hi rend="italic"
                    >natural</hi> not only agree with the analogy of human events, and corroborate
                    each other, but in many instances forcibly illustrate the history of nature in
                    general. Oí this a Christian may offer one instance, of which philosophy will
                    never perhaps be able to produce any tolerable solution, without having recourse
                    to the facts upon which Christianity is founded; for if mankind were originally
                    descended from one pair alone, how did it happen that, long before the date of
                    authentic history, every nation had acquired its ow n language? Or if it be
                    supposed, as some philosophers have done, that man is an indigenous animal in
                    every country, or that he was originally produced in and created for each
                    particular soil and climate which he inhabits,—still it may be demanded, whence
                    arose the prodigious multiplicity and the immense diversity of languages? Is the
                    language of every nation intuitive, or is it dictated by necessity, and
                    established by convention? If the last of these suppositions be true, what an
                    immense period of time must have passed; how many revolutions of material and
                    intellectual nature must have happened; what accessions of knowledge,
                    refinement, and civilization, must human intercourse have gained, before the
                    formation and establishment even of the most simple, imperfect, and barbarous
                    language! Why is a period so vast obliterated entirely, so as to escape the
                    retrospect of history, tradition, or even fable itself? Why was the acquisition
                    and improvement of other arts so infinitely distant from that of language, that
                    the era of the latter is entirely lost, whilst we can trace the former from
                    their origin through the various gradations of their progress? These
                    difficulties, inextricable by all the lights of history or philosophy, are
                    immediately dissipated by the Mosaic account of the confusion of tongues, wisely
                    intended to separate the tribes of men one from another; to replenish the
                    surface of the globe; and to give its multiplied inhabitants those opportunities
                    of improvement which might be derived from experiment and industry, variously
                    exerted, according to the different situations in which they were placed, and
                    the different employments which these situations dictated. Thus the duration of
                    the existence of nature is limited to a period within the reach of human
                    intellect; and thus whatever has happened might have happened during the present
                    mode of things; whereas, if we deduce the origin and diversity of language from
                    a period so remotely distant as to be absolutely lost, and entirely detached
                    from all the known occurrences and vicissitudes of time, we must admit the
                    present forms and arrangements of things to have subsisted perhaps for a much
                    longer duration than any mechanical philosopher will allow to be possible. Other
                    instances equally pregnant with conviction might be multiplied; but holding this
                    to be sufficient, we shall proceed to make a single observation upon the facts
                    which have been termed <hi rend="italic">supernatural.</hi></p>
                <p>Of those changes which happen in sensible objects, sensation alone can enable us
                    to judge. Reason has nothing; to do in the matter. It may draw conclusions from
                    thei testimonies of sense, but it can never refute them. If, therefore, our
                    senses inform us that snow is white, it would be vain for the most learned and
                    subtile philosopher to endeavour to convince us that it was of a contrary
                    colour. He might confound, but he never could persuade us. Such changes,
                    therefore, as appear to happen in sensible objects, must either be real or
                    fallacious. If real, the miracle is admitted; if fallacious, there must be a
                    cause of deception equally unaccountable with reference to the powers of nature,
                    and therefore equally miraculous. If the veracity or competency of the witnesses
                    be questioned, the Christian answers that they must be competent, because the
                    facts which they relate were not beyond <pb break="no" facs="nls:193355089"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-5089-0622"/>their capacity to determine; and they must
                    likewise be faithful, because they had no secular motives for maintaining, but
                    many for suppressing or disguising, their testimony. Now the Christian appeals
                    to the whole series of history and experience, whether such a man is or can be
                    found, as will offer a voluntary, solemn, and deliberate sacrifice of truth at
                    the shrine of caprice. But such facts as, after a long continuance of time, have
                    been found exactly agreeable to predictions formerly emitted, must supersede the
                    fidelity of testimony, and infallibly prove that the event was known to the
                    being by whom it was foretold. It has been urged, but in vain, that prophecies
                    are ambiguous and equivocal; for though they may prefigure subordinate events,
                    yet if the grand occurrences to which they ultimately relate can alone fulfil
                    them in their various circumstances, and in their utmost extent, it is plain
                    that the being by whom they were revealed must have been actually prescient of
                    those events, and must have had them in view when the predictions were uttered.
                    The reader may consult a learned and ingenious dissertation on the credibility
                    of gospel-history by Dr Macknight, where the evidences, detached and scattered
                    through innumerable volumes, are assembled and arranged in such a manner as to
                    derive strength and lustre from the method in which they arc disposed, without
                    diminishing the force of each in particular. The works of Hurd, and those of
                    Newton, Sherlock, Chandler, and others, may likewise be consulted. The
                    publication of Mr Hume’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on Miracles</hi> was attended
                    with the manifest advantage of exciting much discussion on the important subject
                    to which it relates. The sophistry of his arguments was very ably exposed by Dr
                    Campbell, one of the most acute writers of the age; nor must we overlook the
                    labours of Bishop Douglas and Dr Adams, who have both treated this subject with
                    judgment and ability.</p>
                <p>On this branch of the subject we may observe, that a question has been raised,
                    and debated with much learning and ingenuity on both sides, namely, whether the
                    evidence of miracles, considered apart from the peculiar nature and doctrines of
                    Christianity, would not of itself be sufficient to establish the title of this
                    religion to be received and acknowledged as a divine revelation. Such a
                    disputation, however, is but little calculated to promote edification, and seems
                    to have originated rather in a love of paradox, or a desire to strike out
                    something apparently new, than in any sound and comprehensive estimate of the
                    evidences of Christianity. For while it is certain, on the one hand, that the
                    power of working real and incontestable miracles is a direct authentication of a
                    divine mission, and forms an unchallengeable credential of a teacher sent from
                    above; it is equally clear, on the other, that the fact of this power having
                    been conferred presupposes that the purpose to be served is beneficent, and that
                    the doctrines to be taught arc such as immediately concern the well-being and
                    happiness of the human race. In other words, the external can never be separated
                    from the internal evidence; they are two parts of one great whole; and it is,
                    therefore, vain to perplex ourselves by speculating on the supposition of a
                    defective revelation, or torturing our ingenuity to find arguments in support of
                    the hypothesis of the external evidence being sufficient of itself without the
                    internal. Such an hypothesis, indeed, involves a gross absurdity, if not
                    something worse; for it manifestly proceeds on the assumption that any set of
                    doctrines and principles, however flagitious and detestable, may be established
                    by the same evidence which has been employed to accredit Christianity to the
                    human race. But it must be obvious that no kind of evidence, natural or
                    supernatural, can ever prove that to be true which is in its own nature false,
                    or sanction doctrines subversive of reason and morality. This, however, is an
                    unprofitable, not to say profane, speculation, and ought, therefore, to be
                    discouraged as such. The plain and obvious view of the subject is this: God is
                    infinitely wise; and when he interposes by immediate manifestations of his
                    power, the purpose or object to be accomplished must be compatible with and
                    worthy of his inconceivable wisdom and goodness. The interposition itself, and
                    the end to be served by it, cannot possibly be disjoined. The one imports the
                    direct sanction of heaven; and the other must reflect in vivid colours the
                    attributes of that overruling intelligence which is the source of all knowledge,
                    all truth, and all goodness.</p>
                <p>It must be obvious to every reflecting mind, that whether ( we attempt to form
                    the idea of any religion <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> ort contemplate those
                    which have been already exhibited, certain facts and principles must be
                    pre-established, from which will result a particular frame of mind and course of
                    action, suitable to the character and dignity of that Being by whom the religion
                    is enjoined, and adapted to the nature and situation of those agents who are
                    commanded to observe it. Hence Christianity may be divided into <hi
                    rend="italic">credenda</hi> or doctrines, and <hi rend="italic">agenda</hi> or
                    precepts.</p>
                <p>As the great foundation of his religion, therefore, the Christian believes in the
                    existence and government of an eternal and infinite essence, which even involves
                    in itself the cause of its own existence, and inherently possesses all those
                    perfections which are compatible with its nature; as almighty power, omniscient
                    wisdom, infinite justice, boundless goodness, and universal presence. In this
                    indivisible Essence the Christian recognizes three distinct subsistences, yet
                    distinguishable in such a manner as not to be incompatible with essential unity
                    or simplicity of being. Nor is this essential union incompatible with the
                    personal distinction of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Each of these persons
                    possesses the same nature and properties to the same extent; and as they are but
                    one God, there is none of them subordinate, none supreme. The only way by which
                    the Christian can discriminate them is, by their various relations, properties,
                    and offices.</p>
                <p>This infinite Being, though absolutely independent, and for ever sufficient for
                    his own beatitude, was graciously pleased to create a universe, replete with
                    inferior intelligences, who might for ever contemplate and enjoy his glory,
                    participate his happiness, and imitate his perfections. But as freedom of will
                    is essential to the nature of moral agents, in order to enable them to
                    co-operate with God in their own improvement and happiness, so their natures and
                    powers arc necessarily limited, and by that constitution rendered peccable. This
                    peccability was first manifested in a rank of intelligence superior to man. But
                    as guilt is never stationary, Satan and his apostate angels attempted to
                    transfer their turpitude and misery to man, and were, unhappily, but too
                    successful. Hence the heterogeneous and irreconcilable principles which operate
                    in his nature; hence that inexplicable medley of wisdom and folly, of rectitude
                    and error, of benevolence and malignity, of sincerity and fraud, exhibited
                    throughout his whole conduct; hence the darkness of his understanding, the
                    depravity of his will, the pollution of his heart, the irregularity of his
                    affections; and the absolute subversion of his whole internal economy. These
                    seeds of perdition soon ripened into open acts of disobedience and guilt. All
                    the hostilities of nature were confronted, and the whole sublunary creation
                    became a theatre of disorder and mischief.</p>
                <p>And here the Christian once more appeals to fact and experience. If these things
                    are so—if man is the vessel of guilt and the victim of misery—he demands how
                    this constitution of things can be accounted for, or how it can be supposed that
                    a being so wicked and unhappy should be the production of an infinitely oerfect
                    Creator. Hê <pb break="no" facs="nls:193355102" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5102-0623"
                    />therefore insists that human nature must have been disarranged and
                    contaminated by some violent shock; and that, without the light diffused over
                    the face of things by Christianity, all nature must remain an inscrutable and
                    inexplicable mystery. To redress these evils, to re-establish the empire of
                    virtue and happiness, to restore the nature of man to its primitive rectitude,
                    to satisfy the demands of infinite justice, to purify every original or
                    contracted stain, to expiate the guilt and destroy the power of vice, the
                    eternal Son of God, the second person of the sacred Trinity, the Logos or Divine
                    Word, the Redeemer or Saviour of the world, the Immanuel or God with us, from
                    whom Christianity takes its name, and to whom it owes its origin, descended from
                    the bosom of his Father, assumed the human nature, became the representative of
                    man, exhibited a pattern of perfect righteousness, and at last ratified his
                    doctrine, atoned for the sins of the world, and fully accomplished all the ends
                    of his mission, by a cruel, unmerited, and ignominious death.</p>
                <p>Before this divine person left our world, he delivered the doctrine of human
                    salvation, and the rules of human conduct, to his apostles, whom he empowered to
                    instruct the world in all that concerned their eternal felicity, and whom he
                    invested with miraculous gifts to confirm the reality of what they taught. To
                    them he likewise promised another comforter, even the Divine Spirit, who should
                    enlighten the darkness, and console the woes of human nature. Having remained
                    for a part of three days under the power of death, he rose again from the grave,
                    discovered himself to his disciples, conversed with them for a time on earth,
                    and then ascended into heaven; whence the Christian expects him, according to
                    his promise, to appear at the last day as the Sovereign Judge of the living and
                    the dead. Soon after his departure to the right hand of his Father, where, in
                    his human nature, he sits supreme of all created beings, and invested with the
                    absolute administration of heaven and earth, the Spirit of grace and consolation
                    descended on his apostlcs with visible signs of divine power and presence. Nor
                    were his salutary operations confined to them, but extended to all the rational
                    world who did not by obstinate guilt repel his influence, and force him to
                    withdraw them. These, indeed, were not so conspicuous as at the glorious era
                    when they were visibly exhibited in the persons of the apostles; but though his
                    energy be less observable, it is by no means less effectual to all the purposes
                    of grace and mercy.</p>
                <p>The Christian is convinced that there is and ever will be a society upon earth,
                    who worship God as revealed in Jesus Christ, who believe in his doctrines, who
                    observe his precepts, and who shall be saved by his death and the use of those
                    external means of salvation which he has appointed. These are few and simple.
                    The sacraments of baptism and the eucharist, the interpretation and application
                    of scripture, the habitual exercise of public and private devotion, are
                    obviously calculated to diffuse and promote the interests of truth and virtue,
                    by superinducing the salutary habits of faith, love, and repentance. The
                    Christian is firmly persuaded that, at the consummation of all things, when the
                    purposes of providence in the various revolutions of progressive nature are
                    accomplished, the whole human race shall once more issue from their graves; some
                    to immortal felicity, in the actual perception and enjoyment of their Creator’s
                    presence; others to everlasting shame and misery.</p>
                <p>The two grand principles of action, according to the Christian, are, the love of
                    God, which is the sovereign passion in every perfect mind; and the love of man,
                    which regulates our actions according to the various relations in which we
                    stand, whether to communities or to individuals. This sacred connection can
                    never be totally extinguished by any temporary injury. It ought to subsist in
                    some degree even amongst enemies. It requires that we should pardon the offences
                    of others, as we expect pardon for our own; and that we should no further resist
                    evil than is necessary for the preservation of personal rights and social
                    happiness. It dictates every relative and reciprocal duty between parents and
                    children, masters and servants, governors and subjects, friends and friends, men
                    and men. Nor does it merely enjoin the observation of equity; it likewise
                    inspires the most sublime and extensive charity, a boundless and disinterested
                    effusion of tenderness for the whole species, which feels for their distress,
                    and labours for their relief and improvement. These heavenly dispositions, and
                    the different duties which are their natural exertions, arc the various
                    gradations by which the Christian hopes to attain the perfection of his nature,
                    and the most exquisite happiness of which it is susceptible.</p>
                <p>Such are the speculative, and such the practical principles of Christianity. From
                    the former, its votaries contend, that the origin, coonomy, and revolutions of
                    intelligent nature can alone be rationally explained. From the latter they
                    assert, that the nature of man, whether considered in its individual or social
                    eapaeity, can alone be conducted to its highest perfection and happiness. With
                    the determined Atheists they scarcely deign to expostulate. According to them,
                    philosophers who can deduce the origin and constitution of things from casual
                    rencounters of atoms, or mechanical necessity, are capable of deducing any
                    conclusion from any premises. Nor can a more glaring instance of absurdity be
                    produced than the idea of a contingent or self-originated universe. When Deists
                    and other sectarians upbraid them with mysterious or incompatible principles,
                    they without hesitation remit such cavillers to the creed of natural religion.
                    They demand why any reasoncr should refuse to believe three distinct substances
                    in one indivisible essence, who admits that a being may be omnipresent without
                    extension; or that he can impress motion upon other things, whilst he himself is
                    necessarily immovable. They ask the sage, why it should be thought more
                    extraordinary that the Son of God should be sent to this world, that he should
                    unite the human nature to his own, that he should suffer and die for the relief
                    of his degenerate creatures, than that an existence whose felicity is eternal,
                    inherent, and infinite, should havecreated an humble race of intelligent beings.
                    Is it not, says the Christian, as worthy of the divine interposition to restore
                    order and happiness where they arc lost, as to communicate them where they never
                    have been? Is not infinite goodness as conspicuous in relieving misery as in
                    diffusing happiness? Is not the existence of what we call evil in the world,
                    under the government of an infinitely perfect Being, as inscrutable as the means
                    exhibited by Christianity for its abolition? Vicarious punishment, imputed guilt
                    and righteousness, merit or demerit transferred, are certainly not less
                    reconcilable to human reason, <hi rend="italic">apriori,</hi> than the existence
                    of vice and punishment in the productions of infinite wisdom, power, and
                    goodness; particularly when it is considered that the virtues displayed by a
                    perfect Being in a state of humiliation and suffering, must be meritorious, and
                    may therefore be rewarded by the restored felicity of inferior creatures in
                    proportion to their glory and excellence; and that such merit may apply the
                    blessings which it has deserved, in whatever manner or degree, and to whomsoever
                    it pleases, without being under any necessity of violating the freedom of moral
                    agents, in recalling them to the paths of virtue and happiness by a mechanical
                    and irresistible force.</p>
                <p>It will be granted to philosophy by the Christian, that as no theory of
                    mechanical nature can be formed without presupposing established laws, from
                    which it ought rarely, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193355115"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-5115-0624"/>if ever, to deviate, so, in fact, it tenaciously
                    pursucs these general institutions, and from their constant observance result
                    the order and regularity of things; but he cannot admit that the important ends
                    of moral and intellectual improvement may be uniformly obtained by the same
                    means. He affirms, that if the hand of God should either remain always entirely
                    invisible, or at least only perceptible in the operation of second causes,
                    intelligent beings would be apt, in the course of time, to resolve the
                    interpositions of Deity into the general laws of mechanism, to forget his
                    connection with nature, and deny their dependence upon him. Hence, according to
                    the dictates of common sense, and to the unanimous voice of every religion in
                    every age or country, God, for the purposes of his wisdom and benevolence, may
                    not only control, but has actually controlled, the common course and general
                    operations of nature; so that, as in the material world the law of cause and
                    effect is universally observed, suspension and changes of that law may become
                    necessary for the advancement of moral and intellectual perfection.</p>
                <p>But the disciple of Jesus not only contends that no system of religion has ever
                    yet been exhibited so consistent with itself, and so congruous to philosophy and
                    the common sense of mankind, as Christianity. He likewise avers that it is
                    infinitely more productive of real and sensible consolation, than any other
                    system of religious or philosophical tenets that ever entered into the mind, or
                    has been applied to the heart of man. For what is death to that mind which
                    considers eternity as the career of its existence? What are the frowns of
                    fortune to him who claims an eternal world as his inheritance? What is the loss
                    of friends to that heart which feels, with more than natural conviction, that it
                    shall quickly rejoin them in a more tender, intimate, and permanent intercourse
                    than any of which the present life is susceptible? What are the fluctuations and
                    vicissitudes of external things, to a mind which strongly and uniformly
                    anticipates a state of endless and immutable felicity? What arc mortifications,
                    disappointments, and insults, to a spirit which is conscious of being the
                    original offspring and adopted child of God; which knows that its omnipotent
                    Father will, in proper time, effectually assert the dignity and privileges of
                    its nature? In a word, as earth is but a speck of creation, as time is not an
                    instant in proportion to eternity, such are the hopes and prospects of the
                    Christian, in comparison of every sublunary misfortune or difficulty. It is
                    therefore, in his judgment, the eternal wonder of angels, and indelible
                    opprobrium of man, that a religion so worthy of God, so suitable to the frame
                    and circumstances of our nature, so consonant to all the dictates of reason, so
                    friendly to the dignity and improvement of intelligent beings, and pregnant with
                    genuine comfort and delight, should he rejected and despised. Were there a
                    possibility of suspense or hesitation between this and any other religion
                    extant, he could freely, trust the determination of a question so important to
                    the candid decision of real virtue and impartial philosophy.</p>
                <p>It must be allowed, that the utmost extent of human investigation and research
                    into the doctrine of a future life reached no further than a splendid
                    conjecture, before the promulgation of Christianity; at which period alone life
                    and immortality were clearly brought to light. It is therefore a singular
                    circumstance, that the Dcist should not perceive the wonderful superiority of
                    the Christian over every other system, if it had nothing else to recommend it
                    but this single doctrine, so pregnant with unalloyed felicity. If Christianity
                    be false, the believer of it has nothing to lose, since it inculcates a mode of
                    conduct which must ever be amiable in the eye of infinite goodness; but if it be
                    true, he has every thing to gain; while, upon this hypothesis, the Deist has
                    every thing to lose, and nothing to gain. This is a momentous consideration; and
                    that man must be truly infatuated who can treat such a subject with
                    indifference.</p>
                <p>Mr Gibbon, in his <hi rend="italic">History of the Hecline and Fall of the Roman
                    Empire,</hi> mentions five secondary causes tol which he thinks the propagation
                    of Christianity, and all· the remarkable circumstances which attended it, may
                    with good reason be ascribed. He seems to insinuate that Divine Providence did
                    notact in a singular or extraordinary manner in disseminating the religion of
                    Jesus Christ throughout the world; and that, if every argument which has been
                    adduced to prove the sacred authority of this religion may be turned aside or
                    refuted, nothing can be deduced from this source to prevent it from sharing the
                    fate of mere systems of superstition. The causes of its propagation were, in his
                    opinion, founded on the principles of human nature and the circumstances of
                    society. If we ascribe not the propagation of Mahommedanism, or of the doctrines
                    of Zerdust, to an extraordinary interposition of Divine Providence, operating by
                    an unperceived influence on the dispositions of the human heart, and controlling
                    and confounding the ordinary laws of nature; neither can we, upon any reasonable
                    grounds, refer the promulgation of Christianity to such an interposition.</p>
                <p>The secondary causes to which he ascribes these effects are, first, the
                    inflexible and intolerant zeal of the Christians, derived from the Jewish
                    religion, but purified from the narrow and unsocial spirit, which, instead of
                    inviting, deterred the Gentilcs from embracing the law of Moses; secondly, the
                    doctrine of a future life, improved by every additional circumstance which could
                    give weight and efficacy to that important truth; thirdly, the miraculous powers
                    ascribed to the primitive church; fourthly, the pure and austere morals of the
                    Christians; and, fifthly, the union and discipline of the Christian republic,
                    which gradually formed an independent and increasing state in the heart of the
                    Roman empire.</p>
                <p>But before entering upon the examination of Mr Gibbon’s causes in the order in
                    which they are here enumerated, we beg leave to remark, that we cannot perceive
                    the propriety of denominating some of these <hi rend="italic">secondary</hi>
                    causes, since the miraculous powers ascribed to the primitive church, if they
                    were real, must have constituted a primary cause, and if fallacious, could have
                    been no cause at all, except of its complete subversion. As little can we
                    conceive how such an able and learned author could imagine a zeal strictly and
                    properly inflexible and intolerant, as qualified to produce any other effect
                    than the destruction of the system which they are allowed to have been anxious
                    to promote. But our estimate of the causes assigned by Mr Gibbon will be more
                    fully developed as we proceed in our first examination of them.</p>
                <p>In pointing out the connection between the first of] these causes, and the
                    effects which he represents as arising from it, .this learned and ingenious
                    writer observes, that the religion of the Jews does not seem to have been
                    intended to be propagated among the heathens; and that the conversion of
                    proselytes was rather accidental than consistent with the general spirit of the
                    institutions of Judaism. The Jews were, of consequence, studious to preserve
                    themselves as a peculiar people. Their zeal for their own religion was
                    intolerant, narrow, and unsocial. In Christianity, when it madc its appearance
                    in the world, all the better part of the predominant spirit of Judaism was
                    retained; but whatever might have a tendency to confine its influence within
                    narrow limits was laid aside. Christians were to maintain the doctrines and
                    adhere to the constitutions of their religion with sacred fidelity. They were
                    not to violate their allegiance to Jesus by entertaining<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193355128" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5128-0625"/> or professing any reverence
                    for Jupiter or any other of the heathen deities; it was not even necessary for
                    them to comply with the positive and ceremonial institutions of the law of
                    Moses, although these were acknowledged to have been of divine origin. The zeal,
                    therefore, which their religion inculcated, was inflexible. It was even
                    intolerant: for they were not to content themselves with professing Christianity
                    and conforming to its laws; they were to labour with unremitting assiduity, and
                    to expose themselves to every difficulty and every danger, in converting others
                    to the same faith. But the same circumstances which rendered it thus intolerant,
                    communicated to it a more liberal and a less unsocial spirit than that of
                    Judaism. The religion of the Jews was intended only for the few tribes;
                    Christianity was intended to become a catholic religion—its advantages were to
                    be offered to all mankind. All the different sects which arose among the
                    primitive Christians uniformly maintained the same zeal for the propagation of
                    their own religion, and the same abhorrence for every other. The orthodox, the
                    Ebionites, the Gnostics, and other sects, were all equally animated with the
                    same exclusive zeal, and the same abhorrence of idolatry, which had
                    distinguished the Jews from other nations.</p>
                <p>Such is the general purport of what Mr Gibbon advances concerning the influence
                    of the first of these secondary causes in the propagation of Christianity. It
                    would be uncandid to deny, that his statement of facts appears, in this
                    instance, to be almost fair, and his deductions tolerably logical. The first
                    Christians were remarkable for their detestation of idolatry, and for the
                    generous and disinterested zeal with which they laboured to convert others to
                    the same faith. The first of these principles, no doubt, contributed to maintain
                    the dignity and purity of Christianity; and the second to disseminate it
                    throughout the world. But the facts which he relates are scarcely consistent
                    throughout. He seems to represent the zeal of the first Christians as so hot and
                    intolerant, that they could have no social intercourse with those who still
                    adhered to the worship of heathen deities. But if so, how could they propagate
                    their religion? Nay, we may even ask, how could they live? If they could not
                    mingle with the heathens in the transactions either of peace or war; or witness
                    the marriage or the funeral of the dearest friend, if a heathen; or practise the
                    elegant arts of music, painting, eloquence, or poetry; or venture to use freely
                    in conversation the language of Greece or of Rome; it is not easy to see what
                    opportunities they could have had of disseminating their religious sentiments.
                    If, in such circumstances, and observing rigidly such a tenor of conduct, they
                    were yet able to propagate their religion with such amazing success as they are
                    said to have done, they must surely either have practised some wonderful arts
                    unknown to us, or have been assisted by the supernatural operation of divine
                    power. But all the historical records of that period, whether sacred or profane,
                    concur in proving that the primitive Christians in general did not retire with
                    such religious horror from all intercourse with the heathens. They refused not
                    to serve in the armies of the Roman empire. They appealed to heathen
                    magistrates, and submitted respectfully to their decisions. The husband was
                    often a heathen, and the wife a Christian; or, conversely, the husband a
                    Christian, and the wife a heathen. These are facts so universally known and
                    admitted, that we need not quote authorities in proof of them.</p>
                <p>This distinguished writer appears, therefore, not to have stated the facts which
                    he produces under this head with sufficient precision, nor to have reasoned from
                    them correctly. Had the zeal of the first Christians been as intolerant as he
                    represents it, it must have been highly un-</p>
                <p>favou⅛ble to the propagation of their religion; all their wishes to make converts
                    would, in that case, have been counteracted by their unwillingness to mix, in
                    the ordinary intercourse of life, with those who were to be converted. Their
                    zeal, and the liberal spirit of their religion, were indeed secondary causes
                    which contributed to its propagation; but their zeal was by no means so
                    ridiculously intolerant as this writer would have us believe; for if it had, it
                    must have produced effects directly opposite to those which he ascribes to
                    it.</p>
                <p>In illustrating the influence of the next of these se-! condary causes to which
                    he ascribes the propagation of' Christianity, Mr Gibbon displays no less
                    ingenuity than in tracing the nature and the effects of the first. The doctrine
                    of a future life, improved by every additional circumstance which can give
                    weight and efficacy to that important truth, makes a conspicuous figure in the
                    Christian system; and it is a doctrine highly flattering to the natural hopes
                    and wishes of the human heart.</p>
                <p>Though the heathen philosophers were not unacquainted with this doctrine, yet to
                    them the spirituality of the human soul, its capacity of existence in a separate
                    state from the body, its immortality, and its prospect of lasting happiness in a
                    future life, rather appeared things possible and desirable, than truths fully
                    established upon solid grounds. These doctrines, Mr Gibbon would persuade us,
                    had no influence on the moral sentiments and general conduct of the heathens.
                    Even the philosophers who amused themselves with displaying their eloquence and
                    ingenuity on these splendid themes, did not allow them to influence the tenor of
                    their lives; while the great body of the people, who were occupied in pursuits
                    very different from the speculations of philosophy, and were unacquainted with
                    the questions discussed in the schools, were scarcely ever at pains to reflect
                    whether they consisted of a material and a spiritual part, or whether their
                    existence was to be prolonged beyond the term of the present life; and they
                    could not regulate their lives by principles which they did not know.</p>
                <p>In the popular superstitions of the Greeks and Romans, the doctrine of a future
                    state was not omitted. Mankind were not only flattered with the hopes of
                    continuing to exist beyond the term of the present life, but different
                    conditions of existence were promised or threatened, in which retributions for
                    their conduct in life were to be enjoyed or suffered. Some were exalted to
                    heaven, and associated with the gods; others were rewarded with less illustrious
                    honours, and a more moderate state of happiness, in Elysium; while those who by
                    their conduct in life had merited, not rewards, but punishments, were consigned
                    to Tartarus. Such were the ideas of a future state which formed part of the
                    popular superstitions of the Greeks and Romans. But these notions produced only
                    a very faint impression on the minds of those among whom they prevailed. They
                    were not truths supported by evidence; they were not even plausible; they were
                    in fact a tissue of absurdities; they had not therefore a greater influence on
                    the morals, than the more refined speculations of the philosophers. Even the
                    Jews, whose religion and legislation were communicated from heaven, were in
                    general, till within a very short period before the propagation of the gospel,
                    as imperfectly acquainted with the doctrine of a future state as the Greeks and
                    Romans. This doctrine formed no distinct part of the law of Moses, and it is but
                    darkly intimated in the other parts of the Old Testament.</p>
                <p>The rude tribes who inhabited ancient Gaul, and some other nations not more
                    civilized than these, entertained ideas of a future life much clearer than those
                    of the Greeks, the Romans, or even the Jews.</p>
                <p>Christianity, however, explained and inculcated the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193355141" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5141-0626"/>truth of this doctrine in all
                    its splendour and all its dignity. It exhibited an alluring, yet not absurd,
                    view of the happiness of a future life. It conferred new horrors on the place of
                    punishment, and added new severity to the tortures to be inflicted, in another
                    world. The authority on which it taught these doctrines, and displayed these
                    views, was such as to silence doubt, and to command implicit bclief. What added
                    to the influence of the doctrine of a future state of existence, thus explained
                    and inculcated, was, that the first Christians confidently prophesied and
                    sincerely believed that the end of the world, the consummation of all things,
                    was fast approaching, and that the generation then present would live to witness
                    that awful event. Another circumstance which contributed to render this doctrine
                    favourable to the propagation of Christianity was, that the first Christians
                    dealt damnation without remorse, and almost without making any exceptions, on
                    all who diedin the belief of the absurdities of heathen superstition. Thus
                    taught, and enforced with these additional and heightening circumstances, this
                    doctrine, partly by presenting alluring prospects and exciting pleasing hopes,
                    partly by working upon the fears of the human heart with representations of
                    terror, operated in the most powerful manner in extending the influence of the
                    Christian faith.</p>
                <p>Here, however, facts are rather exaggerated, and the inferences unfairly deduced.
                    It must be admitted that the speculations of the heathen philosophers did not
                    fully and undeniably establish the doctrine of the immortality of the human
                    soul; and hence their arguments could scarcely impress such a conviction of this
                    truth as would influence in a very strong degree the moral sentiments and
                    conduct. These arguments, however, were of such a kind that they must have
                    produced some, nay a considerable influence. Several of the most illustrious
                    among the heathen philosophers appear to have been so impressed with the belief
                    of the soul’s immortality, and of a future state of retribution, that their
                    general conduct was constantly and in a high degree influenced by that belief.
                    Şocrates and Plato are eminent and well-known instances. And if, in such
                    instances as these, the belief of the truths in question produced such effects,
                    it maybe fairly inferred, though we had no further evidence, that those
                    characters were not singular in this respect. It is a truth acknowledged as
                    unquestionable in the history of arts and sciences, that wherever any one person
                    has cultivated these with extraordinary success, some of his contemporaries will
                    always be found to rival his excellence, and a number of them will engage in the
                    same pursuits. On this occasion we may venture, without hesitation, to reason
                    upon the same principles. When the belief of the immortality of the human soul
                    produced such illustrious patterns of virtue as a Socrates and a Plato, it must
                    certainly have influenced the moral sentiments and conduct of many others,
                    although in an inferior degree. Some who profess to believe the doctrines of
                    Christianity, make this profession, even although they have never considered
                    seriously whether they be true or false. But notwithstanding this, these truths
                    still exert a powerful influence on the sentiments and manners of society in
                    general. Thus, also, it appears that the doctrines of the ancient philosophy
                    concerning a future life, and even the notions concerning Olympus, Elysium, and
                    Tartarus, which formed part of the popular superstitions, produced a certain
                    influence on the sentiments and manners of the heathens in general. That
                    influence was often indeed inconsiderable, and not always beneficent; but still
                    it seems to have been greater than Mr Gibbon is willing to allow. Christians
                    have been sometimes at pains to exaggerate the absurdities of Pagan
                    superstition, in order that the advantages of Christianity might acquire new
                    value from the contrast. But here we find one who is at heart inimical to
                    Christianity, displaying, and even exaggerating, these absurdities for a
                    different purpose. The truth, however, maybe safely admitted; and it is only
                    when exaggerated that it can serve any purpose adverse to the authority of our
                    holy religion. Mr Gibbon certainly represents the religious belief of the
                    ancient Gauls, in respect to the immortality of the human soul and a future
                    state, in too favourable a light. It is only because the system of superstition
                    which prevailed among the barbarians is so imperfectly known, that it has been
                    imagined to consist of more sublime doctrines than those of the popular
                    superstitions of the Greeks and Romans. The evidence which Mr Gibbon produces in
                    proof of what he asserts concerning these opinions of the ancient Gauls is
                    partial, and far from being satisfactory. They did indeed assert and believe the
                    soul to be immortal; but this doctrine was blended with a number of absurdities
                    still grosser than those which characterized the popular religion of the Greeks
                    and Romans. The latter was the superstition of a civilized people, among whom
                    reason was unfolded and improved by cultivation, and whose manners were polished
                    and refined. The former was that of barbarians, among whom reason was, as it
                    were, in its infancy, and who were strangers to the improvements of
                    civilization. Accordingly, when hasty observers found that those barbarians were
                    not absolutely strangers to the idea of immortality, they were moved to undue
                    admiration; their surprise at finding more than they expected confounded their
                    understanding, and led them to misconceive and misrepresent. Hence, what ought
                    to be ascribed to the savage ferocity of those rude tribes, has been attributed
                    by mistake to the influence of their belief of a future state.</p>
                <p>In the law of Moses, it must be allowed that this doctrine is not particularly
                    explained nor earnestly inculcated. The author of the <hi rend="italic">Divine
                    Legation of Closes</hi> has founded upon this fact an ingenious theory, which we
                    shall elsewhere have occasion to examine, and has supported it with great and
                    various erudition. The reason why this doctrine was not more fully explained to
                    the Jews, we shall not pretend to assign, at least in this place; but we cannot
                    help thinking, that it was more generally known among the Jews than Mr Gibbon
                    and Bishop Warburton are willing to allow. Though it be not strongly inculcated
                    in their code of laws, yet there is some reason to think that it was known and
                    generally prevalent among them long before the Babylonian captivity; and in
                    different passages in the writings of Moses it is mentioned or alluded to in an
                    unequivocal manner. In the history of the patriarchs, it appears that this
                    doctrine was known to these “gray fathers;” and it seems to have had a strong
                    influence on the mind of Moses himself. Were David and Solomon strangers to this
                    doctrine? We cannot here specify minute particulars; but surely all the efforts
                    of ingenuity must be insufficient to torture the Sacred Scriptures of the Old
                    Testament, so as to prove that they contain nothing concerning the doctrine of a
                    future state except in the writings of the later prophets, and that even in
                    these it is only darkly insinuated. Were the Jews, in -the earlier stage of
                    their history, so totally secluded from all intercourse with other nations, that
                    a doctrine of so much importance, and more or less known to all around, could
                    not be communicated to them? The Pharisees admitted traditions, and set upon
                    them an undue value; yet they appear to have been considered as the most
                    orthodox of the different sects which prevailed among the Jews; for the
                    Sadducees were regarded as innovators and infidels.</p>
                <p>But though we are of opinion that the ingenious historian ascribes to the
                    doctrine of the Greek and Roman philosophers, <pb break="no"

                    the human soul, as well as the notices respecting a future state which formed

                    sentiments and conduct of mankind than what they really exerted; and though we
                    cannot agree with him in allowing that the ideas of the im-ι∏ιortality of the
                    soul and of a future state, which were entertained by the Gauls and some other
                    rude nations, were much superior in their nature, or much happier in their
                    influence, than those of the Greeks and Romans; and thdugh, from what is
                    contained in the Old Testament, we are disposed to think that the Jews knew
                    somewhat more concerning the immortality of the human soul, and a future state
                    in which human beings are destined to exist, than Mr Gibbon represents them to
                    have known; yet still we are very sensible, and very well pleased to admit, that
                    “life and immortality were brought to light through the gospel.”</p>
                <p>The doctrine of a future life, as it was preached by the first Christians, was
                    established on a more solid basis than that on which it had been before
                    maintained; it was freed from every absurdity, and so much improved, that its
                    influence, which, as explained by heathen poets and philosophers, must be
                    confessed to have been in many instances doubtful, now became favourable only to
                    the interests of piety and virtue, and that in no ordinary degree. It
                    undoubtedly contributed to the successful propagatiqn of Christianity; for it
                    was calculated to attract and toplease the speculating philosopher, as well as
                    the simple unenlightened votary of the vulgar superstition. The views which it
                    exhibited were distinct; and all was <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> plausible and
                    rational, being demonstrated by the fullest evidence. But the happiness which it
                    promised was of a less sensual nature than the enjoyments which the heathens
                    expected in Elysium; and it would therefore appear less alluring to those who
                    were not capable of entertaining refined ideas, or who preferred the
                    gratifications of the senses in the present life to every other species of good.
                    If the first Christians rejoiced in the hope of beholding all the votaries of
                    Pagan idolatry afflicted with the torments of hell in a future state, and
                    boasted of these hopes with inhuman exultation, they in all probability
                    irritated rather than alarmed those whom they sought to convert from that
                    superstition. The heathens, assailed with such denunciations, might be moved to
                    regard with indignant scorn the preacher who pretended that the beings whom they
                    venerated as gods, heroes, and wise men, were condemned to a state of
                    unspeakable and endless torment. Every feeling of the heart would revolt at the
                    idea of a parent, a child, a husband, a wife, a friend, a lover, or a mistress,
                    but lately lost and still lamented, being consigned to eternal torments for
                    actions and opinions which they had deemed highly agreeable to superior
                    powers.</p>
                <p>With respect, then, to the influence of this secondary cause in promoting the
                    propagation of Christianity, we may conclude that the circumstances of the
                    heathen world were less favourable to that influence than Mr Gibbon pretends;
                    that the means by which he represents the primitive Christians to have improved
                    its efficacy, were some of them not employed, and others rather likely to weaken
                    than to strengthen it; and that therefore more is attributed to the operation of
                    this‘cause than it could possibly produce.</p>
                <p>The third cause, the miraculous powers of the primitive church, is with good
                    reason represented as having conduced to the conviction of infidels. Mr Gibbon’s
                    reasonings under this head are, that numerous miraculous works of the most
                    extraordinary kind were ostentatiously performed by the first Christians; that,
                    however, from the difficulty of fixing the period at which miraculous powers
                    ceased to be communicated to the Christian church, and from some other
                    circumstances, there is reason to suspect, as is darkly insinuated, that they
                    were merely the pretences of imposture; and that the heathens having been
                    happily prepared to receive them as real by the many wonders nearly of a similar
                    nature to which they were accustomed in their former superstition, the miracles
                    which the first Christians employed to give a sanction to their doctrines
                    contributed in the most effectual manner to the propagation of Christianity.</p>
                <p>In reply to what is here advanced, it may be suggested, that the miracles
                    recorded in the New Testament as having been performed by the first Christians
                    when engaged in propagating their religion, are established as true, upon the
                    most indubitable evidence which human testimony can give to any facts. Mr Hume,
                    who was too fond of employing his ingenuity in undermining truths generally
                    received, has endeavoured to prove that no human testimony, however strong and
                    unexceptionable, can afford sufficient evidence of the reality of a miracle; but
                    his reasonings on this head, which once excited doubt and wonder, have since
                    been completely refuted; and mankind still continue to acknowledge, that though
                    we are all liable to mistakes, and exposed to imposition, yet human testimony
                    may afford the most convincing evidence of the most extraordinary and even
                    supernatural facts. We cannot be expected to enter, in this place, into a
                    particular examination of the miracles ascribed to the primitive age of the
                    church. An inquiry into these will occupy a prominent place under the
                    appropriate head of <hi rend="smallcaps">Theology,</hi> to which the reader is
                    accordingly referred. We may, however, consider it as an undeniable and a
                    generally acknowledged fact, that those miracles were real, and that they
                    contributed, in a very eminent manner, to the propagation of Christianity. But
                    it is evident that genuine miracles are not to be ranked among the natural and
                    <hi rend="italic">secondary</hi> causes.</p>
                <p>It was long the current opinion, even among Protestants, that a miraculous power
                    continued for several centuries to reside in the Christian church. When Dr
                    Middleton controverted this opinion in his Free Inquiry, he encountered the most
                    vehement and acrimonious opposition; and many of the clergy, with Archbishop
                    Secker at their head, thought themselves warranted in representing this
                    lingering power as an article of faith. But the progress of reason, though slow,
                    is commonly certain; and the present bishop of Lincoln, Dr Kaye, has ventured to
                    express himself in the following terms :—“My conclusion then is, that the power
                    of working miracles was not extended beyond the disciples, upon whom the
                    apostles conferred it by the imposition of their hands.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>The heathens were no strangers to pretended miracles and prophecies, and other
                    seeming interpositions of superior beings disturbing the ordinary course of
                    nature and of human affairs; but the miracles to which they were familiarized
                    had been so often detected to be tricks of imposture or pretences of mad
                    enthusiasm, that, instead of being prepared to witness or to receive accounts of
                    new miracles with easy credulity, they must have been in general disposed to
                    view them with jealousy and suspicion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Mr Weston’s Enquiry into the Rejection of the Christian
                    Miracles by the Heathens. Cambridge, 174G, 8vo.</p></note> Besides, the miracles
                    to which they had been accustomed, and those performed by the apostles and the
                    first preachers of Christianity, were directly contradictory, and therefore<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193355167" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5167-0628"/> the one could
                    receive no assistance from the other. Yet notwithstanding what has been advanced
                    above, we must acknowledge, that as disagreements with respect to the principles
                    and institutions of their religion very early arose among Christians, so they
                    likewise sought to extend its influence, at a very early period, by the use of
                    pious frauds, which appear to have sometimes served the immediate purposes for
                    which they were employed, though eventually they proved highly injurious to the
                    cause of Christianity itself.</p>
                <p>We conclude, then, that Christianity was indebted to the influence of miracles in
                    a considerable degree for its propagation, but that the real miracles of our
                    Saviour and his apostles were not among the <hi rend="italic">secondary</hi>
                    causes of its success; that the heathens who were to be converted were not very
                    happily prepared for receiving the miracles of the gospel with blind credulity;
                    that, as it is possible to discern between sufficient and insufficient evidence,
                    so it is not more difficult to distinguish between true and false miracles; and,
                    lastly, that false miracles were soon employed by Christians as engines to
                    support and propagate their religion, and perhaps not unsuccessfully, but were,
                    upon the whole, more injurious than serviceable to the cause which they were
                    called in to maintain.</p>
                <p>’ The fourth of this series of secondary causes, which the author supposes to
                    have been adequate to the propagation of Christianity, is the virtue of the
                    primitive Christians, which he is willing to attribute to other and
                    less,generous motives, rather than to the pure influence of the doctrines and
                    precepts of their religion.</p>
                <p>The first converts to Christianity were most of them originally persons of the
                    lowest and most worthless characters. The wise, the mighty, and those who were
                    distinguished by specious virtues, were in general perfectly satisfied with
                    their actual circumstances and future prospects. People whose minds were
                    naturally weak, unenlightened, or oppressed with the sense of atrocious guilt,
                    and who were infamous, or outcasts from society, were eager to grasp at the
                    hopes which the gospel held out to them. When, after enlisting under the banner
                    of Christ, they began to consider themselves as “born again to newness of life
                    ;” remorse and fear, which easily prevail over weak minds; selfish hopes of
                    regaining their reputation, and attaining to the honours and happiness of those
                    mansions which Jesus was said to have gone to prepare; and a desire to raise the
                    honour and extend the influence of the society of which they were become
                    members; all operated powerfully, so as to enable them to display both active
                    and passive virtue in an extraordinary degree. Their virtues did not flow from
                    the purest and noblest source, yet they attracted the notice and moved the
                    admiration of mankind. Of many who admired, some were eager to imitate, and, in
                    order to this, thought it necessary to adopt the same principles of action.
                    Their virtues, too, were rather of that species which excite wonder, because
                    uncommon, and not of essential utility in the ordinary intercourse of society,
                    than of those which are indispensably necessary to the existence of social
                    order, and contribute to the ease and convenience of life. Such virtues were
                    well calculated to engage the imitation of those who had failed egregiously in
                    the practice of the more social virtues. Thus they practised extraordinary but
                    useless and unsocial virtues, from no very generous motives ;-and those virtues
                    drew upon them the eyes of the world, and induced numbers to embrace their
                    faith.</p>
                <p>We must, however, declare, that this is plainly an uncandid account of the
                    virtues of the primitive Christians, and of the motives from which they
                    originated. The social virtues are strongly recommended in the gospel. No degree
                    of mortification or self-denial, or seclusion from the ordinary business and
                    amusements of social life, was required of the early converts to Christianity,
                    except what was indispensably necessary to wean them from the irregular habits
                    in which they had before indulged, and which had rendered them nuisances in
                    society, and to form them to new habits equally necessary to their happiness and
                    their usefulness in life. We allow that they practised virtues which in other
                    circumstances would, however splendid, have been unnecessary; but, in the
                    difficult circumstances in which the first Christians were placed, the virtues
                    which they practised were in the highest degree social. The most prominent
                    feature in their character was their continuing to entertain sentiments of
                    generous benevolence, and to discharge scrupulously all the social duties,
                    towards those who exercised neither charity nor humanity, and frequently not
                    even bare integrity and justice, in their conduct towards them.</p>
                <p>It cannot be said with truth that such a proportion of the primitive Christians
                    were people whose characters had been infamous, and their circumstances
                    desperate, as that the character of the religion which they embraced should
                    suffer from this circumstance. Nor were they only the weak and illiterate whom
                    the apostles and their immediate successors converted by their preaching. The
                    criminal, to be sure, rejoiced to hear that he might obtain absolution of his
                    crimes; the mourner was willing to receive corŋfort; and minds of refined and
                    generous feelings were deeply affected with that goodness which had induced the
                    Son of God to submit to the punishment due to sinners: but the simplicity, the
                    rationality, and the beauty of the Christian system, likewise prevailed in
                    numerous instances over the pride and prejudices of the great and the wise, and
                    in instances sufficiently numerous to vindicate the Christian church from the
                    aspersions by which it has been represented as being in the first period of its
                    existence merely a body of criminals and idiots.</p>
                <p>The principles, too, from which the virtues of the first Christians originated,
                    were not peculiarly mean and selfish: on the contrary, they seem to have been
                    uncommonly sublime and disinterested. Remorse in the guilty mind is a natural
                    and reasonable sentiment; and the desire of happiness in every human breast is
                    equally so. It is uncandid, therefore, to cavil against the first Christians for
                    being, like the rest of mankind, influenced by these sentiments. And when we
                    behold them overlooking temporary possessions and enjoyments, extending their
                    views to futurity, and “living by faith ;” when we observe them “doing good to
                    those who hated them, blessing those who cursed them, and praying for those by
                    whom they were despitefully used and persecuted ;” we cannot deny that their
                    virtues were of the most generous and disinterested kind.</p>
                <p>We allow, then, that the virtues of the first Christians must have contributed to
                    the propagation of their religion; but it is with pain that we observe the
                    historian studiously labouring to misrepresent the principles from which these
                    virtues arose; and not only the principles themselves, but also the importance
                    of the actions and conduct which naturally sprung from them.</p>
                <p>The fifth cause was the mode of church government adopted by the first
                    Christians, by which they were knit∣ together in one society, and preferred the
                    church and its interests to their country and civil concerns. We do not deny
                    that the mutual attachment of the primitive Christians contributed to spread the
                    influence of their religion; and the order which they maintained, by being
                    animated with this spirit of brotherly love, and with an ardent zeal for the
                    glory of God, must no doubt have produced those happy effects among them which
                    order and regularity produce on every occasion when they are strictly
                    observed.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193355180" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5180-0629"/>
                <p>But whether the form of church government, which was gradually established in the
                    Christian church, was actually the happiest that couΓd possibly have been
                    adopted; or whether, by establishing a distinct society, with separate
                    interests, within the Roman empire, it contributed to the dissolution of that
                    mighty fabric; we cannot here pretend to inquire. These are subjects of
                    discussion with respect to which we may with more propriety endeavour to satisfy
                    our readers under another head.</p>
                <p>From the whole, then, of this review of what Mr Gibbon has so speciously advanced
                    concerning the influence of these five secondary causes in the propagation of
                    the gospel, we think ourselves warranted to conclude, that the zeal of the first
                    Christians was not, as he represents it, intolerant; that the doctrine of the
                    immortality of the human soul was somewhat better understood in the heathen
                    world, particularly among the Greeks and Romans, and the Jews, than he
                    represents it to have been, and had an influence somewhat happier than that
                    which he ascribes to it; that the additional circumstances by which, he informs
                    us, the first preachers of Christianity improved the effects of this doctrine,
                    were far from being calculated to allure converts; that the heathens, therefore,
                    were not quite so well prepared for an eager reception of this doctrine as he
                    would persuade us that they were, and, of consequence, could not be influenced
                    by it in so considerable a degree in their con-∣ version; that real and
                    unquestionable miracles, performed by our Saviour, and the first race of
                    Christians, contributed signally to the propagation of Christianity, but are not
                    to be ranked among the secondary causes of its diffusion; that weakness and
                    blind zeal did at times employ pretended miracles for the same purpose not
                    altogether ineffectually; that though these despicable and wicked means might be
                    in some instances successful, yet-they were, upon the whole, much more injurious
                    than beneficial; that the virtues of the primitive Christians arose from the
                    most generous and noble motives, and were in their nature and tendency highly
                    favourable to social order, and to the comfort of mankind in the social state;
                    and, lastly, that the order and regularity of church government, which were
                    gradually established among the first Christians, contributed greatly to
                    maintain the dignity and spread the influence of their religion, but tended in
                    no degree to disjoin them from their fellow-subjects, or to render them inimical
                    to the welfare of the state of which they were members. Upon the whole,
                    therefore, we do not see that these secondary causes were equal to the effects
                    which have been ascribed to them; and it seems undeniable that others of a
                    superior kind must have co-operated in the diffusion of Christianity.<note
