                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Canonical</hi><hi rend="italic">Hours</hi> are certain
                    stated times of the day, consigned, more especially by the Romish church, to the

                    church, those which were deemed capital or mortal. Such especially were

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Canonical</hi><hi rend="italic">Life,</hi> the method or
                    rule of living prescribed by the ancient clergy who lived in community. The
                    canonical life was a kind of medium between the monastic and clerical lives.
                    Originally the orders of monks and clerks were entirely distinct; but pious
                    persons, in process of time, instituted colleges of priests and canons, where
                    clerks, brought up for the ministry, as well as others already engaged therein,
                    might live under a fixed rule, which, though somewhat more easy than the
                    monastic, was yet more restrained than the secular. This was called the <hi
                    rend="italic">canonical life,</hi> and those who embraced it <hi rend="italic"
                    >canons.</hi> Authors are divided about the founder of the canonical life. Some
                    will have it to be founded by the apostles; others ascribe it to Pope Urban I.
                    about the year 1230, who is said to have ordered bishops to provide such of
                    their clergy as were willing to live in community, with necessaries out of the
                    revenues of their churches. The generality attribute it to St Augustin, who,
                    having gathered a number of clerks to devote themselves to religion, instituted
                    a monastery within the episcopal palace, where he lived in community with them.

                    to him, Pope Gelasius I. about the year 495, placed the first regular canons of
                    St Augustin in the Lateran church.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Canonical</hi><hi rend="italic">Letters,</hi> in the ancient
                    church, were a sort of testimonials of the orthodox faith, which the bishops and
                    clergy sent each other, to keep up the Catholic communion, and distinguish
                    orthodox Christians from Arians and other heretics. They were denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">canonical,</hi> cither as being composed according to a certain
                    rule or form, or because they were given to the <hi rend="italic">canonici,</hi>
                    that is, those comprehended in the canon or catalogue of their church. When they
                    had occasion to travel into other dioceses or countries, dimissory and
                    recommendatory letters, also letters of peace, and the like, were so many
                    species of canonical letters.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Canonical</hi> is also an appellation given to those
                    epistles in the New Testament, more frequently called <hi rend="italic"
