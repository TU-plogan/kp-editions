                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">CARDAN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Jerom</hi></label>, one of the
                    most extraordinary geniuses of his age, was born at Pavia on the 24th of
                    September 1501. As his mother was not married, she tried every method to procure
                    an abortion, but without effect. She was three days in labour, and they were at
                    last obliged to cut the child from her. He was born with his head covered with
                    black curled hair. When he was four years old he was carried to Milan, his
                    father being an advocate in that city. At the age of twenty he was sent to study
                    at the university of that city; and two years afterwards he explained Euclid. In
                    1524 he went to Padua, and the same year he was admitted to the degree of master
                    of arts. In the end of the following year he took the degree of doctor of
                    physic. He married about the year 1531.</p>

                <p>During ten years before, his impotency had hindered him from having knowledge of
                    a woman, which was a great mortification to him. He attributed it to the evil
                    influences of the planet under which he was born. When he enumerates, as he
                    frequently does, the greatest misfortunes of his life, this ten years impotency
                    is always one. At the age of thirty-two he became professor of mathematics at
                    Milan. In 1539 he was admitted as a member of the college of physicians at
                    Milan; in 1543 he read public lectures on medicine in that city, and at Pavia
                    the year following; but he discontinued them because he could not get payment of
                    his salary, and returned to Milan. In 1552 he went into Scotland, having been
                    sent for by the archbishop of St Andrews, who had in vain applied to the French
                    king’s physicians, and afterwards to those of the emperor of Germany. This
                    prelate, then forty years old, had for ten years been afflicted with a shortness
                    of breath, which had returned every eight days during the two preceding years.
                    But he began to recover from the moment that Cardan prescribed for him. Cardan
                    took his leave of him at the end of six weeks and three days, leaving him
                    prescriptions which in two years wrought a complete cure.</p>
                <p>Cardan’s journey to Scotland gave him an opportunity of visiting several
                    countries. He crossed France on his way thither, and returned through Germany
                    and the Low Countries, along the banks of the Rhine. It was on this occasion
                    that he went to London, and calculated King Edward’s nativity. This tour
                    occupied about four months; after which, returning to Milan, he continued there
                    till the beginning of October 1552, and then went to Pavia, whence he was
                    invited to Bologna in the year 1562. He taught in this last city till the year
                    1570, at which time he was thrown into prison; but some months afterwards he was
                    sent home to his own house. He left Bologna in 1571, and went to Rome, where he
                    lived for some time without any public employment. He was, however, admitted as
                    a member of the college of physicians, and received a pension from the pope. He
                    died at Rome, on the 21st of September 1575, according to Thuanus. This account
                    may be sufficient to show the reader that Cardan was of a very fickle temper;
                    but he will have a much better idea of his singular and odd turn of mind by
                    examining what he himself has written concerning his own good and bad qualities.
                    He paid himself congratulatory compliments for not having a friend in this
                    world; but that in requital he was attended by an aerial spirit, emanated partly
                    from Saturn and partly from Mercury, who was the constant guide of his actions,
                    and teacher of every duty to which he was bound. He declared, too, that his
                    manner of walking the streets was so irregular, that it induced all beholders to
                    point at him as a fool. Sometimes he walked very slowly, like a man absorbed in
                    profound meditation; then all on a sudden quickened his steps, accompanying them
                    with very absurd attitudes. In Bologna his delight was to be drawn about in a
                    mean vehicle with three wheels. When nature did not visit him with any pain, he
                    would procure to himself that disagreeable sensation by biting his lips so
                    wantonly, or pulling his fingers to such a vehement degree, as sometimes to
                    force the tears from his eyes; and the reason he assigned for so doing was to
                    moderate certain impetuous sallies of the mind, the violence of which was to him
                    far more insupportable than pain itself; and that the sure consequence of such a
                    severe discipline was the enjoying the pleasure of health. He says elsewhere,
                    that, in the greatest tortures of soul, he used to whip his legs with rods, and
                    bite his left arm; that it was a great relief to him to weep, but that very
                    often he could not; that nothing gave him more pleasure than to talk of things
                    which made the whole company uneasy; that he spoke on all subjects, in season
                    and out of season; and that he was so fond of games of chance as to spend whole
                    days in them, to the great prejudice of his family and reputation, for he even
                    staked his furniture and his wife’s jewels.</p>
                <p>Cardan makes no scruple of owning that he was revengeful, envious, treacherous, a
                    dealer in the black art, a backbiter, a calumniator, and addicted to all the
                    foul and detestable excesses that can be imagined; yet, notwithstanding, as one
                    would think, so humbling a declaration, there was never perhaps a vainer mortal,
                    or one who with less ceremony expressed the high opinion he had of himself, than
                    Cardan, as will appear by the following proofs. “I have been admired by many
                    nations; an infinite number of panegyrics, both in prose and verse, have been
                    composed to celebrate my fame. I was born to release the world from the manifold
                    errors under which it groaned. What I have found out could not be discovered
                    either by my predecessors or my contemporaries; and that is the reason why those
                    authors who write any thing worthy of being remembered scruple not to own that
                    they are indebted to me for it. I have composed a book on the dialectic art, in
                    which there is neither one superfluous letter nor one deficient. I finished it
                    in seven days, which seems a prodigy. Yet where is there a person to be found
                    who can boast of his having become master of its doctrine in a year? And he who
                    shall have comprehended it in that time must appear to have been instructed by a
                    familiar demon.”</p>
                <p>The same capriciousness observable in his outward conduct is observable in the
                    composition of his works. We have a multitude of his treatises, in which the
                    reader is stopped almost every moment by the obscurity of his text, or his
                    digressions from the point in hand. In his arithmetical performances there are
                    several discourses on the motions of the planets, on the creation, and on the
                    tower of Babel. In his dialectic work we find his judgment on the historians and
                    the writers of epistles. The only apology which he makes for the frequency of
                    his digressions is, that they were purposely done for the sooner filling up of
                    his sheet, his bargain with the bookseller being at so much per sheet; and that
                    he worked as much for his daily support as for the acquisition of glory. The
                    Lyons edition of his works, printed in 1663, consists of ten volumes in
                    folio.</p>
