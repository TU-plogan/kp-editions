                <p><label type="entry">CAOUTCHOUC, <hi rend="smallcaps">Elastic Resin</hi>, or <hi
                    rend="italic">India Rubber</hi></label>, a substance produced from the syringe
                    tree of Cayenne and other parts of South America, and possessed of singular
                    properties. No substance is yet known which is so pliable, and at the same time
                    so elastic; and it is further a matter of curiosity, as being capable of
                    resisting the action of very powerful menstrua. From the account of M. de la
                    Condamine, we learn that this substance oozes out, under the form of a vegetable
                    milk, from incisions made in the tree; and that it is gathered chiefly in time
                    of rain, because, though it maybe collected at all times, it then flows most
                    abundantly. The means employed to inspissate and indurate it, M. de Laborde
                    says, are kept a profound secret. M. Bomare and others affirm that it thickens
                    and hardens gradually by being exposed to the air; and that as soon as it
                    acquires a solid consistence it manifests a very extraordinary degree of
                    flexibility and elasticity. Accordingly the Indians make boots of it which water
                    cannot penetrate, and which, when smoked, have the appearance of real leather.
                    Bottles are also made of it, to the necks of which are fastened hollow reeds, so
                    that the liquor contained in them may be squirted through the reeds or pipes by
                    pressure. One of these filled with water is always presented to each of the
                    guests at their entertainments, who never fails to make use of it before eating.
                    This whimsical custom led the Portuguese in that country to call the tree that
                    produced the resin <hi rend="italic">pao di xirrin-ga</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and hence the name of <hi rend="italic">seringat</hi> is given both to
                    the tree and to its resinous production. There are likewise made of this resin,
                    flambeaux, an inch and a half in diameter, and two feet long, which give a
                    beautiful light, have no bad smell, and burn twelve hours. A kind of cloth is
                    also prepared from it, which the inhabitants of Quito apply to the same purpose
                    as our oil-cloth and sailcloth. Lastly, it is formed, by means of moulds, into a
                    variety of figures for use or ornament. The process is said to be this: The
                    juice, which is obtained by incision, is spread over pieces of clay formed into
                    the desired shape; and as fast as one layer is dry, another is added, till the
                    vessel be of the proper thickness. The whole is then held over a strong smoke of
                    vegetables on fire, by which means it hardens into the texture and appearance of
                    leather; and before the finishing, while yet soft, is capable of receiving any
                    impression, which remains for ever afterwards. When the whole is finished, the
                    inside mould is picked out.</p>
                <p>Since this resin has been known in Europe, its chemical qualities and other
                    interesting properties have been very diligently investigated. In particular,
                    chemists have endeavoured to discover some method of dissolving it in such a
                    manner that it would assume different figures, with equal ease as when in its
                    original fluid state. In the memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for 1768, we
                    have an account of several attempts of this kind, with information how the
                    object desired may be effected. The state of vegetable milk in which the
                    caoutchouc resin is found when it comes from the tree, led M. Macquer to imagine
                    that it was composed of an oil and a watery matter. From its wanting aromatic
                    flavour, from its having little volatility, and from its being incapable of
                    solution in spirits of wine, he concluded that the oil which entered into its
                    composition was not an essential, but a fatty one. Hence he thought it probable
                    that it passed from a fluid to a solid form by the evaporation of the watery
                    part, and that the oily solvents would reduce it to a soft state. ' <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> The first trials he made for dissolving it were with
                    linseed oil, essence of turpentine, and several others. But all he could obtain
                    by means of these menstrua was a viscid substance, incapable of being hardened,
                    and totally void of elasticity. The rectified essential oil of turpentine was
                    employed, apparently with greater success. To separate from this menstruum the
                    caoutchouc which it had dissolved, M. Macquer added spirits of wine; but the
                    consequence was, that part only of the oil united with the spirit, whilst the
                    rest remained obstinately attached to the resin which it had dissolved, and thus
                    prevented it from assuming a solid consistence. The author next endeavoured to
                    dissolve it by means of heat in Papin’s digester. But neither water nor spirits
                    of wine, although in this way capable of dissolving the hardest bones, could
                    produce any other effect upon it than to render it more firm than before. After
                    this he tried what effect the milky juice of other vegetables would produce upon
                    it. He used several kinds, particularly that of the fig; but in this way he
                    could obtain no solution. From the great volatility of ether, he was next
                    induced to try it as a menstruum; and accordingly he prepared some with great
                    attention. The caoutchouc, cut into little bits, and put into a proper vessel
                    with as much ether as was sufficient to cover it, was perfectly dissolved
                    without any other heat than that of the atmosphere. This solution was
                    transparent and of an amber colour. It still preserved the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193348394" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8394-0107"/>smell of ether, but mixed
                    with the disagreeable odour of the caoutchouc, and was a little less fluid than
                    pure ether. Upon its being thrown into water, no milky liquor was produced; but
                    there arose to the surface a solid membrane, which possessed the elasticity and
                    other peculiar properties of the caoutchouc. He observes, however, that two
                    pints of the best ether, obtained by rectifying eight or ten pints of the common
                    ether by a gentle heat, must be used, in order to insure the success of the
                    operation. The distinguishing properties of this substance, its solidity,
                    flexibility, and elasticity, and its quality of resisting the action of aqueous,
                    spirituous, saline, oily, and other common solvents, render it extremely fit for
                    the construction of tubes, catheters, and other instruments in which these
                    properties are wanted. In order to form this resin into small tubes, M. Macquer
                    prepared a solid cylindrical mould of wax, of the desired size and shape; and
                    then dipping a pencil into the ethereal solution of the resin, daubed the mould
                    with it, till he had covered it over with a coat of resin of a sufficient
                    thickness. The whole piece was then thrown into boiling water, by the heat of
                    which the wax was soon melted, and rose to the surface, leaving the resinous
                    tube completely formed behind.</p>
                <p>Grossart informs us that he succeeded very well in employing the essential oils
                    of turpentine and lavender as a solvent for the elastic gum, and thus forming it
                    into tubes, or giving it any shape that was wanted. When the elastic tube is
                    prepared with oil of lavender, the latter may be separated by immersing the tube
                    in alcohol, which charges itself with oil, and becomes a good lavender water.
                    Alcohol serves another purpose besides taking up the essential oil. It
                    accelerates very much the drying of caoutchouc instruments which are thus
                    formed. Oil of turpentine appeared always to have a kind of stickiness; and the
                    smell, which could not be got rid of by any means yet discovered, was another
                    inconvenience.</p>
                <p>Grossart proposes another solvent, which is easily procured, and is not liable to
                    the inconvenience just mentioned. This solvent is water. “I conceive,” says he,
                    “it will appear strange to mention water as a solvent of elastic gum, that
                    liquid having been always supposed to have no action upon it. I myself resisted
                    the idea; but reflecting that ether, by being saturated with water, is the
                    better enabled to act on caoutchouc, and that this gum, when plunged into
                    boiling water, becomes more transparent at the edges, I presumed that this
                    effect was not due simply to the dilatation of its volume by the heat. I thought
                    that at that temperature some action might take place, and that a long-continued
                    ebullition might produce more sensible effects. I was not disappointed in my
                    expectations, and one of those tubes was prepared without any other solvent than
                    water and heat. I proceeded in the same manner as with ether. The elastic gum
                    dilates but very little in boiling water; it becomes whitish, but recovers its
                    colour again by drying it in the air and light. It is sufficiently prepared for
                    use when it has been a quarter of an hour in boiling water: by this time its
                    edges are somewhat transparent. It is to be turned spirally round the mould, in
                    the manner we described before, and replunged frequently into the boiling water
                    during the time that is employed in forming the tube, to the end that the edges
                    may be disposed to unite together. When the whole is bound with packthread, it
                    is to be kept some hours in boiling water; after which it is to be dried, still
                    keeping on the binding.</p>
                <p>“If we wish to be more certain that the connection is perfect, the spiral may be
                    doubled; but we must always avoid placing the exterior surfaces of the slips one
                    upon the other, as those surfaces are the parts which most resist the action of
                    solvents. This precaution is less necessary when ether is employed, on account
                    of its great action upon the caoutchouc.</p>
                <p>“It might be feared that the action of water upon caoutchouc would deprive us of
                    the advantages which might otherwise be expected; but these fears will be
                    removed if we consider that the affinities differ according to the temperatures;
                    that it is only at a very high temperature that water exercises any sensible
                    action upon caoutchouc. I can affirm that at 120 degrees of Reaumur’s
                    thermometer (302 degrees of Fahrenheit) this affinity is not such as that the
                    water can give a liquid form to caoutchouc; and it does not appear that we have
                    any thing to fear in practice from a combination between these two bodies,
                    which, though it really is a true solution, does not take place in any sensible
                    degree but at a high temperature. It is therefore at present easy to make of
                    caoutchouc whatever instruments it maybe advantageous to have of a flexible,
                    supple, and elastic substance, which is impermeable to water at the temperature
                    of our atmosphere, and resists the action of acids as well as that of most other
                    solvents. As to the durability of these instruments, few substances promise more
                    than this, because it may be soldered afresh in a damaged part. Any woven
                    substance may be covered with it; it is only ʹ required that the substance
                    should be of a nature not to be acted upon during the preparation, either by
                    ether or by boiling water; for these two agents are those which appear to me to
                    merit the preference. Artists will frequently find an advantage in employing
                    ether, as it requires less time; so that a person may make in a single day any
                    tube he may have occasion for. The expense of ether is very little, since it is
                    needful only to dispose the caoutchouc to adhere; and being brought into that
                    state, the caoutchouc may be kept in a vessel perfectly well closed. It would
                    also diminish the expense of the ether, if, instead of washing it with a large
                    quantity of water, there should be added to it only as much water as it can take
                    up.” <hi rend="italic">(^Annales de Chimie,</hi> vol. xi. p. 149.)</p>
                <p>A resin similar to this was some years ago discovered by M. Poivre, in the Isle
                    of France; and there are various milky juices extracted from trees in America
                    and elsewhere, which by previous mixtures and preparations are formed into an
                    elastic resin, but of an inferior quality to that of Cayenne. Such, for
                    instance, are the juices obtained from the <hi rend="italic">Cecropia
                    peltata,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Picus religiosa</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Indica,</hi> and from other trees.</p>
                <p>Of the genuine trees, those growing along the banks of the river of the Amazons
                    are described by M. Condamine as attaining a very great height, being at the
                    same time perfectly straight, and having no branches except at top, which is but
                    small, covering no more than a circumference of ten feet. Its leaves bear some
                    resemblance to those of the manioc; they are green on the upper part, and white
                    beneath. The seeds are three in number, being contained in a pod consisting of
                    three cells, not unlike those of the <hi rend="italic">ricinus</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">ρalma Christi</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in each of these
                    there is a kernal, which being stripped and boiled in water, produces a thick
                    oil or fat, answering the purpose of butter in the cookery of that country.</p>
                <p>A method of dissolving this elastic gum without ether, for the purposes of a
                    varnish or the like, is as follows: Take one pound of the spirit of turpentine,
                    and a pound of the gum cut into very small pieces; pour the turpentine into a
                    long-necked matrass, which must be placed in a sand-bath; throw in the gum, not
                    all at once, but by little and little, according as it is perceived to dissolve;
                    when it is entirely dissolved, pour into the matrass a pint of nut or linseed
                    oil, or oil of poppies, rendered desiccative in the usual manner with litharge;
                    then let the whole boil for a quarter of an hour, and the preparation is
                    finished. This would make an excellent varnish for air balloons, were it <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193348407" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8407-0108"/> not so expensive
                    on account of the price of the gum. Another method, invented by Mr Baldwin, is
                    as follows: Take any quantity of the caoutchoue, as two ounces avoirdupois; cut
                    it into small bits with a pair of scissors. Put a strong iron ladle, such as
                    plumbers and glaziers melt their lead in, over a common pit-coal or other fire.
                    The fire must be gentle, glowing, and without smoke. When the ladle is hot, much
                    below a red heat, put a single bit into the ladle. If black smoke issues it will
                    presently flame and disappear, or it will evaporate without flame; the ladle is
                    then too hot. When the ladle is less hot, put in a second bit, which will
                    produce a white smoke. This white smoke will continue during the operation, and
                    evaporate the caoutchouc; therefore no time is to be lost, but little bits are
                    to be put in, a few at a time, till the whole are melted. It should be
                    continually and gently stirred with an iron or brass spoon. Two pounds,-or one
                    quart, of the best drying oil (or of raw linseed oil, which, together with a few
                    drops of neat’s foot oil, has stood a month, or not so long, on a lump of
                    quicklime, to make it more or less drying) is to be put into the melted
                    caoutchouc, and stirred till hot, and the whole poured into a glazed vessel
                    through a coarse gauze or fine sieve. When settled and clear, which it will be
                    in a few minutes, it is fit for use, either hot or cold.</p>
                <p>The Abbé Clavigero informs us, that the elastic gum is called by the Mexicans <hi
                    rend="italic">Ollin</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Olli,</hi> and by the Spaniards of
                    that kingdom <hi rend="italic">Ule</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that it distils

                    smooth and yellowish, the leaves pretty large, the flowers white, and the fruit
                    yellow and rather round, but angular, and within which there are kernels as
                    large as filberts, and white, but covered with a yellowish pellicle; that the
                    kernel has a bitter taste, and the fruit always grows attached to the bark of
                    the tree; and that when the trunk is cut, the ule which distils from it is
                    white, liquid, and discous, but afterwards becomes yellow, and lastly of a
                    leaden colour, though rather blacker, which it always retains. The tree, he
                    adds, is very common in the kingdom of Guatimala.</p>
                <p>Different trees, it would appear, yield the elastic gum. Aublet, in his <hi

                    871), describes the tree, the fruit, and manner of collecting the juice; but he
                    never saw the flower. He calls it, however, <hi rend="italic">Hevea
                    Gaianensis.</hi> In Jaequin’s America it is called <hi rend="italic">Echites
                    Corymbosa.</hi> The younger Linnaeus, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Supplementum</hi><hi rend="italic">Plantarum</hi> (p. 422), names it <hi
                    rend="italic">Jatropha</hi><hi rend="italic">Elastica</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but acknowledges that he only gives it this name from the structure of
                    the fruit having most resemblance to that genus, his dry species wanting the
                    flowers.</p>
