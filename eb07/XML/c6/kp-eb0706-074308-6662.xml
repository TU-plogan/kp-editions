                    being derived from the verb κλmft, <hi rend="italic">to incline,</hi> was
                    applied by the ancients to signify that obliquity of the sphere with respect to
                    the horizon from which results the inequality of day and night. The great
                    astronomer and geographer Ptolemy distinguished the surface of our globe, from
                    the equator to the arctie circle, into climates or parallel zones, corresponding
                    to the successive increase of a quarter of an hour in the length of
                    midsummer-day. Within the tropics, these zones are nearly of equal breadth; but,
                    in the higher latitudes, they contract so much, that it was deemed enough to
                    reckon them by their doubles, answering consequently to intervals of half an
                    hour in the extension of the longest day. To compute them is an easy problem in

                    quadrant is to the radius, so is the tangent of the obliquity of the ecliptic,
                    or of 23° 28', to the cotangent of the latitude. The semidiurnal arcs are
                    assumed to be 91° 52⅜', 93° 45', 95° 37∣ ʹ, 97° 30', &amp;c.; and the following
                    table, extracted from Ptolemy’s great work, will give some general idea of the
                    distribution of seasons over the surface of our globe :—</p>

                <p>These numbers are calculated on the supposition that the obliquity of the
                    ecliptic was 23° 5P 20'', to which, according to the theory of Laplace, it must
                    have actually approached in the time of Ptolemy. They seem to be affected by
                    some small errors, especially in the parallels beyond the seventeenth, as the
                    irregular breadth of the zone abundantly shows; but they are, on the whole, more
                    accurate than those given by Varenius.</p>
                <p>Ptolemy describes the general appearances which the heavens will present on each
                    parallel, and assigns the corresponding lengths of the shadow of the gnomon at
                    both solstices. He justly maintains, in opposition to the more ancient opinion,
                    that the equatorial region is habitable, since the action of the sun, not
                    continuing long vertical, is there mitigated; but he will not venture to
                    describe the inhabitants, because no person, he says, having yet penetrated so
                    far south, the reports circulated respecting them appeared to be merely
                    conjectural. He therefore passes over the first parallel to the second.</p>
                <p>This <hi rend="italic">second</hi> parallel, then, according to Ptolemy, runs
                    through the isle of Taprobana, supposed to be Ceylon, in the latitude of 4° 15′.
                    The <hi rend="italic">third</hi> parallel, in the latitude of 8° 25', traverses

                    >seventeenth</hi> parallel, corresponding to a day of sixteen hours in length,
                    traverses the mouths of the Borysthenes, in latitude 48° 32′. The <hi

                    Palus Maeotis. The <hi rend="italic">nineteenth</hi> parallel passes through the
                    most southern part of Britain, in latitude 51° 40′ ∙ The <hi rend="italic"
                    >twentieth</hi> parallel crosses the mouths of the Rhine, in latitude 52° 50′.
                    The <hi rend="italic">twenty-first</hi> parallel passes through the mouths of
                    the Tanaïs, in fatitude 54° 30′. The <hi rend="italic">twenty-second</hi>
                    parallel, at the fifty-fifth degree of latitude, traverses the country of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Erigantes,</hi> in Great Britain, that is, the southern and
                    larger portion of this island, reckoning from the Frith of Forth. The <hi
                    rend="italic">twenty-third</hi> parallel, in the fifty-sixth degree of latitude,
                    passes through the middle of Great Britain. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >twenty-fourth</hi> parallel, at the latitude of 57°, runs through <hi
                    rend="italic">Caturactoniurn,</hi> in Great Britain. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >twenty-fifth</hi> parallel, corresponding to a day of eighteen hours, runs
                    through the southern parts of Little Britain, in latitude 58°. The <hi
                    rend="italic">twenty-sixth</hi> parallel, corresponding to a day of 18∣ hours in
                    length, traverses the middle of Little Britain, in latitude 58° 3Q ʹ. It should
                    be observed that the latitudes of the places in our own island are most
                    inaccurately given by Ptolemy, and generally advanced about two or three degrees
                    farther north than their true position. By Little Britain he meant undoubtedly
                    that part of Scotland which lies on the north side of the Friths of Forth and
                    Clyde, and forms almost a peninsula.</p>
                <p>The high zones become so narrow, that Ptolemy separates the <hi rend="italic"
                    >twenty-sixth</hi> to an interval of half instead of a quarter of an hour in the
                    length of the day; but he thinks it superfluous to extend this subdivision
                    farther into such remote and inhospitable countries. Resuming the calculation,
                    however, he places the parallel where midsummer day is prolonged to nineteen
                    hours, in the latitude of 61°, or the north of Little Britain. The parallel of
                    19∣ hours would pass through the Ebudes, Hebrides, or Western Isles, in latitude
                    62°. The parallel of twenty hours runs through the island of Thule, in the
                    latitude of 63°. The parallel of twenty-one hours would traverse the unknown
                    Scythian nations, in latitude 64^ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>. The parallels
                    of twenty-two and twenty-three hours would run through the latitudes of 651° <hi
                    rend="subscript"> a</hi> ∏d 66°. He places in latitude 66° 8′ 40" the arctic
                    circle itself,‘where the sun does not set during the whole of midsummer day.
                    Within this circle the inhabitants are <hi rend="italic">Periscians,</hi> or
                    have the sun lingering above the horizon during part of the summer, and the
                    shadow of the gnomon successively projected in every direction. In the latitude
                    of 67°, the sun continues almost a whole month above the horizon; in the
                    latitude of 69∣ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>, he shines two months; in the
                    latitudes of 731°, 78^ <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi>, and 84°, that luminary
                    displays his presence for three, four, and five months. At the pole itself, the
                    sun appears, during the space of six months, describing circles parallel to the
                    horizon.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Climate,</hi> in its modern acceptation, signifies that
                    peculiar condition of the atmosphere in regard to heat and moisture which
                    prevails in any given place. The diversified character which it displays has
                    been generally referred to the combined operation of several different causes,
                    which are all reducible, however, to these two; <hi rend="italic">distance from

                    Latitude and local elevation form, indeed, the great bases of the law of

                    influence.</p>
                <p>If we dig into the ground, we find the temperature to ' become gradually more
                    steady, till we reach a depth of perhaps forty or fifty feet, below which it
                    continues unchanged. When this perforation is made during winter, the ground
                    gets sensibly warmer till the limit is attained; but in summer, on the contrary,
                    it grows always colder, till it has reached the same limit. At a certain depth,
                    therefore, under the surface, the temperature of the ground remains quite
                    permanent. Nor is there any indication whatever of the supposed existence of a
                    central fire, since the alleged increase of heat near the bottom of the
                    profoundest excavations is merely accidental, being occasioned by the multitude
                    of burning tapers consumed in conducting the operations of mining. Accordingly,
                    while the air of those confined chambers feels often oppressively warm, the
                    water which flows along the floors seems comparatively cold, or rather preserves
                    the medium heat.</p>
                <p>It would be a hasty conclusion, however, to regard this limit of temperature as
                    the natural and absolute heat of our globe. If we dig on the summit of a
                    mountain, or any very elevated spot, we shall discover the ground to be
                    considerably colder than in the plain below; or, if we make a similar
                    perforation on the same level, but in a more southern latitude, we shall find
                    greater warmth than before. The heat thus obtained at some moderate depth is
                    hence only the mean result of all the various impressions which the surface of
                    the earth receives from the sun and the atmosphere.</p>
                <p>The method employed hitherto for ascertaining the temperature at different depths
                    under ground, consists in digging a hole, and burying a sluggish thermometer for
                    several hours, or the space of a whole night. The celebrated naturalist and
                    accurate observer, Saussure, in the month of October 1785, made an interesting
                    set of observations on the banks of the Arve, near Geneva. By digging downwards
                    on successive days, he reached at last the depth of 31 feet. While the surface
                    of the ground had retained a heat of 60° ∙3 by Fahrenheit’s scale, the
                    temperature of the earth at the depth of 4 feet was 60° ∙8, at 16 feet 56°, at
                    21 feet 53° ∙6, and at 28 feet 51° ∙8. A thermometer buried 31 feet deep was
                    found, when taken up in summer, to stand at 49° ∙5, and when raised in winter,
                    to indicate 52° ∙2. Notwithstanding this great depth, therefore, it had still
                    felt the vicissitude of the seasons, having varied 2° ∙7 in the course of the
                    year. The extreme impressions must have taken six months to penetrate to the
                    bulb, since the temperature was lowest in summer and highest in winter.</p>
                <p>But this plan of observing is clumsy and imperfect, there not being sufficient
                    time to allow the mass of earth to regain its proper degree of heat, and too
                    much for the instrument to retain its impression unaltered before it can be
                    raised up and observed. In order to throw distinct light on a subject so curious
                    and important, Robert Ferguson, Esq. of Raith, a gentleman whose elegant mind is
                    imbued with the love of science, caused a series of large mercurial
                    thermometers, with stems of unusual length, to be planted in his spacious garden
                    at Abbotshall, about 50 feet above the level of the sea, and near a mile from
                    the shore of Kirkaldy, in latitude 56° Iff. The main part of each stem having a
                    very narrow bore, had a piece of wider tube joined above it; and to support the
                    internal pressure of the column of mercury, the bulbs were formed of thick
                    cylinders. The instruments, inclosed for protection in wooden cases, were then
                    sunk beside each other to the depths of one, two, four, and eight feet, in a
                    soft gravelly soil, which turns, at four feet below the surface, into quicksand,
                    or a bed of sand and water. These thermometers were carefully observed from time
                    to time by Mr Charles Norval, the very intelligent gardener at Raith; and we
                    have had access to a register of their variations for nearly three years. It
                    thence appears that, in this climate, and on naked soil, the frost seldom or
                    never penetrates one foot into the ground. The thermometer at that depth fell to
                    33° of Fahrenheit on the 30th December 1815, and remained at the same point till
                    the 12th February 1816; but, in the ensuing year, it descended no lower than
                    34°, at which it continued stationary from the 23d Deeember 1816 to 1st January
                    1817. At the same depth, of one foot, it reached the maximum 58° on the 13th
                    July 1815, but, in the following year, it rose only to 54° on the 21st July;
                    and, in the year 1817, it mounted to 56° about the 5th July. This thermometer,
                    in the space of three years, travelled, therefore, over an interval of 25°, the
                    medium being 45į, and attained its highest and lowest points about three weeks
                    after the solstice of summer and of winter.</p>
                <p>The thermometer planted at the depth of two feet sunk to 36° on the 4th February
                    1816; but it stood at 38° about the beginning of January 1817. It rose to 56° on
                    the 1st of August 1815; but in the next year it reached only 53° on 24th July;
                    and, in 1817, it again reached 56° on lOth July. At the depth of two feet, the
                    extreme variation was therefore 20°; and the maxima and minima took place about
                    four or five weeks after either solstice.</p>
                <p>The thermometer of four feet depth had sunk to 39° about the 11th February 1816,
                    and was stationary at 40° near the 3d February 1817. It rose to 54° on the 2d
                    August 1815, and stood at 52° during the greater part of August and September in
                    the years 1816 and 1817. It ranged, therefore, only 15°, the mean being 46⅜°,
                    and the extreme points occurring near two months after either solstice.</p>
                <p>The thermometer whose bulb was planted eight feet deep descended to 42° on the
                    16th February 1816, but stood at 42∣ <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> on the 11th
                    February 1817. It rose to 51⅛° on the 11th September 1815, fell to 50° on the
                    14th September 1816, and mounted again to 51° on the 20th September 1817. This
                    thermometer had, therefore, a range of only 9į°, the medium temperature being
                    46^ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>, and the extremes of heat and cold occurring
                    nearly three months after the solstice of summer and of winter.</p>
                <p>These observations are quite satisfactory, and exhibit very clearly the slow
                    progress by which the impressions of heat or cold penetrate into the ground. It
                    will not be far from the truth to estimate the rate of this penetration at an
                    inch every day. The thermometers hence attained their maximum at different
                    periods, though in a tolerably regular succession. The mean temperature of the
                    ground, however, seemed rather to increase with the depth; but this anomaly
                    evidently proceeded from the coldness of the two successive summers, and
                    particularly that of 1816, which occasioned such late harvests and scanty crops.
                    Thus the thermometer of one foot indicated the medium heat of only 43° ∙8 during
                    the whole of the year 1816. But it will be satisfactory to exhibit the leading
                    facts in a tabular form. The following are the mean results for each month, only
                    those for December 1817 arc supplied from the corresponding month in 1815.</p>

                <p>If the thermometers had been sunk considerably deeper, they would no doubt have
                    indicated a mean temperature of 47° ∙7. Such is the permanent temperature of a
                    copious spring which flows at a short distance, and about the same elevation,
                    from the side of a basaltic or greenstone rock. Profuse fountains and deep
                    wells, which are fed by percolation through the crevices of the strata, furnish
                    the surest and easiest mensuration of the temperature of the earth’s crust. The
                    body of water which bursts from the caverns of Vaucluse, and forms almost
                    immediately a respectable and translucid river, has been observed not to vary in
                    its temperature, by the tenth part of a degree, through all the seasons of the
                    year. It is, therefore, an object highly important for scientific travellers to
                    notice the precise heat of springs in favourable situations, as they issue from
                    their rocky beds. Such choice observations would accurately fix the medium
                    temperature of any climate. It is only requisite to exclude the superficial and
                    the thermal springs, which are not difficult to distinguish.</p>
                <p>From a comparison of meteorological observations made at distant points on the
                    surface of our globe, the celebrated astronomer Professor Mayer of Göttingen,
                    was enabled to discover an empirical law which connects most harmoniously the
                    various results. Round the pole, the mean temperature may be assumed at the
                    precise limit of freezing, since the fields of ice accumulated in that forlorn
                    region seem at this present period neither to increase nor diminish. But under
                    the equator the medium heat on the level of the sea is found to be 841- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0</hi> of Fahrenheit, or 29 centesimal degrees, the division
                    of the thermometric scale which is the best suited to philosophical purposes. At
                    the middle point, or the latitude of 45°, the temperature is likewise the exact
                    mean, or 14∣ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> centigrade. From that centre, the
                    heat diminishes rapidly northwards, and increases with equal rapidity towards
                    the south. Hence the mean temperature of any place, at the level of the sea, is
                    calculated in centesimal degrees, by multiplying the square of the cosine of the
                    latitude into the constant number 29; or it is found by multiplying the
                    supplemental versed sine of double the latitude into 14∣ <hi rend="superscript">
                    o</hi>. The variation of temperature for each degree of latitude is hence
                    denoted centesimally, with very great precision, by half the sine of double the
                    latitude; being, in fact, this quantity diminished in the ratio of 58, the
                    double of 29, to 57∙3, the length of an arch equal to the radius. From these
                    data the following table is computed; in which are likewise annexed the
                    corresponding degrees of Fahrenheit’s, with the successive differences.</p>

                <p>It hence appears, that, near the extremities of the quadrant, or towards the pole
                    and the equator, there is scarcely any sensible variation of the mean
                    temperature, and that the whole change within the arctic circle, or between the
                    tropics, amounts only to eight degrees on Fahrenheit’s scale. Very little
                    increase of heat is, therefore, observed in advancing through the torrid zone to
                    the equator; and the intensity of the cold would not be sensibly augmented in
                    penetrating from the arctic circle to the pole. The existence of an open sea
                    towards the extreme north is hence not improbable.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the character of the climate changes rapidly in the temperate
                    zone. Hence likewise the variety of vegetable productions with which those
                    happier regions abound. Such a country as France, for example, stretching from
                    about the 40th to the 50th degree of latitude, and through a difference of five
                    centesimal degrees of mean temperature, yields not only plentiful crops of
                    wheat, barley, and oats, but raises olives, fig-trees, and vines.</p>
                <p>The gradation of temperature in different latitudes may be clearly shown by a
                    geometrical diagram. Let the figure below represent a quadrant, 90 the pole, and
                    50 the latitude of any place; on the radius as an axis and a parameter, describe
                    a parabola, which will consequently pass through the pole; draw the
                    perpendicular 50 B, and the portion of it AB, intercepted within the parabola,
                    will express the mean temperature of the given place at the level of the sea,
                    which in the present case should amount to 12 centesimal degrees.</p>
                <p>Since each elementary zone of the sphere is equal to the corresponding belt of a
                    circumscribed cylinder, the whole heat accumulated on its surface must be
                    proportional to the area of the annexed parabola, and, consequently, the mean
                    temperature is two thirds of what obtains at the equator, and therefore 191°, or
                    66° 8' on Fahrenheit’s scale. Such must be the temperature of the great mass of
                    the earth, if it has derived all its heat from external impressions. But, at the
                    very small depths to which we can ever penetrate, the influence of the immediate
                    vicinity only is felt; nor, in the profoundest mines, has any tendency yet been
                    perceived towards increase of temperature in the higher latitudes, or decrease
                    in the lower.</p>
                <p>These superficial impressions are all produced, either directly or through the
                    intervention of the atmosphere, by the action of the solar rays. It may be
                    calculated from experiment, that the entire and unimpaired light of a vertical
                    sun will communicate one centesimal degree of heat every hour to a sheet of
                    water of a foot in thickness. Consequently, since the surface of a sphere is
                    four times that of its generating circle, such a sheet of water, spread over the
                    whole of the globe, would receive six degrees of heat every day. But the very
                    inferior capacity of the atmosphere for heat, being estimated as equal to that
                    of a body of water about twelve feet in depth, if the aerial mass finally
                    received and retained all the calorific impressions, it would every day have its
                    temperature raised half a degree, and, therefore, augmented to 182∣ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o</hi> in the course of a whole year. This annual accession
                    of heat, however, is quickly dispersed by the mobility of the fluid medium, and
                    gradually absorbed into the earth, or more quickly diffused through the waters
                    of the ocean, which, besides, occupy at least three fourths of the whole surface
                    of our globe. The luminous matter communicated by the incessant shining of the
                    sun, whether received on the ground or intercepted in its passage through the
                    air, would hence be capable of communicating one centesimal degree of heat to
                    the body of the earth in the space of 1323 years; a quantity too small, perhaps,
                    to be yet perceived, though its influence may be afterwards detected by very
                    delicate observations.</p>
                <p>It is easy to demonstrate, from the laws of optics, that the quantity of light
                    which falls on a horizontal surface must be proportional to the sine of its
                    obliquity. Hence the aggregate light received under the equator at either
                    equinox is to what would accumulate during twenty four hours, if maintained at
                    its highest intensity, as the diameter to the circumference of a circle. This
                    daily accession of heat, confined to the mass of atmosphere, would, therefore,
                    in that climate and season, amount to 633,000 parts of a degree. At the pole
                    itself, during the complete circuit of the sun in midsummer’s day, the measure
                    of heat would be about a fourth part greater, or 797,000 parts; the continued
                    endurance of the sun above the horizon more than compensating for the feebleness
                    of his oblique rays.</p>
                <p>In general, the quantity of light received at any place from the sun in the space
                    of one day is denoted by the product of the sine of the semidiurnal arc, or the
                    distance from noon to the time of sunset, into the cosines of the latitude and
                    declination, joined to the product of that arc itself into the sines of the
                    latitude and declination; the latter part of the expression being considered as
                    additive or subtractive, according as the declination lies on the same or on the
                    opposite side of the latitude. Hence, at Edinburgh, in the latitude of 56°, the
                    heat collected during one day at the summer solstice is 307,000 parts, but at
                    the solstice of winter only 166,000.</p>
                <p>If a calculation be instituted for the quantities of heat during the half yearly
                    periods, from the equinox of spring to that of autumn, and from the autumnal
                    equinox again to the vernal, the following table will be formed.</p>

                <p>The annual accumulation at the latitude of 45° is thus 162°, which differs very
                    little from 158°, the mean between the calorific effects at the equator and at
                    the pole. It may be observed likewise, that the effects vary more slowly at the
                    extremes than near the middle of the quadrant. Thus, from the equator to the
                    tropic, and from the arctic circle to the pole, the differences are 30° and 28°;
                    but in the narrower intervals, from the tropic to the latitude of 45°, and
                    thence to the arctic circle, the differences <pb break="no" facs="nls:193356727"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-6727-0748"/>are 52° and 48°. The property now stated
                    corresponds with the changes of mean temperature in different latitudes.</p>
                <p>If a current of air from the equator, having the ordinary temperature of 29°,
                    were supposed to travel to the pole, from which an equal and contrary current
                    would consequently flow towards the equator, each journey would transport 58° of
                    heat. Between two and three such journeys performed every year would therefore
                    be sufficient to disperse the whole accumulation of 148°. This only requires the
                    existence of a wind advancing northwards at the rate of forty-six miles every
                    day. It is not necessary even that the wind should either continue permanent or
                    blow directly north. The same effect would be produced if it were to blow
                    indifferently to every point of the compass, and only at the rate of three miles
                    an hour; a supposition which agrees perfectly with actual observation.</p>
                <p>The circulation excited in the body of our atmosphere thus prevents the heat shed
                    by the sun on different parts of the earth’s surface from an excessive
                    accumulation. In proportion as the equatorial regions grew warmer from the
                    predominance of illumination, the polar wind would rush with more rapidity, till
                    it had tempered the excess. This balance of the accession, and the consequent
                    dispersion, of heat, has probably been long attained, and it now regulates the
                    gradation of climates in successive latitudes. But if air had possessed the
                    capacity for heat which belongs to hydrogen gas, it would have produced a more
                    equable diffusion of temperature, insomuch that the temperature of the equator
                    could not have become ten degrees warmer than that of the poles. On the
                    contrary, had our atmosphere been less fluid, or less capable of containing
                    heat, the inequality of different climates would have risen to a higher pitch.
                    That variety of temperature which occurs at present on the surface of the globe
                    was requisite for the development of the different vegetable tribes which clothe
                    it. The same harmony connects the system of this lower world which irradiates
                    the expanse of the celestial regions.</p>
                <p>The equilibrium of temperature preserved over the globe by the circulation of the
                    atmosphere is not, however, very quickly produced. Hence the remarkable increase
                    of heat which takes place during the summer months in the higher latitudes. But
                    within the arctic circle, another powerful agent of nature is constantly
                    tempering the inequality of the seasons. The vast beds of snow or fields of ice
                    which cover the land and the sea in those dreary retreats, absorb, in the act of
                    thawing or passing again to the liquid form, all the surplus heat collected
                    during the continuance of a nightless summer. The rigour of winter, when
                    darkness resumes her tedious reign, is likewise mitigated by the warmth evolved
                    as congelation spreads over the watery surface.</p>
                <p>Of the light received from the sun, which, by its union with other bodies,
                    constitutes heat, a considerable portion is always detained and absorbed in its
                    passage through the atmosphere. Even a vertical ray shot through the clearest
                    air will lose more than the fifth part of its intensity before it reaches the
                    surface of the earth. In most cases, the loss which light will suffer in the
                    shortest transit through the atmosphere may be estimated at one fourth of the
                    whole. But the oblique rays must undergo a much greater absorption. If, from
                    their slanting course, they have to encounter twice the number of aerial
                    particles, their intensity must be reduced to nine sixteenths, or the square of
                    three fourths; and if they describe triple the vertical tract, only twenty-seven
                    sixty-fourth parts, or the cube of three fourths, will reach the ground. In
                    general, if the tracts of light follow an arithmetical progression, the
                    diminished force with which it escapes and arrives at the ground will form a
                    decreasing geometrical progression. To determine the train of aerial particles
                    which the oblique rays of the sun must traverse in their passage through the
                    atmosphere, is a nice problem, which requires a skilful application of the
                    integral calculus. Without stopping to engage at present in the details of this
                    intricate investigation, it may suffice to remark, that, in general, the length
                    of the tract is nearly in the inverse ratio of the sine of the sun’s altitude.
                    But the following table, to every five degrees, is calculated from rigorous
                    formulae, the length of oblique tract being reduced to the standard of air
                    uniformly dense. These quantities again are diminished in the ratio of the sine
                    of obliquity, to express the calorific action which those enfeebled and slanting
                    rays finally exert at the surface of the earth.</p>

                <p>It hence appears that, even when the sky is most serene, only one half of the
                    sun’s light can reach the surface of the earth from an altitude of 25°, or one
                    third from that of 15°, and that, if the obliquity of the rays were increased to
                    5°, no more than the twentieth part of them would actually be transmitted. The
                    annual quantity of light which falls may be computed as equivalent at the
                    equator to an uniform illumination from an altitude of 17° 46'; and, in the mean
                    latitude of 45°, and at the pole, the effects are the same as if the rays had
                    respectively the constant obliquities of 13° 2' and 7° 17'. Wherefore, under the
                    most favourable circumstances, of 1000 parts of light transmitted from the sun,
                    only 378 can, at a medium estimate, penetrate to the surface at the equator, 228
                    in the latitude of 45°, and 110 at the pole, of their oblique rays; but the
                    shades received by a given portion of the surface are still less, being only
                    115, 51, and 14. In cloudy weather, the portion of light that can finally reach
                    the ground will seldom amount to the third of those quantities; and when the sky
                    becomes darkened with accumulated vapours, almost every shining ray is
                    intercepted in its passage.</p>
                <p>The light which at last gains the surface being there absorbed and converted into
                    heat, is, in this form, profusely delivered to the ambient air, or more feebly
                    conducted downwards into the body of the earth. But the rays which fall on seas
                    or lakes are not immediately arrested in their course; they penetrate,always
                    with diminishing energy, till, at a certain depth, they are no longer visible.
                    This depth depends, without doubt, on the clearness of the medium, though
                    probably not one tenth part <pb break="no" facs="nls:193356740"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-6740-0749"/>of the incident light can advance five fathoms in
                    most translucid water. The surface of the ocean is not, therefore, like that of
                    the land, heated by the direct action of the sun during the day, since his rays
                    are not intercepted at their entrance, but suffered partially to descend into
                    the mass, and to waste their calorific power on a liquid stratum of ten or
                    twelve feet in thickness.</p>
                <p>But the surface of deep collections of water is kept always warmer than the
                    ordinary standard of the place, by the operation of another cause, arising from
                    the peculiar constitution of fluids. Although these are capable, like solids, of
                    conducting heat slowly through their mass, yet they transfer it principally in a
                    copious flow by their internal mobility. The heated portions of a fluid being
                    dilated, must continue to float on the surface; while the portions which are
                    cooled, becoming consequently denser, will sink downwards by their superior
                    gravity. Hence the bed of a very deep pool is always excessively cold, since the
                    atmospheric influences are modified in their effects by the laws of statics. The
                    mean temperature of the climate is not communicated by these variable
                    impressions; every change to warmth being spent on the upper stratum, while
                    every transition to cold penetrates to the bottom, which thus experiences all
                    the rigours of winter, without receiving any share of the summer’s heat. But, if
                    the beds of profound bodies of water remain perpetually cold, their surface
                    undergoes some variety of temperature, and is generally warmer than the average
                    weekly or monthly heat of the air.</p>
                <p>These principles are confirmed by observations made on our own lakes, and
                    strikingly exemplified in those of Switzerland, which have a breadth
                    proportioned to the stupendous altitude of their encircling mountains. It
                    appears, from the careful observations of Saussure, that the bottoms of those
                    majestic basins, whether situated in the lower plains, or embosomed in the
                    regions of the upper Alps, are almost all of them equally cold, being only a few
                    degrees above the point of congelation. That accurate observer found the
                    temperature of the Lake of Geneva, at the depth of 1000 feet, to be 42°, and
                    could discover no monthly variation under 160 feet from the surface. In the
                    course of July, he examined the Lakes of Thun and Lucerne: the former at the
                    depth of 370, and the latter at that of 640 feet, had both the temperature of
                    41°, while the superficial waters indicated respectively 64° and 68J⅛ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> p</hi> by Fahrenheit’s scale. The bottom of the Lago
                    Maggiore, on the Italian side of the Alps, was a little warmer, being 44° at the
                    depth of 360 feet, while the surface was almost as high as 78°. Barlocci has
                    since found that the Lago Sabatino, near Rome, at the depth of 490 feet, was
                    only 44⅜-, while the thermometer, dipped at the surface, marked “77°.</p>
                <p>Through the friendship of Mr James Jardine, civil engineer, we are enabled to
                    give the results of his observations on some of the principal Scottish lakes,
                    which, as might be expected from him, were conducted with the most scrupulous
                    accuracy. The instrument which he employed for exploring the temperature at
                    different depths, was free from the ordinary objections; being a register
                    thermometer, let down in a horizontal position, which could acquire the
                    impression in not many seconds, and might be drawn up leisurely, without risk of
                    subsequent alteration. It would appear that the variable impressions of the
                    seasons do not penetrate more than fifteen or twenty fathoms; that below this
                    depth, an almost uniform coldness prevails. Thus, in the deepest part of Loch
                    Lomond, on the 8th September 1812, the temperature of the surface was 59° ∙3 of
                    Fahrenheit; at the depth of 15 fathoms, 43° ∙7; at that of 40 fathoms, 41° ∙3;
                    and from that point to about 3 feet from the bottom, at 100 fathoms, it
                    decreased only the fifth part of a degree. Again, on the preceding day, the
                    superficial water of Loch Katrine being at 57° ∙3, the thermometer, let down 10
                    fathoms, indicated 50° ∙6; at the depth of 20 fathoms it marked 43° ∙1; at the
                    depth of 35 fathoms it fell to 41° ∙1; and on the verge of the bottom, at 80
                    fathoms, it had only varied to 41°. At the same place, on the 3d September 1814,
                    the heat.of the surface was 56 <hi rend="superscript"> Ο</hi> ·4; at the depth
                    of 10 fathoms, 49° ∙2∙, at that of 20 fathoms, 44°; at that of 30 fathoms, 41°
                    ∙9; and at that of 80 fathoms, 41° ∙3.</p>
                <p>Hence it is that, even in the northern latitudes, the deep lakes are never,
                    during the hardest winters, completely frozen over. But if the same water be let
                    into a shallow basin, it will, in a rigorous season, be chilled thoroughly, and
                    converted into ice. This may even happen when spread above the surface of salt
                    water, which is always considerably denser. Thus, frost takes no effect on Loch
                    Ness, nor on the river of that name, which, in a rapid course of a few miles,
                    discharges the surplus water into the sea. But in very severe winters, a sheet
                    of ice appears formed along the shore; the impressions of cold being almost
                    wholly expended on the accumulation of fresh water, since the chilled portions
                    of this, which continually descend, are stopped in their progress by the greater
                    density of the recumbent sea water.</p>
                <p>The seas and the ocean itself obey the same law of the distribution of heat, only
                    the difference of temperature experienced by sounding in the Mediterranean is
                    less conspicuous than in the fresh-water lakes. Saussure found that the
                    temperature at the bottom, in the Gulfs of Nice and of Genoa, at the depths of
                    925 and of 1920 feet, was the same, or 55° ∙8, the heat of the superficial water
                    being about 69°. But the mean temperature, or that of the body of the land on
                    the same parallel of latitude, is 59°. The smallness of the diminution here
                    observed may perhaps be attributed to the effect of evaporation in such hot
                    confined bays, the water at the surface being thus rendered salter, and
                    consequently disposed, by its acquired density, to sink into the colder mass
                    below.</p>
                <p>In open seas, and in damper climates, the depression of temperature is greater in
                    the inferior strata. This difference becomes augmented in proportion of the
                    extreme variation of the seasons. Lord Mulgrave, on the 4th September 1773, in
                    the latitude of 65° north, drew up water from the depth of 4100 feet, which he
                    found to have the temperature of 40°, while the thermometer, dipped at the
                    surface, stood, on the 19th June, at 55°. In the latitude of 66°, a register
                    thermometer, let down 4680 feet, marked 26°, while the air was at 48∣ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o</hi>; and on the 31st August, in the latitude of 69°,
                    while the exterior thermometer indicated 591°, the temperature of the water at
                    the depth of 4010 feet was only 32°. In shallow seas the two extremes arc
                    brought closer together, and therefore a similar difference of temperature now
                    occurs at moderate depths. The water lying on the surface, which, in the
                    vicissitude of the season, comes to be chilled, is not precipitated as before to
                    a fathomless abyss. The increase of cold below is hence considered as an
                    indication of the proximity of banks, if not of the approach to land itself.</p>
                <p>A like gradation of temperature is produced by the alternating influence of the
                    seasons in deep and stagnant masses of air. When this active fluid is confined
                    in profound caverns, opening to the sky without being much exposed, and either
                    perpendicular or gently inclined, its lower strata become intensely and
                    permanently cold. The mild air of summer floats motionless at the mouth of the
                    pit; but, in winter, the superior air, cooled many degrees perhaps below the
                    freezing point, and therefore greatly condensed, precipitates itself continually
                    to the bottom.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193356753" xml:id="kp-eb0706-6753-0750"/>
                <p>This fact takes place in most caverns, and in draw-wells which are left
                    uncovered. Saussure found, on the 1st of July, when the thermometer in the shade
                    stood at 78° of Fahrenheit, that a cave in the Monte Testaceo, a small hill in
                    the vicinity of Rome, formed entirely by the enormous accumulation of broken
                    pottery, had the temperature of 50°; and two other caves in the same porous mass
                    were cooled to 44°. On the 9th July, when the external air was at 61°, the cave
                    of St Marino, at the foot of a sandstone hill, about 2080 feet above the level
                    of the sea, indicated only 44^, which is 8° below the mean temperature of the
                    soil in that situation. In the grotto of Ischia, and in the caves of Cesi and of
                    Chiavenna, the thermometer marked likewise 44^°; but in the caves of Caprino, on
                    the borders of the Lake of Lugano, it stood at different times of the year at
                    37° and at 42°; and in those of Hergisweil, near Lucerne, the heat of the
                    interior, on the 31st of July, was only 39J- <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>.</p>
                <p>But this phenomenon is still more striking in certain peculiar circumstances. The
                    famous Swedish mine of Dannemora, which yields the richest iron ore in the
                    world, presents an immense excavation, probably two or three hundred feet in
                    depth. On the occasion of some repairs which suspended the usual labours, the
                    basin appeared some years since full of water, with huge blocks of ice floating
                    in it. The silver mine of Köngsberg, in Norway, has for its main shaft a
                    frightful open cavern, perhaps three hundred feet deep and thirty feet wide, of
                    which the bottom is covered with perpetual snow. Hence, likewise, on the sides
                    of Aetna and of the mountains in Spain, the collected snows are preserved all
                    the year in caves and crevices of the rocks, from which natural stores the
                    muleteers carry down, during summer, to the villages and the cities of the
                    plain, a material so necessary to comfort in those parched climates.</p>
                <p>Such is the disposition induced in a confined column of fair; but in a free
                    atmosphere the gradation of temperature is exactly reversed, the lower strata
                    being invariably warmer than the upper. This most important fact in meteorology
                    and physical geography was thought sufficiently explained, in the infancy of
                    physical science, from the proximity of the heat supposed to be reflected by the
                    surface of the earth. But it were idle to attempt any serious confutation of
                    such crude ideas. The true cause of the cold that prevails in the higher regions
                    of the atmosphere is undoubtedly the enlarged capacity which air acquires by
                    rarefaction. From the unequal action of the sun’s rays, and the vicissitudes of
                    day and night, a quick and perpetual circulation is maintained between the lower
                    and the upper strata; and it is obvious that, for each portion of air which
                    rises from the surface, an equal and corresponding portion must likewise
                    descend. But that which mounts up, acquiring an augmented attraction for heat,
                    has its temperature proportionally diminished; while the correlative mass
                    falling down, carries its share of heat along with it, and, again relaxing its
                    attraction, seems to diffuse warmth below. A stratum at any given height in the
                    atmosphere is hence affected both by the passage of air from below and by the
                    return of air from above, the former absorbing a portion of heat, and the latter
                    evolving it. But the mean temperature at every elevation is on the whole still
                    permanent, and consequently those disturbing causes must be exactly balanced, or
                    the absolute measure of heat is the same at all heights, suffering merely some
                    external modification from the difference of capacity in the several portions of
                    the fluid with which it has combined. That temperature is hence inversely as the
                    capacity of air having the rarity due to the given altitude.</p>
                <p>It only remains, therefore, to discover the capacity of air, or its attraction
                    for heat under successive pressures, or at different degrees of rarity. But this
                    problem requires a very nice investigation, and appears incapable of being
                    resolved by any direct procedure. If the elaborate expe- <hi rend="superscript"
                    >:</hi> riments of Dr Crawford and others on the capacity of air' in its
                    ordinary state gave such erroneous results, what <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    hope could be formed of ascertaining even its minute shad-, ings, by any similar
                    plan of operation? But, independently almost of any theory, a simple method
                    occurs for conducting this research. A delicate thermometer, suspended within
                    the receiver of an air-pump, indicates a decrease of temperature as the process
                    of rarefaction advances; and, on stopping this operation at any stage, the
                    thermometer will slowly regain its former state. If now, when the equilibrium is
                    restored, the air be suddenly readmitted, the dilated portion which had remained
                    in the receiver liberates the heat absorbed by it during the progress of
                    rarefaction. The thermometer accordingly rises quickly through a certain space,
                    then becomes for a short while stationary, and afterwards slowly subsides. But
                    the instrument does evidently not measure the whole of the heat thus evolved; a
                    great part of it being spent in warming up to the same point the internal
                    surface of the receiver. This action, however, is merely superficial, since its
                    effect appears to be momentary. Consequently, the internal surface of the
                    receiver, with that of the plate on which it stands, as penetrated by the sudden
                    impression to a certain very minute depth, forms a constant film of matter,
                    which, as well as the body of air itself, draws its supply from the extricated
                    heat. Under the same receiver, therefore, although the air will not seize the
                    whole of the heat disengaged in the act of admission, it must always retain a
                    proportional share of it. A series of experiments, at successive degrees of
                    rarefaction, must hence discover, if not the absolute, yet the relative changes
                    of the air’s capacity for heat.</p>
                <p>To institute this inquiry with the desired success, an. excellent and powerful
                    air-pump was used, having a re-ι ceiver of the very largest dimensions, of an
                    oblong sphe- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> roidal form, approaching, however,
                    nearly to the globular, and with a narrow bottom. The apparatus being placed in
                    the middle of a close room, which had a steady temperature, a thermometer with a
                    slender stem, open at top, and a small bulb of extreme sensibility, was fixed in
                    a vertical position, a few inches above the centre of the plate. Having replaced
                    the receiver, and allowed it to stand some time, one fifth of the air was now
                    extracted from under it; and, after a considerable interval, the cock was
                    suddenly opened, to restore the equilibrium; when the mercury of the
                    thermometer, which had been stationary, mounted up very rapidly 3Ό centesimal
                    degrees, from which point it afterwards slowly descended.</p>
                <p>The temperature of the room having been regained, two fifths of the air in the
                    receiver were then extracted; and, after some lapse of time, the external
                    communication being repeated, the thermometer rose instantly 5*3 centesimal
                    degrees. On extracting three fifths of the internal air, the corresponding
                    ascent of the thermometer, at the restoration of the equilibrium, was 7Ό of
                    those degrees; and, when the contents of the receiver had been rarefied five
                    times, the heat evolved, on the re-admission of the air, amounted to 8Ό degrees.
                    The rate of progressive effect was thus evidently diminishing. On pushing the
                    rarefaction as far as it was really practicable, or till the residual air had
                    become rarefied about 300 times, the change indicated by the thermometer did not
                    reach to more than 8∙3.</p>
                <p>But, to determine the absolute quantity of heat which is disengaged in the
                    transition of air from a rarer to a denser state, it becomes necessary to
                    ascertain what part of it was consumed on the sides of the receiver. By
                    varying<pb break="no" facs="nls:193356766" xml:id="kp-eb0706-6766-0751"/> the
                    size of the receiver, and consequently altering the proportion between its
                    surface and its contents, some light may be thrown on this question. Another
                    similar receiver was therefore provided, having half the former dimensions; and
                    with this the same set of experiments was repeated. Its included air being
                    reduced successively to the density of four fifths," three fifths, two fifths,
                    and one fifth, and then rarefied as much as possible, the thermometer mounted
                    each time through the shorter spaces of 1∙8, 3∙2, 4∙2, 4∙8, and finally 5 ’ 0
                    centesimal degrees. These quantities evidently follow the same proportion as the
                    former, of which indeed they are only three fifths. But the smaller receiver,
                    having, under the fourth part of the surface of the larger, only the eighth part
                    of its contents, exposes comparatively twice the extent of surface. The rise of
                    temperature which its included air exhibits must consequently be the same as
                    what would have obtained within the larger receiver, if, while its capacity
                    remained the same, its surface had been actually doubled. If we suppose the air
                    to hold one part of the heat, while two parts and four parts are respectively
                    expended on the insides of the receivers, the results would correspond with
                    observation; for the whole quantity evolved, being in both cases the same, the
                    air under the larger receiver would retain one third, and, under the smaller
                    receiver, only one fifth; the impressions being thus in the ratio of five to
                    three. The same conclusion may be obtained somewhat differently. If the heat
                    spent on the inside of the large receiver had been spread over twice the
                    surface, it would have raised the temperature only 1° ∙5; but this mounted
                    really to 1° ∙8, and therefore the difference ’ 3 was the effects of 1° ∙8
                    derived from the contained air. Of the heat thus shared between the air and the
                    doubled surface, one part was hence retained and five communicated.
                    Consequently, to obtain the true results, it is only necessary to multiply the
                    second set of quantities by five, or the first set by three. If no waste,
                    therefore, took place against the inside of the receiver, the heat evolved in
                    the passage of air from the densities of four fifths, three fifths, two fifths,
                    one fifth, and extreme rarefaction, to its ordinary state, would be 9, 16, 21,
                    24, and 25 centesimal degrees.</p>
                <p>It is not difficult to discover the law of this progression. They are obviously
                    formed by the successive addition of the odd numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1; and are,
                    consequently, the excesses of the square of 5 above the squares of 4, 3, 2, and
                    1. Wherefore, if the square of the density be taken from unit, the remainder,
                    multiplied by 25, will express in centesimal degrees the rise of temperature
                    which accompanies the return of the air to its ordinary state.</p>
                <p>The numbers thus obtained, however, do not still express the final results. If
                    the restoration of four parts of the air included under the receiver to their
                    usual density, disengage heat sufficient to raise the temperature of the whole
                    five parts 9 degrees, its real measure must have been lli degrees, or the former
                    augmented in the ratio of 4 to 5. For the same reason, if three fifths, two
                    fifths, and one fifth of the air in the transition of density, evolve portions
                    of heat, which would elevate the temperature of the mass 16, 21, and 24 degrees,
                    the actual quantities are 26∣∙ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>, 52⅜°, and 120°,
                    or those numbers multiplied by 5, and divided by 3, 2, and 1.</p>
                <p>These conclusions are easily reduced to formulae. Let J denote the density of the
                    air, and 25 (1 — <hi rend="italic">ô</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    2</hi><hi rend="italic">)</hi> will express, in centesimal degrees, the
                    elevation of the thermometer which would follow the rc-admission of the air, if
                    none of the heat were spent on the inside of the receiver. Consequently, 25 <hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">^0~)'</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    or</hi><hi rend="italic">(j~~~</hi> win exhibit on the same scale the whole
                    quantity of heat evolved in the restoration of density. The last formula is
                    extremely simple, implying that 25, multiplied into the difference between the
                    density of air and its reciprocal, will represent the measure of heat due to the
                    change of condition. This result may be either additive or subtractive; it may
                    express the heat emitted in the condensation of air, or the heat absorbed during
                    its opposite rarefaction.</p>
                <p>Thus, the heat extricated from air which has its density doubled is 25° (2 — J-),
                    or 37⅛- <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>; and the same quantity is withdrawn,
                    either when this air recovers its former density, or when air of the ordinary
                    state expands into double its volume. Hence the copious heat extricated by the
                    sudden compression of air. If it were condensed thirty times, the heat
                    discharged would amount . to 25 ^30 — —or 749°, which is more than sufficient
                    for the inflammation of fungous or soft substances. On this principle are
                    constructed the pneumatic matches invented by Mollet of Lyons, which produce
                    their effect by the momentary action of a small syringe.</p>
                <p>But, to discover the relative capacity or attraction which air of a given density
                    has for heat, it would be necessary to know the extent of the natural scale, or
                    the position of the absolute zero. The conclusions, however, from different
                    data, are not very constant; yet several experiments appear to fix nearly the
                    point from which the infusion of heat commences at 750 centesimal degrees below
                    congelation. On this supposition, therefore, air which is rarefied thirty times
                    has its capacity doubled, the heat contained in it being dilated only fifteen
                    times. For the same reason, air sixty times rarer than ordinary acquires a
                    triple attraction for heat, which, in this union, becomes attenuated only twenty
                    times. But these inferences are merely speculative, and the law of the gradation
                    of temperature in the atmosphere is quite independent of the existence of an
                    absolute term of heat.</p>
                <p>The last formula now investigated has been already laid before the public,
                    without any explication, however, or indeed indication, of the process by which
                    it was discovered. The experiments on which it rests were begun many years
                    since, and have been repeated with every precaution. But the mean results only
                    are retained; and, for the sake of simplicity, a few slight modifications have
                    been introduced, to adapt the apparatus ζo more convenient proportions. Though
                    it was impossible to blow a receiver that should have <hi rend="italic"
                    >exactly</hi> half the dimensions of another, nothing seemed easier, from the
                    general mode of investigation, than to apply the minute corrections which any
                    small deviations of size or form required. The mixture of obscure and intricate
                    computations has been thus avoided.</p>
                <p>The gradation of the effects disclosed by this experimental research is more
                    easily and clearly traced in geometrical diagrams. Having divided the absciss AF
                    into five equal portions, erect the several perpendiculars EG, DH, CI, BK, and
                    AL, equal respectively to 9, 16, 21, 24, and 25 parts on any scale, and connect
                    the points F, G, H, I, K, and L, by a curve line. It is readily perceived that
                    the curve now traced must be a parabola, formed on the axis LA. Wherefore, if AF
                    represent the height of the barometric gage of the air-pump, and AD its altitude
                    after a partial exhaustion, the parallel DIT will express the rise of the
                    included thermometer on the re-admission of the air which had been
                    extracted.</p>
                <p>The axis AL itself denotes the extreme effect, or what would take place if the
                    rarefaction,were pushed to the utmost. While the mercurial column, therefore,
                    descends <pb break="no" facs="nls:193356779" xml:id="kp-eb0706-6779-0752"/>by
                    equal intervals to E, D, C, B, and approximates to A, the elevation of the
                    thermometer through the spaces EG, DH, CI, BK, and nearly AL, advances at first
                    uniformly, and afterwards continually more slowly, till it becomes
                    stationary.</p>
                <p>But the parallels to the axis of a parabola do not express the whole of the heat
                    disengaged by the attenuated air during the resumption of its density. The line
                    DH, for instance, marks only the rise of temperature communicated to the entire
                    mass AF, by the heat evolved from the portion AD; and to represent the true
                    measure of this heat, it must, therefore, be increased in the ratio of AD to AF.
                    Hence, from the point A, and through the extremities of the parallels EG, DH,
                    CI, and BK, draw the oblique lines AG, AH, AI, and AK, to meet the extended
                    perpendicular FO; the intercepted segments or parabolic tangents FM, FN, FO, and
                    FP (if this last were completed), will exhibit the real portions of heat
                    liberated from any of the corresponding densities AE, AD, AC, AB.</p>
                <p>Let the part AL of the axis be taken equal to the parameter, and the ordinate AF
                    must likewise be equal to it: draw the vertical tangent LQ meeting the parallel
                    DH in Q; join the oblique line AQ, and produce it to meet the perpendicular in
                    R. From the property of the curve, QH: AD:: AD: AF; but from the mutual relation
                    of the diverging 1 ines AN, AR, and the parallels DQandFR, AD:AF:: AH: AN:: QH:
                    NR; whence QH: NR:: QH: AD, and, therefore, NR is equal to AD. Consequently FN,
                    which expresses the whole evolution of heat corresponding to the densityAD,is
                    equal to the difference between AD and FR.</p>
                <p>But since AD: AF:: DQ or AF: FR, the line FR is the reciprocal of AD, the
                    parameter AF being considered as unit. The measure of heat evolved, or the
                    parabolic tangent FN, is, therefore, as before expressed, by the difference of
                    the density of the air and its reciprocal.</p>
                <p>The same result may be represented geometrically in another way. Let LIG be a
                    rectangular hyperbola referred to its asymptotes AE and AF, the axis being AO.
                    If the perpendicular IC, or the absciss AC, express the ordinary density of the
                    air, and the ordinate DH denote any other density, the intercepted segment HN,
                    or the difference between DH and its reciprocal AD or DN, will exhibit the
                    additional share of heat required for its constitution. On the contrary, if the
                    air acquires the higher density BK, the quantity of heat which it must evolve in
                    its transition will be represented by KP. In the figure here annexed, the air is
                    presumed to have its density reduced to the half in one case, and doubled in the
                    other; the quantities of beat, HN and KP, which are evolved and absorbed, being
                    then equal and opposite.</p>
                <p>Since the absolute quantity of heat contained in every part of any vertical
                    column of the atmosphere has been shown to remain unchanged, these diagrams must
                    likewise represent the diminution of temperature in the higher strata,
                    corresponding to the decreased density of the air at different elevations. The
                    same formula will determine the measure and gradation of this effect. Reckoning
                    the density of the air at the surface of the earth unit, the difference between
                    the density at any given altitude and its reciprocal, being multiplied by 25,
                    will express the mean diminution of temperature in centesimal degrees; or if 45
                    be employed as the multiplier, the product will exhibit the same result in
                    degrees of Fahrenheit’s scale.</p>
                <p>This very simple deduction from theory is amply confirmed by numerous and
                    extensive observations. But a few leading facts will perhaps be deemed
                    sufficient for exemplification.</p>
                <p>According to Lasius, the same barometer which, at Goslar, an ancient town seated
                    in the bosom of the Hartz Forest, stands at 29,500 inches, would fall to 26,444
                    on the top of the Brocken, in that mining district. This gives •896 for the
                    density of the air on the summit, the reciprocal of which is 1∙116; but 1416 —
                    ∙896=∙22, and ∙22 × 25° = 5° ∙5, the calculated difference of temperature. The
                    actual difference is very nearly the same, being only 5° ∙2; as we had once an
                    opportunity ourselves of observing, having found the temperature of a copious
                    spring at Goslar to be eight centesimal degrees, while that of the noted
                    Hecken-Brunnen, or <hi rend="italic">Witch-Well,</hi> on the summit of the
                    Brocken, was only 2° ∙8.</p>
                <p>Saussure, whose accuracy always inspires confidence, found that, while at his
                    villa of Conche, near Geneva, the barometer stood at 28∙500, another similar
                    instrument fell to 25∙165 on the top of the mountain of Nant Bourant. The
                    diminished densjty of the air at this elevation was, therefore, ∙890; the
                    difference between which and its reciprocal 1423 being multiplied by 25°, gives
                    5° ∙82. But a thermometer buried a whole night at two feet deep in that lofty
                    station, marked only 12° ∙75, while it indicated 6'25 more, or 19°, a few days
                    afterwards, when sunk to the same depth at Conche. The discrepancy here is thus
                    less than half a degree.</p>
                <p>On the top of a higher mountain, the Chapieu, the same observer found the ground,
                    at a depth of two feet, to be colder by 6° ∙44 than at Conche; but the
                    corresponding <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> density of the air and its
                    reciprocal were ∙872 and 1447 consequently, 25° × ∙275 = 6° ∙87.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193356792" xml:id="kp-eb0706-6792-0753"/>
                <p>While the barometer at Conche stood at 28∙500 inches, the mercurial column was
                    only 19∙836 inches on the summit of Mont Cervin, a still loftier mountain. The
                    density of the air at this elevation was therefore ∙696, which being taken from
                    its reciprocal 1∙4∙37, leaves ∙741 to be multiplied by 25°, indicating 18° ∙52
                    as the diminution of temperature. The actual medium difference ascertained from
                    corresponding thermometrical observations, made at depths in the ground from one
                    to three feet, on the top of Mont Cervin and at Conche, was 18° ∙25, almost
                    exactly the same.</p>
                <p>Such is the nice agreement on the whole, between theory and observation, with
                    regard to the decrease of the mean temperature in the higher regions of the
                    atmosphere. This gradation of cold varies, however, to a certain extent with the
                    seasons. Since-the heat derived from the sun is chiefly accumulated at the
                    surface of the earth, the changes of temperature which take place through the
                    year in the elevated strata of our atmosphere, must evidently be less than what
                    are experienced below. The lofty tracts of air, remote from the primary scene of
                    action, preserve nearly an equable temperature, and scarcely feel ;the extreme
                    heat of summer or winter’s frost. In ascending the atmosphere, the decrease of
                    warmth is hence more rapid in the fine season, and more slow in the darkened
                    period of the year. In many places, it will not be far from the truth, perhaps,
                    to assume 30° for the multiplier during the summer months, and only 20° during
                    those of winter.</p>
                <p>Thus General Roy, a diligent and experienced observer, found, in the month of
                    August, the air on the top of Snowdon was, in the course of a whole day, at an
                    average, 7∙2 centesimal degrees colder than on Carnarvon Quay; but the
                    difference between the density at that elevation, and its reciprocal, or between
                    ∙878 and-l∙139, being only ∙261, would require nearly 28 for the multiplier.</p>
                <p>In the early part of September, the same observer noticed the centesimal
                    thermometer to stand 10 degrees lower on the top of Ben Lawers than at Weem, the
                    relative density of the air at that height being ∙868. The difference from its
                    reciprocal is ∙284, which would hence require to be multiplied by 35 to give the
                    actual diminution of temperature.</p>
                <p>Again, Saussure found, on his visit to Mont Blanc, the air on its summit to be 31
                    centesimal degrees colder than at Geneva. The relative density was ∙592, which
                    being taken from its reciprocal 1∙689, leaves 1 ’ 097; consequently the
                    multiplier required is 28.</p>
                <p>This ingenious philosopher passed several days encamped on the Col du Géant,
                    where he found, from the mean of eighty-five observations, the temperature of
                    the air to be only 4° ∙54, or 20° ∙3 colder than at Geneva; but the relative
                    density of that elevated stratum and its reciprocal were ∙704 and 1∙420; the
                    difference of which, or •7,16, would require to be multiplied by 28⅛, to
                    indicate the diminished temperature.</p>
                <p>The observations made on the decreased temperature of the higher regions of the
                    atmosphere by the ascension of balloons, appear generally to indicate rather a
                    slow rate of diminution; but it should be recollected that those daring aerial
                    flights have seldom been performed except in the fine season of the year.
                    Besides, the car, the balloon, and its cordage, will not immediately acquire the
                    temperature of the elevated strata, but continue for a considerable time to
                    diffuse a sensible portion of heat. A memorable example, however, is entirely
                    conformable to the general principle. Charles, the first who ascended the
                    atmosphere by means of a balloon filled with hydrogen gas, found, on the 1st of
                    December 1783, the thermometer depressed II centesimal degrees at the greatest
                    elevation, the column of the barometer having sunk from 29∙24 to 20∙05 inches.
                    This would require a multiplier less than 20.</p>
                <p>In ascending through equal heights, the density of the atmosphere, as derived
                    from the incumbent pressure, di- <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> minishes in a
                    continued proportion. This density is hence' represented by the ordinates of a
                    logarithmic curve, of which the absciss denotes the altitude above the surface.
                    The cold which prevails in the upper strata would no doubt modify the dilatation
                    of the air; but since it follows nearly the same progression, it cannot
                    materially affect the general results. In the figure annexed, the vertical
                    spaces expressing the elevations of one, two, three, and four English miles, the
                    horizontal lines ID, 2F, 3H, 4K, represent the corresponding mean temperature in
                    the temperate, latitudes; but, from the nature of the logarithmic curve, if it
                    were supposed to be continued in like manner below the surface, the horizontal
                    lines at the same equal distances would be the reciprocals of the former. Let
                    this extension of the curve be, therefore, folded back, and placed over its
                    first portion, rising from 0A, and the difference between the horizontal lines,
                    or the distance between the two branches of the curve, as, from the point A,
                    they constantly spread from each other, will exhibit the diminution of
                    temperature corresponding to the elevation. These branches of the curve at first
                    diverge at the same angle; but the wider branch afterwards spreads with a larger
                    sweep, and their mutual distance slowly increases.</p>
                <p>The gradually increasing progression, which marks the diminution of temperature
                    in ascending the atmosphere, is still more apparent from another property of the
                    logarithmic curve. The difference between any two ordinates is constantly
                    proportional to the intercepted area. Consequently, the successive diminution of
                    temperature corresponding to the elevations of one, two, three, or four miles,
                    are expressed by the areas ABDC, CDFE, EFIIG, and GHKI. But, since the component
                    spaces 0C, IE, 2G, and 31, augment evidently faster than 0D, IF, 2H, and 3K,
                    diminish, the decrements of heat encountered in ascending the atmosphere must on
                    the whole increase. It is further evident, that if those spaces were reduced to
                    extremely narrow belts, they might be considered as proportional merely to their
                    several lengths; and hence the momentary decrements, or the rate of the
                    diminution of temperature at the heights of one, two, three, and four miles, are
                    expressed by the transverse lines CD, EF, GH, and IK. If a calculation be
                    instituted for the temperate climates, while the mean temperature at the level
                    of the sea decreases one centesimal degree during an ascent of 540 feet above
                    the surface, it suffers a similar diminution.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193356805" xml:id="kp-eb0706-6805-0754"/>
                <p>in 529 feet at the altitude of a mile; but at two, three, four, and five miles of
                    elevation, the same difference will obtain at the contracting intervals of 498,
                    454, 401, and 346 feet. Should Fahrenheit’s scale be preferred, those numbers
                    multiplied by five, and divided by nine, will give respectively 300, 295, 277,
                    252, 223, and 192, for the ascents due to a decrement of one degree at the
                    surface, and at the heights of one, two, three, four, and five miles.</p>
                <p>Hence the altitude of any place above the surface of the ocean may be nearly
                    ascertained from an observation of its mean temperature. In the milder climates
                    it will be sufficiently accurate, in moderate elevations, to reckon an ascent of
                    540 feet for each centesimal degree, or 100 yards for each degree on
                    Fahrenheit’s scale, of diminished temperature. Thus, the Black Spring, a copious
                    perennial source which bursts forth on the ridge of the Pentland Hills, in the
                    vicinity of Edinburgh, is found to indicate only 7*2 centesimal degrees, or 1°
                    ∙6 less than the medium due to that parallel. But 1° ∙6 multiplied by 540 gives
                    868 feet; which differs by a few feet only from the altitude as determined by
                    actual levelling.</p>
                <p>Again, we had ascertained the temperature of a plentiful and deep-seated spring
                    in the meadow below Schweitz, near the margin of the branching lake of the
                    Forest Cantons, to be only ten centesimal degrees, or 3⅛° lower than the
                    standard temperature of that latitude. This gives 3⅜ ×540, or 1890 feet, for the
                    elevation of the central valley of Switzerland above the level of the sea.</p>
                <p>As a final example, we may cite an observation made in Upper India by Dr Francis
                    Buchanan, who found a spring at Chitlong, in the Lesser Valley of Nepaul, to
                    indicate the temperature of 14*7 centesinal degrees; which is 8° *1 below that
                    of the standard of its parallel, or 27° 38'. Wherefore 8∙1 × 540, or 4374 feet,
                    is the elevation of that valley.</p>
                <p>When the altitude above the sea is very considerable, however, a multiplier
                    somewhat decreasing from 540 must be taken. But it is ‘easy .to show, that the
                    same result very nearly will be obtained by applying a small correction. If the
                    product of 540 into the diminution of temperature be again multiplied by the
                    square of this difference in centesimal degrees, and then clivided by the
                    constant number 15,000, the quotient will express the quantity to be subtracted.
                    Thus, in the last example, the square of 8∙1 or 65 ’ 61 multiplied into 4374
                    makes 286,978, and this divided again by 15,000 gives 18, to be deducted from
                    4374, leaving 4356 for the corrected altitude.</p>
                <p>This correction, therefore, amounts only to 33^ feet at the elevation of one
                    mile; but for two, three, four, and five miles, it would rise to 266, 904∣,
                    2128, and 3350 feet. Though it augments thus rapidly, it may in ordinary cases
                    be totally disregarded, and the allowance of one degree by Fahrenheit’s scale
                    for every hundred yards of ascent is a rule of most easy recollection.</p>
                <p>That the decrements of heat corresponding to equal ascents in the atmosphere are
                    not uniform, however, but augment gradually with an accelerating progression, is
                    confirmed by the appeal to actual observation. Thus, in proceeding from Geneva
                    to the vale of Chamounĩ, through an elevation of 2094 feet, Saussure found the
                    temperature of the air to decrease only 31 centesimal degrees, or at the rate of
                    one degree in the rise of 644 feet. Between Chamouni and the Col du Géant, an
                    interval of 7940 feet, the diminution of temperature was 17°, being a degree for
                    each 465 feet of ascent. Again, the summit of Mont Blanc, though only 4400 feet
                    higher than the Col du Géant, was 10° ∙8 colder, which gives a degree for every
                    rise of 407 feet. The acceleration of cold is here very perceptible; but the
                    gradation from Geneva to Chamouni was unusually slow, owing to the position of
                    this sequestered spot, where the action of the sun-beams in summer, being
                    sheltered from the influence of dispersing winds, accumulates above the
                    standard. Near the level of the sea, the ascent, corresponding to the decrement
                    of a centesimal degree, very seldom exceeds 600 feet.</p>
                <p>Since, in ascending from the surface, the temperature constantly diminishes,
                    there must in every latitude exist, a certain limit of elevation at which the
                    air will attain the] term of congelation. The mountains, likewise, which rearţ
                    their heads above that boundary, are covered with eter- <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> nal snow. In the higher regions of the atmosphere, especially within the
                    tropics, the temperature varies but little throughout the whole year. Hence, in
                    those brilliant climates, the line of perpetual congelation is strongly and
                    distinctly marked. But in countries remote from the equator the boundary of
                    frost rises after the heat of summer as the influence of winter prevails, thus
                    varying its position over a belt of some considerable breadth.</p>
                <p>The height of the limit of perpetual congelation for any latitude is easily
                    determined from the principles already established. Let <hi rend="italic">t</hi>
                    denote the mean temperature in centesimal degrees at the surface of the ocean,

                    From the density of the air thus found, the corresponding latitude is discovered
                    by the application of logarithms, as in the barometrical measurements. Hence the
                    following table is computed:</p>

                </table>
                <p>This table, though calculated from theoretical data, will be found to coincide
                    with actual observation. It suggests a variety of important results; and the
                    position of the snowy boundary may direct the intelligent traveller to estimate
                    the elevation of any country. Thus, Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in Scotland,
                    is generally seen covered with snow through the whole year, except during two or
                    three weeks in the month of Julj∙. Its summit, therefore, does not reach the
                    limit of congelation, which, at the latitude of 57°, has an altitude of 4534
                    feet. Accordingly, the height of that mountain is only 4380 feet. Again, we
                    learn from the relations of travellers, that, though perpetual snow covers the
                    stupendous ridge of the Himalaya Mountains in Upper India, it descends but a
                    short way along their sides, and leaves, for the <hi rend="italic">ghauts</hi>
                    or passages below, a grassy plain. But the boundary of congelation traverses the
                    parallel of 30° at the altitude of 11,484 feet, and consequently that towering
                    range may rise probably 4000 or 5000 feet higher, and thus surpass the elevation
                    of Mont Blanc. The pretended altitudes of 23,000 or even 27,000 feet, so
                    recently assigned to those mountains, are hence scarcely credible.</p>
                <p>The gradation of altitude which marks the snowy boundary in different latitudes
                    is most clearly perceived from the inspection of a diagram. Thus, if the
                    horizontal line represent the distance of the pole from the equator, divided
                    into 90°, and each vertical line corresponding to the latitude denote the height
                    of the limit of perpetual congelation in English miles, the extremities of these
                    perpendiculars being connected, will form a curve of contrary flexure, of which
                    the one half is nearly the reverse of the other. This curve, therefore, bends
                    slowly at first from the equator, most rapidly about the middle latitudes, but
                    again slants near the surface to the pole.</p>
                <p>The ordinates of this curve of congelation, or the altitudes of the limit of
                    eternal frost, might also be found, with sufficient precision, from the
                    corrected gradation of cold, if the primary multiplier were in each parallel of
                    latitude adapted to the mean temperature*. In the high latitudes the correction
                    to be applied is small, but it becomes very considerable within the tropics.
                    Thus, in the middle latitude of 45° it is only 110 feet; but under the equator
                    it amounts to 877 feet. But, except in this extreme case, the altitude of the
                    snowy boundary will on the whole differ very little from the product of the mean
                    temperature by 540. That line must, therefore, approximate to a coincidence with
                    the curve formed by referring the series of temperatures to the successive
                    latitudes. Let <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> the tangent 0 90 be applied equal
                    to the semicircumference 0 A 29 of a circle, and every intermediate point B be
                    determined, by making any parallel 10 AB equal to the intercepted arc A 29. If
                    the absciss then represent the meridian extending from the equator to the pole,
                    the several ordinates will express the corresponding mean temperatures at the
                    level of the sea. The reason of this construction is easily perceived; for the
                    arc 0 A of the generating circle being equal to the complement of the
                    corresponding latitude, its chord is equal to the cosine of this latitude, which
                    belongs to a circle having twice the diameter of the former; but the ordinate
                    from B, or the perpendicular segment 0 10, is proportional to the square of the
                    chord 0 A, and consequently to the square of the cosine of the latitude.</p>
                <p>The curve now constructed is what has been called the <hi rend="italic">Companion
                    of the Cycloid.</hi> In fact, it differs from the cycloid only by the defect of
                    the generating circle. If each parallel AB were extended as far beyond B as 10
                    A, the cycloid would be traced. This deficient cycloid has obviously the same
                    aspect as the curve of perpetual congelation. It is only less flattened towards
                    the equator, where the correction of altitude chiefly operates. A close
                    inspection, however, is requisite to distinguish their difference.</p>
                <p>The companion of the cycloid, or curve of temperatures, might also be formed, by
                    unrolling half the convex surface of a cylindrical wedge or <hi rend="italic"
                    >ungula.</hi> The curve already delineated was only the expansion of the annexed
                    figure. If the semicircumference of the base of the cylinder were divided into
                    90 equal parts, to denote the successive latitudes from the equator to the pole,
                    the perpendicular lines terminating in the oblique section would <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193356831" xml:id="kp-eb0706-6831-0756"/>express the corresponding
                    mean temperatures. These lines, again, might be easily measured by parallels of
                    temperature or arcs of circles, dividing the altitude of the wedge into
                    twenty-nine equal parts, and running parallel to the plane of its base. If the
                    whole wedge or ungula were taken, the combination of vertical lines and of
                    horizontal arcs would exhibit all the gradations of mean temperature in its
                    progress and subsequent decline from pole to pole. It is easy to perceive that,
                    on this plan, an elegant instrument could be constructed, equally calculated for
                    illustration and practical use.</p>
                <p>The curve of perpetual congelation must evidently rise higher during Abe tide of
                    summer, and again descend in the winter months, thus oscillating between certain
                    limits of elevation. The intervening belt is narrow under the equator; but it
                    enlarges to a very considerable extent in the high ’.er latitudes. On the
                    breadth of this zone, where frost holds a doubtful reign, depends the formation
                    of <hi rend="italic">glaciers</hi> along the flanks of the snowy mountains. The
                    fields of snow which are alternately melted and congealed, become at last
                    changed by this process into solid ice, often grouped and fashioned by such
                    irregular action into the most fantastic shapes. In its native seat, this icy
                    belt acquires continual additions to its height, till the accumulating pressure
                    at last tears the mass from its base, and precipitates its dissevered fragments
                    to a lower level. In its new position, below the inferior boundary of
                    congelation, the enormous pile suffers, on the whole, a very gradual thaw, which
                    is sometimes protracted for several centuries. Meanwhile, in the higher
                    magazine, another icy belt is again slowly collecting, which will in due time
                    repeat the succession, and maintain the eternal circle of production and
                    decay.</p>
                <p>Within the tropics, the zone of undecided frost is so very narrow, that scarcely
                    any trace of a glacier has been ever observed. But as that zone enlarges in the
                    higher latitudes, the appearance of vast glaciers constitutes a very striking
                    feature in the aspect of the lofty mountains. They occur frequently along the
                    sides of the Pyrenees, but they are still more conspicuous in the recesses of
                    the central chain of the Swiss Alps. Glaciers are likewise seen as far north as
                    the verge of the arctic circle. Along the western shore of Norway and the coast
                    of Lapland, stretching onwards to the promontory of the North Cape, huge masses
                    of columnar ice descend from the cliffs, or against the precipitous sides of the
                    mountains, almost to the surface of the ocean.</p>
                <p>Through the whole train of investigation now pursued, the warmth which vivifies
                    our globe has been viewed as flowing from the fountain of the sun. The easiest
                    mode of conceiving the subject, is to consider the heat which permeates all
                    bodies, and unites with them in various proportions, as merely the subtle fluid
                    of light in a state of combination. When forcibly discharged or suddenly
                    elicited from any substance, it again resumes its radiant splendour. Such
                    changes are exhibited in the phenomena of electricity, and in many of the
                    operations of chemistry. But the production of light is not less striking in the
                    ordinary business of life. The glowing spark struck from flint, and the
                    consuming fire, which even the rudest tribes had learned to excite, by the rapid
                    friction of two pieces of dry wood, were by the ancient philosophers regarded as
                    only detached portions of the divine and celestial flame which illumines the
                    empyreal vault. The same notion was embraced by the poets, and gives sublimity
                    to their finest odes. <hi rend="smallcaps">Heaăoenly Light, Invisible

                    the mystic hymn of Orpheus.</p>
                <p>Those poetical images which have descended to our own times, were hence founded
                    on a close observation of nature. Modern philosophy need not disdain to adopt
                    them, and has only to expand and reduce to precision the original conceptions.
                    If any body be exposed to the sun’s incident rays, it will experience a rise of
                    temperature exactly proportioned to the quantity of light intercepted or
                    absorbed. When those rays are either concentrated or attenuated, the effect
                    produced by their detention is proportionally augmented or diminished. The
                    calorific action is occasioned solely by that portion of the light which remains
                    united to the opposing substance. The rays which are either transmitted or
                    reflected, leave no trace of their energy. Neither a very bright reflecting
                    surface, nor a fine pellucid medium, is sensibly heated on being exposed even to
                    a meridian sun. But since reflection and transmission cannot be perfect, a
                    certain calorific effect, however small, and varied by circumstances, is always
                    the result. A polished surface of silver may absorb from the tenth to the fifth
                    part of the perpendicular rays; and we have seen that the thin body of
                    atmosphere itself will detain one fourth part of the vertical light shot down
                    through it, and one half of the beams that slant at an inclination of 25°. The
                    absorption of light in its passage through water is proportionally greater; the
                    perpendicular rays lose half their force by a descent of seventeen feet in that
                    medium; and become reduced to one fourth by traversing a path of thirty-four
                    feet, which corresponds to the mass of an atmosphere. It hence follows, that
                    only the hundred thousandth part of the vertical rays can penetrate below
                    forty-seven fathoms. But this faint remnant is scarcely equal to the glimmer of
                    the closing twilight. The depths of the ocean are never visited, therefore, by
                    the cheering influence of the great luminary of day.</p>
                <p>The rise of temperature produced by the same measure of the absorption of light,
                    is in different substances inversely as their capacity or attraction for heat.
                    Thus, if two very thin glass balls of the same diameter, and coated with China
                    ink, be filled, the one with water and the other with mercury., and exposed to
                    the sun, the latter will mark an accession of five degrees of heat, while the
                    former will indicate only two. Or, if two equal and similar pieces of glass and
                    lead were both of them blackened and presented to the incident solar rays, the
                    lead will acquire a higher temperature than the glass, in the ratio of twelve to
                    seven.</p>
                <p>This theory agrees, therefore, in all its bearings, exactly with observation. But
                    facts have been alleged of a contrary tendency; and some ingenious yet incorrect
                    experiments, performed by a celebrated astronomer, appear to have, for several
                    years, deceived the public into a belief, that, besides the ordinary mixture of
                    coloured rays emanating from the sun, there is emitted also a cluster of
                    invisible and less refrangible rays, which excite or constitute heat.</p>
                <p>And as if such an hypothesis were not already sufficiently complex, it was
                    afterwards assumed, that there exists likewise another series of dark rays, more
                    refrangible than usual, whose office it is merely to abstract oxygen from the
                    substances on which they fall. But a closer examination of the circumstances has
                    proved, that, in forming these opinions, philosophers have proceeded to
                    generalise too fast. If, while the sky is perfectly clear, which seldom happens
                    indeed iií this climate, the solar spectrum formed behind a prism be observed by
                    a differential thermometer in a darkened room, the intensity of the heat will be
                    found to augment most rapidly in passing from the one extremity to the other,
                    from the limit of the violet to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193356844"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-6844-0757"/>that of the red. When a prism of flint-glass was
                    used, we found that the spectrum being divided into four equal spaces, the
                    effects indicated by the thermometer, and corresponding to the range of the
                    violet, the green, the yellow, and the red, were as the square numbers 1, 4, 8,
                    and 16. If the spectrum were formed by another refracting medium, as the
                    intermediate coloured spaces would alter their proportions, so likewise would
                    the calorific action vary. But, in every case, the violet and the red rays which
                    occupy the extremes must differ very widely in their relative energies. Without
                    the spectrum, however, and beyond the absolute limit of illumination, no sort
                    of; action whatever is betrayed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It may be worth while to state here a very simple yet
                    decisive experiment, which we have repeated more than once. If a circle of black
                    paper ten inches in diameter be pasted over the middle of a burning-glass of the
                    diameter of one foot, it will leave around the margin of the lens a sort of
                    circular prism, which bends the coloured rays into a hollow double cone, whose
                    intermediate apex occupies the focus. On directing the lens, thus partly shaded,
                    to a bright sun, in a clear sky, a card held perpendicular to the beam, and
                    drawn either forwards or backwards from the focus, will exhibit a narrow
                    coloured ring, opening with intense brilliancy. Between the focus and the lens,
                    the red rays will mark the outer edge of the vivid ring; but beyond that limit
                    they will cross over and tint the inside. In either case, it was easy to mark
                    their extreme boundary. To examine the graduating calorific action of this
                    condensed spectrum, a broad and flat piece of black sealing wax, having the
                    gloss removed from its surface by a file, and a thin slip of white paper laid
                    across it, was then held in the cone of light, two or three inches before the
                    focus; and in the space of a few seconds a very narrow ring, shading inwards,
                    however, was distinctly impressed in the wax, the roughened surface being melted
                    and left hollow and gkissy at the exact limit of the red on the outside, and
                    smoothing slightly away on the inside. Beyond the apex of the double cone of
                    light, a similar glazed narrow ring was imprinted, softening from the inside. In
                    both cases, the circular impression on the wax corresponded exactly with the
                    trace of the red rays,—an interval of the fiftieth part of an inch being easily
                    distinguishable.</p></note> The distinct effects produced by the extreme
                    coloured spaces may possibly depend on the peculiar qualities of the several
                    rays, but perhaps proceed from the character of the diluted or concentrated
                    energy which they display. The violet or blue rays will probably hasten the
                    process of darkening a solution of the nitrate of silver; yet have we found that
                    white light, attenuated to a certain degree, has likewise a power to accelerate
                    thi s change. It is probable that the collected beams only retard the effect, by
                    exciting heat, which may dispose the oxygen to adhere more strongly to its
                    substratum. In like manner, the intense action of the red rays on the bulb of a
                    thermometer, may proceed more from their condensation, than from some exclusive
                    quality which they possess. What the nature is of that peculiar constitution
                    which fits a ray of light to excite in the organ of vision any peculiar
                    sensation of colour, it seems impossible to decide. Perhaps the whole
                    distinction consists in the difference of the celerity with which it moves. The
                    peculiar energy of any coloured pencil of light may depend chiefly, if not
                    entirely, on its density. From the violet to the red, the successive tints of
                    the spectrum rise with augmented force. The blue rays appear feeble, the green
                    cause a milder impression, the yellow and the orange begin to glow with
                    intensity, and the red dazzle the eye. The language of painters, being grounded
                    on nice observation, marks appositely the gradation of strength. Blue is by them
                    termed a cold colour, green a soft colour, yellow a rich colour, and red a warm
                    colour.</p>
                <p>For measuring the intensity, or at least the calorific action of light, no
                    instrument is so finely adapted, by its peculiar delicacy, as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Photometers</hi> which consists of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Differential Thermometer</hi> inclosed in a thin pellucid case, and having one
                    ball made of black and the other of clear glass. It will besides admit of some
                    variety in its form and construction, and maybe rendered on the whole very
                    commodious and portable. Yet, owing to a combination of circumstances, this
                    elegant instrument has only been partially and reluctantly admitted; and the
                    philosophic world has still to discharge an act of justice, by receiving it into
                    the favour and distinction which it so well deserves. Some, indeed, affecting to
                    display superior sagacity, have taken the trouble to remark that it was only a
                    species of thermometer, and not strictly a photometer, since it measures heat
                    and not light. But what does the thermometer itself indicate, except <hi
                    rend="italic">expansion</hi><hi rend="italic">?</hi> As heat is measured by the
                    expansion it occasions, so light is determined by the intensity of the heat
                    which, in every supposition, invariably accompanies it. WTiat other mode, after
                    all, could be imagined for detecting the presence of light? How can an unknown
                    quantity be expounded, but in terms of one already known?</p>
                <p>The photometer is adapted for a variety of important; meteorological researches.
                    If such instruments, in the <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> hands of skilful
                    observers, had been dispersed to the re- <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> mote
                    regions of the globe, we should ere now have obtained a body of precise facts,
                    highly instructive in themselves, and calculated to illustrate the nature of
                    different climates. Meanwhile, we shall endeavour to state the general
                    consequences which may be drawn from even a scanty range of photometrical
                    observations.</p>
                <p>The direct and absolute action of the sun’s rays on the photometer, at the
                    elevation of 30°, may be reckoned in this climate at 120 millesimal degrees. The
                    effect is produced by the incidence of a pencil of light, which has for its base
                    a circle of the same diameter as the black ball, but modified and regulated in
                    its amount by the subsequent dispersion of the accumulated heat from the whole
                    surface of the sphere, which is four times greater than that of the generating
                    circle. If a thin disc were, therefore, substituted instead of the ball, and
                    presented to the perpendicular rays of the sun, the impression would be doubled,
                    or raised to 240°; or, if the emission of heat from the posterior surface of the
                    disc were prevented, the calorific effect would amount by this accumulation to
                    480°, or 86 degrees on Fahrenheit’s scale. Such is the rise of temperature which
                    a dark surface of dry mould, sloping at an angle of 30°, yet exactly fronting
                    the sun, might acquire under a diaphanous shell of glass, if scarcely any
                    portion of the heat were supposed to be conducted downwards into the mass of the
                    earth. But since the rays of light which traverse the atmosphere under an
                    obliquity of 30° have, in comparison with perpendicular beams, their force
                    diminished in the ratio of 750 to 563; the action of a vertical sun, through a
                    thin capsule of glass, might heat up a dark horizontal surface 113° by
                    Fahrenheit’s scale. On removing the glass cover, this effect, in a calm still
                    air, would be reduced about two thirds, or to 75^- <hi rend="superscript">
                    o</hi>.</p>
                <p>The colour of the ground or substratum has very little influence in modifying the
                    calorific action of the solar beams. The different shades of brown or gray have
                    almost the same absorbent quality as black itself; yellow and orange begin to
                    cause a partial reflection; but a surface even of pure chalk will not reflect
                    perhaps the fifth part of the incident light. Hence the arid sands of Africa are
                    often heated by a vertical sun to near the point of boiling water, insomuch as
                    to scorch the feet of the wretched traveller, and to accumulate warmth
                    sufficient for the slow roasting of an egg. Even within the arctic circle, the
                    calorific action of a bright sun, in the height of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193356857" xml:id="kp-eb0706-6857-0758"/>summer, may exceed 49°. In
                    those dreary regions, accordingly, amidst a dissolving world of ice, the pitch
                    is yet sometimes softened or melted in the seams of the sides or the decks of
                    ships.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that the accumulated effect of the incident rays must increase in
                    proportion as the conducting power of the medium is diminished. Hence at an
                    elevation of three miles and a half, where the density of the atmosphere is
                    reduced to one half, the heat communicated would, on this account alone, augment
                    from 75L to 83 degrees. But the effect would be further increased, from the
                    smaller absorption of heat in its passage to the surface. Under the equator, the
                    whole accumulated action would, therefore, amount to 96 degrees. All travellers,
                    accordingly, complain of the scorching rays which the sun darts from a dark
                    azure sky on the summits of lofty mountains. Yet the contrast is more striking
                    in the higher latitudes. Thus, in the middle parallel of 45°, the action of the
                    sun at the summer solstice would excite a heat of 69° at the level of the sea,
                    and of 90° at an elevation of three miles and a half; but at the winter solstice
                    it would communicate only 17° below and 46° at the altitude assumed. Saussure
                    was accordingly very much struck with the force and brilliancy of the sun-beams
                    on the top of Mont Blanc.</p>
                <p>It might easily be computed that, on the supposition of a perfect calm, the
                    surface of the earth, under the equator, will, at the medium of a year, have its
                    temperature raised 12°; and that, in the latitude of 45°, the mean annual
                    impression would be only 5°. But, of the whole of the light received, the
                    calorific action on a black mould, whether emitted from the sun or shed
                    indirectly by the sky, maybe deduced from the indication of the photometer. It
                    is only required to diminish the power of the sun’s rays in the ratio of the
                    sine of their obliquity, and to reduce the action of the light reflected from
                    the canopy of clouds to one half, or what is due to the medium inclination of
                    30°, then to multiply the sum of these quantities by eight, and divide by three,
                    or to take two thirds of the quadrupled effect. Thus, suppose, while the sun’s
                    altitude is 40°, that the photometer marks 155°, which it very seldom ever
                    reaches in this climate, and that it indicates only 20° if merely screened from
                    the direct action of the sun. Now, 155° multiplied by the sine of 40°, makes 87°
                    ∙8, which is augmented to 97° ∙8 by the addition of the half of 20°; and this
                    number again being increased in the ratio of 3 to 8, gives finally 261
                    millesimal degrees, or 47° on Fahrenheit’s scale. When the sun is obscured in
                    clouds, the reflected light, from a dappled sky, will sometimes in summer affect
                    the photometer to the extent of 50°. This corresponds to a heat of 16° of
                    Fahrenheit communicated to the ground. During the fine season the photometer
                    seldom in cloudy weather indicates less than 15°, which is equivalent to an
                    impression of 6° on the embrowned surface of the earth. While the sun is
                    enveloped in clouds, if the rest of the sky assumes a fine azure hue, the
                    photometer will only mark 10°. But in the gloomy days of winter, the minute
                    portion of light which pierces through the congregated mass of clouds will
                    scarcely affect the photometer 5°, or excite a heat of 2° by Fahrenheit on the
                    ground.</p>
                <p>These augments of temperature are communicated to the ground unimpaired, only in
                    the case, however, of a perfect calm. The agitation of the atmosphere will
                    scatter the heat before it has accumulated. When the wind creeps along the
                    surface of the earth at the rate of eight miles in the hour, it diminishes the
                    calorific action of the light from the sun and from the sky one half; but if it
                    sweeps with a velocity of 16, 24, or 32 miles in the hour, it will reduce the
                    whole effect successively to the third, the fourth, or the fifth of its
                    standard. The impression made on the ground seldom, therefore, exceeds the third
                    part of the computed measure, and often will not amount to one fifth.</p>
                <p>The simplest and most accurate method of examining the temperature acquired
                    during the day on the surface of the earth, is to employ a differential
                    thermometer of the pendant kind, about one or two feet in length, and having its
                    lower ball surmounted by a small cylindrical cavity supporting the coloured
                    liquor. This instrument being suspended or held in a vertical position, the
                    lower ball resting on the ground, will evidently mark, by its movable column,
                    the difference between the temperature of the surface and that of the ambient
                    air. In this way, we have found, during the summer months in this climate, that
                    the ground was, by Fahrenheit’s scale, generally two or three degrees warmer
                    than the air near it in cloudy weather, and perhaps ten or fifteen degrees
                    warmer when the sun shone powerfully upon it. But, under similar circumstances,
                    the effect varies very considerably, according to the nature of the surface.
                    While fresh ploughed land, for instance, indicates an increased temperature of
                    perhaps 8°, a grass plot close beside it will scarcely show a difference of 3°.
                    Nor is this distinction owing to any greater absorption of light by the black
                    mould; the reflection from the surface, in both cases, being extremely small. A
                    thin layer of hay, whether spread on the naked soil or on the green turf, will
                    betray the same diminished effect. The fibres of the grass exposing a multiplied
                    surface to the cuntact of the air, the greater portion of the heat is hence
                    dissipated before accumulation. A corresponding effect has been remarked with
                    respect to the impressions of cold. Thus, in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh,
                    after a long tract of rigorous weather, the frost was found to have penetrated
                    thirteen inches into the ground in a ploughed field, but only eight inches in
                    one piece of pasture ground, and four inches in another. But, in some of the
                    streets of that city, the frost had descended even below two feet, so as to
                    begin to affect the water-pipes. The greater density and solidity of the
                    pavement had no doubt conducted the frigorifie impressions more copiously
                    downwards, while the loose and spongy blades of grass had mostly scattered and
                    wasted those impressions in the open field. This consideration, it is obvious,
                    might lead to very important practical results.</p>
                <p>The unequal action of light at the surface of the earth, whether produced by the
                    various obliquity of the sun’s rays, the different inclination of the horizon,
                    or the alternating succession of day and night, is attempered, we have seen, by
                    the actual flow of the heated portions of the atmosphere. Between the poles and
                    the equator, a perpetual circulation of air is maintained, which confines the
                    accumulating effects of heat within narrow limits. The prevalence, on the whole,
                    of northerly winds in this hemisphere during summer, and of southerly winds in
                    winter, tends likewise to mitigate the extreme impressions of hot and cold. But
                    a current of warm air excited at first by the presence of the sun, continues to
                    rise from the ground, and occasions the descent, therefore, of an opposite
                    current of cold air, which, as the equilibrium of temperature is not soon
                    restored, may be protracted through a great part of the night. The combined
                    influence of these currents is hence continually exerted in cooling down the
                    surface of the earth; but their activity being the greatest while the solar
                    beams fall most copiously, the accumulation of heat is checked in little more
                    than an hour after mid-day, while its further dissipation is prolonged through
                    the whole of the night, sun-rise being generally the moment when the ground is
                    coldest.</p>
                <p>Such a concatenated system of aerial currents might <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193356870" xml:id="kp-eb0706-6870-0759"/>hence appear sufficient to
                    explain the gradation and general balance of temperature which prevails on the
                    surface of our globe. An horizontal stream of air must evidently -cause the flow
                    of an opposite one, since the action must be the same on every part of the same
                    parallel of latitude. The difference of the temperature of the surface from that
                    of the ambient air will maintain the constant play of an ascehding and a
                    descending current. In clear and calm weather, this interchange between the
                    higher and lower strata of the atmosphere will be the most vigorous, owing then
                    to the concentrated impression of the sun-beams. The perpetual commerce
                    maintained in our atmosphere by the medium of these combined horizontal and
                    vertical currents, forms no doubt an essential part of the system which
                    attempers the constitution of this globe. But it is not the only mode by which
                    nature seeks to preserve the harmony of her productions; and recent discovery
                    has detected the existence of another auxiliary principle, extremely active, of
                    most rapid and extensive influence, and continually at vγork, though subject to
                    various modifications. To understand rightly, however, the operation of this
                    principle, it will be necessary to recal the chief facts which have been
                    disclosed relative to the propagation of heat.</p>
                <p>It is well known, that, though partial causes may disturb the equilibrium of
                    temperature among bodies, there is a constant tendency to restore it again. Yet
                    heat still remains in the state of combination, without ever assuming a distinct
                    form. Its balance is, therefore, maintained by a very different process from
                    that which establishes the equilibrium between the several communicating parts
                    of a liquid. The substratum of heat is not passive, nor do the calorific
                    particles themselves merely flow from their redundance towards another situation
                    where they happen to be 1leficient. But since the presence of heat is invariably
                    accompanied by corpuscular distention, that portion of the substance which loses
                    it must successively contract, while the portion which gains it will in the same
                    degree expand. The actual transfer of heat through any mass will hence give
                    occasion to a connected series of minute internal contractions and expansions.
                    To consider the subject more fully, we shall suppose the conducting substance to
                    be, 1. a solid; 2. a liquid; and, 3. a gaseous fluid.</p>
                <p>1. When the surplus beat is conducted through a solid substance, a sort of
                    alternating vermicular motion is excited along the whole train of communication.
                    Ifheatwere left to the energy of its own repulsion, it would, like light, dart
                    with a speed almost instantaneous. But the time consumed by those interior
                    oscillatory movements retards immensely the rate of transmission. The quickness
                    of the oscillations themselves depends on the elasticity of the conducting
                    substance; but their energy and extent are proportioned to the extreme
                    difference of temperature, and the shortness of the tract, modified essentially
                    by the peculiar nature of the conducting substance. In equal circumstances,
                    glass transmits heat faster than wood, and metal faster than glass. But, even in
                    the same class of conductors, the effects are very different; thus, box delivers
                    the impressions of heat more quickly than cork, and silver conveys them with
                    greater rapidity than platinum.</p>
                <p>2. When the conducting substance is a liquid. The ordinary transmission of heat
                    through a solid is now greatly augmented, from the diffusion occasioned by the
                    mobility of the affected portions of the medium. Below the freezing point, ice
                    will conduct heat through its substance; but after it has melted into water, a
                    new and powerful agency is brought into play. The liquid particles, as they
                    become successively warmer, acquire a corresponding expansion, and, therefore,
                    rise upwards and spread through the mass, <hi rend="italic">carrying</hi> with
                    them and dispersing the heat which they have received. This diffuse buoyancy
                    will depend evidently on the dilateable quality of the liquid. It is greater in
                    alcohol than in water, and in water than in mercury; it is even more active in
                    hot than in cold water. Near the point of congelation, indeed, the joint
                    conducting power of water is scarcely superior to that of mere ice. The actual
                    flow of a liquid, by whatever cause it is produced, must evidently accelerate
                    the dissipation of heat.</p>
                <p>3. When the medium of transmission is a gaseous substance, the heat is partly
                    still conducted through the substance of the communicating mass, as if this were
                    solid, and partly transferred by the streaming of the corpuscles, which come to
                    be successively affected. But a new principle seems here to combine its
                    influence, and the rate of dispersion in aeriform media is found to depend
                    chiefly on the nature of the mere heated surface. From a metallic surface the
                    heat is feebly emitted; but from a surface of glass, or still better, from one
                    of paper, it is discharged with profusion. If two equal hollow balls of thin
                    bright silver, one of them entirely uncovered, and the other closely enveloped
                    in a coat of cambric, be filled with water slightly warmed, and then suspended
                    in a close room, the former will only lose 11 parts of heat in the same time
                    that the latter will dissipate 20 parts. Of this expenditure 10 parts from each
                    of the balls is communicated in the ordinary way, by the slow recession of the
                    proximate particles of air as they come to be successively heated. The rest of
                    the heat, consisting of 1 part from the naked metallic surface, and of 10 from
                    the cased surface, is propagated through the same medium, but with a certain
                    diffusive rapidity, which in a moment shoots its influence to a distance, after
                    a mode altogether peculiar to the gaseous fluids.</p>
                <p>But those effects are modified by the different proximity of the air to the
                    metallic surface. If the silver ball be covered with the thinnest film of
                    gold-beater’s skin, which exceeds not the 3000th part of an inch in thickness,
                    the power of dispersion will be augmented from 1 to 7; if another pellicle be
                    added, there will be a farther increase of this power, from 7 to 9; and so
                    repeatedly growing, till after the application of five coats, when the repellent
                    energy will reach its extreme limit, or the measure of 10.</p>
                <p>The approximation of the metallic substratum thus evidently diminishes the power
                    of the external pellicle in darting heat. No absolute contact exists in nature;
                    but air must approach to a boundary of pellicle, or cambric, much nearer than to
                    a surface of metal, from which it is always divided by an interval of more than
                    the 500th part of an inch. A vitreous surface has very nearly the same property
                    as one of cambric or paper; from its closer proximity to the recipient medium,
                    it imparts its heat more copiously and energetically than a surface of metal in
                    the same condition.</p>
                <p>By what process the several portions of heat thus delivered to the atmosphere
                    shoot through the fluid mass, it seems more difficult to conceive. They are not
                    transported by the streaming of the heated air, for they suffer no derangement
                    from the most violent agitation of their medium. The air must, therefore,
                    without changing its place, disseminate the impressions it receives of heat, by
                    a sort of undulatory commotion, or a series of alternating pulsations, like
                    those by which it transmits the impulse of sound. The portion of air next the
                    hot surface, suddenly acquiring heat from its vicinity, expands proportionally,
                    and begins the chain of pulsations. In again contracting, this aerial shell
                    surrenders its surplus heat to the one immediately before it, now in the act of
                    expansion; and thus the tide of heat rolls onwards, and spreads itself on all
                    sides.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193356883" xml:id="kp-eb0706-6883-0760"/>
                <p>But these pulsations are not propagated with equal intensity in all directions.
                    They are most powerful in the perpendicular to the projecting surface, and
                    diminish as they deviate from that axis in the ratio of the sine of the angle of
                    obliquity.</p>
                <p>Nor are the vibratory impressions strictly darted in radiating lines, but each
                    successive pulse, as in the case of sound, presses to gain an equal diffusion.
                    Different obstructions may hence cause the undulations of heat to deflect
                    considerably from their course. Thus, if a cornucopia, formed of pasteboard,
                    present its wide mouth to a fire, a strong heat will, in spite of the gradual
                    inflection of the tube, be concentrated at its narrow end; in the same way,
                    probably, as waves flowing from an open bay into a narrow harbour, now
                    contracted and bent aside, yet without being reflected, rise into furious
                    billows.</p>
                <p>But the same pulsatory system will enable the atmosphere to transmit likewise the
                    impressions of cold. The shell of air adjacent to a frigid surface, becoming
                    suddenly chilled, suffers a corresponding contraction, which must excite a
                    concatenated train of pulsations. This contraction is followed by an immediate
                    expansion, which withdraws a portion of heat from the next succeeding shell,
                    itself now in the act of contracting; and the tide of apparent cold, or rather
                    of deficient heat, shoots forwards with diffusive sweep.</p>
                <p>That quality which enables a surface to propel the hot or cold pulses, likewise
                    fits it under circumstances to receive their impressions. If a vitreous or
                    varnished surface emits heat most copiously, it will also, when opposed to the
                    tide, arrest with entire efficacy the affluent wave; and if, on the other hand,
                    a surface of metal sparingly parts with its own heat, it detains only a small
                    share of each warm appulse, and reflects all the rest.</p>
                <p>Hence the construction of the <hi rend="italic">Pyroscope,</hi> a delicate and
                    valuable instrument, adapted to measure the warm pulses of air, or the intensity
                    of the heat that darts continually from a fire into a room, which has been
                    vaguely and inaccurately termed <hi rend="italic">radiant heat.</hi> It is in
                    fact only a modification of the <hi rend="italic">differential thermometer,</hi>
                    one of the balls being completely gilt with a thick gold or silver leaf. The <hi
                    rend="italic">pyroscope</hi> being placed at some distance from the fire, the
                    hot pulses are mostly thrown back from the bright metallie surface; but on the
                    naked glass ball they produce their full impression; and the same instrument
                    will serve equally to indicate the pulsations excited from a cold surface. Thus,
                    in a warm apartment, the pyroscope placed before a mass of snow, a block of ice,
                    or even a pitcher of water from the fountain, will quickly intimate the chilling
                    impressions propagated through the ambient medium. Nor has the brightness of the
                    fire or the glare of the snow any sensible influence to affect the result; for,
                    of the small portion of light transmitted, what falls on the diaphanous ball
                    passes almost without obstruction, and what strikes the gilt ball, especially if
                    this be covered with silver leaf, is nearly all reflected.</p>
                <p>But the pyroscope, in its simple form, is scarcely calculated for making nice
                    observations, when exposed out of doors to the agitation of winds and the
                    effulgence of light. A greater share of this light will generally be detained by
                    the gilt surface than what is absorbed in its passage through the diaphanous
                    ball. On the other hand, all the effects on the instrument will be diminished by
                    the rapidity of the circulation of the air.</p>
                <p>The application of the pyroscope incontestibly shows, that no pulsation, whether
                    calorific or frigorifie, ever takes place, except from a conterminous surface,
                    which is either hotter or colder than the surrounding gaseous medium. If the
                    general equilibrium of temperature be interrupted, such aerial pulses will
                    arise, whether the boundary of excitation be solid or liquid. They are produced
                    feebly from a surface of metal, though evidently stronger from mercury than from
                    silver; but they are projected with most energy from a surface of glass, and
                    still more powerfully from one of varnish, of paper, of ice, and of water.</p>
                <p>But since those hot or cold pulses are darted from such various surfaces, and
                    since the softness of the external coat, and its tendency to fluidity, seem
                    vastly to augment' their power; may they not likewise be excited from a boundary
                    of air itself? This extension of a great principle in the economy of nature has
                    never yet been surmised; nor can it be readily brought to the test of direct
                    experiment. A body of air, whether hotter or colder than the general medium, it
                    is evident, could not remain for a moment in the same detached situation, but
                    would continuo to rise or to fall. In a confined place, however, a stratum of
                    warm air may float incumbent over a mass of colder fluid. The difference of
                    temperature between the conterminous surfaces would no doubt be constantly
                    diminishing, from the slow intermixture and subsequent diffusion of the adjacent
                    portions of the air. This tendency to an equilibrium might be counteracted, by
                    causing either a constant stream of warm air to enter by the edges of the
                    ceiling of the apartment, or one of cold air to flow from the side of the floor.
                    Sueh would be the most favourable arrangement for performing the experiment.
                    Both the ceiling and the floor would obviously soon acquire the same temperature
                    as the current spreading over them, and could therefore exert no influence
                    whatever in projecting the aerial pulses. If under such circumstances those
                    pulses be hence found to exist, they must necessarily proceed from the action
                    excited at the bounding surface which divides the warm from the cold stratum of
                    air.</p>
                <p>But an arrangement, less perfect indeed, yet sufficient for ascertaining the main
                    fact, is entirely within our reach. In a close apartment, where a good fire is
                    constantly kept up, the ceiling and the floor may be discovered by the pendant
                    differential thermometer to have exactly the same temperature with its adjacent
                    stratum. Yet the upper portions of the confined air of the room will be found
                    several degrees warmer than the lower. Instead of being divided only into
                    opposite ranges, the whole mass from the floor to the ceiling will, in
                    consequence of the expansion and buoyancy of its heated particles, form a series
                    of intermediate strata, not distinguished however by any very precise
                    boundaries. But the intensity of action being proportional to the difference of
                    temperature, the effect on the pyroscope must evidently be the same, whether it
                    is produced by a single set of large pulses or by several sets of smaller ones.
                    If, instead of one bounding surface, for example, above which the air is six
                    degrees warmer than immediately below it, we suppose six such boundaries, each
                    having an excess of temperature of only one degree, the pulses excited at the
                    first of these intermediate surfaces, and successively augmented as they reach
                    the second, third, and fourth, &amp;c. surfaces, will at last acquire the same
                    energy as if the aggregate difference of six degrees had been all exerted at
                    once. Thus, the under surface of the stratum F darts pulses downwards, which
                    being augmented in succession at the under surfaces of the strata E, D, C, B,
                    and A, may have finally the same intensity as if they had originated from the
                    apposition of the extreme strata Fand <pb break="no" facs="nls:193356896"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-6896-0761"/>A. Accordingly, having planted a large screen
                    immediately before the fire, if a delicate pyroscope be placed about the middle
                    of the room, and a broad circular piece of metal suspended a few inches above
                    it; on withdrawing this canopy after some time, the instrument will indicate a
                    small impression of heat, seldom exceeding, however, one degree. But the effect
                    may be rendered more sensible by a moderate concentration of the power excited.
                    Suppose a hemispherical shell of thin brass, or even planished tin, having a
                    diameter about four times greater, adapted under the naked or sentient ball of
                    the pyroscope, which might occupy by its surface the place of the diffuse focus,
                    or the middle space between the centre and the bottom of the cup. Thus mounted,
                    the instrument will now in the same situation mark a very sensible calorifie
                    impression, amounting, at least in ordinary eases, to three or four degrees. Hot
                    pulses are, therefore, actually shot downwards from all the upper strata of the
                    confined air of a room in which a fire is kept steadily burning.</p>
                <p>The experiment can likewise be reversed. Let an inverted pyroscope, composed of a
                    pendant differential thermometer, have its sentient ball fitted with a small
                    hemispherical cup which is turned downwards. This instrument being set on the
                    floor, will remain at zero; but if lifted only a few feet, it will indicate a
                    visible impression of cold received from below, which will increase to three or
                    four degrees when the pyroscope is suspended near the top of the room.
                    Wherefore, the upper surfaces of the successive decumbent strata, being
                    comparatively colder, send upwards a series of chilling pulsations. Each of the
                    conterminous boundaries appears thus to perform a double operation, shooting
                    downwards impressions of heat, and darting upwards equal impressions of cold.
                    Such a mutual exchange of influence must evidently tend to accelerate that
                    progress to an equilibrium which the gradual intermixture of the different
                    strata, if left quite undisturbed, would in time produce. The air of a close
                    apartment exposed to the action of a steady fire is hence kept agitated through
                    its whole mass by a series of opposite tremors, which continually disperse in
                    all directions the irregularities of temperature.</p>
                <p>If the action of the pulses excited in the air of a small room be made thus
                    apparent, how much more striking should we expect to find the effect produced by
                    the mingled tide of commotion collected in free space from the vast body of the
                    atmosphere itself? Taking even the lowest range of strata, to the height perhaps
                    of two miles, including scarcely one third part of the whole aerial mass, the
                    difference of temperature between its extreme boundary will amount to twenty
                    centesimal degrees, or 36 on Fahrenheit’s scale. The order of the series,
                    however, is exactly the reverse of what takes place in a close room, the air of
                    the superior regions being invariably colder than at the surface of the earth.
                    Accordingly, the simple pyroscope, exposed in calm weather to a clear and open
                    sky, will at all times, if not disturbed by the influence of a strong light,
                    indicate large impressions of cold, amounting to five, or perhaps even ten
                    degrees. In most cases it may be sufficient to screen this instrument from the
                    direct action of the sun’s rays. But the action of light will be almost
                    neutralized, by opposing a diaphanous ball to one gilt with silver, or
                    contrasting a ball of the different shades of green or blue to another coated
                    with pure gold leaf. But to procure consistent results, it is still more
                    necessary to guard against the deranging influence of winds.</p>
                <p>• All these requisites are attained by adapting the pyroscope to the cavity of a
                    polished metallie cup, of rather an oblong spheroidal shape, the axis, having a
                    vertical position, being occupied by the sentient ball, while the section of a
                    horizontal plane passing through the upper forms the orifice. The cup may be
                    made of thin brass or silver, either hammered or cast, and then turned and
                    polished on a lathe; the diameter being from two to four inches, and the
                    eccentricity of the elliptical figure varied within certain limits according to
                    circumstances. The most convenicnt proportion, however, is to have this
                    eccentricity equal to half the transverse axis, and, consequently, to place the
                    foeus at the third part of the whole height of the cavity, the diameter of the
                    sentient ball being likewise nearly the third part of that of the orifice of the
                    cup. In order to separate more the balls of the pyroscope, the gilt one may be
                    carried somewhat higher than the other, and lodged in the swell of the cavity,
                    its stem being bent to the curve, and the neck partially widened, to prevent the
                    risk of dividing the coloured liquor in carriage. A lid of the same thin
                    unpolished metal as the cup itself is fitted to the mouth of the aethrioscope,
                    and only removed when an observation is to be made. The scale may extend to 60
                    or 70 millesimal degrees above the zero, and about 15 degrees below it.</p>
                <p>This instrument, exposed to the open air in clear weather, will at all times,
                    both during the day and the night, indicate an impression of cold shot downwards
                    from the higher regions. Yet the effect varies exceedingly. It is greatest while
                    the sky has the pure azure hue; it diminishes fast as the atmosphere becomes
                    loaded with spreading clouds; and it is almost extinguished when low fogs settle
                    upon the surface. The name <hi rend="smallcaps">Aethrioscope</hi> (from <hi
                    rend="italic">A</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">Dpος,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">serenus, sudus, frigidus)</hi> may, therefore, be justly
                    appropriate to this new combination of the pyroscope. The sensibility of the
                    instrument is very striking, for the liquor incessantly falls and rises in the
                    stem with every passing cloud. But the eaιιse of its variations does not always
                    appear so obvious. Under a fine blue sky, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >aethrioscope</hi> will sometimes indicate a cold of 50 millesimal degrees; yet
                    on other days, when the air seems equally bright, the effect is hardly 30°.
                    Particular winds at different altitudes seem to modify the result, and so
                    perhaps may the transition from summer to winter. Four months are scarcely
                    elapsed since this instrument was first contrived, and during that time very few
                    opportunities have occurred for making nice observations.</p>
                <p>The aethrioscope might be reduced to a smaller and more compact form, by
                    conjoining with it a pendant differential thermometer. Neither of the glass
                    balls in this case requires to be gilt; but the lower one is encased by a hollow
                    sphere of brass, composed of two pieces which screw together, and the upper ball
                    occupies the focus of the cup, which needs scarcely be more than two inches
                    wide. This variety of the instrument is equally accurate, but, under any change
                    of temperature, rather slower in its action than the former.</p>
                <p>On replacing the metallic lid, the effect is entirely extinguished, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193356909" xml:id="kp-eb0706-6909-0762"/>and the fluid in
                    the stem of the differential thermometer sinks to zero. A cover of pasteboard
                    has at first precisely the same influence; but after it has itself become
                    chilled by this exposure, it produces a small secondary action on the sentient
                    ball, scarcely exceeding, however, the tenth part of the naked impression. A lid
                    of glass or of mica intercepts the impressions like one of paper; for the
                    admission of light has no deranging effect if the aethrioscope be rightly
                    constructed and highly polished. The minute secondary action is almost
                    extinguished, if screens of paper, glass, or mica, be held at some distance
                    above the mouth of the instrument.</p>
                <p>In the first form of the aethrioscope, it is not essential (though it augments
                    the effect) that one of the balls should be gilt, since the other being placed
                    naked in the focus, receives the pulses much concentrated. If both the balls
                    were formed of black glass, the sethrioscopic impressions would evidently be
                    blended with opposite photometrical ones. As long as the action of the light
                    from the sky predominates, the instrument indicates an excess of heat; but after
                    the pulses darted from the higher atmosphere come to prevail, it will mark the
                    excess of cold. The liquor is stationary when these contending influences are
                    exactly balanced.</p>
                <p>To ascertain whether the cold pulses are shot obliquely as well as in the
                    vertical direction, the aethrioscope may be constructed to turn towards any
                    portion of the sky. To effect this, the form best adapted for the reflection
                    would be that of an hyperbola, whose asymptotes have an inclination equal to the
                    visual angle of the space to be explored. But to obtain accurate results, the
                    focal ball must be small, and the hyperbolic conoid wide and much extended. It
                    will answer nearly the same purpose, however, to adopt a truncated spheroid of
                    great eccentricity. Let the height of the focus, for instance, be one inch, that
                    of the entire cavity nine inches, and consequently the widest diameter six
                    inches. The figure on the other side is rather more distended, its extreme width
                    being equal to double the eccentricity, and the focal ball dividing the height
                    of the orifice in the ratio of 1 to 3 + 8, or 6 to</p>
                <p>35 nearly. While that sentient ball remains always in the same position, the axis
                    of the instrument can, by means of a screw acting on the limb of a quadrant, be
                    depressed or elevated to any given angle. But the effect will chiefly be
                    produced by the direct impressions; for the lateral pulses, striking less
                    obliquely <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> against the cavity of the spheroid,
                    will be feebly reflected. This movable aethrioscope was placed in a convenient
                    situation out of doors, when the sky appeared free from clouds, and had assumed
                    a clear blue tint. The spheroid being turned first upright, the effect was
                    noted; but this continued still unchanged on depressing the axis successively
                    till it had approached the limit of energetic range, or within twenty degrees of
                    the horizon.</p>
                <p>From every portion of the sky that subtends a given visual angle, there is hence
                    received the same quantity of the frigorifie pulses. But such would likewise be
                    the <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> result if they were showered from the
                    horizontal surfaces of the successive strata which divide the atmosphere;'
                    since, although the intensity diminishes in the ratio of the sine of obliquity,
                    a projecting space proportionally broader is for each elemental angle brought
                    into action, as evidently appears from the annexed figure. This entire agreement
                    between theory and observation is most satisfactory.</p>
                <p>The same sectoral form of the aethrioscope discloses: also the peculiar influence
                    of clouds in obstructing the* frigorifie pulses excited in the atmosphere. When
                    the sky was completely obscured by a dense canopy of clouds, the instrument
                    being pointed to the zenith, marked only five millesimal degrees; but on
                    lowering it successively to the angle of thirty degrees above the horizon, it
                    continued to indicate still the same effect. Water almost completely absorbs the
                    pulsatory impressions of heat or cold; and may not clouds, consisting of diffuse
                    aqueous particles, produce a similar effect? But the feeble action of five
                    degrees, amounting scarcely to the eighth part of what is observed in clear
                    weather, could not be any remnant of the pulses from the higher celestial
                    regions which had penetrated through the mass of vapours, because if the
                    vertical transit, through the obstructing range, allowed only an eighth part to
                    escape, the oblique passage of thirty degrees, redoubling the extent of
                    absorption, would have reduced the final discharge to five eighths of a degree.
                    The impression measured by the aethrioscope in this case must therefore have
                    originated wholly in the strata of air between the under surface of the clouds
                    and the ground. But in that narrow space, the extreme difference of temperature
                    would be comparatively small. Hence the frigorifie action is found always to
                    diminish as the clouds descend. Nor does their variable denseness appear
                    materially to affect the result, which is often the least, when a very thin,
                    whitish, but low vapour, gathers in the atmosphere<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193356922" xml:id="kp-eb0706-6922-0763"/>. Hence the aethrioscope
                    might, with great facility, be employed to estimate the altitude of clouds.</p>
                <p>As the higher strata of the atmosphere thus dart cold pulses downwards, so the
                    lower strata must evidently project equal pulses of heat upwards. But to measure
                    these, it would require the aethrioscope to be inverted, and furnished with a
                    pendant pyroscope. The instrument, now carried to the top of a lofty mountain,
                    and directed to the plain below, would indicate a considerable impression of
                    heat, nearly proportional to the quantity of ascent; and therefore amounting,
                    for example on the summit of Chimboraço, to perhaps twenty millesimal degrees.
                    But in the same situation the common aethrioscope might be expected to mark an
                    impression of cold from above as just so much diminished. No opportunity,
                    however, has yet occurred, on a large scale, for making these interesting
                    observations. A balloon would afford the readiest mode of verifying the
                    theory.</p>
                <p>The inverted aethrioscope likewise discovers the quality and measure of the
                    pulses projected from the ground. These in general arc very feeble, seldom in
                    this climate exceeding three or four degrees. In the progress of a bright day,
                    as the ground grows warmer than the incumbent air, it excites hot pulses, but as
                    the sun declines the effect gradually diminishes, till this again returns,
                    increasing with a contrary character, when the surface of the earth has become
                    relatively colder.</p>
                <p>The same instrument being suspended a few reet above the ground while the sky
                    appeared clear and blue, a silver tray was laid under it, and the reflected
                    impression of cold amounted to twenty-five degrees; but on interposing a plate
                    of glass, it was reduced to two degrees; and on removing this and pouring a
                    sheet of water over the silver, the effect was absolutely extinguished. The
                    absorbent influence of water, and consequently of clouds, was thus distinctly
                    shown.</p>
                <p>The nature and intensity of the cold and hot pulses excited in the several strata
                    of the atmosphere, may be easily understood from the annexed figure. Let two
                    equal and opposite circles touch the straightline AB, which divides a stratum of
                    cold from another of warm air. Whilc the opposite diameters CD and <hi
                    rend="italic">cd</hi> represent the force of the perpendicular pulses of cold
                    darted downwards, and of heat upwards, the chords CF, CĽ, CH, and CG, and C∕,'
                    <hi rend="italic">Ce,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ch,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cg,</hi> will likewise exhibit the strength of the pulses which are shot
                    obliquely.</p>
                <p>The aethrioscope thus opens new scenes to our view. It extends its sensation
                    through indefinite space, and reveals the condition of the remotest atmosphere.
                    Constructed with still greater delicacy, it may perhaps scent the distant winds,
                    and detect the actual temperature of every quarter of the heavens. The
                    impressions of cold which arrive from the north will probably be found stronger
                    than those received from the south. But the instrument has yet been scarcely
                    tried. We are anxious to compare its indications for the course of a whole year,
                    and still more solicitous to receive its reports from other climates and
                    brighter skies.</p>
                <p>But the facts discovered by the aethrioscope are nowise at variance with the
                    theory already advanced on the gradation of heat from the equator to the pole,
                    and from the level of the sea to the highest atmosphere. The internal motion of
                    the air, by the agency of opposite currents, still tempers the disparity of the
                    solar impressions; but this effect is likewise accelerated by the vibrations
                    excited from the unequal distribution of heat, and darted through the
                    atmospheric medium with the celerity of sound. Any surface which sends a hot
                    pulse in one direction, must evidently propel a cold pulse of the same intensity
                    in an opposite direction. The existence of such pulsations⅛ therefore, is in
                    perfect unison with the balanced system of aerial currents.</p>
                <p>The most recondite principles of harmony are thus disclosed in the constitution
                    of this nether world. But we have left no room for pursuing the details. In
                    clear weather, the cold pulses then showered entire from the heavens will, even
                    during the progress of the day, prevail over the influence of the reflex light,
                    received on the ground, in places which are screened from the direct action of
                    the sun. Hence, at all times, the coolness of a northern exposure. Hence,
                    likewise, the freshness which tempers the night in the sultriest climates, under
                    the expanse of an almost constant azure sky. In our northern latitudes, a canopy
                    of clouds generally screens the ground from the impressions of cold. But, within
                    the arctic circle, the surface of the earth is more effectually protected by the
                    perpetual fogs which deform those dreary regions, and yet admit the light of
                    day, while they absorb the frigorifie pulses, vibrated from the higher
                    atmosphere. Even the ancients had remarked that our clear nights are generally
                    likewise cold. During the absence of the sun, the celestial impressions continue
                    to accumulate; and the ground becomes chilled to the utmost in the morning, at
                    the very moment when that luminary again resumes his powerful sway. But neither
                    cold nor heat has the same effect on a green sward as on a ploughed field, the
                    action being nearly dissipated, before it reaches the ground, among the
                    multiplied surfaces of the blades of grass. The lowest stratum of air, being
                    chilled by contact with the exposed surface, deposits its moisture, which is
                    either absorbed into the earth, or attracted to the projecting fibres of the
                    plants, on which it settles in the form of dew or hoar frost. Hence the utility
                    in this country of spreading awnings at night, to screen the tender blossoms and
                    the delicate fruits from the influence of a gelid sky; and hence, likewise, the
                    advantage of covering walled trees with netting, of which the meshes not only
                    detain the frigorifie pulses, but intercept the minute icicles, that, in their
                    formation, rob the air of its cold.</p>
                <p>The novelty and importance of the principles which regulate the distribution of
                    heat in the atmosphere seemed to require a full discussion; but we have already
                    outrun the space allotted for this article, and must, for the present, content
                    ourselves with subjoining a few corollaries and general remarks.</p>
                <p>From what has been explained, it is easy to perceive why the climate of an island
                    should have a distinct character from that of a wide continent. The latter will
                    experience a much greater range of heat and cold than the former, though the
                    mean temperature, in like circumstances, will be the same in both. The proximity
                    of the ocean quickly absorbs the inequality of the solar impressions. The
                    passage from summer to winter is hence but feebly marked in detached islands.
                    The prevalence, likewise, in such situations, of a land breeze during the day,
                    and of a sea breeze during the night, especially near the tropics, reduces to
                    very moderate limits the effects produced by the vicissitude of light and
                    darkness.</p>
                <p>The coldness of particular situations has very generally been attributed to the
                    influence of piercing winds which blow over elevated tracts of land. This
                    explication, however, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193356961"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-6961-0764"/>is not well founded. It is the altitude of the
                    place itself above the level of the sea, and not that of the general surface of
                    the country, which will mould its temperature. A cold wind, as it descends from
                    the high grounds into the valleys, has its capacity for heat diminished, and,
                    consequently, becomes apparently warmer. The prevalence of northerly above
                    southerly winds may, however, have some slight influence in depressing the
                    temperature of any climate.</p>
                <p>It has often been assumed as an incontrovertible fact, that the clearing of the
                    ground, and the extension of agriculture, have a material tendency to ameliorate
                    the character of any climate. But whether the sun’s rays be spent on the foliage
                    of the trees, or admitted to the surface of the earth, their accumulated effects
                    in the course of a year, on the incumbent atmosphere, must continue still the
                    same. The direct action of the light would no doubt more powerfully warm the
                    ground during the day, if this superior efficacy were not likewise nearly
                    counterbalanced by exposure to the closer sweep of the winds; and the influence
                    of night must again re-establish the general equilibrium of temperature. The
                    drainage of the surſace will evidently improve the salubrity of any climate, by
                    removing the stagnant and putrefying water; but it can have no effect whatever
                    in rendering the air milder, since the ground will be left still sufficiently
                    moist for maintaining a continual evaporation to the consequent dissipation of
                    heat.</p>
                <p>Much has been said of the comparatively low temperature of the American
                    continent. Its majestic forests, impervious to the solar beams, and its immense
                    lakes, diffusing their vapours, are supposed sufficient to make the climate cold
                    and damp; and the most splendid prospects have been delineated of those changes,
                    which an active, free, and rapidly extending population is destined to produce
                    in reclaiming that vast region from the rankness of nature, and opening its soil
                    to the genial influence of heaven. Much inaccuracy and exaggeration, however,
                    has prevailed on this subject. The extremes of summer and winter probably differ
                    more in America than in the old world; but the mere temperature on any parallel
                    appears, when carefully taken, to be nearly the same. Thus, Mr Warden (<hi
                    rend="italic">Chorographical Description of the District of Columbia,</hi> 1816)
                    found a spring in the vicinity of the capital of the United States, and
                    therefore a little above the level of the sea, to mark 58° in Fahrenheit’s
                    scale; but two chalybeate springs in the same quarter, though perhaps deeper
                    seated, showed a heat of 62° and 64°. Chalybeates are not deemed warm springs,
                    or affected by their slight mineral ingredient. But on the same parallel of 39°,
                    the mean temperature of the ancient continent is 63^ <hi rend="superscript">
                    o</hi>.</p>
                <p>After the above had been written, the third volume of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoires de Physique et de Chimie</hi> of the Society of Arcueil was published,
                    containing an elaborate paper of the celebrated and accomplished traveller Baron
                    Humboldt, <hi rend="italic">On Isothermal Lines, and the Distribution of Heat
                    over the Globe.</hi> Laying aside every theoretical consideration, this
                    distinguished philosopher has here endeavoured to class the results of his own
                    very numerous thermometrical observations with all those which he could collect
                    from different quarters. The first difficulty that occurs is the mode of
                    ascertaining the mean temperature of any place. It was found that half the sum
                    of the maximum and minimum observed during the day and night, or through the
                    summer and the winter, does not represent the true quantity. Μ. Humboldt has
                    remarked that, between the parallels of 46° and 48°, the thermometer at the
                    moment of sun-setting indicates in every season very nearly the medium
                    temperature of the day. If this fact could be-extended to other latitudes, it
                    would greatly abridge the labour of meteorological observations.</p>
                <p>From the data employed by Μ. Humboldt, he calculates that, corresponding to the
                    latitudes of 30°, 40°, 50°, and 60°, the mean temperatures on the west side of
                    the Old Continent are 70° ∙5, 63° ∙1, 50° ∙9, and 40° ∙6; but, on the east side
                    of the New Continent, only 66° ∙9, 54° ∙5, 38°, and 42° ∙2. The isothermal
                    lines, or lines of equal temperature, under the tropics run across the Atlantic
                    nearly parallel to the equator; but, in the middle latitudes, they bend
                    southerly towards the coast of America. These lines run nearly parallel into the
                    interior of the New Continent, till they pass the Rocky Mountains, after which
                    they bend again northwards. The climate is comparatively mild on the western
                    shore of North America.</p>
                <p>It is well known that the difference between the temperature of the winter and of
                    the summer months increases in advancing from the equator to the pole. On the
                    isothermal lines of 68°, 59°, 50°, and 41°, by Fahrenheit’s scale, Μ. Humboldt
                    estimates the extreme range of the year at 22°, 29°, 32∣ <hi rend="superscript">
                    o</hi>, and 36°, on the Old Continent, and at 27°, 42°, 412°, and 52°, on the
                    New Continent. <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.)</hi></p>
