                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">CARD</label>, among artificers, an instrument consisting of a
                    block of wood set with sharp teeth, serving to arrange the hairs of wool, flax,
                    hemp, and the like. There are different kinds of them, as hand-cards,
                    stock-cards, &amp;c. They are made as follows:</p>
                <p>A piece of thick leather, of the size intended for the card, is strained in a
                    frame for that purpose, and then pricked full of holes, into which the teeth or
                    pieces of iron wire are inserted; after which the leather is nailed by the edges
                    to a flat piece of wood, in the form of an oblong square, about a foot in length
                    and half a foot in breadth, with a handle placed in the middle of one of the
                    longer sides.</p>
                <p>The teeth are made in the following manner. The wire being drawn of the size
                    intended, a skain or number of wires are cut into proper lengths by means of a
                    gauge, and then doubled in a tool contrived for the purpose; after which they
                    are bent into the proper direction by means of another tool, and then placed in
                    the leather, as above mentioned. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Woollen
                    Manufacture.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Cards,</hi> in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gaming,</hi> little pieces of fine thin pasteboard, of an oblong figure, of
                    several sizes, but most commonly, in Britain, three inches and a half long and
                    two and a half broad, on which are painted several points and figures.</p>
                <p>The moulds and blocks for making cards are exactly like those that were used for
                    the first printed books. , A sheet of wet or moist paper is laid on the block,
                    which is very slightly done over with a sort of ink made of lampblack diluted in
                    water, and mixed with some starch to give it a body. This is afterwards rubbed
                    off with a round list. The court-cards are coloured by means of several
                    patterns, styled <hi rend="italic">stane-files.</hi> These consist of papers cut
                    through with a penknife; and in the apertures the various colours, as red,
                    black, &amp;c. are severally applied. These patterns are painted with
                    oil-colours, that the brushes may not wear them out; and when the pattern is
                    laid on the pasteboard, a brush full of colour is slightly passed over it, and,
                    leaving the colour within the openings, forms the face or figure of the
                    card.</p>
                <p>Among sharpers, divers sorts of false and fraudulent cards have been contrived;
                    as, 1. <hi rend="italic">Marked</hi> cards, where the aces, kings, queens,
                    knaves, are marked on the corners of the backs with spots of different number
                    and order, either with clear water or water tinged with pale Indian ink, that
                    those in the seeret may distinguish them. Aees are marked with single spots on
                    two corners opposite diagonally; kings with two spots at the same corners;
                    knaves with the same number transversed. 2. <hi rend="italic">Breef</hi> cards,
                    those which are longer or broader than the rest, chiefly used at whist and
                    piquet. The broad cards are usually for kings, queens, knaves, and aces; the
                    long for .the rest. Their design is to direct the cuttings, to enable him in the
                    secret to cut the cards disadvantageously to his adversary, and draw the person
                    unacquainted with the fraud to cut them favourably for the sharper. As the pack
                    is placed either endwise or sidewise to him that is to cut, the long or broad
                    cards naturally lead him to cut them. Breef cards are sometimes made thus by the
                    manufacturer; but, in defect of these, sharpers pare all but the breefs with a
                    penknife or razor. 3. <hi rend="italic">Corner bend</hi> denotes four cards
                    turned down finely at one corner, to serve as a signal to cut by. 4. <hi
                    rend="italic">Middle bend,</hi> or Kingston-bridge, is where the tricks are bent
                    two different ways, which causes an opening or arch in the middle, to direct
                    likewise the cutting.</p>
                <p>Cards were invented about the year 1390, to divert Charles VI. of France, who had
                    fallen into a melancholy disposition. The inventor proposed, by the figures of
                    the four suits or colours, as the French call them, to represent the four
                    classes of men in the kingdom. By the <hi rend="italic">coeurs</hi> (hearts) are
                    meant the <hi rend="italic">gens de choeur,</hi> choir-men, or ecclesiastics;
                    and therefore the Spaniards, who certainly received the use of cards from the
                    French, have <hi rend="italic">copas,</hi> or chalices, instead of hearts. The
                    nobility, or prime military part of the kingdom, are represented by the ends or
                    points of lanees or pikes; and our ignorance of the meaning or the resemblance
                    of the figure induced us to call them <hi rend="italic">spades.</hi> The
                    Spaniards have <hi rend="italic">espadas,</hi> swords, in lieu of pikes, which
                    are of similar import. By diamonds are designed the order of citizens,
                    merchants, or tradesmen, <hi rend="italic">carreaux,</hi> square stones, tiles,
                    or the like. The Spaniards have a coin, <hi rend="italic">dincros,</hi> which
                    answers to it; and the Dutch call the French word <hi rend="italic"
                    >carreaux,</hi><hi rend="italic">streneen,</hi> stones and diamonds, from the
                    form. <hi rend="italic">Trefle,</hi> the trefoil-leaf, or clovergrass, corruptly
                    called <hi rend="italic">clubs,</hi> alludes to the husbandmen and peasants. But
                    how this suit came to be called <hi rend="italic">clubs</hi> is not easily
                    explained; unless, borrowing the game from the Spaniards, who have <hi
                    rend="italic">bastos</hi> (staves or clubs) instead of the trefoil, we gave the
                    Spanish signification to the French figure.</p>
                <p>The history of the four kings, which the French, in drollery, sometimes call the
                    cards, are David, Alexander, Caesar, and Charles; which names were then, and
                    still are, on the French cards. Those respectable names represent the four
                    celebrated monarchies of the Jews, Greeks, Romans, and Franks under Charlemagne.
                    By the queens are intended Argine, Esther, Judith, and Pallas (names retained in
                    the French cards), typical of birth, piety, fortitude, and wisdom, the
                    qualifications residing in each person. <hi rend="italic">Argine</hi> is an
                    anagram for <hi rend="italic">regina,</hi> queen by descent. By the knaves were
                    designed the servants to knights, for <hi rend="italic">knave</hi> originally
                    meant only <hi rend="italic">servant</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but French
                    pages and valets, now indiscriminately used by various orders of persons, were
                    formerly only allowed to persons of quality, esquires <hi rend="italic"
                    >(escuires),</hi> shield or armour-bearers. Others fancy that the knights
                    themselves were designed by those cards, because Hogier and Labire, two names on
                    the French cards, were famous knights at the time when cards were supposed to
                    have been invented.</p>
