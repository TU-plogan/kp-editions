                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">CARTHAGENA</label>, a city, sea-port, and arsenal of Spain,
                    situated on the banks of the Mediterranean Sea. It is in the province or kingdom
                    of Murcia. The port is very secure, both from an enemy and from tempests. Two
                    castles of great strength defend it from the former, whilst high mountains
                    surrounding all its sides, and an island called <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193349694" xml:id="kp-eb0706-9694-0207"/>Escombra in the centre of the
                    entrance, protect the shipping from the effects of the latter.</p>
                <p>As the tide in the Mediterranean does not rise sufficiently high to permit docks
                    to be constructed in the usual manner, they are kept dry by the help of
                    steam-engines and pumps. Some of the largest ships in the Spanish navy were
                    built at this arsenal, and, in prosperous times, every species of store for the
                    building and equipping of ships of the line were collected here; but the late
                    disasters have prevented the re-erection of the store-houses, and the whole
                    marine service has fallen into decay with most deplorable rapidity. Carthagena
                    is a presidio, or place in which felons condemned to slavery are kept at work in
                    chains. These convicts perform the most laborious offices about the arsenal, and
                    are treated with rigorous severity.</p>
                <p>The city has very little trade, except the exportation of barilla, which is made
                    from the ashes of marine plants, some of which are cultivated, and others grow
                    naturally on the sea shore. There are manufactures of sail-cloth and cordage,
                    both for the royal navy and for the supply of individuals. The hemp and flax of
                    which these are made is almost wholly grown within the province, which produces
                    annually about 12,000 quintals. Considerable quantities of larger ropes and
                    cables are made from esparto, or broom, the <hi rend="italic">spartium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">junceum</hi> of Linnaeus. The fibres of this plant, when spun into
                    cordage, make cables which are buoyant, and therefore less subject to accidents
                    from rocks at the bottom of the sea than those made from hemp. Carthagena is the
                    see of a bishop, and has a handsome cathedral, besides many other churches and
                    convents. By accurate observations, its latitude is 37. 35. 50. N. and its
                    longitude 0. 29. 13. W. This city contains 29,000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Carthagena,</hi> a province of Colombia, in South America.
                    With the provinces of Santa Martha and Rio Hacha it forms the department of
                    Magdalena, bordering on the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Darien. It is about
                    300 miles in length by 240 in breadth. The country is composed of mountains and
                    valleys, the former of which are clothed with forests. There is a great variety
                    of plants and trees, and perpetual verdure covers the earth. Wheat and other
                    kinds of European grain do not flourish well, but Indian corn and rice are
                    raised in quantities sufficient to supply the wants of the inhabitants. The
                    climate is very hot, and from May to December a great deal of rain falls. The
                    variety and beauty of the birds is remarkable. Poultry, pigeons, partridges, and
                    geese, are good and plentiful. This province produces pine-apples, papayas,
                    plantains, and other tropical fruits. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Colombia.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Carthagena,</hi> the capital city of the above province, is
                    situated on a sandy island, on the shore of a large and very commodious bay,
                    more than two leagues in length. It contains a handsome cathedral, besides
                    several churches, convents, and monasteries. The island, which forms a narrow
                    strait on the south-west, opens a communication with that part of the land
                    called Tierra Bomba. To the eastward the city is joined by a wooden bridge to a
                    large suburb called Xeximani, which is connected with the continent by another
                    bridge. The city and suburbs are well laid out, the streets being straight,
                    broad, and uniform. The houses are for the most part built of stone. They
                    consist chiefly of one story above the ground floor. All of them have balconies
                    and lattices of wood, which in this climate is more durable than iron. The
                    climate is excessively hot; and, like the whole province, Carthagena suffers
                    from periodical rains. In former times this city was the scene of frequent
                    contests, and in the late war of independence it was taken and retaken by both
                    parties. The population amounts to about 20,000, of whom a great many are of
                    Indian descent. Long. 77. 30. W. Lat. 10. 25. N.</p>
