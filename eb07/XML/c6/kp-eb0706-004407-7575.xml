                    and Marquis of Argyll, was the son of Archibald Earl of Argyll, by the Lady Anne
                    Douglas, daughter of William Earl of Morton. He was born in the year 1598, and
                    educated in the profession of the Protestant religion, according to the
                    strictest rules of the church of Scotland, as it was established immediately
                    after the reformation. During the commonwealth he was induced to submit to its
                    authority. Upon the restoration he was tried for his compliance; a crime common
                    to him with the whole nation, and such a one as the most loyal subject might
                    frequently by violence be induced to commit. To make this compliance appear the
                    more voluntary and hearty, there were produced in court letters which he had
                    written to Monk while that general governed Scotland, and which contained
                    expressions of the most cordial attachment to the established government. But
                    besides the general indignation excited by Albemarle’s discovery of this private
                    correspondence, men thought, that even the highest demonstrations of affection
                    might, during jealous times, be exacted as a necessary mark of compliance from a
                    person of such distinction as Argyll, and could not, by any equitable
                    construction, imply the crime of treason. The parliament, however, scrupled not
                    to pass sentence upon him, and he suffered with great constancy and courage.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Campbell,</hi><hi rend="italic">Archibald,</hi> Earl of
                    Argyll, son to the former, had from his youth distinguished himself by his
                    loyalty and his attachment to the royal family. Though his fa ther was head of
                    the covenanters, he himself refused to concur in any of their measures; and when
                    a commission of colonel was given him by the convention of states, he forbore to
                    act upon it till it should be ratified by the king. By his respectful behaviour,
                    as well as by his services, he made himself acceptable to Charles when that
                    prince was in Scotland; and even after the battle of Worcester, all the
                    misfortunes which attended the royal cause could not engage him to desert it.
                    Under Middleton he obstinately persevered to harass and infest the victorious
                    English; and it was not till he had received orders from that general, that he
                    would submit to accept of a capitulation. Such jealousy of his loyal attachments
                    was entertained by the commonwealth and protector, that a pretence was soon
                    after fallen upon to commit him to prison; and his confinement was rigorously
                    continued till the restoration. The king, sensible of his services, had remitted
                    to him his father’s forfeiture, and created him Earl of Argyll; and when a most
                    unjust sentence was passed upon him by the Scotch parliament, Charles anew
                    remitted it. In the subsequent part of this reign Argyll behaved himself
                    dutifully; and though he seemed not disposed to go all lengths with the court,
                    he always appeared, even in his opposition, a man of mild disposition and
                    peaceable deportment.</p>
                <p>A parliament was summoned at Edinburgh in summer 1681, and the Duke of York
                    appointed commissioner. Besides granting money to the king, and voting the
                    inde-fe’asible right of succession, this parliament enacted a test which all
                    persons holding offices, civil, military, or ecclesiastical, were bound to take;
                    in which test the king’s supremacy was asserted, the covenant renounced, passive
                    obedience assented to, and all obligations disclaimed of endeavouring any
                    alteration in civil or ecclesiastical establishments. But in addition to the
                    test as prepared by the courtiers, the country party proposed also a clause of
                    adherence to the Protestant religion, which could not with decency be rejected.
                    The whole was of an enormous length, considered as an oath; and, what was worse,
                    being voted in a hurry, it was found on examination to be a medley of absurdity
                    and contradiction. Though the courtiers could not reject the clause of adherence
                    to the Protestant religion, they proposed that all princes of the blood should
                    be exempted from taking the oath; an exception which was zealously opposed by
                    Argyll, who observed that the sole danger to the Protestant religion must
                    proceed from the quarter where it was thus proposed to grant an exemption. By
                    insisting on this topic he drew on himself the secret indignation of the Duke of
                    York, of which he soon felt the fatal consequences.</p>
                <p>When Argyll took the test as. a privy counsellor, he subjoined, in the duke’s
                    presence, an explanation which he had previously communicated to that prince,
                    and which he believed to have been approved by him. It was in these words :—“I
                    have considered the test, and am very desirous of giving obedience as far as I
                    can. I am confident that the parliament never intended to impose contradictory
                    oaths; therefore I think no man can explain it but for himself. Accordingly I
                    take it as far as it is consistent with itself and the Protestant religion. And
                    I do declare that I mean not to bind myself in my station, and in a lawful way,
                    from wishing and endeavouring any alteration which I think to the advantage of
                    church or state, and not repugnant to the Protestant religion and my loyalty;
                    and this I understand as a part of my oath.” The duke heard the qualification
                    with tranquillity, and Argyll was admitted to sit that day in council; nor was
                    it possible to imagine that a capital offence had been committed where occasion
                    seemed not to have been given for so much as a frown or a reprimand. Argyll was
                    therefore much surprised a few days afterwards to find that a warrant had <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193347588" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7588-0045"/> been issued for
                    committing him to prison; that he was indicted for high treason, leasing-making,
                    and perjury; and that from the innocent words above mentioned an accusation had
                    been extracted, by which he was to forfeit life, honours, and fortune. It is
                    needless to enter into particulars where the iniquity of the whole is so
                    apparent. Of five judges three did not scruple to find that the guilt of treason
                    and leasing-making had been incurred by the prisoner; a jury of fifteen noblemen
                    gave a verdict against him; and the king being consulted, ordered sentence to be
                    pronounced, but the execution of it suspended till further orders. Argyll,
                    however, saw no reason to trust to the justice or mercy of such enemies. He made
                    his escape from prison, and, till he could find a ship for Holland, concealed
                    himself during some time in London. All the parts of his sentence, however, as
                    far as the government in Scotland had power, were rigorously executed; his
                    estate was confiscated, and his arms were reversed and torn down. Having got
                    over to Holland, he remained there during the remaining part of the reign of
                    Charles II. But thinking himself at liberty, before the coronation of James II.
                    to exert himself in order to recover the constitution by force of arms, he
                    concerted measures w⅛h the Duke of Monmouth, and returned to Scotland to
                    assemble his friends; but not meeting with the success which he expected, he was
                    taken prisoner, and, being carried to Edinburgh, was beheaded upon his former
                    unjust sentence, on the 30th June 1685. He showed great constancy and courage
                    under his misfortunes. At the place of execution he made a short, grave, and
                    religious speech; and, after solemnly declaring that he forgave all his enemies,
                    submitted to death with heroic firmness.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Campbell,</hi><hi rend="italic">Archibald,</hi> first Duke
                    of Argyll, son of the preceding, was an active promoter of the revolution. He
                    came over with the Prince of Orange; was admitted into the convention as Earl of
                    Argyll, though his father’s attainder had not been reversed; and in the claim of
                    rights the sentence against him was declared to be a reproach to the nation. The
                    establishment of the crown upon the Prince and Princess of Orange being carried
                    by a great majority in the Scottish Convention, the earl was sent from the
                    nobility, with Sir James Montgomery and Sir John Dalrymple from the barons and
                    burghs, to offer the crown, in name of the Convention, to their majesties, and
                    to tender them the coronation oath; for which, and many other eminent services,
                    he was admitted a member of the privy council, and, in 1690, made one of the
                    lords of the treasury. He was afterwards made a colonel of the Scotch horse
                    guards, and, in 1694, one of the extraordinary lords of session. He was likewise
                    created Duke of Argyll, Marquis of Kintyre and Lorn, Earl of Campbell and
                    Cowall, Viscount of Lochow and Glenisla, Lord Inverary, Mull, Morvern, and
                    Terrey, by letters-patent, bearing date at Kensington the 23d of June 1701. He
                    sent over to Flanders for King William’s service a regiment, the officers of
                    which were chiefly of his own name and family, who bravely distinguished
                    themselves throughout the whole course of the war. He married Elizabeth,
                    daughter of Sir Lionel Talmash of Helmingham in the county of Suffolk, by
                    Elizabeth, duchess of Lauderdale, his wife, daughter and heiress of William
                    Murray, earl of Dysart, by whom he left issue two sons and a daughter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Campbell,</hi><hi rend="italic">John,</hi> second Duke of
                    Argyll, and also duke of Greenwich and baron of Chatham, son of the preceding,
                    was born on the 10th of October 1680; and, on the very day when his grandfather
                    suffered at Edinburgh, he fell out of a window three pair of stairs high without
                    receiving any hurt. At the age of fifteen he had made considerable progress in
                    classical learning. His father then perceiving his military disposition,
                    encouraged it, and introduced him to King William, who appointed him to the
                    command of a regiment. In this situation he remained till the death of his
                    father in 1703, when becoming Duke of Argyll, he was soon afterwards sworn of
                    Queen Anne’s privy council, made captain of the Scotch horse guards, and
                    appointed one of the extraordinary lords of session. In 1704, her majesty having
                    revived the Scottish order of the thistle, his grace was installed as one of the
                    knights of that order, and was soon afterwards appointed high commissioner to
                    the Scotch parliament; and having been of great service in promoting the union,
                    he was on his return created a peer of England, by the titles of Baron of
                    Chatham and Earl of Greenwich, and, in 1710, was made knight of the garter. His
                    grace first distinguished himself in his military capacity at the battle of
                    Oudenarde, where he commanded as brigadier-general, with all the bravery of
                    youth, and the conduct of a veteran officer. He was present under the Duke of
                    Marlborough at the siege of Ghent, and took possession of the town. He had also
                    a considerable share in the victory obtained over the French at the battle of
                    Malplaquet, by dislodging them from the wood of Sart, and gaining a post of
                    great consequence. In this sharp engagement several musket-balls passed through
                    the duke’s clothes, hat, and peruke. Soon after the action he was sent to take
                    the command in Spain; but on the reduction of Port Mahon he returned to England.
                    His grace having now a seat in the House of Lords, he censured the measures of
                    the ministry with such freedom, that all his places were disposed of to other
                    noblemen; but at the accession of George I. he recovered his influence. On the
                    breaking out of the rebellion in 1715 he was appointed commander-in-chief of the
                    forces in North Britain, and was principally instrumental in effecting the total
                    extinction of the rebellion in Scotland, without much bloodshed. He arrived in
                    London early in March 1716, and was at first in high favour; but, to the
                    surprise of people of all ranks, he was in a few months divested of his
                    employments; and from this period to the year 1718 he signalized himself in a
                    civil capacity, by his incorruptible patriotism and manly eloquence. In the
                    beginning of the year 1719 he was again admitted into favour, appointed
                    lord-steward of the household, and in April following created Duke of Greenwich.
                    He continued in the administration during the remaining part of that reign, and,
                    after the accession of George IL, till April 1740, when he delivered a speech
                    with such warmth, that the ministry being highly offended, he was again
                    dismissed from his employments. To these, however, on the change of the
                    ministry, he was soon restored; but not approving of the measures of the new
                    administration any more than those of the old, he gave up all his posts for the
                    last time, and never afterwards engaged in affairs of state. He now enjoyed
                    privacy and retirement; and died of a paralytic disorder on the 4th of October
                    1743. To the memory of his grace a noble monument was erected in Westminster
                    Abbey, executed by Roubillac.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Campbell,</hi><hi rend="italic">Archibald,</hi> third Duke
                    of Argyll, brother of the preceding, was born at Hamhouse, in England, in June
                    1682, and was educated at the University of Glasgow. He afterwards applied
                    himself to the study of the civil law at Utrecht; but, upon his father’s being
                    created a duke, he betook himself to a military life, and served some time under
                    the Duke of Marlborough. Upon quitting the army, in which he did not remain
                    long, he applied to the acquisition of the knowledge calculated to enable him to
                    perform a part in the political world. In 1705 he was appointed treasurer of
                    Scotland, and made a considerable figure in parliament, though he was not more
                    than twenty-three years of age. In 1706 he was appointed one of the
                    commissioners for treating of the union; and in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193347601" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7601-0046"/>same year he was created Lord
                    Oronsay, Dunoon, and Arrois, Viscount and Earl of Isla. In 1708 he was made an
                    extraordinary lord of session; and when the union had been effected, he was
                    chosen one of the sixteen peers for Scotland in the first parliament of Great
                    Britain, and was elected to every future parliament, except the fourth, till his
                    death. In 1710 he was appointed justice-general or Scotland. In 1711 he was
                    called to the privy council; and upon the accession of George I. he was
                    nominated lord register of Scotland. When the rebellion broke out in 1715, he
                    again betook himself to arms, in defence of the house of Hanover, and by his
                    prudent conduct in the West Highlands, he prevented General Gordon, at the head
                    of three thousand men, from penetrating into the country and raising levies. He
                    afterwards joined his brother at Stirling, and was wounded at the battle of
                    Dumblane or Sheriffmuir. He was appointed keeper of the privy seal in 1725, and
                    from this time he was intrusted with the management of Scottish affairs. In
                    1734, upon his resigning the privy seal, he was made keeper of the great seal,
                    which office he enjoyed’till his death. Upon the decease of his brother, he
                    became Duke of Argyll, hereditary justice-general, lieutenant, sheriff, and
                    commissary of Argyleshire and the Western Isles, hereditary great master of the
                    household, and hereditary keeper of Dunstaffnage, Carrick, and several other
                    castles. He was also chancellor of the University of Aberdeen, and laboured to
                    promote the interest of that, as well as of the other universities of Scotland.
                    It was by his advice that, after the rebellion in 1745, the Highlanders were
                    employed in the royal army. He was a man of great endowments, both natural and
                    acquired, and possessed considerable parliamentary abilities. He was likewise
                    eminent for his literary accomplishments, and had collected one of the most
                    valuable private libraries in Great Britain. The faculties of his mind continued
                    unimpaired till his death, which happened suddenly on the 15th of April 1561, in
                    the seventy-ninth year of his age. He was married, but had no issue; and was
                    succeeded in his titles and estates by John Campbell, fourth Duke of Argyll, son
                    of the honourable John Campbell of Mammore, the second son of Archibald the
                    ninth Earl of Argyll. The family of Argyll were heritable justices-general for
                    Scotland till the office was abolished by the jurisdiction act. They are still
                    heritable masters of the king’s household in Scotland, and keepers of
                    Dunstaffnage and Carrick.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Campbell,</hi><hi rend="italic">John,</hi> an eminent
                    historical, biographical, and political writer, was born at Edinburgh on the 8th
                    March 1708. His father, Robert Campbell of Glenlyon, was captain of horse in a
                    regiment commanded by the then Earl of Hyndford; and his mother, Elizabeth,
                    daughter of Mr Smith of Windsor in Berkshire, had the honour of claiming a
                    descent from the poet Waller. John, their fourth son, when five years old, was
                    carried from Scotland to Windsor, where he received the rudiments of his
                    education; and at a proper age he was placed as clerk to an attorney, being
                    intended for the law. This profession, however, he never followed; but by a
                    close application to the acquisition of knowledge of various kinds, he became
                    qualified to appear with advantage in the literary world. In 1736, before he had
                    completed his thirtieth year, he gave to the public, in two volumes folio, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Military History of Prince Eugene and the Duke of
                    Marlborough,</hi> enriched with maps, plans, and cuts. From the reputation which
                    he thus acquired, he was soon afterwards solicited to take part in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ancient Universal History.</hi> But whilst employed in this
                    capital work, Mr Campbell found leisure to entertain the world with other
                    productions. In 1739 he published the <hi rend="italic">Travels and Adventures
                    of Edward Brown, Esq.</hi> 8vo. In the same year appeared his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoirs of the Bashaw Duke de Ripperda,</hi> 8vo, reprinted, with improvements,
                    in 1740. These memoirs were followed, in 1741, by the <hi rend="italic">Concise
                    History of Spanish America,</hi> 8vo. In 1742 he published a letter to a friend
                    in the country, on the publication of Thurloe’s State Papers; giving an account
                    of their discovery, importance, and utility. The same year was distinguished by
                    the appearance of the first and second volumes of his <hi rend="italic">Lives of
                    the English Admirals, and other eminent British Seamen.</hi> The two remaining
                    volumes were completed in 1744; and not long afterwards the whole was translated
                    into German. This was the first of Mr Campbell’s works to which he prefixed his
                    name, and it is a performance of great and acknowledged merit. In 1743 he
                    published <hi rend="italic">Hermippus Revived</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a
                    second edition of which, much improved and enlarged, came out in 1749, under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Herrnippus</hi><hi rend="italic">Redivivus,</hi> or
                    the Sage’s Triumph over Old Age and the Grave. This tract had its origin in a
                    foreign publication, but it was much improved by the ingenuity and learning of
                    Mr Campbell. In 1744 he gave to the public, in two volumes folio, his I <hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">oyages and Travels,</hi> on
                    Dr Harris’s plan, being an improvement of that collection which bad appeared in
                    1705. The time and care employed by Mr Campbell in this important undertaking
                    did not prevent his engaging in another great work, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Biographia Britannica,</hi> which began to be published in weekly numbers in
                    1745, and extended to seven volumes folio; but our author’s articles were
                    confined to the first four volumes, of which, Dr Kippis observes, they
                    constitute the prime merit.</p>
                <p>When Mr Dodsley formed the design of <hi rend="italic">The Preceptor,</hi> which
                    appeared in 1748, Mr Campbell was engaged to assist in the undertaking; and the
                    parts written by him were the Introduction to Chronology, and the Discourse on
                    Trade and Commerce, both of which displayed an extensive fund of knowledge upon
                    these subjects. In 1750 he published the first separate edition of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Present State of Europe</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a work which
                    had been originally begun in 1746, in the <hi rend="italic">Museum,</hi> a very
                    valuable periodical performance, printed for Dodsley. There is no production of
                    our author’s which has met with a better reception. It passed through six
                    editions, and fully deserved this encouragement. The next undertaking which
                    called for the exertion of our author’s abilities and learning, was <hi
                    rend="italic">The Modern Universal History.</hi> This extensive work was
                    published, from time to time, in detached parts, till it amounted to sixteen
                    volumes folio; and a second edition, in octavo, began to make its appearance in
                    the year 1759. The parts of it written by Mr Campbell were, the histories of the
                    Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish, French, Swedish, Danish, and Ostend Settlements in
                    the East Indies; and the histories of the kingdoms of Spain, Portugal, Algarve,
                    Navarre, and that of France, from the time of Clovis till 1656. Our author
                    having thus distinguished himself in the literary world, the degree of LL.D, was
                    conferred upon him by the university of Glasgow, on the 18th June 1784.</p>
                <p>His principal and favourite production was, <hi rend="italic">A Political Survey
                    of Great Britain,</hi> in two volumes 4to, published a short time before his
                    death; a work in which the extent of his knowledge, and the ardour of his
                    patriotic spirit, are equally conspicuous. Dr Campbell’s reputation was not
                    confined to his own country, but extended to the remotest parts of Europe. As an
                    instance of this, it may be mentioned, that in the spring of 1774, the empress
                    of Russia was pleased to honour him with the present of her picture, drawn in
                    the robes worn in that country in the days of John Bassiliowitz, grand duke of
                    Muscovy, who was contemporary with Queen Elizabeth.</p>
                <p>In 1736 Dr Campbell married Elizabeth, daughter of Mr Benjamin Vobe, of
                    Leominster, in the county of Hereford, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193347614"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-7614-0047"/>with whom he lived nearly forty years in the
                    greatest conjugal harmony and happiness. So wholly did he dedicate his time to
                    books, that he seldom went abroad; but to relieve himself as much as possible
                    from the inconveniences incident to a sedentary life, it was his custom, when
                    the weather permitted, to walk in his garden, or in some room of his house, by
                    way of exercise. By this method, united with the strictest temperance in eating,
                    and an equal abstemiousness in drinking, he enjoyed good health, though his
                    constitution was delicate. His domestic manner of life did not prevent him from
                    cultivating an extensive and honourable acquaintance. His house, especially on a
                    Sunday evening, was the resort of the most distinguished persons of all ranks,
                    and particularly of those who had rendered themselves eminent by their knowledge
                    or love of literature. He received foreigners who were fond of learning with an
                    affability and kindness which excited in them the highest respect and
                    veneration; and his instructive and cheerful conversation made him the delight
                    of his friends. During the latter part of his life he was agent for the province
                    of Georgia in North America, and he died at the close of the year 1775, in the
                    sixty-seventh year of his age. Dr Campbell’s literary knowledge was by no means
                    confined to the subjects which he more particularly treated of as an author. He
                    was well acquainted with the mathematics, and had read much in medicine. He was
                    eminently versed in the different parts of sacred literature, and his
                    acquaintance with the languages extended not only to Hebrew, Greek, and Latin,
                    among the ancient, and to French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch, among
                    the modern; but likewise to the oriental tongues. He was particularly fond of
                    the Greek language. His attainment of such a variety of knowledge was
                    exceedingly assisted by a memory surprisingly retentive, and which indeed
                    astonished every person with whom he was acquainted. In communicating his ideas,
                    he had an uncommon readiness and facility; and the style of his works, which had
                    been formed upon the model of that of the celebrated Bishop Sprat, was
                    perspicuous, easy, flowing, and harmonious. To all these accomplishments of the
                    understanding Dr Campbell joined the more important virtues of a moral and pious
                    character. His disposition was gentle and humane, and his manners kind and
                    obliging. He was a tender husband, an indulgent parent, a kind master, a firm
                    and sincere friend. To his Creator he paid the constant and sincere tribute of
                    devotion and reverence; and in his correspondence he showed that a sense of
                    piety was always nearest his heart.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Campbell,</hi><hi rend="italic">George,</hi> D. D., a
                    distinguished theologian and philosopher, was born at Aberdeen in December 1719.
                    He was educated at the grammar school of that town; and being intended for the
                    profession of the law, he was bound as an apprentice to a writer or clerk to the
                    signet. The love of study, however, prevailed over all opposition. In 1741 he
                    attended divinity lectures at Edinburgh before the term of his apprenticeship
                    had expired, and soon afterwards he became a regular student in the university
                    of Aberdeen, attending the lectures of Professor Lumsden in King’s, and
                    Professor Chalmers in Marischal College. In 1746 he was licensed to preach by
                    the presbytery of Aberdeen. In 1748 he obtained the living of Banchory Ternan,
                    in which situation he married, and was fortunate in possessing a lady remarkable
                    for the sagacity of her understanding, the integrity of her heart, the general
                    propriety of her conduct, and her skill in the management of domestic affairs.
                    Mutual happiness was the consequence of this union, which was not terminated
                    till her death in 1792. In 1757 he was translated to Aberdeen, to be one of the
                    ministers of that town; and in 1759 he was presented to the office of principal
                    of <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Marischal College.</p>
                <p>Mr Hume’s Treatise on Miracles gave the new principal an opportunity of evincing
                    that he was not unworthy of this office. He opposed it in a sermon preached
                    before the provincial synod of Aberdeen in 1760, which he was requested to
                    publish; but he preferred the form of a dissertation, and in that state sent the
                    manuscript to Dr Blair, to be by him communicated to Mr Hume. Availing himself
                    of the remarks of his friends, and of his opponent, he gave it to the world in
                    1763, with a dedication to Lord Bute; but however desirable the patronage of the
                    minister might in other respects be, it proved of very little assistance in
                    giving circulation, in the literary world, to an essay which, from the
                    favourable impressions of Blair and Hume, was eagerly read and universally
                    admired.</p>
                <p>In 1771 he was elected professor of divinity in Marischal College, upon which he
                    resigned his office as one of the ministers of Aberdeen; but as minister of
                    Grayfriars, an office conjoined to the professorship about a century previous to
                    this, he was obliged to preach once every Sunday in one of the established
                    churches. Few persons seem to have entertained truer notions of the office of a
                    teacher in an university than the new professor; and the plan he had in view, on
                    entering upon his lectures, though expressed in rather too strong language, may
                    be recommended to every one who undertakes a similar employment.</p>
                <p>“The nature of my office,” said he, in addressing his pupils, “has been much
                    misunderstood. It is supposed that I am to teach you every thing connected with
                    the study of divinity. I tell you honestly, that I am to teach you nothing. Ye
                    are not school-boys. Ye are young men, who have finished your courses of
                    philosophy, and ye are no longer to be treated as if ye were at school.
                    Therefore, I repeat it, I am to teach you nothing; but, by the grace of God, I
                    will assist you to teach yourselves every thing.”</p>
                <p>In 1771 he published his excellent sermon on the Spirit of the Gospel; and, in
                    1776, appeared his Philosophy of Rhetoric. In this latter year, also, he
                    acquired the friendship of Dr Tucker, by a sermon, then much admired, and very
                    generally read, on the Duty of Allegiance, in which he endeavoured to show that
                    the British colonies in America had no right, either from reason or from
                    Scripture, to throw off their allegiance; and employed those vulgar arguments
                    which, as being purely political, and more especially adapted to the sentiments
                    of the majority of that day, were very improper topics for the pulpit. In 1777
                    he chose a better subject for a discourse, which he published at the request of
                    the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, and in which the success of the
                    first publishers of the gospel is ably treated as a proof of its truth. In 1770,
                    when many of his countrymen, led away by an excess of enthusiasm and fanaticism,
                    were rushing headlong into the antichristian practice of persecution, he
                    published a seasonable address to the people of Scotland, on the alarms which
                    had been raised by the bill in favour of the Roman Catholics. In the same year,
                    also, he published a sermon on the influence of religion on civil society. The
                    last work which he lived to bring before the public was his translation of the
                    Four Gospels, with preliminary dissertations and explanatory notes, of which it
                    is unnecessary to say any thing further in this place than that it is worthy of
                    his talents and character.</p>
                <p>In 1795 he resigned his professorship; and soon afterwards he also resigned the
                    principalship, on a pension of L.300 a year being conferred on him by
                    government. But this pension he possessed for a very short time; for on the 31st
                    of March 1796 his last illness seized him, and on the next morning it was
                    followed by a paroxysm of palsy, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193347627"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-7627-0048"/>which destroyed the power of speech, and under
                    this deprivation he languished till his death. His funeral sermon was preached
                    on the 17th of April by Dr Brown, who had succeeded him in the offices of
                    principal and professor.</p>
