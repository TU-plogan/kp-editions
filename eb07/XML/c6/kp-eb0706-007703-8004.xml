                <p><label type="entry">CANDLE</label>, a small taper of tallow, wax, or spermaceti,
                    the wick of which is commonly of several threads of cotton, spun and twisted
                    together.</p>
                <p>A tallow-candle, to be good, must be half sheep’s and half bullock’s tallow; for
                    hog’s tallow makes the candle gutter, and always gives an offensive smell, with
                    a thick black smoke. The wick ought to be pure, sufficiently dry, and properly
                    twisted, otherwise the candle will emit an inconstant, vibratory flame, which is
                    both prejudicial to the eyes and insufficient for the distinct illumination of
                    objects.</p>
                <p>There are two sorts of tallow-candles; the one dipped, and the other moulded. The
                    former are the common candles; the latter are the invention of the Sieur le
                    Brege at Paris.</p>
                <p>As to the method of making candles in general, after the tallow has been weighed,
                    and mixed in the due proportions, it is cut into very small pieces, that it may
                    melt the sooner; for the tallow in lumps, as it comes from the butchers, would
                    be in danger of burning or turning black if it were left too long over the fire.
                    Being perfectly melted and skimmed, a certain quantity of water, proportionable
                    to the quantity of tallow, is poured into it. This serves to precipitate to the
                    bottom of the vessel the impurities of the tallow which may have escaped the
                    skimmer. No water, however, must be thrown into the tallow designed for the
                    three first dips, because the wick, being still quite dry, would imbibe the
                    water, which makes the candles crackle in burning, and renders them bad in use.
                    The tallow, thus melted, is poured into a tub, through a coarse sieve of horse
                    hair, to purify it still more, and may be used after having stood three hours.
                    It will continue fit for use twenty-four hours in summer and fifteen in winter.
                    The wicks are made of spun cotton, which the tallow-chandlers buy in skains, and
                    which they wind up into bottoms or clues; whence they are cut out, with an
                    instrument contrived on purpose, into pieces of the length of the candle
                    required; then put on the sticks or broaches, or else placed in the moulds, as
                    the candles are intended to be either dipped or moulded.</p>
                <p>Wax-candles are made of a cotton or flaxen wick, slightly twisted, and covered
                    with white or yellow wax. Of these there are several kinds; some of a conical
                    figure, used to illuminate churches, and in processions, funeral ceremonies,
                    &amp;c. (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Taper)</hi>; others of a cylindrical form,
                    used on ordinary occasions. The first are either made with a ladle or the hand.
                    1. To make wax-candles with the ladle: the wicks being prepared, a dozen of them
                    are tied by the neck, at equal distances, round an iron circle, suspended over a
                    large basin of copper tinned, and full of melted wax. A large ladle full of this
                    wax is poured gently on the tops of the wicks one after another, and the
                    operation is continued till the candle arrives at its destined size; with this
                    precaution, that the three first ladles are poured on at the top of the wick,
                    the fourth at the height of three fourths, the fifth at one half, and the sixth
                    at one fourth, in order to give the candle its pyramidal form. Then the candles
                    are taken down, kept warm, and rolled and smoothed upon a walnut-tree table,
                    with a long square instrument of box, smooth at the bottom. 2. As to the manner
                    of making wax-candles by the hand, candle-makers begin to soften the wax by
                    working it several times in hot water contained in a narrow but deep caldron. A
                    piece of the wax is then taken out, and disposed by little and little around the
                    wick, which is hung on a hook in the wall, by the extremity opposite to the
                    neck; so that they begin with the big end, diminishing still as they descend
                    towards the neck. In other respects the method is nearly the same as in the
                    former case. However, it must be observed that, in the former case, water is
                    always used to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193348017" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8017-0078"
                    />moisten the several instruments, to prevent the wax from sticking; and in the
                    latter, oil of olives, or lard, is used for the hands, &amp;c. The cylindrical
                    wax-candlcs are either made as the former, with a ladle, or they are drawn.
                    Waxcandles drawn are so called because they are actually drawn in the manner of
                    wire, by means of two large rollers of wood, turned by a handle, which turning
                    backwards and forwards several times, pass the wick through melted wax contained
                    in a brass basin, and at the same time through the holes of an instrument like
                    that used for drawing wire fastened at one side of the basin.</p>
                <p>The Roman candles were at first little strings dipt in pitch, or surrounded with
                    wax, though afterwards they were made of the papyrus, covered likewise with wax;
                    and sometimes also of rushes, by stripping off the outer rind, and only
                    retaining the pith. For religious offices wax-candles were used; for vulgar
                    uses, those of tallow.</p>
                <p>A few years ago Dr Ure of Glasgow made a set of experiments of the relative
                    intensities of light and duration of different candles, the result of which is
                    contained in the following table.</p>
