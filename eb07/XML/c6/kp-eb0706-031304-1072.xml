                <p><label type="entry">CHAMBERS, <hi rend="smallcaps">David</hi></label>, a Scotch
                    historian, priest, and lawyer, was born in the shire of Ross about the year
                    1530, and educated in the university of Aberdeen. From thence he went to France
                    and Italy, where he continued some time, particularly at Bologna, where in 1556
                    he was a pupil of Mariannus Sozenus.</p>
                <p>After his return to Scotland, he was appointed by Queen Mary, parson of Suddy,
                    and chancellor of Ross. He was soon afterwards employed in digesting the laws of
                    Scotland, and was principally concerned in publishing the acts of parliament of
                    that kingdom by authority in 1566. He was also appointed one of the lords of
                    session, and continued her majesty’s faithful servant till her declining fortune
                    obliged her adherents to seek for refuge in othe∙ kingdoms. Chambers went first
                    to Spain, where he was graciously received by king Philip; and thence travelled
                    to Paris, where he was no less kindly welcomed by Charles IX. of that kingdom,
                    to whom, in 1572, he presented his history of Scotland. He died at Paris in the
                    year 1592, much regretted, says Mackenzie, by all who knew him. His writings
                    were chiefly calculated to assist his royal mistress, and to extol the wisdom of
                    the Scotch nation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chambers,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ephraim,</hi> author of the
                    Cyclopaedia which bears his name, was born at Milton, in the county of
                    Westmoreland. His parents were dissenters of the Presbyterian persuasion, and
                    his education was no other than that common one which is intended to qualify a
                    youth for trade and commerce. λVhen he became of a proper age, he was put as
                    apprentice to Mr Senex the globe-maker, a business which is connected with
                    science, and especially with astronomy<pb break="no" facs="nls:193351085"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-1085-0314"/> and geography. It was during Mr Chambers’
                    residence with this skilful mechanic that he contracted that taste for science
                    and learning which accompanied him through life, and directed all his pursuits.
                    It was even at this time that he formed the design of his great work, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyclopoedia</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and some of the articles
                    of it were written behind the counter. Having conceived the idea of so extensive
                    an undertaking, he justly concluded that the execution of it would not consist
                    with the avocations of trade; and therefore lie quitted Mr Senex, and took
                    chambers at Gray’s Inn, where he chiefly resided during the rest of his days.
                    The first edition of the <hi rend="italic">Cyclopaedia,</hi> which was the
                    result of many years’ intense application, appeared in 1728, in two volumes
                    folio. It was published by subscription, the price being L4. 4s.; and the list
                    of subscribers was exceedingly respectable. The dedication to the king is dated
                    the 15th October 1727. The reputation which Mr Chambers acquired by bis
                    execution of this undertaking procured him the honour of being elected fellow of
                    the Royal Society on the 6th November 1729. In less than ten years time a second
                    edition became necessary, which accordingly was printed, with corrections and
                    additions, in 1738; and it was followed by a third in the course of next
                    year.</p>
                <p>Although the <hi rend="italic">Cyclopoedia</hi> was the grand business of Mr
                    Chambers' life, and may be regarded as almost the sole foundation of his fame,
                    his attention was not wholly confined to this undertaking. He was concerned in a
                    periodical publication entitled <hi rend="italic">The Literary Magazine,</hi>
                    which was begun in 1735. In this work he wrote a variety of articles, and
                    particularly a review of Morgan’s <hi rend="italic">Moral Philosophy.</hi> He
                    was engaged likewise, in conjunction with Mr John Martyn, fellow of the Royal
                    Society, and professor ofbotany at Cambridge, in preparing for the press a
                    translation and abridgment of the Philosophical History and Memoirs of the Royal
                    Academy of Sciences at Paris, or an Abridgment of all the Papers relating to
                    Natural Philosophy which have been published by the Members of that illustrious
                    Society. This undertaking, when completed, was comprised in five volumes 8vo,
                    which did not appear till 1742, some time after our author’s decease, when they
                    were published under the joint names of Mr Martyn and Mr Chambers. In a
                    subsequent publication, Mr Martyn passed a severe censure upon the share which
                    his fellowlabourer had had in the abridgment of the Parisian papers. The only
                    work besides, that we find ascribed to Mr Chambers, is a translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Jesuit’s Perspective,</hi> from the French; which was printed in
                    4to, and has gone through several editions. Mr Chambers’ close and unremitting
                    attention to his studies at length impaired his health, and obliged him
                    occasionally to take a lodging at Canonbury-house, Islington. This not having
                    greatly contributed to his recovery, he made an excursion to the south of
                    France, but did not reap that benefit from it which he had himself hoped, and
                    which his friends wished; for, returning to England, he died at Canonbury-house,
                    and was buried at Westminster, where the following inscription, written by
                    himself, is placed on the north side of the cloisters of the Abbey:</p>
