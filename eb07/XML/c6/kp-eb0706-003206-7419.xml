                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">CAMBRIDGE</label>, the capital of the English county of the
                    same name, stands on the river Cam, which is navigable to the Ouse, and
                    communicates with the sea through the port of Lynn. It is situated on an
                    extensive and not very fertile plain, and is considered a very salubrious
                    situation. Neither the streets nor private buildings have any thing remarkable,
                    but the general appearance of the town has been much improved by the recent
                    additions and embellishments which the colleges have received. The town is
                    governed by a mayor, thirteen aldermen, and twenty-four common-council men. The
                    chief object of attention is its university, which is a corporation of itself,
                    and returns in that capacity two members to the House of Commons, who are chosen
                    by such students as have taken the degree of master of arts, and from whom no
                    landed qualification is required on taking their seat in that assembly. The
                    public library, the senate-house, the printing press, the observatory, and some
                    other establishments, belong to this corporation; and it also possesses power to
                    adopt rules and make regulations for the government of the whole body, as well
                    as to choose the several professors.</p>
                <p>Each college is also a separate corporate body, holding the buildings and
                    libraries, and possessing large funds in money, in land, in houses, and in
                    advowsons, by which the expenses of the several establishments are defrayed, and
                    stipends allowed to the holders of fellowships. The constitutions of these
                    colleges are various, as well as the amount of their property, and the mode in
                    which the scholars, fellows, and masters are appointed and remunerated. Our
                    limits do not admit our describing the wealth,« the inducements to study, or the
                    mode of examination practised in the several colleges; but we may enumerate the
                    names of each of them, and the number of scholarships, fellowships, and
                    advowsons. Is/, St Peter’s was founded in 1257, contains a master, tutors, and
                    bursars, like the others, to be noticed in succession, with fourteen
                    fellowships, forty-eight scholarships, and eleven advowsons. 2d, Clare Hall was
                    founded in 1326; it has ten senior and seven junior fellowships, thirty-eight
                    scholarships, and fifteen advowsons. 3&lt;7, Pembroke Hall has sixteen
                    fellowships, several scholarships under ten pounds, and seven above thirty
                    pounds a year, and ten advowsons. <hi rend="italic">Atlt,</hi> Gonville and

                    founded in 1448, has twenty fellowships, several small scholarships, and ten

                    and fifteen advowsons. 11∕7z, Christ College, founded in 1505: the fellowships

                    12∕A, St John’s College, founded in 1511: the fellowships are fifty-one, the

                    has sixty fellowships, sixty-nine scholarships, and fifty-eight advowsons.
                    15/7/, Emanuel College, founded in 1584, has thirteen fellowships, thirty-six
                    scholarships, and fourteen advowsons. 1 <hi rend="italic">6th,</hi> Sidney
                    Sussex College: this has twelve fellowships, forty-eight scholarships, and six
                    advowsons. 17∕A, Downing College, founded in 1800, has sixteen fellowships, six
                    scholarships, and two advowsons. These seventeen foundations have each their
                    separate chapel, library, and hall, with apartments for the members of the
                    college. They have also college tutors to superintend the morals and tuition of
                    the students, and to maintain the due discipline. There are in all of them
                    private tutors, of which benefit the more aspiring pupils commonly avail
                    themselves. In each house there are prizes distributed corresponding to the rank
                    which the students attain at the examinations.</p>
                <p>As the increase of the value of land has augmented the funds of these colleges,
                    though some of the result of their economy has been applied to the‘purchase of
                    advowsons, other parts have been liberally made use of to enlarge the
                    accommodation for the pupils, or to beautify and adorn the edifices. This has
                    recently been the case in several of the corporations, to the great improvement
                    of the town. There has been a gradual increase in the number of students, who in
                    a few years have risen from 1500 to upwards of 3000; many of whom are now under
                    the necessity of procuring lodging in the town, though they attend at meals and
                    at daily worship in the colleges to which they belong. It is impossible to
                    reduce into a narrow compass the list of interesting objects in this university;
                    but Trinity College, King’s with its wonderful chapel, the senate house, and the
                    new part of St John’s, are all objects exciting great admiration. The number of
                    eminent men produced from this university may be deemed the most convincing
                    proof of the value of the system of education that <pb break="no"

                    of Cambridge amounted in 1811 to 11,108, in 1821 to 14,142, and in 1831 to
                    20,917, including the university. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    respects the first institution of the kind in America. In 1820 the population
                    amounted to 3295.</p>
