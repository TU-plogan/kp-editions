                <p><label type="entry">CASIRI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Michael</hi></label>, a very
                    learned orientalist, of the sect of Syrian Christians called Maronites, was born
                    at Tripoli in Syria in the year 1710. As the sect of Maronites were subject to
                    the pope, Casiri came to study at Rome, and entered into holy orders in 1734. In
                    the following year he proceeded to Syria to assist at a synod of the Maronites.
                    He returned to Rome in 1738, and for ten years thereafter taught the brethren of
                    his convent to read Arabic, Syriac, and Chaldaic, giving lectures also in
                    philosophy and theology. In 1748 he passed into Spain, upon the invitation of
                    Ravago, confessor to Ferdinand VI., and was by his means employed in the royal
                    library at Madrid. In 1749 he was named a member of the royal academy of
                    history; in 1756 he was appointed interpreter of eastern languages to the king,
                    and soon afterwards joint librarian of the Escurial, with a royal pension of 200
                    piastres, besides the ordinary emoluments of the office. In 1763 he became
                    principal librarian, a situation which he appears to have held till his death in
                    1791.</p>
                <p>The only work which entitles Casiri’s name to be recorded among the benefactors
                    of literature is his celebrated <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Arabic
                    Manuscripts,</hi> preserved in the library of which he was keeper. This curious
                    work, entitled <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >AraljicoHispana Escurialensis,</hi> was published in two volumes folio, at
                    Madrid; the first volume in 1760, and the second ten years thereafter. Mr Gibbon
                    expresses himself “happy in possessing a copy of this splendid and interesting
                    work,” which constitutes, indeed, one of the most valuable contributions that
                    modern Europe has yet furnished towards the illustration of eastern literature.
                    The judicious manner in which it is compiled renders it a sort of digest of the
                    attainments of the Saracens in science and literature during the most
                    flourishing eras of their empire. Its contents, as Mr Barington observes, “may,
                    under some of its heads, principally regard Spain; but they will, however, be
                    found adequately to represent the general standard of learning, in its full
                    extent and character, whether at Cordova or Fez, at Cairo or at Bagdad.” (. <hi
                    rend="italic">Literary History of the Middle Ages,</hi> p. 652.)</p>
                <p>The manuscripts described amount to above 1800, and arc classed in the following
                    order: Grammar, Rhetoric, Poetry, Philology and Miscellanies, Lexicos,
                    Philosophy, Politics, Medicine, Natural History, Jurisprudence, Theology,
                    Geography, and History. The two last classes, with a copious index, occupy the
                    whole of the second volume. As a system of bibliography, this arrangement cannot
                    be allowed to be very perfect or scientific; but it was not the learned author’s
                    object to exhibit any such system, though some French bibliographers seem to
                    view his classification in that light, and express no small degree of wonder
                    that an ecclesiastic, in the country of the inquisition, should place so many
                    classes before that of theology, which in their systems generally holds the
                    first place. The title of each manuscript is given in the original Arabic, with
                    a Latin translation, and its age and author, when these are known, are pointed
                    out. But this is not all; the title and description of the work is frequently
                    followed with extracts, also in Arabic and Latin, by which some of the most
                    curious or peculiar features of the piece are brought before the reader, thereby
                    supplying the want of the original, as well to those who could read it if
                    accessible, as to those who could not read it though at hand. The learned author
                    has also collected various interesting and authentic particulars of Saracenic
                    biography, and corrected some prevalent errors regarding the lives of these
                    writers.</p>
                <p>In the preface, which is of considerable length, Casiri gives a general view of
                    his labours, and commemorates the assistance which lie received from the
                    government and from the learned. Rich as the Escurial is in Arabic manuscripts,
                    its present stores are small compared to what they once were; for Casiri
                    mentions that, by a fire which happened in 1670, more than <hi rend="italic"
                    >three thousand</hi> of these interesting pieces were consumed. They who have
                    not access to this valuable work will find a full view of its contents, with
                    some political comments, in the first appendix to Harris’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philological Inquiries,</hi> and in the second appendix to Barington’s <hi
