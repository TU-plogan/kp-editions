                <p><label type="entry">CALENDER</label>, a mechanical engine employed by
                    cloth-lappers, for dressing and finishing cloths and stuffs of various
                    descriptions and fabrics, before exposure to sale, or delivery to purchasers. It
                    is also used by calico-printers, in order to extend and smooth the surface of
                    their cloths, after they have been bleached, and before they are subjected to
                    the operations of the printing table or copperplate press.</p>
                <p>In all cases two, and in many three requisites must be attained, in order to give
                    to cloth that appearance which it is deemed necessary that it should possess, to
                    attract the eye and gratify the fancy of the purchaser and consumer.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of these requisites consists in as perfect
                    extension and smoothness of surface as can be attained; so that no wrinkle or
                    doubled folding may remain in it, excepting such as shall afterwards be
                    intentionally made, in order to the reducing of it to the proper form and
                    shape.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">second</hi> requisite acquired by the calendering of cloth,
                    is the compression of the yarn or threads of which the texture is composed,
                    which in some degree divests them of their cylindrical shape, and reduces them
                    to a degree of flatness, which, by bringing them more closely into contact with
                    each other, gives to the fabric a greater appearance of closeness and strength
                    than it would otherwise possess. The operation of the calender also improves the
                    superficial appearance, by flattening down all knots, lumps, and other
                    imperfections, from which no material from which cloth is fabricated can ever be
                    entirely freed during the previous processes of spinning and weaving.</p>
                <p>And, <hi rend="italic">thirdly,</hi> in many fabrics it is desirable, and
                    esteemed a great addition to the effect and beauty of the superficial
                    appearance, that cloth should receive, by means of friction, an additional
                    lustre or polish, which is generally distinguished by the appellation of
                    glazing, and is chiefly required in those stuffs which are employed in the
                    ornamental descriptions of female attire.</p>
                <p>Such, in a strictly limited sense, are the sole and exclusive effects resulting
                    from the mechanical operation of the calender; but, as other operations besides
                    smoothing or glazing are necessary for the proper preparation of cloths for the
                    market, these also are carried on by the same persons, and in the same premises.
                    Hence by a natural, although not strictly correct, extension of its acceptation,
                    the term calender, which really means only the chief mechanical engine employed,
                    gives the general name to the whole establishment where all the varied
                    operations of cloth-lapping are carried on; and it is as usual to say that goods
                    are <hi rend="italic">packed,</hi> as that goods are <hi rend="italic"
                    >dressed,</hi> at a calender. In the illustration, therefore, of those
                    operations which the limits of this article will admit, the first object will be
                    to convey a distinct idea of the principles, construction, and operation of the
                    principal machinery employed; and then to add such general and miscellaneous
                    observations as may serve to elucidate how the business of cloth-lapping is
                    carried on in its present extended form.</p>
                <p>For the purpose of smoothing both surfaces of a piece <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193347237" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7237-0018"/>of cloth, it is necessary
                    that they should be exposed to ’ universal contact and pressure in every point,
                    with some body of sufficient density to acquire the requisite degree of
                    superficial polish. Such equality of surface, however, as will produce this
                    effect, is not very easily attainable in large plane surfaces. Hence the contact
                    of cylinders in this operation has been found to be in all respects infinitely
                    preferable to that of planes, both in the speed and the effect of the operation.
                    The common domestic smoothing iron is the most simple of all calendering
                    utensils; but, even in the application of its small and limited surface, it
                    would be difficult to procure any table or board sufficiently level to bring the
                    whole cloth into equal contact with the iron, without the intervention of a few
                    folds of blanket, or some other thick and soft woollen cloth.</p>
                <p>The old and now almost entirely superseded machine termed a <hi rend="italic"
                    >mangle</hi> gives the most simple and rude approximation towards cylindrical
                    calendering, and the substitution of circular for plane surfaces. Its operation
                    is that of a cylinder applied to a plane, upon which it is rolled backward and
                    forward, until some degree of smoothness is produced by this reciprocating
                    motion. It is, therefore, very analogous in principle to the common gardener’s
                    roller, with which land is resmoothed after having been dug up for sowing or
                    other agricultural purposes.</p>
                <p>The smoothing calender completes the substitution of cylindrical for plane
                    surfaces, all the parts which operate upon the cloth being of that form. This
                    ingenious engine, which was introduced into Britain from Flanders and Holland,
                    during the persecution of the Huguenots, has, since its introduction and
                    adoption here, undergone no very material or important alteration or improvement
                    in point of theoretical principle; nor, until the extension of the cotton
                    manufacture had introduced a general spirit of mechanical improvement, had it
                    received any great amelioration in practical execution. Two very important
                    improvements have, however, since that period been introduced and adopted. The
                    first of these, which originated in Lancashire, is now almost universally
                    employed. The second was invented at Glasgow.</p>
                <p>The scope of the former of these improvements consists in the substitution of
                    pasteboard in the place of wood, in constructing three out of the five cylinders
                    of which the engine is composed. These cylinders, when previously composed of
                    wood, were found to be liable to two serious and important objections. Calenders
                    employed in general business are necessarily subjected to frequent alternations
                    and vicissitudes of heat and cold. These are entirely unavoidable, because, in
                    smoothing or dressing cloths of the denser fabrics, the effect, as in the common
                    operation of ironing linens, is found to be greatly heightened by the
                    application of as great a degree of heat as can safely be communicated without
                    danger to the fabrics which are to be smoothed.</p>
                <p>The expansion of every thread which composes a given extent of cloth, although
                    individually indistinguishable, even with microscopic aid, produces very
                    considerable general effect, when exerted upon eight or ten thousand of these
                    minute cylindrical substances, all combined together in the space of one single
                    square yard. In this expanded state, the pressure of the calender divests them
                    more easily of their cylindrical form, and flattens them down until they come
                    more closely into contact than before. This effect, which is in exact unison
                    with the general theories of expansion and contraction, will at once produce an
                    apparent increase of closeness and density to the texture, as well as of gloss
                    to the surfaces; although the former is in fact deceptive, as no <hi
                    rend="italic">real</hi> acquisition of strength to the fabric can thus be
                    obtained. The apparent density of fabric, as well as a higher accession of
                    gloss, is also frequently obtained by impregnating and stiffening the cloth,
                    after ' it has been bleached, with a mucilage of starch; and this is ’ too
                    frequently carried to a very unfair height, for the purposes of deception, which
                    is not very easily detected, until the cloth be again exposed to moisture, when
                    the delusive appearance instantly vanishes. Hence, in all dense fabrics, the
                    calender is generally used in a heated state; whilst in flimsy fabrics, in which
                    transparency of appearance is more the requisite than strength, the operation is
                    conducted with the calender perfectly cold.</p>
                <p>The effect of these frequent and sudden transitions upon wooden cylinders was
                    necessarily productive both of <hi rend="italic">fissure</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">warping</hi> or <hi rend="italic">twisting</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and no care in drying or seasoning the wood before turning could
                    entirely remove these defects. The substitution of pasteboard, however, afforded
                    a radical cure for both, as well as a collateral advantage arising from its
                    being susceptible of a much higher degree of superficial polish, which is always
                    transferred to the cloth.</p>
                <p>The paper or pasteboard cylinder, besides total exemption from all defects
                    incidental to ligneous substances, from the immense density of which it is
                    susceptible by compression, presents a superficies capable of receiving and
                    retaining an almost unparalleled smoothness and polish.</p>
                <p>In order to construct cylinders of this description, an axis of malleable iron,
                    and two circular plates of cast iron, are, in the first place, provided. In
                    these plates, which must be at least from one to two inches thick, there are six
                    equidistant perforations near to the circumference, each capable of admitting a
                    rod of malleable iron at least three fourths of an inch in diameter. The entire
                    space between the two iron plates is then to be filled with circular pieces of
                    the strongest pasteboard, exceeding by about one inch in diameter the iron
                    plates, and having each a correspondent perforation, through which the six iron
                    rods may pass parallel to the axis. A cylinder is thus formed, the substance of
                    which is of pasteboard locked together by plates of iron at the extremities, and
                    susceptible, by means of screws on the extremities of the six connecting rods,
                    of immense compression. After undergoing this preparation, the cylinder is
                    exposed to strong beat in a confined apartment; and, as the pasteboard daily
                    contracts, the screws are every day tightened for the space of some weeks. The
                    density of the cylinder is thus increased, whilst it is contracted in length
                    upon the axis, for which contraction adequate allowance must be made in its
                    original measure, and the operation is continued until it has gradually acquired
                    the requisite compression. It is then re-exposed to the ordinary temperature of
                    the atmosphere, and by its re-expansion presents a body almost inconceivably
                    compact, its specific gravity in this state being greater than even that of
                    silver. The only operation now required is that of turning its superficies until
                    correctly cylindrical; and this is a work of immense labour and patience.</p>
                <p>The rotatory motion in turning does not exceed forty or fifty revolutions per
                    minute; and the turner requires two or three assistants constantly employed in
                    sharpening his tools. When properly finished and smoothed, a pasteboard
                    cylinder, however, amply compensates, by its strength, its gloss, and its
                    durability, for the great labour and expense which its construction has
                    created.</p>
                <p>A second practical improvement in calenders of the common description consists in
                    the substitution of cast iron for wood in the construction of the connecting
                    frames. This improvement is now common to almost every description of machinery;
                    and when applied to the calender, it is of more than usual advantage, because,
                    independently of the accession* of strength and diminution of space occupied,
                    the total exemption of iron from warping is of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193347250" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7250-0019"/>peculiar advantage in an
                    engine so rapidly exposed to alteration of temperature as the calender must be.
                    The entire exemption of iron framing from combustion forms also another
                    advantage of some importance in an engine frequently heated by the application
                    of red-hot cylinders of iron. With this cursory outline of general improvement,
                    the next object of the present article is to afford a description of the new
                    glazing calender.</p>
                <p>Previously to the introduction of this improvement, the operation of glazing,
                    although performed sufficiently well, was somewhat tedious, being effected
                    almost exclusively by the mere application of manual labour. It was performed
                    upon a table, the cover of which was oblique to the horizon, forming with it an
                    angle of 15° or 20°. The cloth being stretched on this, and a quantity of wax
                    being thinly spread on its surface, the glazing was effected by the
                    reciprocation of a smoothed flint, vibrating at the end of a rod, somewhat
                    similar to the oscillations of a pendulum. The centre of oscillation was also
                    movable on a spring, in order to reduce the arc of vibration to a plane, and
                    keep the flint in uniform contact with the cloth. But a man’s power was
                    competent to glaze only a few inches in breadth at once, and it was only by
                    successive shiftings that the whole breadth was successively brought under the
                    friction of the flint. The glazing calender produces the same effect, with
                    increased uniformity, simply by changing the relative velocities of the
                    cylinders to each other, and generating friction, as well as pressure, at the
                    points of contact. The process of flint glazing is still practised in
                    Manchester, but on a large scale, the operation being carried on by means of
                    steam power.</p>
                <p>The following is a description of the new glazing calender. Fig. 1, Plate CXLIII.
                    is en elevation of a five-rollered calender for finishing cloth. AA are two
                    paper rollers, of twenty inches diameter each. BB are two cast-iron cylinders,
                    externally turned until perfectly smooth; their diameter is eight inches,
                    allowing the substance of iron to be two inches, and leaving a perforation of
                    four inches diameter. C is a paper roller of fourteen inches diameter; DD is the
                    framing of cast iron for containing the bushes in which the journals of the
                    rollers revolve; EE are two levers by which the rollers are firmly pressed
                    together while the cloth is passing through.</p>
                <p>Fig. 2 is an end view of the same calender, with the wheels for glazing cloth.
                    The wheel on the upper cylinder is ten inches diameter, the wheel on the under
                    cylinder is thirteen inches diameter, both connected by the wheel F, which
                    communicates the speed of the upper cylinder, so that the wheel on the under
                    cylinder being nearly one third of an inch more in diameter, the difference of
                    their motions retards the centre paper roller, by which means the upper cylinder
                    passes over the cloth one third faster than the cloth passes through the
                    calender, and polishes it in consequence.</p>
                <p>Fig. 3 is a perspective view of a hydrostatic press. A, the piston, eight inches
                    diameter, working in the cylinder B, and kept water-tight by passing through a
                    collar of leather; D, a cast-iron plate raised by the piston A, between which
                    and the entablature EE the goods to be pressed arc laid; CCCC, four malleable
                    iron columns, 2f th inches diameter, having screwed ends, with nuts, by which
                    the entablature and the base FF are firmly connected together. G, a cistern for
                    holding water to supply the two force-pumps HI, the largest of which has a
                    piston 11 inch diameter, and the other one of half an inch diameter, which is
                    used to give the highest pressure; KK, weights to balance the pump-handles which
                    fit into the sockets at <hi rend="italic">ll.</hi> The pistons of the
                    force-pumps are made water-tight by collars of leather, kept in their place by

                <p>For dressing muslins, gauzes, lawns, and other goods of the light and transparent
                    fabrics, a smaller species of calender is employed. It consists of only three
                    cylinders of equal diameters (generally about six inches), and is easily moved
                    by a common winch or handle. The middle cylinder is iron, and the others are
                    wood or pasteboard. They are of equal diameters, and are moved with equal
                    velocities by small wheels. This machine is always used in a cold state.</p>
                <p>The folding of cloth is so entirely regulated by fashion, that no precise rules
                    can be laid down for its regulation. In general, as all the different
                    manufactures of cloth have been imported from other countries, the original
                    foldings have been copied to complete the resemblance. In the infant state
                    of.imitation there was probably some policy in this, but the continuance may be
                    ascribed almost exclusively to the power of habit. Preservation and portability
                    are the main requisites to be attained by folding; and these are attained by
                    subjecting the cloth, when folded, to a very powerful compression.</p>
                <p>Water-presses upon the forcing principle of Mr Bramah, or acted upon by the
                    pressure of a column of water, arc now in general use in Glasgow and Manchester.
                    Besides the immense power thereby procured, the labour of pressing is much
                    lessened. No improvements that have taken place in calendering can exceed the
                    power and facility of the water-press; one of these presses is generally wrought
                    by two men, who can with great ease work the press so as to produce a pressure
                    of four hundred tons; and thereby the appearance and finish of the goods, in
                    consequence of such an immense weight acting on them, are materially improved.
                    Not only this, but the Bramah press is also used for the purpose of packing,
                    which has increased the method of packing in bales considerably. The bale is
                    commonly packed, roped, &amp;c. while in a compressed state; the dimensions are
                    therefore greatly diminished from what they would otherwise be by any other
                    method; for instance, the same quantity of goods packed in a bale would be one
                    third less in size than if they were packed in a box.</p>
                <p>To the mechanical art of calendering it is found expedient, in the extended
                    states of commerce, to add many of the operations of packing, sheeting, and
                    preparing goods for shipment; and these generally form a branch of the
                    establishment. In order to suit the great extent and va·« ricty of manufacture
                    practised in Britain, and to adapt these to the prevalent tastes and views of
                    the extensive range of consumers to be supplied, a multiplicity of foldings or
                    lappings has been necessarily adopted, few of which probably possess much claim
                    to entire originality. The high, and perhaps pre-eminent, station which the
                    productions of the British looms have gradually attained, seem to be rather the
                    effect of assiduous and enterprising industry, than of great originality of
                    invention, or precedence in mechanical improvement. Certainly she can, at the
                    utmost, boast of only one <hi rend="italic">raw material,</hi> from which cloth
                    is manufactured, as peculiarly indigenous.</p>
                <p>At an early period, no doubt, the British wool had attracted the peculiar
                    attention of economistsand statesmen as of paramount value; and the prohibition
                    of its exportation became an object of legislative enactment. That manufacture,
                    therefore, has long been the staple of England, as the linen trade, at a later
                    period, has become that of Ireland.</p>
                <p>The attempts to introduce both of these branches of industry into Scotland,
                    although, during the latter part of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193347263"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-7263-0020"/>the last century, they engrossed much of the
                    attention both of public bodies and of patriotic individuals, cannot be regarded
                    as having proved eminently successful; and the progress actually made has been
                    almost entirely superseded and extinguished by the more recent introduction of
                    the cotton manufacture.</p>
                <p>The latter branch of industry, since the splendid invention of spinning by the
                    aid of machinery, has indeed made most rapid advances in every part of the
                    united kingdom, and has attained to a height which has, perhaps, absorbed a
                    greater portion of national industry than consumers can easily be found to
                    employ. The extension of external commerce has constantly supplied the raw
                    material at easy and generally moderate rates; and even the India Company have
                    long ceased to oppose to it any very formidable competition in the market.</p>
                <p>The silk manufactures of Britain formerly were not carried on to a very great
                    extent; they have now, however, increased considerably. Whatever may have,
                    directly or indirectly, tended to regulate the finishing, folding, and preparing
                    of British goods for the various markets of consumption, will chiefly refer to
                    the three former branches of manufacture.</p>
                <p>Extensively as the woollen trade is carried on, it is in a great measure absorbed
                    either by internal or colonial consumption, and does not, therefore, enter so
                    generally into actual competition with the cloths of other nations, as to render
                    it either peculiarly desirable that its marketable aspect should be either
                    servilely copied from those of other countries, or very peculiarly distinguished
                    from them. The chief object appears to have generally been, to prevent the
                    intrusion of foreign cloths and stuffs into our own markets; and hence adopting
                    their usual folds into such rolls as most effectually preserve the dressed
                    surface from acute cresses, is found to be most expedient and convenient, the
                    goods being distinguished by letters denoting them to be “British manufacture”
                    on the ends of the pieces.</p>
                <p>In the Irish manufactures of cambrics and linens, the case is almost entirely
                    reversed. From the superiority of climate, the French flax is admitted to be of
                    finer appearance; and although the importation of manufactured cambrics be
                    strictly prohibited, the restraint during periods of peace has always been
                    considerably evaded, in consequence of the demand experienced, and the
                    reputation in which they are held. Indeed it was found generally most expedient,
                    by many retailers, to sell Irish cambrics under the title of French, and hence
                    the fold was correctly imitated. The pieces, after being folded into lengths of
                    about twelve inches, and twice laterally doubled, until the whole breadth of
                    thirty-four inches was reduced to about eight and a half inches, were subjected
                    to a powerful compression in the press until fully flattened. They were then
                    packed in purple coloured wrappers or papers, and a small engraved card or
                    ticket was attached to each piece, specifying the length, generally about eight
                    or eight and a half yards. The cards were attached by a silken string, so as to
                    be easily cut away with a penknife or pair of scissors, in order to avoid
                    seizure; and French or Irish goods were sold indiscriminately as “foreign
                    cambrics.” Custom has even carried this practice farther; and cotton cambrics,
                    which are avowedly <hi rend="italic">British manufacture,</hi> and subjected to
                    no risk whatever, because easily distinguishable from any cambric manufactured
                    from flax, are put up into the same folds, papered, and ticketed, in exactly the
                    same manner.</p>
                <p>In linens, hollands, and sheetings, whether of foreign or Irish manufacture, the
                    same fold is also employed; and in cotton shirtings and sheetings it is closely
                    imitated. The form is that of a cylindric roll, somewhat flattened by subsequent
                    compression; and, in general, all dense fabrics, whether of linen or of cotton,
                    are rolled up and compressed in a similar manner, the object of which is
                    evidently safety and diminution of space in land carriage or exportation.</p>
                <p>In others of the extensive varieties of cotton cloths of British manufacture,
                    some are avowed imitations of the manufactures of Hindustan, whilst others
                    profess no such imitation. Very few among the manufactures of Lancashire are
                    either distinguished by Indian names, or copied from Indian cloths, although
                    some of great extent are directly so. Calicoes, cossacs, and jaconets, for
                    printing, as well as Ballusore, Bandana, and Pullicate handkerchiefs, are
                    amongst the leading articles of the latter description; whilst among the former
                    may be classed the very extensive manufactures of corduroys, thicksetts,
                    velveretts, velveteens, &amp;c. although their origin is also probably Asiatic,
                    but because well known and manufactured by the Genoese, French, and other
                    European nations, even before the discoveries of De Gama and other mariners had
                    first laid open the maritime intercourse with India by the Cape of Good
                    Hope.</p>
                <p>When, at a period infinitely more recent; the splendid invention of spinning
                    cotton by the agency of machinery to any degree of fineness afforded new scope
                    to the British weaver, the imitation of the lighter Indian fabrics fell chiefly
                    into the hands of the Scottish weavers, for executing which they had been in a
                    considerable degree previously prepared, by their habits of weaving lawns in
                    imitation of the French, as well as their lighter fabrics of silk and thread
                    gauzes. To their share, in consequence, fell the bouks, mulls, and japuns,
                    almost exclusively, as well as the lighter jaconets, designed for ornament from
                    the needle and tambour frame. And whilst they have made no successful attempt to
                    compete with their Lancashire brethren in the dense fabrics of corduroys,
                    quiltings, and other ponderous articles, they have shared with them the
                    manufacture of the middling textures of cambrics, Pullicates, and ginghams.</p>
                <p>Indeed, whatever prepossession may, at an early period, have existed in favour of
                    the real Indian fabrics, it has now so. entirely subsided as to possess no
                    influence whatever in swaying general opinion. The British workmanship has
                    proved itself long ago so decisively superior to the Indian, both in spinning·
                    and weaving, as to eradicate every doubt in the minds of all who are really
                    competent to decide the question of comparative superiority. Still, however,
                    candour will compel us to allow that the Indian possesses advantages in the rich
                    qualities of his cotton, and the brilliancy of some of his dyes, which, in some
                    degree, compensate for the immense superiority of the British skill and
                    machinery, and which, to those who examine superficially, may appear to entitle
                    him to the preference.</p>
                <p>Nothing, therefore, exists in the cotton manufacture which could, in general
                    cases, prompt to a servile imitation of external appearance for the purposes of
                    deception; and the Indian mode of lapping their cloth is too rude and laborious
                    to admit of its being copied as a matter of convenience. Their method consists
                    merely in doubling a piece of twenty yards, to reduce its length to ten yards,
                    which is again doubled, in order to reduce it to five; and thus they continue to
                    redouble, until the piece be reduced to a moderate length, capable of being
                    contained in a chest or bale. Thus often redoubled, an Indian piece cannot be
                    examined throughout unless the whole piece be again unfolded; and this, in large
                    transactions, would be utterly impracticable.</p>
                <p>British muslins are folded generally to a yard in length, with a small allowance
                    for extra measure; and as the folding is alternately from right to left, every
                    part can be <pb break="no" facs="nls:193347276" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7276-0021"
                    />instantly examined upon a table or counter, every fold opening as easily as
                    the leaves of a book in its uncut state. The piece, when folded, is reduced by
                    doubling it longitudinally to about nineteen inches, and it is then folded
                    across to the breadth of about thirteen inches. An ordinary sized trunk, 39 × 19
                    inches, thus contains three layers of pieces, in which package goods for
                    exportation to the colonies are generally packed, the trunk there forming an
                    article of merchandise as much in general demand as the muslins which it
                    contains.</p>
                <p>Even the Indian ornaments of gilt silver threads which were at first woven into
                    one end of each piece, although they did not exceed the value of twopence each,
                    have been either greatly curtailed, or totally given up upon principles of
                    economy. Even the cost of this trivial ornament has been computed to have
                    amounted annually in Glasgow and Paisley to about L.30,000.</p>
                <p>Pullicate and other handkerchiefs are most commonly folded up in dozens. For the
                    African and some other foreign trades, pieces containing only eight
                    handkerchiefs are preferred. These are still imitations of Indian precedents,
                    confined to markets where competition continues to exist, not only with the
                    British Company, but with Americans and others trading to India. A species of
                    pale orange-coloured India handkerchiefs, distinguished by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Mudxus,</hi> being in extensive reputation in the Caraccas and
                    other Spanish settlements in South America at the period of the capture of
                    Trinidad in 1795, patterns were procured by some British traders, who ordered
                    very large quantities to be manufactured in Scotland of the same quality and
                    appearance. With such effect were these imitated in texture, in dye, in
                    finishing, and even in the packages, that some hundreds of pieces sent to London
                    for exportation were actually seized at the customhouse as India goods, either
                    illegally imported, or stolen from some of the Company’s ships in the river. A
                    scrutiny, however, clearly ascertained that these goods were not Indian, but
                    British, and that no trespass against either the privileges or the property of
                    the Company had been even attempted. The goods were of course released, and
                    permitted to proceed to their destination, where, after examination and trial,
                    it was found totally unnecessary longer to conceal their real origin; and a very
                    extensive trade, through direct channels, has been since carried on for similar
                    goods.</p>
                <p>From the above general and cursory sketch, it will be obvious that the management
                    of an extensive calendering establishment will require, on the part of its
                    conductor, not only a competent knowledge and experience of the mechanical
                    operations and duties of his particular profession, but that a more extensive
                    mercantile acquaintance with the demands, habits, and tastes of particular
                    markets, will conduce equally to his own interests and those of his employers.
                    From the variations of markets, and fluctuations of mercantile transactions,
                    there can be no precise or definite limit to the extent of such knowledge. It is
                    only by constant attention and sedulous inquiry that he can preserve accuracy in
                    what is liable to almost daily change. His immediate employers will no doubt be
                    often both able and desirous to supply him with this. But as even they must
                    sometimes be liable to error or deception, he ought to omit no opportunity of
                    extending his inquiries, and arriving, as nearly as he can, at the most
                    comprehensive and unambiguous information.</p>
