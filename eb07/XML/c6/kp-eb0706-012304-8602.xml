                <p>The laws of the Franks were enacted “coňsensu populi, constitutione regis.”
                    Liberty was the chief inheritance of the ancient people of Germany, nor were
                    they governed by laws which they had no share in enacting. It has been remarked
                    by Dr Stuart that “the short, but comprehensive and sentimental work of Tacitus,
                    on the manners of Germany, is the key to the institutions, the Capitularies, and
                    the codes of the barbarians.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    opinion of the same able jurist, the foundation and principles of the
                    Anglo-Saxon constitution are to be found in the institutions and manners of the
                    ancient Germans; and he has accordingly endeavoured to trace the most essential
                    principles of that constitution to the forests of Germany. But the national
                    assemblies of those who were capable and worthy of bearing arms, appear to have
                    been gradually superseded by a select council, composed of the two orders of the
                    clergy and nobility; and if the great body of the people attended their
                    deliberations, it seems to have been more in the capacity of spectators, than of
                    actual legislators. This was the form of the constitution in the time of
                    Charlemagne, in whose name a great proportion of the Capitularies are
                    promulgated, though some of them belong to a more recent, and others to a much
                    more early period, the collection commencing with an enactment of King
                    Childebert, dated in the year 554. The Capitularies are written in the Latin
                    language, and this task was doubtless performed by the ecclesiastics. The Latin
                    copies were deposited among the national archives, but the laws were divulged to
                    the people in their mother tongue.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Savigny, whose name ought to be familiar to all those who study the history or
                    jurisprudence of the middle ages, has supplied us with the following statement:
                    “The imperial ordinances of the Franks, <hi rend="italic">Capitularia,</hi>
                    which, after the extension of their empire, were distinguished from the national
                    laws, <hi rend="italic">Leges,</hi> arose from the enlargement of the same
                    principle. All royal enactments, particularly in later times, were called
                    Capitularia, or Capitula. The king had a double character; the one, as chief of
                    each individual tribe, and the other as head of the whole nation. Hence the
                    Capitularies also are of two classes; thqse defining the law of a particular
                    race; e. g. “Capitula addita ad Legem Salicam,” and those of general application
                    over the whole Frank territory. In the kingdom of the Franks, with which so many
                    different nations were incorporated, the Capitularies are so frequently general,
                    under the Carlovingian dynasty, that when their character is not specially
                    fixed, they may be understood as belonging to that class. In Lombardie Italy, on
                    the contrary, where the Lombards and Romans were the only distinct people, most
                    of the ordinances of Charles and his successors must be understood as
                    constituting exclusively Lombardie law. For this reason, probably, they have
                    been inserted in all the early collections of that law, and were consequently
                    never obligatory on the Romans.—It is, however, of great importance to determine
                    accurately the limits of the general Capitularies. The laws of the race of
                    Charlemagne have been erroneously supposed to apply to all the subjects of their
                    extensive empire. These princes rcigned over three distinct kingdoms, the
                    Frankish, Lombardic, and that which, under the name of Rome and the Exarchate,
                    had recently constituted part of the Greek empire. No Capitulary, however
                    general, could overstep the boundaries of that state in which it had originated.
                    The only exceptions to this rule were some clerical laws; and their universal
                    validity arose from the unity of the church, and from the common old
                    ecclesiastical<pb break="no" facs="nls:193348615" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8615-0124"/>
                    authorities, on which they were founded. No example of a similarly general
                    application is found in any of the temporal ordinances.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>The earliest editor of the Capitularies was Vitus Amer-pachius, who published at
                    Ingolstadt, in the year 1545, “Praecipuae Constitutiones Caroli Magni de Rebus
                    ecclesiasticis et civilibus.” The history of the various editions we cannot here
                    detail, but must refer our more inquisitive readers to the copious and elaborate
                    preface of Baluze, who has himself surpassed all preceding and all subsequent
                    editors. His great collection appeared under the following title: “Capitularia

                    Bibliothecae v. cl Stephani Baluzii Tutelensis.” Paris. 1719, 2 tom 8vo. This
                    library contained 10,799 printed books, and many hundred manuscripts. Of one of
                    his ewly publications, which we had no opportunity of inspecting, we have copied
                    a French title from Nk∙eron, but the work is written in Latin: “Disquisitio

                    mentioned in p. 333.</p></note> “Nova editio, auction ac emendation ad fidem
