                    distance from the western coast of Africa, in the Atlantic Ocean. They are
                    thirteen in all; but only three, Grand Canary, Teneriffe, and Fuerteventura, can
                    be called large; Palma, Lancerota, Gomera, and Ferro, are comparatively small;
                    while Graciosa, Rocca, Allegranza, St Clara, Inferno, and Lobos, are little more
                    than rocks. They lie between 29. 26. and 27. 39. north latitude, and 13. 20. and
                    18. 10. west longitude. This group was imperfectly<pb break="no"

                    celebrated by them under the appellation of “the Fortunate Islands.” Ptolemy
                    made them his first meridian, in which he has been followed by many of the
                    moderns. They were, however, in a great measure forgotten, till, in 1344, Louis
                    de la Cerda, infant of Spain, procured a donation of them from the Romish see;
                    and several expeditions were sent to take possession of them, but were for some
                    time repulsed with loss. In 1402, however, John de Bethencourt, a French
                    nobleman, made himself master of Lancerota and Ferro. In 1464 Herrera, a
                    Castilian gentleman, who had married the heiress of Bethencourt, landed with a
                    larger force on Canary and Teneriffe. Fresh reinforcements were continually
                    sent; and after a long and chequered struggle with the Guanches, the brave
                    native inhabitants, the latter were completely subdued; and through the combined
                    action of the sword and the inquisition the race was finally exterminated. M.
                    Bory de St Vincent has published his <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Fortunate
                    Islands,</hi> in which, besides giving the result of his own observations, he
                    has collected, with great industry, all that is to be found in the Spanish
                    writers on the subject. Μ. de Humboldt, also, who in his way to South America
                    ascended the Peak of Teneriffe, has communicated, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Personal Narrative,</hi> a number of learned and curious remarks.</p>
                <p>It is not proposed to follow Μ. Bory de St Vincent into his speculation
                    concerning the ancient Atlantic continent, of which the Canaries appear to him
                    to have composed a fragment, because the whole theory seems to us destitute of
                    any solid foundation. He has collected, however, from the early Spanish
                    historians, a variety of particulars respecting that singular people the
                    Guanches. They appear to have considerably surpassed in civilization both the
                    inhabitants of the West India islands and those of the opposite* continent of
                    Africa. The most remarkable of their customs, and of which monuments still
                    remain, was that of embalming the bodies of their dead. This operation was
                    performed by extracting the intestines, washing the whole body with salt water,
                    and filling the large cavities with aromatic plants. The bodies were then dried
                    in the heat of the sun, or, if that was wanting, in a stove. Where this method
                    was too expensive, corrosive liquids, calculated to destroy the intestines, were
                    merely poured down the throat previous to desiccation. The embalming was
                    completed usually in about fifteen days, after which the body was sewed up in
                    several folds of goat-skin, placed in a chest or coffin cut out of a single
                    piece of wood, and finally lodged in a grotto excavated from the rock, the
                    entrance of which was carefully guarded. These mummies, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >xaxos</hi> as they are called, when found at the present day, are of a tanned
                    colour, and usually of an agreeable odour. They are often perfectly well
                    preserved, particularly the hair; the features are distinct, but drawn back; and
                    the belly is sunk. On being taken out of the goat-skins, and exposed to the air,
                    they fall gradually into dust.</p>
                <p>The Spanish authors have translated some specimens of the poetry of the Guanches,
                    which display considerable imagination and sensibility. The females appear to
                    have been treated with a respect very unusual among savage tribes. In the island
                    of Lancerota a plurality of husbands is said to have prevailed, as in Thibet.
                    There were a species of vestal priestesses, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Malgades,</hi> who were held in the utmost veneration, and supposed to enjoy
                    peculiar communication with the divinity. The form of government was highly
                    aristocratic. A tradition prevailed that the nobles were created first, and had
                    the property of the earth and of all its productions vested in them; after which
                    a supplementary creation took place of beings destined solely to perform the
                    office of slaves. They had a king, however, but of limited power. There are
                    reports of the existence among the Guanches of a race of giants; and the Spanish
                    annals mention one chief who was nine, and another who was fourteen feet in
                    height; but these are evidently fables, such as may be found in the early
                    traditions of every nation.</p>
                <p>The Guanches have long been entirely extinct. They made a vigorous resistance to
                    the invaders; but the sword of the Spaniards, aided by a pestilential disorder,
                    soon swept entirely this ancient population from the face of these islands.</p>
                <p>The information furnished by Humboldt relates chiefly to the physical aspect and
                    present state of the Canaries. In ascending the Peak of Teneriffe he found five
                    zones of vegetation. The first was that of vines, rising about two or three
                    hundred toises above the sea, and forming the only part of the island which is
                    much inhabited or carefully cultivated. Here corn, the vine, the olive, the
                    fruit trees of Europe, the date, the plantain, the Indian fig, the <hi
                    rend="italic">arum</hi><hi rend="italic">colocasia,</hi> are found in a
                    flourishing state. The bread-fruit, cinnamon, coffee, and cocoa, have been tried
                    with success. The second zone, or that of the laurels, contains the wooded part
                    of Teneriffe. It contains four species of laurel, an oak resembling the <hi
                    rend="italic">quercus</hi><hi rend="italic">Turneri</hi> of Thibet, a native
                    olive, the largest tree of this zone, and several species of myrtle. The third
                    zone, beginning at the height of 900 toises, and extending 400 upwards, consists
                    entirely of a vast pine forest. The tree resembled the Scotch fir; but Μ.
                    Humboldt not having an opportunity of examining the fructification, could not
                    determine whether there was any thing peculiar in the species. The fourth and
                    fifth zones, called those of the Rétama and the Gramina, consist of an immense
                    plain, or rather sea, of sand, covered with pumice stones and large blocks of
                    obsidian. In its lower part are scattered tufts of the retama <hi rend="italic"
                    >(spartiurn nu-bigenum</hi> of Alton), a beautiful plant, whose odoriferous
                    flowers render delicious the flesh of the goats who feed upon them. At the upper
                    end of the plain grasses and lichens faintly struggle against the volcanic
                    matter. At 1530 toises above the sea they reached a station commonly called the
                    English Halt, consisting of a cavern inclosed between two rocks. Here they spent
                    the night, suffering considerably from cold. Next morning, after two hours’
                    walk, they came to a small plain called Alta Vista, where persons called Neueros
                    were collecting snow for the use of the inhabitants of the coast. Here commence
                    the Malpays, a tract entirely destitute of mould, and covered with fragments of
                    lava, which, sinking beneath the feet, rendered the ascent very laborious. The
                    guides now earnestly dissuaded them from proceeding farther, and were found, on
                    examination, never to have themselves reached the summit. At the extremity of
                    the Malpays, however, the travellers came to a small plain, whence they saw
                    rising the cone of the <hi rend="italic">piton.</hi> This hillock is extremely
                    steep, and is so covered with volcanic ashes and fragments of pumice stone, as
                    to render the ascent scarcely possible. They succeeded only by following a
                    current of old lava, the wrecks of which formed a wall of scorious rocks, by
                    grasping the points of which, in half an hour, they reached the top. This
                    volcano appeared to Humboldt the most difficult to ascend of any lie had seen,
                    except that of Jorullo in Mexico</p>
                <p>On arriving at the summit, our traveller was surprised to find scarcely room to
                    sit down. The crater was inclosed with a small circular wall of porphyritic
                    lava, with a basis of pitchstone. This wall, at a little distance, has the
                    appearance of a small cylinder or a truncated cone. It would have entirely
                    blocked up the approach to the crater, had there not been a breach on the east
                    side, through which they descended into the funnel. They found it of an elliptic
                    form, 300 feet in length and 200 in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193347965"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-7965-0074"/>breadth. It is remarkable that these dimensions
                    are only a fifth part of those of the crater of Vesuvius. In fact, very lofty
                    volcanoes usually throw out the matter by lateral openings, so that some of the
                    greatest among the Andes have very small apertures at the summit. The inside of
                    the funnel indicated the appearance of a crater which had not thrown out fire
                    for thousands of years. There were none of those layers of scoriae and ashes
                    which mark recent volcanic action; the floor was strewed with fragments of stony
                    lavas, which the action of time had detached from the sides. The strata along
                    the edges were very irregularly piled over each other, exhibiting various
                    grotesque ramifications. The inclosing wall is snow white at its surface, owing
                    to the action of sulphuric acid gas on pitchstone porphyry. The aspect of the
                    whole is rather curious than awful. “The majesty of the site consists in its
                    elevation above the level of the ocean, in the profound solitude of those lofty
                    regions, and the immense space over which the eye ranges.”</p>
                <p>The view from this point is described by Humboldt as interesting in a very
                    peculiar manner. He observes, “Travellers have learnt by experience, that views
                    from the summit of very lofty mountains are neither so beautiful, picturesque,
                    nor varied, as those from the summit of heights which do not exceed that of
                    Vesuvius, Riga, or Puy-de-Dome. Colossal mountains, such as Chimboraço,
                    Antisana, or Mount Rosa, compose so large a mass, that the plains, covered with
                    rich vegetation, are seen only in the immensity of distance, where a blue and
                    vapoury tint is uniformly spread over the landscape. The Peak of Teneriffe, from
                    its slender form and local position, unites the advantages of less lofty summits
                    to those which rise from very great heights. Vie not only discover from its top
                    a vast expanse of sea, but we see also the forests of Tenerifte, and the
                    inhabited part of the coasts, in a proximity fitted to produce the most
                    beautiful contrasts of form and colouring. The volcano seems as if it crushed
                    with its mass the little isle which serves for its basis, and shoots up from the
                    bosom of the waters to a height three times loftier than the region where the
                    clouds float in the summer.” The remarkable transparency of the atmosphere
                    increases greatly the apparent proximity in which the hamlets, vineyards, and
                    gardens on the coast are beheld.</p>
                <p>The Peak appeared to Humboldt to be composed entirely of volcanic products,
                    without any mixture of primitive rocks. It is peculiarly distinguished by the
                    vast quantity of obsidian, a substance not found in the immediate vicinity of
                    almost any other volcano. It alternates with, and passes into pumice, in a
                    manner which convinced our traveller that pumice was merely tumefied obsidian.
                    These two rocks, together with a porphyry consisting of vitreous lava in a basis
                    of pitchstone, composed the whole upper part of the Peak. Although the crater
                    was entirely silent, yet, near the summit, vapour, which condensed into pure
                    water, issued from different spiracles, called the Nostrils of the Peak.</p>
                <p>The active volcanoes of Teneriffe arc considered by Humboldt as merely lateral
                    eruptions of the great volcano. The only one recently in operation is the
                    volcano of Cahorra, situated on the west side of the Peak. After a long silence,
                    it began its discharge on the night of the 8th of June 1798. A hollow and
                    stifled sound was first heard, like that of distant thunder; then a louder
                    noise, like that of matter in violent ebullition; after which another sound,
                    which resembled a great discharge of artillery. A short interval still elapsed,
                    till the liquefied substances began to ascend. Four mouths were opened, of which
                    the two highest threw up only red-hot stones. The third poured out lava, but
                    slowly; and it is fortunately surrounded by a rampart of rocks, the interval
                    between which and the volcano must be filled up before the stream could reach
                    the cultivated fields.</p>
                <p>Humboldt observed the other islands merely by sailing along their coasts.
                    Lancerota exhibited every mark of having been recently overwhelmed by volcanic
                    agency. This appears to have taken place in 1730, when nine villages were
                    entirely destroyed. The summit of its great volcano did not appear to exceed 300
                    toises. The coast of Graciosa is distinguished by rocks of basalt 500 or 600
                    feet in height, which frown in perpendicular walls over the ocean, like the
                    ruins of vast edifices. One of them so exactly resembled a castle, that the
                    French captain saluted it, and sent a boat on shore to make some inquiries of
                    the governor.</p>
                <p>All the rocks which Humboldt observed were thus either volcanic or of very recent
                    trap formation. Μ. Broussonnet, however, who spent a long time upon these
                    islands, stated that Gomera was composed of the primitive rocks of granite and
                    mica slate. The Grand Canary has never been explored; but it struck Humboldt as
                    wearing a different aspect from the rest, its mountains being disposed in
                    parallel chains.</p>
                <p>The eastern side of the island of Teneriffe is entirely naked and barren, but the
                    northern and western sides are beautiful and fertile. It does not produce two
                    thirds of the corn necessary for its own consumption, but is supplied from the
                    other islands. Santa Cruz, the Capital, is situated on the eastern side, the
                    convenience of the harbour and situation compensating for the barrenness of the
                    surrounding country, it supports itself by trade, forming as it were a great
                    caravanserai between Spain and the Indies. English ships often touch at this
                    port for fresh provisions, which are obtained of excellent quality, though
                    chiefly from the neighbouring island of Canary. The appearance of this city,
                    which exhibits houses of dazzling whiteness, with flat roofs, and windows
                    without glass, stuck against a perpendicular wall of basaltic rocks, appeared
                    very unpleasing to Humboldt. The streets, however, are neat, with foot-walks on
                    each side. The houses within are remarkably spacious; the halls and galleries so
                    extensive as, in Μ. Bory de St Vincent’s opinion, to exclude the comfortable
                    feeling of a house, and rather to suggest that of an open space. The roadstead
                    is excellent, and forms the chief recommendation of Santa Cruz. The harbour is
                    well built, but the landing difficult, and even dangerous. The population is

                    to the island; but since the volcano of 1706 destroyed its port of Garachico
                    then the finest on the island, its commerce has been supplanted by that of Santa
                    Cruz, and it has been in a state of rapid decline. It still, however, contains
                    9000 inhabitants. The situation is beautiful, about 350 toises higher than that
                    of Santa Cruz, and crowned by a wood of laurel, myrtle, and arbutus, which
                    maintains a delightful coolness. The situation of Orotova is still finer, and it
                    is refreshed by numerous rivulets passing even through the streets. Its aspect,
                    however, is gloomy and deserted, and it is chiefly inhabited by a haughty race
                    of nobility. The population amounts to 7000, with 3000 in its port of Santa
                    Cruz. The road is bad.</p>
                <p>The other islands have been very little examined. The Grand Canary is said to
                    surpass Teneriffe in fertility, but has been much neglected. Its chief town,
                    Ciudad de las Palmas, contains upwards of 9000 inhabitants, and is the
                    ecclesiastical capital of the islands. Lancerota and Fuerteventura are the most
                    arid, and their soil so nearly resembles that of the African continent, that
                    thecamel has been introduced with success.</p>

                <p>Hassel reckons 181,000; but Tarrente <hi rend="italic">(Geografia Universal,</hi>
                    1828) states the result of the last census to be 196,517. He does not, however,
                    give the distribution of this number among the different islands.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants are said to be of an active and industrious disposition. They
                    have emigrated in great numbers to the different parts of South America, where
                    they are supposed to be as numerous as in their native islands. They are fond of
                    considering these as a portion of European Spain, to whose literature they have
                    made some not unimportant additions, by the labours of Clavijo, Vieyra, Yrairte,
                    and Betancourt. A most formidable list of prohibited books is exhibited at
                    Laguna, but this only whets their avidity for these forbidden treasures.</p>
                <p>The chief article of export is wine, of which the average produce in Teneriffe is
                    estimated by M. Bory de St Vincent at 22,000 pipes. Lord Macartney reckons
                    25,000, and Mr Anderson (in Cook’s <hi rend="italic">Third Voyage)</hi> 40,000;
                    but this last amount is doubtless greatly exaggerated. A large proportion is
                    consumed in the island; the export, chiefly to Britain and America, amounts to
                    8000 or 9000 pipes. The other exports are brandy, raw silk, soda, and some
                    fruits, which, however, are not equal in quality to those of Portugal. The
                    revenue amounts to 242,000 piastres, <hi rend="smallcaps">(e.)</hi><hi
