                <p><label type="entry">CAUCASUS</label>, a vast chain of mountains in Western Asia,
                    commencing to the south of the fortress of Kopil, at the mouth of the river
                    Kuban, which falls into the Black Sea, and, after running to the south,
                    traverses Mingrelia in an easterly direction to the town of Georgiefsk, and the
                    source of the river Kuma. Here the ridge, diverging towards the south, enters
                    Georgia near the source of the river Kur, and afterwards taking an easterly
                    course, runs along the western shores of the Caspian Sea, and through the
                    Persian provinces of Daghestan and Schirvan; and thence penetrating Ghilan, is
                    connected with the Hindoo Coosh Mountains, a branch of the great Himalaya chain.
                    The mountains of Causasus are not, however, understood to extend beyond the
                    isthmus that lies between the Black and the Caspian Seas. In this restricted
                    sense, the length of the chain is calculated at 644 miles, but its breadth is
                    various; from Mosdok to Tiflis, however, it is computed at 184 miles. This
                    region is described by Sir R. Ker Porter as exhibiting nature in her most
                    sublime aspect of rude and terrific grandeur. In many parts it is one continued
                    chain of precipices, or of craggy and impassable mountains, in which the
                    mountain torrent is seen tumbling in cataracts over rocks, or roaring and
                    foaming in the dark and unfathomable abysses through which it makes its way in
                    its progress to the plains. At other times the dreadful avalanche, descending
                    from the mountains, spreads death and desolation around. These awful phenomena
                    of nature are often exhibited in the mountains of Caucasus on a tremendous
                    scale. Vast masses of snow falling from the mountains obstruct the torrents,
                    until they gradually accumulate, and, bursting through with the most fearful
                    desolation, ravage and destroy all that occurs in their course. In other parts
                    these mountains stretch out into level plains. This great ridge is divided into
                    two parallel chains, the highest summits of which rise to an elevation,
                    according to a Russian measurement, of 16,000 and 17,000 feet. The Elburz, which
                    is on the western declivity, is 16,700 feet high; and the Casibeg is 17,388 feet
                    in height. The highest summits of these mountains are covered with perpetual
                    snow and ice; the lower parts are clothed with thick forests. There are two
                    passes into these mountains, which, from their narrowness, are called gates;
                    namely, the Caucasian Pass, and the Albanian or Caspian Pass. This great chain
                    of mountains is the dividing ridge between the rivers which run with an easterly
                    course to the Caspian Sea, and those which flow west into the Black Sea. The
                    Terek, on the northern declivity, flows into the former; while the Kuban, on the
                    southern declivity, flows into the latter; and beyond these rivers the mountains
                    by degrees decline into the sandy plains of Southern Russia. On the southern
                    declivity the Kur and the Rioni flow respectively into the Caspian and Black
                    Seas; and beyond these rivers are seen the mountain chains of Turkish and
                    Persian Armenia, which connect the Caucasus with the other chains of Western
                    Asia. The southern declivity of these mountains is highly fertile, abounding in
                    forests and fountains, orchards, vineyards, corn-fields, and pastures, in rich
                    variety. Grapes, chestnuts, figs, &amp;c. grow spontaneously in these countries;
                    as well as grain of every description, rice, cotton, hemp, &amp;c. But the
                    inhabitants are barbarous and indolent. They consist of mountain tribes,
                    remarkably ferocious, whose delight is in war, and with whom robbery is a
                    hereditary trade; and their practice is to descend from their fastnesses, and to
                    sweep every thing away from the neighbouring plains, not only grain and cattle,
                    but men, women, and children, who are carried into captivity. The names of the
                    different tribes are the Georgians, Abassians, Lesghians, Ossetes, Circassians,
                    Taschkents, Khists, Ingooshes, Cha-rabulaks, Tartars, Armenians, Jews, and in
                    some parts wandering Arabs. They are mostly barbarous in their habits, and
                    idolatrous in their religion, worshipping stars, mountains, rocks, and trees.
                    There are among them Greek and Armenian Christians, Mahommedans, and Jews.
                    Several of the tribes, particularly the Circassians and Georgians, are accounted
                    the handsomest people in the world; and the females are much sought after by the
                    eastern monarchs, to be immured in their harams. The inhabitants amount to about
                    900,000, who are partly ruled by petty sovereigns, and partly by their seniors.
                    The most famous are the Lesghians, who inhabit the eastern regions, and, living
                    by plunder, are the terror of the Armenians, Persians, 'Turks, and Georgians.
                    Their sole occupation is war; and their services can at any time be purchased
                    by' every prince in the neighbourhood for a supply of provisions and a few
                    silver rubles. Since the extension of the Russian empire in this quarter, many
                    of these mountain tribes have been restrained in their predatory habits. Under
                    the iron rule of that powerful state they have been taught to tremblĉ and obey;
                    military posts have been dispersed over the country, fortresses have been
                    erected, towns have arisen, and commerce and agriculture begin slowly to
                    supplant the barbarous pursuits of war and plunder, in which these mountain
                    tribes have hitherto been engaged. But the work of civilization in these wild
                    regions is still slow; it is difficult to reclaim the people from their
                    long-settled habits of violence and disorder; and it would not be safe for any
                    traveller to pass alone through the⅞e countries, where he would be exposed to
                    robbery and murder.</p>
                <p>All the regions on and about the Caucasus are comprehended under the name of
                    Caucasian countries. They are supposed to extend over an area of 116,078 square
                    miles, and to contain 1,673,500 inhabitants. The provinces which are under the
                    dominion of Russia are six in number, namely, 1<hi rend="italic">st,</hi> the
                    province of Tiflis, or Georgia, containing a population of 390,000: 2<hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi>, Imiretta, 270,000; 3d, Circassia, 550,000 (here are
                    Russian military posts, to guard against the attacks of the mountain tribes):
                    4<hi rend="italic">th,</hi> Daghestan, or the mountain land, on the Caspian Sea,
                    of which Derbent is the capital, 184,000: 5<hi rend="italic">th,</hi> Schirvan,
                    with Bakou, the best harbour on the Caspian, 133,000. In the neighbourhood are
                    the fountains of naphtha to which the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193350266"

                    Terek, on the northern side of the Caucasus, lies, 6<hi rend="italic">th,</hi>
                    the province of Caucasia, which, previously to 1822, was the government of
                    Georgiefsk. Of the inhabitants of this province, amounting to 146,500, 21,000
                    are Russians, and 48,000 colonists. Here are twenty-two fortified places, among
                    which are Georgiefsk, Kizĥar, a commercial city with a population of 9000, and
                    Alexandrovsk, which form, along with the Kuban, the Kama, and the Terek,
                    defences against the inroads of savage tribes. Since 1825 Stavropol has been the
                    capital of this province. Here is the Scottish missionary station of Kara,
                    founded in 1803, and enlarged by Moravians from Sarepta, with schools and a
                    printing office. Hitherto the efforts of the missionaries have not been very
                    successful in disseminating the Christian faith among the savage tribes. <hi
