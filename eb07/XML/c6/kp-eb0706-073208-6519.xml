                    celebrated landscape painter, and a striking example of the efficacy of industry
                    to supply, or at least to call forth genius. Claude was born in the diocese of
                    Toul, in Lorrain, in 1600, and, being dull and heavy at school, he was put an
                    apprentice to a pastry-cook: he afterwards rambled to Rome to seek a livelihood;
                    but being very ill bred, and unacquainted with the language, nobody cared to
                    employ him. Chance threw him at last in the way of Augustin Tassi, a painter,
                    who hired him to grind his colours, and to do all the household drudgery. His
                    master hoping to make him serviceable in some of his greatest works, taught him
                    by degrees the rules of perspective and the elements of design. Claude at first
                    did not know what to make of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193356532"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-6532-0733"/>these principles of art; but being encouraged, and
                    not failing in application, he came at length to understand them. Then his mind
                    began to expand, and he cultivated the art with wonderful eagerness. He exerted
                    his utmost industry to explore the true principles of painting by an incessant
                    examination of nature, that genuine source of excellence; for which purpose he
                    made his studies in the open fields, where he very frequently continued from
                    sunrise, till the close of the evening compelled him to withdraw himself from
                    his contemplations. It was his custom to sketch whatever he thought beautiful or
                    striking; and every curious tinge of light, on all kinds of objects, he marked
                    in his sketches with a similar colour; from which he perfected his landscapes
                    with such a look of real nature, and gave them such an appearance of truth, as
                    proved superior to any artist who had ever painted in that style.</p>
                <p>The beauties of his paintings are derived from nature herself, which he examined
                    with uncommon assiduity; and Sandrart relates, that Claude used to explain to
                    him, as they walked through the fields, the causes of the different appearances
                    of the same prospect at different hours of the day, from the reflections or
                    refractions of light, from dews or vapours in the evening or morning, with all
                    the precision of a philosopher. He worked on his pictures with great care,
                    endeavouring to bring them to perfection, by retouching them frequently; and if
                    any performance did not answer his ideas, it was customary with him to alter, to
                    deface, and repaint it several times over, till it corresponded with the image
                    pictured in his mind. But whatever struck his imagination while he observed
                    nature abroad, it was so strongly impressed on his memory, that on his return to
                    his work he never failed to make the happiest use of it.</p>
                <p>His skies are warm and full of lustre, and every object is properly illumined.
                    His distances are admirable, and in every part a delightful union and harmony
                    not only excite our applause, but our admiration. His invention is pleasing, his
                    colouring delicate, and his tints have such an agreeable sweetness and variety,
                    as have been but imperfectly imitated by the best succeeding artists, but were
                    never equalled. He frequently gave an uncommon tenderness to his finished trees
                    by glazing; and in his large compositions which he painted in fresco, he was so
                    exact, that the distinct species of every tree might readily be distinguished.
                    As to his figures, when he painted them himself, they arc very indifferent; but
                    he was so conscious of his deficiency in this respect, that he usually engaged
                    other artists who were eminent to paint them for him, of which number were
                    Curtois and Philippo Laura. In order to avoid a repetition of the same subject,
                    and also to detect such copies of his works as might be injurious to his fame,
                    by being sold for originals, it was his custom to draw (in a paper-book prepared
                    for this purpose) the designs of all those pictures which were transmitted to
                    different countries; and on the back of the drawings he wrote the name of the
                    person who had been the purchaser. That book he titled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Libro</hi><hi rend="italic">di</hi><hi rend="italic">Verita.</hi> This great
                    artist died at Rome in November 1682, at the advanced age of eighty-two.</p>
