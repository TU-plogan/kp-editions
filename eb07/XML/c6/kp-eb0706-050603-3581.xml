                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">CHENIER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Marie Joseph de</hi></label>,
                    was the son of Louis Chenier, well known as the author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Recherches Historiques sur les Maitres,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Révolutions
                    de l’Empire Othmam.</hi> He was born in the year 1764, at Constantinople, where
                    his father at that time acted as consul-general of France. At a very early
                    period of life he entered into the French army; but he soon relinquished the
                    military profession, and settled at Paris, where he devoted much of his time to
                    literary pursuits. He commenced his dramatic career by a tragedy, which was
                    acted in 1786, and was completely unsuccessful. A few years afterwards, availing
                    himself of the political feelings of the period, he produced the tragedy of
                    Charles IX., which was received with vast applause by the party which
                    predominated at the time. This was followed by <hi rend="italic">Lα Mort</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Calas,</hi> and the republican tragedies of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gracchus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Timoleon.</hi> These dramas in a great
                    measure owed their popularity to existing circumstances, and the author’s talent
                    of addressing himself to the prevailing feelings of the multitude. Plis
                    performances, however, were instrumental in procuring him a seat in the National
                    Convention, and obtained him the highest theatrical reputation, till he
                    unfortunately brought forward a tragedy founded on the accession of Cyrus to the
                    throne of the Medes, a subject which, as it gave less scope to political
                    allusion than his former productions, and had been previously treated with
                    greater ability by other writers, failed more completely even than the piece in
                    which he first laid claim to the favour of the public. After this failure
                    Chenier appears to have distrusted his dramatic genius, and chiefly employed
                    himself in translating or imitating the most celebrated productions of the Greek
                    and German stage.</p>
                <p>Chenier, however, did not confine himself to dramatic compositions, but
                    cultivated almost every species of poetry with tolerable success. His
                    productions arc chiefly satirical, lyric, and political. Being engaged in a
                    variety of literary as well as political quarrels, and being naturally of a
                    haughty, irritable temper, he was insensibly led to employ his talents for
                    poetry and satire on all who had provoked his enmity. His works of this
                    description, accordingly, are often misapplied, but are distinguished by
                    considerable gaiety and energy of composition. His lyric productions, of which
                    he published <hi rend="italic">a</hi> collection in 1797, consist partly of odes
                    imitated from the <hi rend="italic">Poems of Ossian.</hi> Most of his other
                    poems, as his <hi rend="italic">Poeme</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">l’</hi><hi rend="italic">Assemblée des</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Notables</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dithyrambe sur</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >l’</hi><hi rend="italic">Assemblée Nationale,</hi> allude entirely, as their
                    name imports, to-the political events of the day.</p>
                <p>Chenier also distinguished himself as a prose writer by his productions in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Mercure de France,</hi> and the discourses which he prepared
                    for the different academies of which he was a member, which discourses chiefly
                    turn on subjects connected with the progress of knowledge in Europe, and the
                    literary history of his own country. In consequence of a task assigned by
                    Bonaparte to the Institute, of which Chenier was a member,.he undertook to give
                    a historical and critical account of the most celebrated production^, both in
                    prose and verse, which had enriched French literature from the years 1788 to
                    1808. This sketch was originally read at one of the sittings of the Institute,
                    and was afterwards published under the title <hi rend="italic">Tableau</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Historique</hi><hi rend="italic">de l’</hi><hi rend="italic">Etat
                    et des Progrès de la Littérature Française depuis</hi> 1789. This work
                    comprehends a notice of all the best works which had appeared during that
                    period, from the light class of romances to the most important treatises on
                    morals, politics, and legislation; and in poetry it embraces a review from the
                    highest epic to burlesque and mock heroic.</p>
                <p>Many of the orations and discourses pronounced by Chenier in the different
                    political assemblies which were formed during the existence of the French
                    republic, and of almost all which he was a member, related to similar
                    topics,—proposals for legislative measures with regard to literary works, and
                    the encouragement of arts and systems of public instruction. Those orations
                    which were truly political breathed all the violent spirit of the time, and of
                    the assemblies in which they were delivered. As he took an active part in the
                    distracted politics of his country, and was engaged on one side or other in most
                    of the revolutions by which she was at that time agitated, his character was
                    frequently the object of the blackest calumnies, his property of confiscation,
                    and his person of proscription. All this was little favourable to literary
                    improvement. But when France at length settled under the absolute dominion of
                    one ruler, by being precluded from political intrigue and discussion, he had
                    ample leisure left for study and composition. He continued thus usefully
                    employed, in a state of comparative tranquillity,, till his death, which
                    happened at Paris on the 10th January 1811.</p>
                <p>The character and writings of Chenier partook strongly of the spirit of the times
                    in which he lived. The former was marked by turbulence, restlessness, and
                    ambition; and although some of his poems, as well as his more recent prose
                    compositions, show that his taste was not naturally that of the school of the
                    French revolution, yet many of his tragedies and literary discourses are
                    disfigured by that exaggeration of sentiments and ideas, as <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193353594" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3594-0507"/>well as that declamatory and
                    inflated style, which the tone and feelings of the period had introduced or
                    propagated. <hi rend="smallcaps">(q.)</hi></p>
