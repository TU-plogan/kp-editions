                    particular part of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> house where the fire is made, having
                    a tube or funnel to carry off the smoke. The word <hi rend="italic">chimney</hi>
                    comes from the French <hi rend="italic">cheminée,</hi> and that from the Latin
                    <hi rend="italic">caminata,</hi> a chamber in which is a chimney; while <hi
                    rend="italic">caminata,</hi> again, is derived from <hi rend="italic"
                    >caminus,</hi> and that from the Greek <hi rend="italic">κάμινος,</hi> chimney,
                    from κα∕ω, <hi rend="italic">uro,</hi> I burn.</p>
                <p>It is usually supposed that chimneys are of modern invention, and that the
                    ancients made use only of stoves; but Octavio Ferrari endeavours to prove that
                    chimneys were in use among the ancients. To this end he cites the authority of
                    Virgil,</p>
                <p>Et jam summa procul villarum culmina fumant, and that of Appian, who says, that
                    of those persons proscribed by the triumvirate, some hid themselves in wells and
                    common sewers, and some on the tops of houses and in chimneys (xαwα⅛; <hi

                    comedies, introduces his old man, Polycleon, shut up in a chamber, whence he
                    endeavours to make his escape by the <hi rend="italic">chimney.</hi></p>
                <p>Chimneys, however, are, in Professor Beckmann’s opinion, of comparatively modern
                    origin; and in order to show the ground upon which he comes to this conclusion,
                    we shall lay before our readers some observations from his elaborate
                    dissertation on this subject.</p>
                <p>When the triumviri, says Appian, caused those who had been proscribed by them to
                    be sought for by the military, some of them, in order to avoid the bloody hands
                    of their persecutors, hid themselves in wells, and others, as Ferrarius
                    translates the words, <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">fumaria</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sub</hi><hi rend="italic">tecto,</hi><hi rend="italic">qua
                    scilicet</hi><hi rend="italic">fumus e tecto evolvitur.</hi> The true
                    translation, however, in Beckmann’s opinion, is <hi rend="italic">fumosa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">coenacula.</hi> The principal persons of Rome endeavoured to
                    conceal themselves in the smoky apartments of the upper story under the roof,
                    which, in general, were inhabited only by poor people; and this seems to be
                    confirmed by what Juvenal expressly says, <hi rend="italic">Parus venit</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">in ccenacula miles.</hi></p>
                <p>Those passages of the ancients which speak of smoke rising up from houses, have
                    with equal impropriety been supposed to allude to chimneys, as if the smoke
                    could not make its way through doors and windows. Seneca says, “Last evening I
                    had some friends with me, and on that account a stronger smoke was raised; not
                    such a smoke, however, as bursts forth from the kitehens of the great, and which
                    alarms the watchmen, but such an one as signifies that guests have arrived.”
                    Those whose judgments are not already warped by prejudice, will undoubtedly find
                    the true sense of these words to be, that the smoke forced its way through the
                    kitchen windows. Had the houses been built with chimney funnels, one cannot
                    conceive why the watchmen should have been alarmed when they observed a stronger
                    smoke than usual arising from them; but as the kitchens had no convenience of
                    that nature, an apprehension of fire, when extraordinary entertainments were to
                    be provided in the houses of the rich for large companies, seems to have been
                    well founded; and on such occasions people appointed for that purpose were
                    stationed in the neighbourhood, to be constantly on the watch, and to be ready
                    to extinguish the flames in case a fire should happen. There are to be found in
                    Roman authors many other passages of a similar kind, which it is hardly
                    necessary to mention, such as that of Virgil,</p>
                <p>Et jam summa procul villarum culmina fumant; and the following words of Plautus,
                    descriptive of a miser:</p>
                <p>Quin divûm atque hominum clamat continuo fidem,</p>
                <p>Suam rem periisse, seque eradicarier, De suo tigillo fumus si qua exit foras.</p>
                <p>The passage of Aristophanes above alluded to, however, and which, according to
                    the usual translation, seems to refer to a common chimney, may, especially when
                    we consider the illustration of the scholiasts, be explained by a simple hole in
                    the roof, as Reiske has supposed; and indeed<pb break="no" facs="nls:193354114"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-4114-0547"/> this appears to be the more probable, as we find
                    mention made of a top or covering (τjja∕α) with which the hole was closed.</p>
                <p>It has been said that the instances of chimneys remaining among the ruins of
                    ancient buildings are few, and that the rules given by Vitruvius for building
                    them are obscure; but it appears that there exists no remains of ancient
                    chimneys, and that Vitruvius gives no rules, either obscure or perspicuous, for
                    building what, in the modern acceptation of the word, deserves the name of a
                    chimney The ancient mason-work still to be found in Italy does not determine the
                    question. Of the walls of towns, temples, amphitheatres, baths, aqueducts, and
                    bridges, there are some, though very imperfect remains, in which chimneys cannot
                    be expected; but of common dwellinghouses none are to be seen, except at
                    Herculaneum, and there no traces of chimneys have yet been discovered The
                    paintings and pieces of sculpture which are preserver; afford as little
                    information, for nothing can be perceived ir them which bears the smallest
                    resemblance to a modern chimney.</p>
                <p>If there were no funnels in the houses of the ancients to carry off the smoke,
                    the directions given by Columella, to make kitchens so high that the roof should
                    not catch fire, were of the utmost importance. An accident of the kind, which
                    the author seems to have apprehended, had almost happened at Beneventum, when
                    the landlord who entertained Maecenas and his company was making a strong fire
                    in order to get some birds the sooner roasted.</p>
                <p>Ubi sedulus hospes</p>
                <p>Paene arsit, macros dum turdos versat in igne; Nam vaga per veterem dilapso
                    flamma culinam Vulcano summum properabat, lambere tectam.</p>
                <p>Had there been chimneys in the Roman houses, Vitruvius certainly would not have
                    failed to describe their construction, which is sometimes attended with
                    considerable difficulties, and which is intimately connected with the regulation
                    of the plan of the whole edifice. He does not, however, say a word on the
                    subject; neither does Julius Pollux, who has collected with great care the Greek
                    names of every part of a dwelling-house; and Grapaldus, who in later times made
                    a collection of the Latin terms, has not given a Latin word expressive of a
                    modern chimney.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Caminus,</hi> as far as we have been able to lcarn, signified
                    first a chemical or metallurgic furnace, in which a crucible was placed for
                    melting and refining metals; secondly, a smith’s forge; and, thirdly, a hearth
                    on which portable Stoves or fire-pans were placed for warming the apartment. In
                    all these, however, there appears no trace of a chimney. Herodotus relates, that
                    a king of Libya, when one of his servants asked for his wages, offered him in
                    jest the sun, which at that time shone into the house through an opening in the
                    roof, under which the fire was perhaps made in the middle of the edifice. If
                    such a hole must be called a chimney, our author admits that chimneys were in
                    use among the ancients, especially in their kitchens; but it is obvious that
                    such chimneys bore no resemblance to ours, through which the sun could not dart
                    his rays upon the floor of any apartment.</p>
                <p>However imperfect may be the information which can be collected from the Greek
                    and Roman authors respecting the manner in which the ancients warmed their
                    apartments, it nevertheless shows that they commonly used for that purpose a
                    large fire-pan or portable stove, in which they kindled wood, and, when the wood
                    was well lighted, carried it into the room, or perhaps they filled it with
                    burning coals. When Alexander the Great was entertained by a friend in winter,
                    as the weather was cold and raw, a small fire basin was brought into the
                    apartment to warm it. The prince, observing the size of the vessel, and that it
                    contained only a few coals, desired his host, in a jeering manner, to bring more
                    wood or to fetch frankincense; giving him thus to understand that the fire was
                    fitter for burning perfumes than to produce heat. Anacharsis, the Scythian
                    philosopher, though displeased with many of the Grecian customs, praised the
                    Greeks, because they shut out the smoke, and brought only fire into their
                    houses.</p>
                <p> We are informed by Lampridius, that the extravagant Heliogabalus caused to be
                    burned in such stoves, Indian</p>
                <p>, spices, and costly perfumes, instead of wood. It is also worthy of notice, that
                    coals were found in some of the <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> apartments of
                    Herculaneum, but neither stoves nor chim- , neys.</p>
                <p>It is well known to every scholar, that the useful arts of life were invented in
                    the East; and that the customs, manners, and furniture of eastern nations, have
                    remained from time immemorial almost unchanged. In Persia, I which Sir William
                    Jones seems to have considered as the original country of mankind, the methods
                    employed by the inhabitants for warming themselves have a great resemblance to
                    those employed by the ancient Greeks and &gt; Romans for the same purpose.
                    According to De la Ville, the Persians make fires in their apartments, not in
                    chimneys as we do, but in stoves in the earth, which they call <hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">tennor.</hi> These stoves consist of a square or round
                    hole, I two spans or a little more in depth, and in shape not unlike an Italian
                    cask. That this hole may throw out heat sooner, and with more strength, there is
                    placed in it an iron vessel of the same size, which is either filled with
                    burning coals, or a fire of wood and other inflammable substances is made in it.
                    When this is done, they place over the hole or stove a wooden top, like a small
                    low table, and spread above it a large coverlet quilted with cotton, which hangs
                    down on all sides to the floor. This covering condenses the heat, and causes it
                    to warm the whole apartment. The people who eat or converse there, and some who
                    sleep in it, he down on the floor upon the carpet, and lean with their shoulders
                    against the wall, on square cushions, upon which they sometimes also sit; for
                    the <hi rend="italic">tennor</hi> is constructed in a place equally distant from
                    the walls on both sides. Those who are not very cold put their feet only under
                    the table or covering; but those who require more heat may put their hands under
                    it, or creep under it altogether. By these means the stove diffuses over the
                    whole body, without causing uneasiness to the head, so penetrating and agreeable
                    a warmth, that I never experienced any thing more pleasant. Those, however, who
                    require less heat let the coverlet hang down on their side to the floor, and
                    enjoy without any inconvenience from the stove the moderately-heated air of the
                    apartment. They have a method also of stirring up or blowing the fire when
                    necessary, by means of a small pipe united with the tennor or stove under the
                    earth, and made to project above the floor as high as is judged necessary; so
                    that, when a person blows into it, the wind, having no other vent, acts
                    immediately upon the fire like a pair of bellows. When there is no longer
                    occasion to use this stove, both holes, that is to say, the mouth of the stove
                    and that of the pipe which conveys the air to it, are closed up by a flat stone
                    made for that purpose. Scarcely any appearance of them is then to be perceived,
                    nor do they occasion inconvenience, especially in a country where it is always
                    customary to cover the floor with a carpet, and where the walls are plastered.
                    In many parts these ovens are used to cook victuals, by kettles placed over
                    them. They are employed also to bake bread; and for this purpose they are
                    covered with a large broad metal plate, on which the cake is laid; but if the
                    bread is thick and requires more heat, it is put into the stove itself. (See <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Invent.</hi> ii. 88.) <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193354127" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4127-0548"/>Beckmann further observes,
                    that the oldest account of chimneys is to be found in an inscription at Venice,
                    which relates, that, in the year 1347, a great many chimneys were thrown down by
                    an earthquake. It would appear, however, that in some places they had been in
                    use for a considerable time before that period; and De Gataris, in his history
                    of Padua, relates, that Francesco de Carraro, lord of Padua, came to Rome in
                    1368, and finding no chimneys in the inn where he lodged, because at that time
                    fire was kindled in a hall in the middle of the floor, he caused two chimneys
                    like those which had <hi rend="italic">long</hi> been used at Padua to be
                    constructed by masons and carpenters, whom he had brought along with him. Over
                    these chimneys, the first which had ever been seen at Rome, he affixed his arms,
                    and these still remained in the time of De Gataris, who died of the plague in
                    1405.</p>
