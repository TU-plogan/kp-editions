                <p><label type="entry">CAROLINA, <hi rend="smallcaps">North</hi></label>, one of the
                    United States of America, is bounded on the north by Virginia, on the east by
                    the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by South Carolina, and on the west by Tenessee.
                    It lies between long. 75.45. and 84. W. and lat. 33. 50. and 36. 30. N., being
                    four hundred and thirty miles in length by a hundred and eighty in breadth, and
                    containing an area of 50,000 square miles. This state is divided into
                    sixty-three counties. It contains no large towns. Besides Ralcigh, which is the
                    seat of government, the most considerable are Newbern, Fayetteville, Wilmington,
                    Edenton, Washington, Hillsborough, Halifax, Tarborough, Salisbury, and Salem.
                    The principal rivers are the Roanoke, Chowan, Neuse, Pamlico, Cape Fear, Yadkin,
                    and Catawba. Of these, Cape Fear affords the best navigation. The two principal
                    sounds on the coast are those of Pamlico and Albemarle. Dismal Swamp lies partly
                    in Virginia and partly in this state. There are three celebrated and dangerous
                    capes on the coast, Hatteras, Lookout, and Fear. For about sixty miles from the
                    sea, and in its whole width, North Carolina is a dead level, diversified only by
                    occasional openings in the immense forest with which it is covered. Beyond this
                    monotonous plain rise mountains and hills, from whose summits is beheld a
                    beautiful tract of country, which recedes westward beyond the range of vision,
                    and is adorned with forests of lofty trees. On the level parts the soil is
                    indifferent; but on the banks of rivers, such as the Roanoke, it is remarkably
                    productive. In some parts of this champaign country there are glades of rich
                    swamp and ridges of oak land of a black and fruitful soil, which form an
                    exception to the general sterility. That portion of the state which extends to
                    the west of the mountains is for the most part very fertile, abounding in trees
                    of various kinds. Wheat, rye, barley, oats, and flax, are the crops usually
                    cultivated. Indian corn and pulse of all kinds are also abundant throughout the
                    state, and cotton is raised in considerable quantities. Of the plains in the low
                    country, the largest natural growth is the pitch-pine, a tall and beautiful
                    tree. It affords pitch, tar, turpentine, and various kinds of lumber, which
                    together constitute about one half of the exports of the state. In the back
                    country a variety of fruits and medicinal plants grow spontaneously. North
                    Carolina abounds in iron ore; and it is the only one of the United States in
                    which gold has been discovered in any considerable quantities. It is found in
                    almost every part of this territory, intermixed with the soil. Mines have been
                    established, but hitherto they have not proved very productive.</p>
                <p>This state has not reached that perfection of culture which it is capable of
                    arriving at from its natural advantages. The want of sufficient inland
                    navigation, and also of harbours, is described as the cause of this
                    backwardness. There are several large rivers, but their mouths are blocked up
                    with sand. The best of the harbours, which are all indifferent, are Wilmington,
                    Newbern, and Edenton. Since 1815, however, the state has been zealously engaged
                    in several extensive improvements, such as the construction of canals and roads,
                    and the draining of marshes and swamps.</p>
                <p>Like all the southern states, North Carolina has a considerable diversity of
                    climate, occasioned by the physical peculiarities of its parts. The level parts
                    of the country are unhealthy, but in the hilly parts the reverse is the case.
                    The summer day is hot, but the evening is refreshing and cool. Autumn is
                    temperate and serene; and in some years the winters are so mild, that autumn may
                    be said to continue till the spring. The wheat harvest commences in June, and
                    that of Indian corn in September. In 1827 merchandize to the value of 276,791
                    dollars was imported into North Carolina, and to the amount of 449,237
                    exported.</p>
                <p>The Christian denominations in this state are numerous. At Chapel Hill there is a
                    respectable institution entitled the university of North Carolina. Lately
                    considerable attention has been paid to education, and academies have been
                    established in various places. The population in 1810 amounted to 555,500, and
                    in 1820 to 638,829.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Carolina,</hi><hi rend="italic">South,</hi> one of the
                    United States, is bounded on the noļ|h by North Carolina, on the east by the
                    Atlantic Ocean, and on the south-west and west by Georgia. It lies between 78.
                    24. and 83. 30. of west longitude, and between 32. and 35. 8. of north latitude.
                    It is 200 miles long by 125 broad, and contains 30,000 square miles. This state
                    is naturally divided into Upper and Lower Carolina. The latter is supposed to
                    have been formerly under the ocean. To the extent of an hundred miles westward
                    from the sea, the country presents a dull uniformity of gigantic forests,
                    swamps, and level fields. This plain is succeeded by a range of little sand
                    hills, which cover a surface of sixty miles, and resemble the undulations of an
                    agitated sea. It is extremely barren, and only here and there enlivened by a
                    small oasis of verdure, or a few straggling pines. Its scanty inhabitants earn a
                    subsistence by the cultivation of corn and sweet potatoes. Stretching beyond
                    these sand hills there is a remarkable tract of ground called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ridge,</hi> which, on approaching it from the sea, is lofty and
                    bold; but on the north-west it is level from its summit. This fine belt of land
                    extends from Savannah to Broad River. It is fertile and well cultivated.
                    Succeeding this ridge, the country is a pleasant alternation of hill and dale;
                    and large rivers roll their broad columns of water through the varied beauties
                    of luxuriant and well-cultivated fields. From these fertile regions the ground
                    continues to rise to the western limits of the state, where several mountains
                    run in a regular direction, the principal of which is called Table Mountain. The
                    others are Oolenoy, Oconee, Paris’s Glassey, Hogback, and Kings. The chief
                    rivers are the Waccamaw, Pedee, Black River, Santee, Cooper, Ashly, Stono,
                    Edisto, Asheppo, Camba-hee, Coosaw, Broad, and Savannah.</p>

                <p>The soil of South Carolina is divided into six classes, first, tide swamp;
                    second, inland swamp; third, high river swamp, or low grounds, distinguished by
                    the name of second low grounds; fourth, salt marsh; fifth, oak and hickery high
                    land; sixth, pine barren. The first two classes are best adapted for rice and
                    hemp; the third for hemp, corn, and indigo; the fourth has been much neglected;
                    the fifth, which is very fertile, for corn, indigo, and cotton; and the last is
                    the least productive, but so much more salubrious than the other soils of the
                    low country, that a proportion of it is an indispensable appendage to every
                    swamp plantation. The staple commodities of this state are cotton and rice, of
                    which great quantities are annually exported. These crops are the most
                    profitable, and hence the planters have almost totally neglected the cultivation
                    of wheat, barley, oats, and other articles equally useful. Of wheat, in
                    particular, so little is raised, that large quantities require to be imported.
                    Tobacco thrives well, as do various kinds of fruits, such as pears,
                    pomegranates, and water melons. The latter grow to an enormous size, and are
                    thought superior to any in the world. In favourable years vegetation continues
                    for about eight months. The frosts are severe; but they seldom penetrate deeper
                    than two inches into the earth, or continue longer than three or four days. At
                    some seasons the weather is very variable. The temperature has been known to
                    vary forty-six degrees in one day. In summer there are several days of excessive
                    heat, and the nights also are sometimes extremely sultry. The low country is
                    infested with all those diseases which are incidental to a warm, moist, and
                    unelastic atmosphere. Of these the most frequent are fevers, from which the
                    inhabitants suffer severely. The upper districts, however, enjoy a very
                    salubrious climate.</p>
                <p>The planters in the low country live in a luxurious and splendid style; those in
                    the upper country are of more frugal and industrious habits. The labour of the
                    fields is principally performed by slaves, who in the low country exceed the
                    free inhabitants in the ratio of three to one. Charleston is the largest town,
                    but Columbia is the seat of government. The legislature consists of a senate and
                    house of representatives, who are chosen biennially. In its moral and religious
                    aspect this state bears a resemblance to North Carolina. In 1827 the value of
                    the imports amounted to 1,434,106, and the exports to 8,322,561 dollars. In 1810
                    the population was 415,115, and in 1820 to 502,741.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Carolina,</hi> a town in Spain, of recent foundation, in the
                    province of Andalusia, in one of its kingdoms, distinguished by the name of
                    Jaen. It was formed by German colonists in 1767, who began the process of
                    cultivation, but, from various causes, with little success. It has, however,
                    some excellent wine grown in its vicinity; and olives, hemp, and corn, have been
                    introduced. The district was formerly inhabited only by robbers, gipsies, and
                    pretended conjurors; to extirpate whom, Olavide planted several German families,
                    and introduced the arts of civilized life. The great sufferings of the late war
                    were very much experienced in this town, and it must be long before it can
                    recover its former prosperity. It contains at present 2050 inhabitants, and is
                    situated in lat. 38. 17. 5. N.</p>
