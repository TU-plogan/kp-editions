                <p><hi rend="italic">Account of the Writings of Aristotle, and reception of his
                    Philosophy.</hi></p>
                <p>The preservation of the original writings of Aristotle is a curious fact in
                    literary history. Whilst the philosopher distributed his other property to his
                    surviving family, he left the more precious bequest of his writings to
                    Theophrastus, his favourite disciple and successor in the Lyceum. By
                    Theophrastus they were bequeathed to Neleus, by whom they were conveyed from
                    Greece into Asia Minor, to the city of Scepsis, where he resided. The heirs of
                    Neleus, to whom they next descended, were private individuals, not philosophers
                    by profession, who were only anxious for the safe custody of their literary
                    treasure. The magnificence of kings had then begun to display itself in the
                    collection of libraries, and the works of genius were sought out with an eager
                    and lavish curiosity. It was a taste happy for the cause of literature; to
                    which, perhaps, the example of Alexander’s noble fondness for every thing
                    connected with intellectual energy had principally led. Aristotle himself,
                    indeed, is said to have been the first to form a library.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Strabo, xiii.</p></note> He was the first,
                    probably, to form one on an extensive scale. The Scepsians, into whose hands his
                    works had now fallen, fearful of the literary rapacity of the kings of Pergamos,
                    resorted to the selfish expedient of secreting the writings under ground. The
                    volumes remained in this concealment until at length their very existence seems
                    to have been forgotten; and they would thus have been lost to the world, but for
                    the accidental discovery of them after the lapse of 130 years. His philosophy
                    had been traditionally propagated, for we hear of Peripatetics at this time.
                    Portions, indeed, of his works probably had continued in circulation among the
                    disciples of the Lyceum, serving in some measure as a record of the principles
                    of the sect. Much may have been preserved from memory, for we have little notion
                    now of the impression made by <hi rend="italic">viva voce</hi> instruction, when
                    it was the only channel of knowledge co the generality. A peripatetic
                    philosopher, accordingly, Apellicon of Teos, whom Strabo, however, characterizes
                    as a lover of books rather than a philosopher—p∕λo‰Cλoς μάλλον <hi rend="italic"

                    volumes, and effectually retrieved them for the world. He employed several
                    copyists in transcribing them, himself superintending the task. Unfortunately,
                    much was irreparably lost, the writings being mouldered with the dampness of the
                    place in which they had so long been deposited. In addition to these damages of
                    time, they were now further impaired by misdirected endeavours to restore the
                    effaced text of the author.</p>
                <p>The works of Aristotle thus, through the care and the wealth of Apellicon, found
                    their way back to Athens, their woper soil, though no longer perfect as the
                    author had left them. Here they remained until the spoliation of the city by
                    Sylla. The library of Apellicon was a tempting object of plunder to the Romans,
                    who were now awakened to the value of literature; and Aristotle’s works
                    accordingly were carried away to Rome amidst the other rich spoils. At Rome they
                    experienced a netter fortune. Tyrannio, a learned Greek, who had been a prisoner
                    of war to Lucullus, and was then enjoying the freedom granted to him as a
                    resident at Rome, was the principal instrument in their future publication.
                    Obtaining access to the library of Sylla, he made additional copies of the
                    writings. His labours were followed by Andronicus the Rhodian, who at length
                    edited the works of Aristotle, at a distance of nearly 300 years from the time
                    when they were composed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Athenaeus, 1. p. 3, says the books of Aristotle were sold by Neleus to Ptolemy

                <p>Meanwhile other sects in philosophy had sprung up, and engaged the attention of
                    the world. The Stoics and the Epicureans, among others, had formed their
                    respective parties. Platonism had obtained permanent establishment at
                    Alexandria. The disciples of Aristotle, on the contrary, had to struggle against
                    the disadvantage of the loss of the authoritative records of their master’s
                    philosophy. When, however, these records were fully published, they were studied
                    with extraordinary eagerness. A multitude of commentators arose, who exercised a
                    profound ingenuity in explaining the genuine sense of the philosopher. As
                    Aristotle himself by his personal teaching had transcended the fame of his
                    contemporaries, so his philosophy rose up from its long sleep to triumph over
                    every other that had previously engaged the public mind. Platonism, indeed,
                    modified as it was by Ammonius and his successors, continued to be fostered in
                    the early ages of the Christian church, in consequence of the theological cast
                    which it had assumed, and its facility of accommodation to Christian truth. But
                    in the progress of the church, when Christianity demanded to be maintained, not
                    so much by accession from the ranks of paganism, as by controversial ability
                    within its own pale, a more exact method of philosophy was required. Here, then,
                    the philosophy of Aristotle asserted its pre-eminence.</p>
                <p>But it was only a partial Aristotelian philosophy that was at first established.
                    His dialectical treatises had been studied during the ascendancy of Platonism,
                    for their use in arming the disputant with subtle distinctions, and enabling him
                    accurately to state his peculiar notions in theology. The same occasion still
                    existed for the acuteness of the expert dialectician, even after the decline of
                    Platonism, in the state of theological controversies. It was still, therefore,
                    chiefly as a dialectical philosopher, through the several treatises which pass
                    under the name of the <hi rend="italic">Organon,</hi> that Aristotle was known
                    throughout Christendom. In western Europe, indeed, the cloud of igiibrance which
                    had covered the lands with thick darkness, limited the attainments even of the
                    learned to a narrow field. The original language of Aristotle’s philosophy was
                    gradually almost forgotten, and the generality were restricted to such parts of
                    his writings as were translated by the happier talent and industry of the few,
                    who shone as luminaries in the night of the middle ages. The peculiar exigencies
                    of the times, probably the taste of the learned themselves, led to the
                    translation in particular of the dialectical treatises. The treatise on the
                    Categories appears to have been the one principally known <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193101996" xml:id="kp-eb0703-1996-0495"/>among Christians. Nor were
                    these translations always made from the original Greek; but, on the contrary,
                    were in most instances versions of versions. For its knowledge of Greek
                    literature, western Europe was indebted to Arabic civilization. The Arabians
                    had, together with their conquests in Spain, imported their knowledge of the
                    Greek philosophy, the seeds of which had been scattered in the East by the
                    learning of the Nestorian Christians. Translations had been made into Arabic, of
                    the Greek authors, and among these, of Aristotle. Jews at the same period were
                    resident in great numbers in Andalusia, the principal seat of Arabic literature;
                    and these, by their commercial intercourse with Christians and Mahometans,
                    served as a channel through which the Greek philosophy was carried on from the
                    Spanish Arabians to the Christians of the West. For the purpose of
                    communication, the Arabic versions of Aristotle were translated into Latin, the
                    universal language of early European literature; and thus, was the foundation
                    laid of that scholastic philosophy, through which the dominion of Aristotle was
                    afterwards extended over Europe.</p>
                <p>But the occupation of Constantinople by the Latins, in the beginning of the 13th
                    century, was the opening of a new era in the literary history of Europe. Greater
                    facilities were afforded by this event for the knowledge of the Greek language;
                    and Aristotle began to be no longer known chiefly as a logician. His physical,
                    metaphysical, and moral treatises were more extensively explored and studied;
                    though at first objection was madeto the physics by the papal authority. He was
                    thenceforth fully recognized under the title of <hi rend="italic">Princeps
                    Philosophorum.</hi> His dialectic, indeed, maintained its ascendancy in the
                    scholastic philosophy; but it was not applied exclusively, as at first, to
                    theology. It was carried into those new subjects of inquiry which the extended
                    knowledge of his writings had introduced to the learned. The spirit of
                    disputatious subtilty, which, in the beginnings of the scholastic philosophy,
                    had displayed itself in the quarrels between the Nominalists and Realists,
                    afterwards found employment in the application of logical principles to
                    speculations in physics and metaphysics. At the same time theology became more
                    and more corrupted by the refinements of systematic exposition, until at length
                    the accumulated mass of error became too evident to be borne, and, among other
                    causes, produced a re-action in the reformation of the church.<note

                <p>The abuse of the Aristotelian philosophy, thus mischievously shown, tended
                    greatly to shake the empire which it had held over the minds of men. Had Luther
                    stood alone in the work of reform, Aristotle would have been altogether banished
                    from the schools of the reformed. But his roughness of hand was tempered in this
                    point, as in others, by the milder spirit of Melanchthon.</p>
                <p>Melanchthon, though he had too deep an acquaintance with classical literature not
                    to feel the charm of Plato’s writings, yet justly vindicated the superiority of
                    Aristotle’s philosophy as a discipline of the mind. He was therefore
                    instrumental in supporting the dominion of Aristotle in the schools, whilst he
                    rejected the errors to which the peripatetic philosophy had falsely
                    administered.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    disputes among Protestants themselves served to perpetuate the re-established
                    philosophy of Aristotle, and, from the same cause as before, the subtilties of
                    his Dialectic and Metaphysics were studied rather than the more practical parts
                    of his system. Thus, even after the labours of Bacon in dispelling the mists
                    which the Aristotelian philosophy, such as it descended through the doctors of
                    the scholastic ages, had diffused, Aristotle’s works, continued to be read and
                    taught in Protestant universities. His philosophy, during an empire of
                    centuries, had occupied so many posts in the field of literature, that no
                    system, however great an improvement, could at once displace it; for we find
                    even Bacon himself, in the process of counteracting it, and introducing his own
                    method, compelled to use a phraseology founded on the dogmas of the scholastic
                    creed.</p>
                <p>It is then of great importance to examine the system of Aristotle in its
                    authentic records. Such an examination will convince us that the philosopher is
                    not to be censured for that depravation of philosophy to which he was made
                    subservient; but that, had his system been rightly understood, and pursued in
                    the spirit of its author, the schoolmen could never have found in it just ground
                    for the extravagances into which they deviated. We are compelled, indeed, to
                    take our estimate of it from such Imperfect relics as time has spared to us out
                    of a far greater mass of his original writings.<note anchored="true"

                    Fortunately, however, those relics include a great variety of treatises,
                    affording a specimen at least of his mode of philosophizing in every department
                    of science.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">State of Philosophy before Aristotle. General Character of his
                    Philosophy.</hi></p>
                <p>Aristotle was the first philosopher who really separated the different sciences,
                    and constituted them into detached systems, each on its proper principles.
                    Before his time philosophy had existed as a vast undigested scheme of
                    speculative wisdom, fluctuating in its form and character according to the
                    circumstances and the genius of its leading professors.</p>
                <p>Thus the two great fountains of Grecian science— the Italic school, founded by
                    Pythagoras—the Ionic, by Thales—were both in their principle mathematical;
                    though, when we look to their actual results, as they were moulded by their
                    respective masters, the Italic may be characterized as the Ethical school, the
                    Ionic as the Physical. Both appear to have been drawn from the same
                    parent-source of Egyptian civilization and knowledge. That mystic combination of
                    mathematical, physical, and moral truth exhibited in the theological philosophy
                    of Egypt, found a kindred spirit in Pythagoras. Hence that solemn religious
                    light shed over his speculations. Mathematical truth was the basis of his
                    system. He made numbers the elements of all existing things; the objects of the
                    physical world being conceived by him to be “imitations,” or “representations,”
                    of the abstract natures of numbers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    whole, was a mysterious contemplation of the universe, addressed to the moral
                    and devotional feelings of man. Thales was a philosopher of a much more simple
                    cast. Like Pythagoras, he was devoted to mathematical study. He is said to have
                    instructed the Egyptians how to measure the height of their pyramids by means of
                    the shadows; and several of the theorems of the elements of Euclid are
                    attributed to him. But he did not, like Pythagoras, fall, into the error
                    confounding and blending the facts of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193102009"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-2009-0496"/>natural philosophy with the abstract truths of
                    science. According to him, it was sufficient to show that water might be
                    regarded as the primary element of all things. He sought no deeper cause in any
                    speculation concerning the mode in which this element subsisted. The successors
                    of Pythagoras and Thales variously modified the theories of those great masters.
                    The physical philosophy, however, of Thales, as the more simple and
                    intelligible, and probably also from the greater intercourse of Greece with its
                    Asiatic colonies than with its Italian, more especially prevailed in Greece;
                    until we find Socrates, who had been the disciple of Archelaus of that school,
                    complaining that the concerns of human life had been abandoned for the
                    subtilties of physics. In the hands of Socrates philosophy resumed its moral
                    complexion. Had it devolved on Xenophon to take the lead as the successor and
                    interpreter of Socrates, things would probably have continued in this course,
                    and ethical science would henceforth have triumphed in the Grecian schools. But
                    the genius of Plato succeeded to the rich patrimony of the Socratic philosophy:
                    and Plato was not one, whose ambition could be content with less than the
                    reputation of founding a school, or whose imagination could be tied down to the
                    realities of human life.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    field of exertion, in speculation on those moral truths with which the lessons
                    of Socrates had inspired him. He had also been a hearer of Cratylus,<note

                    “perpetual flux” of nature, the favourite doctrine of Heraclitus. Plato
                    accordingly applied himself to the combination of these various systems. The
                    theory of Pythagoras was to be retained Consistently with the perpetual change
                    of all existing things according to Heraclitus, and with the immutability of
                    nature implied in the Socratic definitions. Definitions could not apply to any
                    perceptible objects, if it were allowed that all such objects were constantly
                    changing; nor could numbers sufficiently account for that immense variety of
                    objects which the universe presented. There must therefore be some existences,
                    independent of the perceptible universe, to serve as the objects of definitions;
                    and there must be also an infinity of various archi-types, corresponding to the
                    various classes of external objects. Hence he devised his doctrine of <hi
                    rend="italic">nδη,</hi> or ideas; a doctrine naturally suggested to an
                    imaginative mind, by the fixedness and universality of the terms of language, as
                    contrasted with the perpetual variation of the course of nature. To these
                    abstract natures he assigned a real being, as objects of intellectual
                    apprehension alone, accounting for the existence of sensible objects from their
                    “participation” of these intellectual universals. Thus he raised a structure of
                    physical philosophy on a basis of metaphysics and logic conjointly; or, in other
                    words, philosophy, in its passage through the school of Plato, had been invested
                    with a dialectical character. Dialectic, the science, according to Plato, which
                    speculates on these universals or the intellectual world, was held forth to the
                    student in wisdom as the dominant philosophy, the consummation and end of all

                <p>Such was the state of philosophy when Aristotle began to teach, and in which he
                    had himself been trained: but it was not a system in which his penetrating mind
                    could rest satisfied. He thought too deeply and accurately, not to discover that

                    and that, in order to rest the sciences on a sure basis, a more exact analysis
                    of the principles of human knowledge was required. He accordingly addressed
                    himself to the task of developing a <hi rend="italic">really intellectual</hi>
                    system of nature, in the stead of that imaginary intellectual system which the
                    enthusiasm of Plato had created.</p>
                <p>He found the different sciences separated from their roots, and vegetating only
                    as stunted branches on a stock of dialectic unnatural to them. Even dialectic
                    itself, in this state of things, was neglected. Its proper nature was unknown in
                    that conjunction of logic and metaphysics which had usurped its name; and its
                    relation to the other sciences was misapprehended. In overthrowing the doctrine
                    of ideas, therefore, he had to make an entire reform of philosophy. And, in
                    fact, he did appear no less as a reformer of the ancient philosophy, than Bacon
                    was of the scholastic system. In each case, idols were enthroned in the niches
                    and shrines of the temple of science; and the hand of the reformer was required
                    to cast them down and break them in pieces. If indeed we impartially consider
                    the case, we shall find that Aristotle was animated by the same spirit which
                    dictated the method of the inductive philosophy, and that his reform was
                    directed to the same points. It was his object, as well as Bacon’s, to recall
                    men, from their unprofitable flight to universals, to the real course of nature;
                    and to direct them in the discovery of sure principles of science.</p>
                <p>He was the first, accordingly, to exhibit a particular science drawn out into its
                    proper system. There was, for instance, a great deal of logical and of moral
                    truth scattered through the writings of Plato; but there was no regular
                    statement of the principles either of logical or moral science, no distinct
                    collection of the proper facts of those sciences, until the treatises of the
                    Organon and the Nicoachean Ethics of Aristotle appeared. We may easily conceive
                    the arduousness and importance of this service in the cause of philosophy. For
                    any reformer to have fully carried it into effect in every science, we may
                    indeed pronounce to be impossible. And we shall not wonder, therefore, that in
                    some instances he should have failed, or have merely indicated the proper path
                    of inquiry. .</p>
                <p>It was not indeed to be expected, that one trained in the dialectical philosophy
                    of Plato should have emerged at once from the prejudices imposed by that system.
                    Aristotle, though professedly opposed to the realism involved in Plato’s
                    doctrine of ideas, yet betrays the power of language over his own speculations,
                    by the importance which he attributes to abstract conceptions as the foundations
                    of scientific truth. It is a delusion, which the simple attention to the
                    phraseology of one language (and there is no evidence that Aristotle knew any
                    other language but his own) is apt to produce. In the analysis of the terms, we
                    lose sight of the merely arbitrary connection between the terms and the objects
                    designated by them, and suppose that we have penetrated into the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193102022" xml:id="kp-eb0703-2022-0497"/>nature of the thing, when we
                    have only explored the philosophical meaning of the term. Thus Aristotle, whilst
                    he rejected the Platonic ideas, still conceived that there were universal
                    principles in nature, in the knowledge of which true science consisted. He
                    differed at the same time essentially from Plato in his view of these
                    universals. Plato regarded the ideas as causes of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >existence</hi> of sensible objects; whereas Aristotle considers the-universals
                    of which his philosophy treats, as causes of <hi rend="italic">our
                    knowledge</hi> of nature. Aristotle did not allow that these universals had in
                    themselves any physical reality independent of the human mind, but he conceived
                    that they pointed to the real internal nature of existing things.</p>
                <p>Philosophy, accordingly, under his hands, stripped of its metaphysical mysticism,
                    assumed a logical aspect. The foundations of science were laid in definitions of
                    those essential natures which he conceived to be the substrata of universals;
                    and from these definitions the particular truths of the sciences were to be
                    deduced as a series of consequences.</p>
                <p>From this view of the nature of science, it followed that he should employ
                    induction, rather to determine notions, than to arrive at general principles,’
                    such as in modern philosophy are denominated Laws of Nature. In order to
                    discover an <hi rend="italic">universal</hi> principle, on which a system of
                    science might be raised, it was necessary to state exactly that conception of
                    the mind which belonged exclusively to any particular class of objects. The
                    stating such a conception was, in the phraseology of Aristotle, the assigning of
                    the ∖ <hi rend="italic">οyος</hi> of the cu&lt;r∕α, or the giving a definition
                    of the object as it really existed. A notion of this kind required an accurate
                    analysis of thought. Every notion common to other objects was to be rejected;
                    and after the rejection of these, that which remained exclusively appropriate to
                    the object under consideration, .was to be assumed as the proper universal by
                    which its real nature was denoted. The process was not dissimilar to that by
                    which the truths of modern science are elicited, except that the induction of
                    Aristotle terminated in <hi rend="italic">universals</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> whereas the induction of Bacon terminates in <hi rend="italic"
                    >general</hi> principles; —such principles being the utmost that can be obtained
                    from outward observation of objects. It is precisely indeed in this point that
                    the great difference consists between the science of Aristotle and that of
                    Bacon. Aristotle, for example, inquires into the nature of light, and endeavours
                    to define it exactly as it differs from all other natures. This definition is an
                    expression of that universal on which the whole nature of light is conceived to
                    depend. A modern philosopher pursuing the method of Bacon, examines facts
                    concerning it, and, distinguishing those which really belong to it from those
                    which do not, concludes from·the remainder some general affirmative respecting
                    it. A modern philosopher often draws a conclusion as to the nature of a thing;
                    as when he infers that light is material, or that the soul is immaterial. But
                    then he does not hold such inferences as universals in the sense of Aristotle,
                    nor does he employ them to interpret the facts of a scicncè. He acquiesces in
                    such conclusions as ultimate principles. He finds,'for example, the facts
                    belonging to <hi rend="superscript"> f</hi> the falling of bodies on the earth’s
                    surface, and to the revolutions of the heavens, coincident in the same general
                    law. He pronounces, therefore, that the principle signified.by. the term
                    gravity,, whatever its nature may be, is the same in both classes of facts. His
                    conclusions at the same time in Natural Philosophy are independent of this
                    assumption, as these would not be affected though the principle of; gravitation
                    were proved to be different in the two cases. If you overthrow, on the other
                    hand, a speculative doctrine of the ancient physics all the conclusions fall to
                    the ground.</p>
                <p>Vve shall wonder the less at the peculiar complexion of Aristotle’s philosophy,
                    when we observe that even modern philosophers have been by no means exempt from
                    the realism which language tends to suggest, and which might almost be termed
                    the original sin of the human understanding.</p>
                <p>Such, then, according to Aristotle, was the character of philosophy, so far as it
                    was purely theoretic. It furnished the mind with the means of contemplating
                    nature surely and steadily, amidst the variety of phenomena which external
                    objects presented, by fixing it on universal principles, eternal and
                    unchangeable.</p>
                <p>But this was not the only view which he took of philosophy. He did not limit it
                    to contemplation alone. He regarded it further as ministering to human life
                    under two other distinct points of view—as it was productive of some effect, and
                    as it instructed us for action. Thus, he distributed philosophy in general into
                    three branches: 1s⅛ Theoretic, 2<hi rend="smallcaps">d</hi>, Efficient, 3d,
                    Practical; including under Theoretic, Physics, Mathematics, Theology, or the
                    Prime Philosophy, or the science more familiarly known by the name of
                    Metaphysics; under Efficient, what we commonly term the arts, as Dialectic or
                    Logic, Rhetoric, Poetics; under Practical, the moral sciences, as Ethics and
                    Politics. Whilst, then, in order to a purely theoretic philosophy, he
                    consistently endeavoured to present to the mind the primary elements of thought,
                    attending rather to the order of human reason than to the phenomena of nature,
                    he had a different aim in the two other branches of philosophy, and pursued a
                    different method. In these, his aim was to enable the student to realize some
                    effect, or to attain some good; in Efficient Philosophy, to lay before the mind
                    those principles which constitute the arts; in Practical, those principles by
                    which the goods of human life are attained by individuals or societies. Thus, in
                    both these branches his object was precisely what'Bacon’s was in the whole
                    method of his philosophy—to increasehuman power by increasing human knowledge.
                    And he has accordingly adopted, in pursuing them, the same inductive method
                    which Bacon has formally explored in the <hi rend="italic">Novum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Organum.</hi> We find him in these strictly attending to
                    experience—deducing his speculative principles from facts, and pointing out
                    their application to the realities of the arts and of human life. Under the term
                    <hi rend="italic">rεχνη,</hi> indeed, which we commonly translate art, he
                    comprised much more than is understood by art. Chemistry, for instance, might
                    justly be referred to this branch of philosophy, so far as its principles are
                    applicable to the production of any effect. In fact, it corresponds more nearly
                    with science, in the acceptation of the word science by Bacon, or to what is
                    commonly understood by the term “applied sciences ;” for Aristotle himself
                    expressly asserts it to be the result of experience—observing, that memory of
                    particular events is the foundation of experience, and that from several
                    experiences art is produced.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>So also, in his practical philosophy he directs us not to seek a speculative
                    certainty of principles, but to be satisfied with such as result from the
                    experience of human life. He further even cautions us against treating this
                    department in the <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> method of his theoretic
                    philosophy, in remarking that the doctrine of universal good was an useless
                    speculation in that kind of inquiry.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Philosophy in its application to the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193102035"

                    inductive method there also; and in truth he has done so, so far as particular
                    departments of nature are explored in his writings in order to particular arts.
                    But his works professedly treating of Natural Philosophy belong to a higher
                    speculation, according to his estimate, than those which concern human life. He
                    conceived the things of the material world to be endued with an unoriginated and
                    indestructible nature, and <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> the eternal objects
                    of scientific truth,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    The former, therefore, were not satisfactorily investigated until they were
                    referred to their ultimate fixed principles; but of the latter it was sufficient
                    to obtain such knowledge as the contingency of the objects admitted. He
                    perceived, from his accurate and extensive knowledge of human nature, that there
                    was no ground for that realism in morals which the more uniform aspect of the
                    physical world tended to inculcate. The immense variety of objects to which the
                    appellation of “goods” was applied, impressed on his acute mind the conviction,
                    that there was no one fixed and invariable principle implied by that term; and
                    that the philosophy of moral subjects, accordingly, was to be sought simply in
                    an observation of facts, without endeavouring to trace them to some further
                    principle.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>He has been,
                    on this account, very inadvertently accused by Brucker <hi rend="italic">(Hist.

                    commended for his truly philosophical view of the science.</p></note></p>
                <p>It will illustrate this arrangement of the sciences to look to the Theory of
                    Causation, or the classes into which the ancient philosophy distributed the
                    several principles of scientific truth. Now, the classes of such principles
                    assigned by Aristotle are, Is/, the Material, or that class which comprehends
                    all those cases in which the inquiry is, <hi rend="italic">out of</hi> what a
                    given effect has originated. From the analogy which this class has to the wood,
                    or stone, or any actual material, out of which any work of nature or art is
                    produced, the name “material” has been currently given to the class. But it is
                    not commonly so termed by Aristotle, whose description of it is more precise and
                    philosophical.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    Unfortunately, the adoption of the term “material” has been the source of great
                    misunderstanding of Aristotle’s doctrine. It has been supposed to imply that
                    inquiries coming under this head refer to something physically existing, some
                    real object, as wood or stone; whereas, according to Aristotle, it is simply a
                    view of antecedents, that is, of those principles whose priority is implied in
                    any given fact.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    premises of a syllogism accordingly are the material cause of the
                    conclusion.</p></note> The material cause, then, is properly an intellectual
                    class of principles—one method of analysis, by which the mind simplifies to its
                    own view the variety of existing objects.</p>
                <p>The second class of causes is that to which all inquiries belong, which respect
                    the proper characteristic nature of a thing. To this Aristotle gives the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">uδος,</hi> form or exemplar.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thus he terms it also <hi rend="italic"

                    modern philosophy “laws of nature.” According to Aristotle, and to the spirit of
                    the ancient philosophy in general, it is the abstract essence or being of a
                    thing,—that primary nature of it on which all its properties might be conceived
                    to depend. Bacon, indeed, has retained the scholastic name “form” in his
                    philosophy, and applied it to denote the generalizations of his philosophy;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bacon, <hi rend="italic">Nov.
                    Org.</hi> ii. 2.</p></note> —a general fact, from its excluding all merely
                    accidental circumstances, being in a manner the proper <hi rend="italic"
                    >form</hi> of the particular facts from which it is deduced.</p>
                <p>The third class of causes comprehends all inquiries into the motive or efficient
                    principles of a thing. It differs from the material cause—which it resembles so
                    far as it is an investigation of antecedents—in its reference to such
                    antecedents only as are the means in order to an effect. We may contemplate a
                    given effect <hi rend="italic">as such,</hi> and not simply as a mere <hi
                    rend="italic">event</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in that case should inquire
                    into the power by which it was produced, or the Motive Cause. It is to this
                    class that the term cause<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The word cause is indeed, as has been often pointed out, only a verbal
                    generalization of the different principles to which it is here applied. The
                    Greek word amuis nearer the truth.</p></note> is popularly applied, by analogy
                    from the works of human art, in which we are able to discern the connection
                    between means and results. Aristotle, however, did not suppose that we could
                    discern any such connection in nature; not intending more by this class than
                    those principles of the mind under which all effects, <hi rend="italic">as
                    such,</hi> might be arranged.</p>
                <p>The fourth class in the ancient theory of Causation is, what in the language of
                    the schoolmen has obtained the appellation of the Final Cause, or, to express it
                    more after the mind of Aristotle, inquiries directed to the perfect nature or
                    tendency of any existing thing. For example, when we appeal from virtue militant
                    in the world to virtue triumphant in heaven, and derive precepts of duty from
                    this ultimate view of virtue, or of the end to which it is tending, we argue
                    from a final cause in the sense of Aristotle: so, again, when it is contended
                    that the eye was formed for seeing, because its nature is perfected in the act
                    of seeing; or, in general, whenever it is inferred that such is the nature of a
                    thing, because it is <hi rend="italic">best</hi> that it should be so. According
                    to modern views, design is always implied in a final cause. In Aristotle, it is
                    a philosophical view of an intrinsic tendency in nature, analogous to the effect
                    of design.</p>
                <p>The division of philosophy adopted by Aristotle corresponds with this division of
                    causes. Physical science, as concerned about objects, of which one appears the
                    result of another, or rather of which one is found to be produced after another,
                    is an investigation of material causes. The inquiry is into the law of that
                    continuation and succession observed in the natural world,—what the antecedents
                    are in this course,—what the ultimate principles, to which the mind may carry
                    its analysis of the succession of natural events.</p>
                <p>Metaphysics and mathematics, as employed about notions of the mind, are sciences
                    belonging to the Formal Cause. They endeavour to draw forth that secret
                    philosophy by which the mind administers the world of its own ideas; and, in
                    this process, to arrive at those ultimate abstractions, into which all other
                    principles may be resolved, as into their ultimate forms; metaphysics and
                    mathematics differing only so far as mathematics consider ideas of quantity
                    exclusively, whereas metaphysics embrace all our abstract notions.</p>
                <p>Dialectic and the arts in general are inquiries into motive causes, since it is
                    by the arts that human power is exerted in producing certain effects. The
                    principles of rhetoric, for instance, are the means by which the effect of
                    persuasion is produced. In order to produce any effect, we must observe what
                    acts, what moves, what influences—</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193102048" xml:id="kp-eb0703-2048-0499"/>
                <p>not simply what precedes or follows—in the course of nature; and a study of this
                    kind constitutes what Aristotle calls efficient philosophy.</p>
                <p>The final cause is the science of human actions, or practical philosophy.
                    Actions, being the exertions of inward principles towards some end, cannot
                    rightly be judged of as to their nature, by the view of them merely as effects,
                    but must be considered in their <hi rend="italic">tendency. A.</hi>
                    compassionate action, for example, may in its actual effect be productive of
                    evil; but we cannot estimate the nature of the action from this result, but must
                    further inquire whether the result was coincident or not with the effect
                    intended; that is, we must inquire into its final cause.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The same principle applies to the arts also,
                    so far as the skill in any art is exerted in action. We then judge of the art so
                    exemplified by its tendency to produce the proper effect; of the wisdom, for
                    instance, of the politician by the adaptation of his counsels to the welfare of
                    his country—not simply by their result, which may accidentally be
                    untoward.</p></note></p>
                <p>But though this is the appropriate classification of the principles of the
                    several sciences, it does not follow that any particular science is restricted
                    to one particular mode of speculation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    type="authorial"><p>Thus an action may be analysed into the affection exerted in
                    it (the material or physical cause), the moral choice of the agent (the motive
                    cause), the end to which it tends (the final cause), the definition of the
                    virtue to which it belongs (the formal cause); and yet the science of the action
                    is fundamentally an inquiry into the final cause.</p></note> As all philosophy
                    indeed ultimately refers to the principles of the human mind, so far every
                    science is a speculation of the formal cause. In Aristotle’s system of physics,
                    the doctrine of final causes occupies in fact the <hi rend="italic"
                    >principal</hi> place, instead of being employed, as in modern philosophy, in

                    threefold division of philosophy, and contained in the extant writings of
                    Aristotle, those which he has classed under the head of theoretic philosophy, as
                    being the only <hi rend="italic">proper sciences</hi> in his view, naturally
                    come first to be considered. These, as we have observed, are physics,
                    metaphysics, and mathematics.</p>
                <p>There is the less occasion for considering these three sciences distinctly, as
                    Aristotle in his treatises of them has not strictly maintained their separation,
                    but has often blended their different principles in the same discussion. In this
                    department of philosophy, he receded less from the dialectical system of Plato,
                    and felt the influence of that system attracting him into its vortex. As Plato,
                    by drawing off the attention of the philosophical inquirer from nature itself to
                    the ideas of his intellectual world, was led to confound all the sciences in one
                    philosophical reverie; so Aristotle, in the theoretic branch of his philosophy,
                    looking to the ultimate principles of the sciences as they exist in the human
                    mind, rather than to the phenomena of each, overlooked their real differences in
                    his mode of treating them. The ground of this promiscuous discussion is to be
                    found in that classification which he adopts of the objects of these three
                    sciences.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    from existing things. The science which considers Being in union with matter, or
                    as it is evidenced under those variations which the material world presents, is
                    physics. That which considers Being as it is conceived separate from the
                    variations of the material world, though not (probably, he observes) abstracted
                    from matter, is mathematics. Lastly, that to which the name of metaphysics has
                    been given by his commentators, but to which Aristotle himself assigns the name
                    of theology, or the First philosophy, is the science which considers Being
                    separated both from the variations of the material world and altogether from
                    matter. It appears, therefore, that the objects of his inquiry in each of these
                    three sciences were ultimately the same. He is engaged in all—in investigating
                    those universal principles under which he conceives all existing things are
                    arranged by the mind. For this is the meaning of Being in his philosophy. It
                    stands for any of those conceptions of the mind by which the various natures or
                    properties of existing things are denoted. The sciences, accordingly, not
                    differing fundamentally in his view, he was naturally, though very erroneously,
                    led to combine them in speculation.</p>
                <p>Hence the abortive and futile character of his physical philosophy. Instead of
                    looking to the phenomena of the material world, he was employed in deducing
                    consequences from metaphysical and mathematical data; arguing from the mere
                    abstract notions of the mind to the realities of external nature. Thus, instead
                    of being an investigation of the laws of nature, it was an airy fabric of
                    speculative reasoning from assumed principles. Whilst he thought that he was
                    delivering incontrovertible truths of physical science, he was only analyzing
                    the connections of the notions of the human mind, and arranging them under their
                    appropriate terms. No other method, indeed, is open to the philosopher, who
                    would penetrate the veil of the actual phenomena, and establish a certainty of
                    science beyond the concessions of nature, but to resort to abstract definitions.
                    These being once laid down, the truths of science follow by necessary
                    connection; for they are then the mere development of general assertions into
                    the particulars implied in them. But, as it thus appears, the certainty and
                    necessity of the conclusions are simply the consistency with our original
                    meaning. It is absurd to suppose them otherwise, because this would be
                    equivalent to asserting that our meaning was not what we asserted it to be.
                    Aristotle indeed himself allows, that truth of fact and truth of science are not
                    mutually implied in each other, "Impossible and possible, and falsehood and
                    truth,” he observes, “are either hypothetical—as it is impossible for a triangle
                    to have two right angles if this is so, and the diameter of a square is
                    commensurate with its side if this is so-—or absolute. But absolute falsehood
                    and absolute impossibility are not the same; since, for one not standing to say
                    he is standing, is false, but not impossible; and for a harper not singing to
                    say he is singing, is false but not impossible; but to stand and sit at once, or
                    for the diameter to be commensurate, is not only false, but impossible.”<note

                    <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> spirit of his physical philosophy, to be
                    deduced. Agreeably to this order or inquiry, he sets out with discussing the
                    question, whether these principles should be ultimately referred to one or more
                    than one, and laying down his own doctrine of three principles, to which he
                    gives the denomination of, 1. matter, 2. form, 3. privation. These are the
                    well-known principles, of which so perverse a use has been made by the
                    schoolmen, and which have consequently occasioned much undue censure of the
                    Aristotelian system of physics. That system, indeed, is sufficiently condemned
                    in its <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> character, but is guiltless of the
                    absurdity which the scholastic refinements have cast upon it. These three
                    principles are nothing more than general conceptions of the mind, as it
                    endeavours to class the various objects of the sensible universe, and to refer
                    the succession of events without itself to some ultimate unchanging views within
                    itself. It has been already explained what is meant by a material cause, the εξ
                    oû or <hi rend="italic">υλη</hi> of Aristotle. These principles, then, are only
                    different modifications of this cause. They arc antecedents, or notions at which
                    the mind ultimately arrives, in an analysis of its complex notions of natural
                    objects; and therefore antecedents, because they must be presupposed in every
                    contemplation of the natural world. The terms by which they are denoted are
                    merely analogical. Aristotle, pro</p>

                    philosophers before him,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    must be at least two opposite classes of principles. In the changes observed in
                    the course of the world, one object is succeeded by another; something has
                    passed away, something is produced. Two fundamental notions, therefore, are
                    involved in every contemplation of nature, and these are expressed by the terms
                    Form and Privation; imperfectly characterizing these subtile abstractions,
                    though shadowing them out justly, so far as the relation denoted corresponds
                    with that between the present form of any material object and the previous forms
                    now superseded by it. For example, a statue is a form now constituted in the
                    stead of that infinite multiplicity of figures of which the marble or brass in
                    its unmoulded state was susceptible, and of which it is, as it were, “deprived,”
                    in the very act of producing the statue. The very analogy, however, is apt to
                    induce us to suppose that there is something real implied by the terms form and
                    privation in the language of Aristotle. Hence the ridicule with which the
                    statement of privation as a physical principle is commonly received. But if
                    rightly understood, it holds a just and important place in the physical
                    philosophy of Aristotle; and to see the proper nature of it, it should be
                    observed, that it applies no less to immaterial objects than to material.<note

                    is capable of moral improvement. Supposing him, then, civilized and improved
                    beyond his ordinary state, we perceive in such a case a transition from a state
                    of barbarism to a state of culture. The state of culture, then, is the form of
                    which Aristotle speaks; the state of barbarism, which may be in infinite
                    varieties of form, the privation. Or, a person becomes healthy from being
                    diseased; health is the form superinduced, the privation is of every species of
                    disease. But besides those principles which are excluded in the physical
                    constitution of any thing, and so referred to the head of privation,—and those
                    principles in which the peculiar constitution of the thing is found to consist,
                    and which are therefore referred to the head of form,—there are evidently other
                    principles which remain the same in all variations of form. The actual nature of
                    the physical objects remains unchanged: and the notion, therefore, by which that
                    nature is represented to the human mind, must be respected, in assigning a cause
                    for the physical constitution of a thing; as being an antecedent out of which it
                    proceeded. To this notion, or class of principles by which the ultimate common
                    nature of different objects is denoted, Aristotle applies the name of ύλη, or
                    matter; this notion being analogous to the stuff or substance of which different
                    works of human art are constructed, as marble or brass is the material of which
                    different statues are made.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Now, beyond these it is impossible to proceed in the philosophy of physical
                    existence. They comprise, in fact, the whole of modern investigations in
                    physics, though these last have been prosecuted in an order exactly the reverse
                    of that of Aristotle. These have ended where he began: but they have had these
                    several principles in view. That <hi rend="italic">abscissio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">infiniti,</hi> prosecuted in the inductive method of philosophy,
                    is analogous to the “privation” of Aristotle’s system. It is a continued process
                    of separating from any subject under examination, of those natures or principles
                    which do not constitute the proper nature of the subject, and thus gradually
                    narrowing the inquiry more and more, until we have at last obtained some
                    ultimate fact, the proper nature of the thing. This ultimate fact, accordingly,
                    Bacon terms the form of the thing, adopting that expression to denote the law or
                    principle by which it exists. It is the result, we observe, which remains to be
                    affirmed, after rejecting and excluding other principles; or, to speak in
                    analogical language, after the subject has been deprived of all those forms in
                    which its proper nature does not consist. Again, Bacon directs that a collection
                    be made of all those “<hi rend="italic">in-stantiae,”</hi> instances, to which
                    the form in question seems to belong. These instances, so far as they agree in
                    this respect, correspond with the material principle of Aristotle. They exhibit
                    that common nature, in some one form of which the particular nature sought must
                    be found.</p>
                <p>Aristotle, of course, did not conceive of these principles according to the view
                    of them here given. The design of his inquiry is, by an analysis of nature, as
                    that term is applied in physics, to obtain those fundamental notions to which
                    all the various notions involved in the speculation of nature might ultimately
                    be referred. For he explains things that have their being by nature to be such
                    as have in themselves a principle of motion and rest, as contrasted with works
                    of art, the principle of which is in the artist.<note anchored="true"

                    is to examine this inherent principle of motion and rest, which is the nature of
                    a thing, and to show how it operates in producing the various forms observed in
                    the world around us. His error was not unlike that of one who should profess to
                    give an account of visible objects solely from what they <hi rend="italic"
                    >appear</hi> to the eye, and who should accordingly describe such objects as
                    flat surfaces, variously shaded and coloured. Hom this view of the object of
                    natural philosophy, he was led to account for the processes of generation and
                    corruption? and the changes which occur in bodies by alteration, increase and
                    decrease, local motion, mixture. Consequently» he states his ultimate principles

                    which physical effects are produced, rather than as principles by which the
                    investigation of nature must be guided. Hence the perverse application of his
                    physical philosophy in the middle ages to work transmutations in nature. The
                    labours of the alchemists were nothing else but a practical realism founded on

                    theology.</p></note></p>
                <p>The discovery of the principle to which the denomination of form is assigned, is,
                    in Aristotle’s system, as in Bacon’s, the ultimate point of physical inquiry.
                    The investigation of the principles of matter and privation is in order to the
                    discovery of the form; which is thus the <hi rend="italic">&lt;riaος</hi> or
                    completion of the process of nature. That principle of self-motion which,
                    according to Aristotle, is the object of physics, is then traced to its effect
                    on the thing produced, and we have obtained the <hi rend="italic"

                    ancient philosophy, that “nature does nothing in vain that “nature always works
                    the best that the case admits that “nothing by nature is imperfect.”<note

                    that Aristotle expressly asserts the necessity which belongs to physical facts
                    to be hypothetical—dependent, that is, on the assumption of the end pursued by
                    nature, in like manner as the conclusions in mathematics are dependent on the

                <p>It is curious to observe the traces of such a doctrine in different systems of
                    philosophy, as they appear under different modifications. In some of the older
                    theories, we find indications of it in the hypothesis of two opposing
                    principles, as love and enmity, by which it was proposed to solve those
                    appearances in nature which were adverse to the notion of the tendency of nature
                    to the best. In the systems of Parmenides and of Hesiod, love and desire-in that
                    of Anaxagoras, intellect—were the expressions of this tendency. In the
                    philosophy of Plato, it was evidenced in the rejection of the material world
                    from the class of permanent and real existences; this doctrine being a ready
                    transition from the notion, which attributed the physical constitution of things
                    to their dependence on some ultimate principles. Modern deists have argued m the
                    same way, when they have rejected an account of things alleged to have proceeded
                    from the Author of nature, because these things did not correspond with what
                    they had determined to be “best” in nature.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Aristotle. Inquiring into nature simply as a principle of motion, he was only
                    called upon to show how those changes which took place in the material world
                    might be satisfactorily accounted for. It was no part of his philosophy to
                    demonstrate that any particular material, or combination of materials, was
                    employed in the laboratory of nature for effecting her productions and
                    transmutations. All he assumes is, that some material or other is employed in
                    every instance of a physical object, to effect that perfect constitution of it
                    in which its “form” consists. It is not indeed a physical object, unless it is
                    conceived in conjunction with “matter but provided it has “matter,”—that is, has
                    a nature capable of affecting the external senses,—what particular kind of
                    matter it may have, is irrelevant to his inquiry.<note anchored="true"

                    must pre-exist in the production of ether, is not the point with which he is
                    concerned. It is enough that there is in every physical effect a principle of
                    motion operating. It follows, from the existence of such a principle, that there
                    must be some “matter otherwise the <hi rend="italic">material</hi> effect—the
                    effect cognizable by the senses—would not have been produced.</p>
                <p>The analogous inquiry in his system is, which are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >prior</hi> principles in the order of transition, so that from the presence or
                    absence of these the constitution of any particular body results? What are those
                    which never pass into each other, and which may therefore be regarded as
                    elementary principles of motion?</p>
                <p>Hence his detailed investigation of Motion, considered in the technical sense in
                    which the term is employed in his philosophy, as it is exhibited in physical
                    changes of place, or quantity, or quality; generation and corruption; the action
                    and passion of bodies; and mixture. Hence also his discussion in his physics of
                    questions which, in modern philosophy, are more properly regarded as the
                    province of the metaphysician; as the nature of infinity, time, and place: all
                    which, however, belong to his inquiry, as implied in the various processes of
                    motion.</p>
                <p>A speculative difficulty, however, occurred to him in the prosecution of this
                    physical theory, like that which perplexed the material philosophers in respect
                    to the preexistence of matter. He had to account for the production by motion of
                    a form not previously existing.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    being, and manifested to our perception in some physical object.<note

                    modern philosophy, we should say it was a transition from metaphysical existence
                    to physical; from an object of the mind only, cognizable by the internal
                    principles of our constitution, to an object of the external senses ;—the mind
                    perceiving the principle of motion <hi rend="italic">as a principle,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> the senses giving us the primary impression of the
                    principle <hi rend="italic">moving</hi> or operating on matter.</p>
                <p>This doctrine of potential being, transmitted through the scholastic philosophy,
                    and through that perverted to realism, has given occasion to represent a
                    coincidence on this point in the system of Aristotle with the ideal theory of
                    Plato, the very part of Plato’s philosophy which Aristotle most directly
                    opposed. But it should be observed, that the forms of which Aristotle speaks,
                    are not, like the ideas of Plato, constituent of physical objects. They are the
                    philosophy of nature considered as an instinctive principle of motion—general
                    principles under which the mind classes the operations of physical power,
                    analogously to its own external operations.</p>
                <p>Leaving, then, the question as to the material itself, of which physical objects
                    are composed, untouched, Aristotle examines what principles reject and exclude
                    one another in the various changes of the material world. For these are the
                    causes of the transitions of one nature into another, and of generation and
                    corruption: the presence of one involving the privation of all those forms of
                    matter dependent on the presence of the other. What these mutually excluding
                    principles are, he decides by a reference to the sense of touch; that being the
                    proper evidence to us of the existence of body: since, though sight may give us
                    the first notices of the <hi rend="italic">existence</hi> of a material thing,
                    it does not inform us of the <hi rend="italic">material</hi> nature of the
                    thing; which we infer from the resistance to the sense of touch. Accordingly,
                    Aristotle explains what is sensible to be what is tangible.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">De Gen. et Cor.</hi> ii. c.
                    2.</p></note> The contrarieties then ascertained by touch, and which account
                    therefore for all the different forms of matter, are hot and cold, dry and
                    moist; the first two as active principles, the last two as passive. The touch,
                    indeed, informs us of other contrarieties, but they are all reducible to these
                    four heads, with the exception of light and heavy. These last are excluded from
                    the class of physical principles; since, though Aristotle, in common with other
                    ancient philosophers, held them to be positive and absolute natures, he found,
                    that they could not act on each other, and therefore could not effect any
                    physical change. As hot and cold cannot co-exist, nor can moist and dry, these
                    four principles admit only of four combinations, and the effect of each
                    combination is a different element. The combination of hot and dry is fire; of
                    hot and moist, air; of cold and dry, earth; of cold and moist, water. Any one of
                    these elements may pass into another<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Und.</hi> ιι. c. 4.</p></note> by the
                    privation of one of the combined principles: since then, the contrary principle,
                    which had been only excluded by the presence of its contrary, combines with the
                    remaining one; <hi rend="italic">e. g.</hi> water is transformed into air, by
                    the privation of cold, and the consequent combination of hot with the moist
                    which remains; or both principles combined may be superseded by the two
                    opposites, as when fire and water may be changed into each other. Thus there is
                    a subordination of principles wherever the principle of motion is exerted in
                    act. First, there must be matter, that is, a principle susceptible of the
                    contrarieties; then the contrarieties ∙ and last of all the material elements
                    themselves.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    When the change effected involves an entire change of the material from which it
                    proceeds, the process is that of generation and corruption; but when the change
                    is simply in the affections of some existing body, as when the same person from
                    being unmusical becomes musical, or the food of an animal is converted into its
                    substance, the process is that of alteration.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Thus does Aristotle account for all the changes which take place in the world
                    immediately about us. Whether we observe things produced altered in their
                    sensible qualities, or in bulk, or in place (and to one or the other of these
                    every physical effect may be inferred), the changes observed may be traced to
                    the operation of a principle which is either one of these four already
                    mentioned, or some modification of them; for all the intermediate principles
                    between two contrarieties are to be regarded as contrary, and capable therefore
                    of effecting physical changes in the same manner as the extremes.</p>
                <p>But the changes which occur immediately in the world around us, constituted, in
                    the view of the ancient philosopher, a very inferior part of the objects of
                    physical science. The luminaries of the celestial world were regarded by
                    Aristotle as superior to man himself, and the study of their laws as a higher
                    employment of the intellect than the philosophy of human life.<note

                    other physical changes, it appears, imply local change, which may therefore be
                    inferred to be prior to every other.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    constant succession of generation and corruption which is carried on in the
                    world, there must be some principle ever in actual being; and the revolution of
                    the heavenly bodies continuing incessantly, exhibits a principle of local motion
                    adequate to this effect. Aristotle, accordingly, was led to philosophize on the
                    motions of the heavens, in order to trace up the propagation of motion in this
                    lower world, through its successive impulses, to the prime mover. This being
                    discovered, his philosophy of nature is then completed, since nature is then
                    fully explored according to his analysis as a principle of motion and rest.</p>
                <p>His whole astronomy is dependent on those speculative notions which he had
                    adopted, of lightness and heaviness, as intrinsic and absolute properties of
                    bodies. He considers lightness the same as -positive tendency upwards, and
                    heaviness as positive tendency downwards. But this view implied that there were
                    certain fixed points, the extremes to which these qualities of bodies tended,
                    and in which they naturally rested as they naturally possessed either lightness
                    or heaviness. Each of the material elements, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193102100"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-2100-0503"/>accordingly, had its proper place in the universe,
                    corresponding to the degree of lightness or heaviness which he conceived them to
                    possess, absolutely in themselves, and relatively to each other. Fire he placed
                    in the extreme point upwards, earth in the lowest; air next to fire, and water
                    next to earth. Each of these elements, therefore, he argued, as naturally
                    tending either upwards or downwards, moved in a straight line, and could not
                    consequently move <hi rend="italic">naturally</hi> in a circle. Hence the earth
                    must be at rest, and therefore be the centre of the universe. For if it revolved
                    round the sun, as the Pythagoreans thought, it would be moving unnaturally, and
                    therefore could not move eternally. Hence, also, no revolving body could consist
                    of any of the four material elements. It must be some other material, to which
                    circular motion was as natural, as rectilineal motion is to earth or fire.</p>
                <p>On the ground of such speculative notions Aristotle proceeded in constructing his
                    system of the universe; in opposition to the more enlightened researches of the
                    Pythagorean astronomy, and the records of Egyptian and Babylonian<note

                    their accordance with his speculations <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> as he
                    rejected or misinterpreted other facts from their repugnance to these
                    speculations. For the spherical form of the earth resulted from his theory of
                    gravity. It was the effect of the tendency of all the particles of the earth to
                    the lowest point; this lowest point being a centre of the two opposite
                    hemispheres of the heavens. For, that the whole heavens were spherical, he
                    supposed a necessary consequence of the perfection belonging to them, a solid
                    being the most perfect mathematical dimension. The tendency, consequently, of
                    all the particles of the earth to the lowest point, was a tendency towards a
                    middle; or this lowest point would be a centre round which the earth would
                    adjust itself in a spherical mass.</p>
                <p>The reason assigned by Aristotle for the revolutions of the heavens, as appears,
                    then, is precisely opposite to that of modern philosophy. He conceived
                    revolution to be performed, not in consequence of a tendency to the centre, but
                    of the absence of any such tendency in the revolving body. Revolution and
                    gravity are, according to him, contradictory terms. The motions of the several
                    heavenly bodies result from their being carried round by spheres, which consist
                    of this revolving element. That they do not revolve in themselves he considers
                    to be evident from the fact that the moon always presents the same side towards
                    us.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">De

                    he argues, in being spherical, nature seeming purposely to have denied them all

                    possibility. The stars move with the'spheres, he says, like the parts of a ship

                    Egypt about 368 u. c. and introduced the regular astronomy from Egypt into
                    Greece. Aristotle gives him the high praise of recommending his view of pleasure
                    as the chιet good, by the distinguished morality of his life. <hi rend="italic"

                    many additional spheres employed in.the revolutions of each body as it appeared
                    to have different motions.</p>
                <p>The oblique motion of the sun, viewed in connection with the successive renewals
                    and decays of nature, as he approaches or recedes from the earth, suggested the
                    most ready link for connecting the phenomena of the earth with those of the
                    heavens. It is, accordingly, to the revolution of the sphere of the sun, that
                    Aristotle ascribes the continuation of generation and corruption in unbroken
                    series, and the consequent perpetuity of being in the world around us. It might
                    be supposed that generation and corruption would be carried on at equal
                    intervals: but the unequal temperament of material things prevents such a
                    uniformity; and occasions that variety of duration, which we observe in
                    different things within the sphere of the moon, or the limits of nature properly
                    so called.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>Still, however, it remained to be explained what it was that imparted to the
                    sphere of the sun, as well as to the several other spheres, their principle of
                    motion. To every thing that is itself moved there must be a mover: and the
                    successive motions, therefore, as communicated from sphere to sphere, must be
                    traced up to some ultimate principle, itself unmoved, in which they
                    originate.</p>
                <p>Here, then, we discern the close connection of Aristotle’s physics with his
                    metaphysics; and at the same time the ground of his applying to the latter
                    science the designation of theology. The several spheres of the heavens,
                    differing in element from the bodies of this lower world, and pursuing their
                    unceasing and immortal revolutions, presented a distinct class of <hi

                    philosopher. To ascertain that in which they moved and had their being, was an
                    inquiry, with regard to them, analogous to his investigation of the principle of
                    motion in the natural world. This principle of motion to these celestial
                    substances would be being itself, or the very vital energy itself in which they
                    had their being.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A <hi

                <p>This intimate connection of theology with metaphysics, in the ancient philosophy,
                    was a natural consequence of the separation which heathenism established between
                    theology and religion. In the civilized states of antiquity, religion was
                    pursued only as a matter of policy, and not as a rule of life to the individual.
                    Whatever was the established creed of the state, it was the recognized duty of
                    the good citizen to support as established.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the laws and manners of the state, but imperiously rejected all questioning of
                    the principle itself, that the established religion must be practically

                    that it should be no question of truth and falsehood. The religious feelings of
                    the human heart were thus unnerved. Their strength was spent in showy pomps or
                    cumbrous ceremonies, if they were not corrupted by demoralizing orgies. In this
                    state of things, the better and wiser part of men were driven into a
                    metaphysical religion. They could not acquiesce in the views of the Deity
                    conveyed in the popular superstitions; and the subject could not but recur to
                    them in the reasonings of their hearts, as soliciting earnest inquiry. They
                    searched for God, accordingly, not seeking what to <hi rend="italic">do,</hi>
                    but what to <hi rend="italic">hnow.</hi> Whatever the truth concerning him might
                    be, it was not to be expressed in any acts of adoration. Though the whole world
                    might be found his temple, he was not to be the Holiness of their shrines.
                    Though the heavens were telling of his glory, and the stars were singing
                    together for joy at his presence, yet no praise was to ascend to him in the
                    perfumes of their altars, or the melodies of their choral hymns. Thus, devotion
                    being banished from the heart, reared a tabernacle for itself in the wilderness
                    of a theological philosophy; and thus Socrates and Plato, and Aristotle and
                    Cieero, and other illuminated sages of heathenism, continued, without hypocrisy,
                    professors of the established religion, whilst they sought a purer knowledge of
                    God in the thoughtful abstractions of their own intellect.</p>
                <p>Looking, then, at die admirable order of the heavenly bodies, the philosopher
                    saw, in their unvarying regularity, the immutable and eternal nature of the
                    great principle on which their motions depended. He did not, it seems, attribute
                    to them a proper divinity in themselves; for he refers their perpetuity of
                    motion to the ultimate principle or First Mover, the Deity of his system. But he
                    speaκs as if they possessed a divine nature, calling them divine bodies, and

                    He also says expressly that we must think of them as partaking of life and
                    action. He must be supposed, however, by such expressions, to be giving only an
                    analogical description of the perfection, in which they display the efficacy of
                    the First Great Principle. Contrasted with the unstable things of the earth,
                    they evidence the principle of motion perpetually operating without
                    interruption; whereas the successions of generations and corruptions about the
                    earth only approximate to the unbroken perpetuity of the heavenly motions. We
                    ought indeed to interpret in the same manner his ascription of power to nature
                    as a principle of motion. It seems as if he was excluding the agency of the
                    Deity; but in truth he is only analyzing one mode of the operation of the First
                    Principle. For he thinks that all things attain the good of their nature, so far

                    well as the revolving spheres of the heavens, are divine, inasmuch as they
                    illustrate more or less perfectly the animating principle of all motion,—the
                    operation of Deity itself. Al the same time, it must be observed, there is no

                    is simply as the Life of the Universe—the Intellect—the Energy—as what gives
                    excellence, and perfection, and joy to the whole system—that his philosophy
                    explores the Deity. It is, in short, pure Being, abstracted from all matter, and
                    therefore only negatively defined as without parts or magnitude, impassible,
                    invariable, and eternal. But whilst his system included no providence,<note

                    is, his speaking of <hi rend="italic">gods</hi> in the plural in that passage.
                    At any rate, the superintendence here spoken of, is distinct from what we mean

                    the operation of chance and accident. These, he observes, are not capable of
                    being causes of any thing; they are merely descriptions of what takes place
                    contrary to some presupposed design, or some tendency in nature.<note

                    metaphysical point of view. His professed object here is, to inquire into “Being
                    so far forth as it is Being, and the general properties belonging to it as
                    such.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    Having traced the changes which occur about the earth to a fixed principle, he
                    had presented one unchangeable .point of view in which the human mind might
                    contemplate the vast and restless variety of physical objects. It remained for
                    him, then, to examine this ultimate principle in itself, and its various
                    applications, or properties, as he describes them, as the foundation of all
                    science.</p>
                <p>His employing the term “Being” so definitely, gives the appearance of his being
                    engaged in the investigation of realities here; just as, in his physics, he
                    appears to be describing secret processes of nature rather than philosophizing
                    on the course of nature. Hence we might be induced to think, that in reading the
                    metaphysics of Aristotle we are exploring the mysteries of ontology. The
                    expressions indeed of Aristotle, and perhaps his example in some parts of his
                    metaphysics, afforded occasion to the ontology of the schools. Aristotle,
                    however, is not to be charged with the realism and absurdity of that system.
                    These may be traced chiefly to a circumstance already adverted to—the
                    introduction of Aristotle’s philosophy into the western church by the medium of
                    Latin translation. The term oυ&lt;f∕α, by which he denotes existence in the
                    abstract, as distinct from any object of which it is affirmed, having been
                    rendered in Latin by <hi rend="italic">substantia;</hi> it came to be supposed,
                    that the natures or principles represented by the term had a real subsistence.
                    Thus the doctrine of Aristotle respecting Being, was understood in a sense
                    precisely the reverse of that which the philosopher hiniself intended. The
                    analogy on which the application of the term <hi rend="italic">substantia</hi>
                    to metaphysical subjects was founded, became obscured by the actual force of the
                    term itself. Instead of its being regarded as denoting only a relation between
                    our conceptions corresponding to that between a thing supported and what
                    supports it, the idea was suggested of a reality, or even of a material nature,
                    as implied by the term.</p>
                <p>Rightly, however, to understand Aristotle’s notion of Being, as it is the object
                    of metaphysics, we should distinguish between Being, as it is in nature
                    generally, and as it is in the human mind in particular. For it is in this last
                    sense that it must be understood, when it is stated, that Being abstracted from
                    all objects whatsoever, is the object of the universal science: since there is
                    no other sense, in which a Being which is not in any thing can be conceived, but
                    as it is the pure object of intellect, or is in the intellect solely. Looking,
                    then, at nature at large, we must apply Being, in its first and proper sense, to
                    individual objects really existing; and in a secondary sense, to the attributes
                    of such: because, the first notion of Being in nature is suggested by the actual
                    existence of the object; and our next notions result from the operations of our
                    minds about the object already presupposed in existence. But the case is
                    different, when the objects whose being we are considering, are objects of
                    intellect in themselves. Here the abstract notions of things are the first in
                    order:<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    ∣t is engaged; whereas the actual objects in nature are, in this point of view,
                    the secondary beings. The reason is, that an object of the mind, as such, exists
                    in its proper nature when it is entirely abstracted from all matter, but loses
                    that nature in proportion as it is conceived in any actual form of physical
                    being.</p>
                <p>Hence, in the science of metaphysics, the proper if not the only substance, or
                    oυ&lt;∏α, is the form or abstract nature of things.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> vii.
                    5.</p></note> This, as explained by Aristotle, is the exemplar or representation
                    in the mind of a thing as it exists in nature. As, then, the primary substances
                    in nature are the things themselves as they are found and observed in nature, so
                    the primary substances in the world of the mind are those abstract forms by
                    which the truth and reality of things are there shadowed out. The science of
                    metaphysics, then, is strictly conversant about these abstract forms, just as
                    natural philosophy is conversant about external objects of which the senses give
                    us information.</p>
                <p>The object, then, of Aristotle in his metaphysics, is to explain the nature of
                    those general principles, by which the mind represents to itself the objects
                    without it as they really are; which principles are thus the foundations of all
                    philosophical truth. Hence, in the technical language of ancient philosophy, he
                    describes this science as the science of First Causes—the First Philosophy—or by
                    the general title of Philosophy. But a science such as this is precisely what
                    modern writers have designated by the Philosophy of the Human Mind, though they
                    have differed from Aristotle in their mode of investigation: they having
                    directed their attention principally to the operations of the mind, whilst he
                    has confined himself, in this department at least of his philosophy, to the
                    objects about which the mind is conversant.</p>
                <p>In his inquiry into these principles, Aristotle had to encounter two extremes of
                    opinion maintained by philosophers before him—the doctrine of Protagoras,
                    Empedocles, and others, who held that there was no fixed standard of such
                    principles in nature, but that every thing was relative to human perception; and
                    the ideal theory of Plato, which, by the hypothesis of self-existent universals,
                    introduced a subtile materialism into the philosophy of mind.</p>
                <p>He points out the practical absurdity of the former opinion, according to which
                    contradictories were equally true, and every proposition was equally true and
                    equally false—by asking,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    in the morning, but uses caution, as not equally convinced that the falling in

                    that men do not regard all notions as equally true, is plain, he observes, from
                    this, that “no one who may have supposed himself during the night at Athens,
                    when he was in Libya, walks to the Odeum.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    this sceptical doctrine more expressly, by distinguishing between the reality of
                    things as they exist absolutely or relatively to our perceptions. There may be
                    no reality of Being, either in things perceived or in the perceptions, these
                    being affections of the percipient power. But it is impossible that there should
                    not really exist some subject-things which produce the perception, and are
                    independent of perception. Whereas those who make <hi rend="italic">being</hi>

                    Hence it appears that Aristotle virtually admits the distinction made by <pb

                    metaphysicians between the primary and secondary qualities of matter. He
                    affirms, that whilst we have ideas of things without us which are simply our own
                    perceptions, or acts of the perceiving mind, there must also be some really
                    existing natures without us on which these perceptions are founded.</p>
                <p>The ideal theory of Plato tended to the same scepticism as the doctrine of these
                    elder philosophers, but on a different principle. Plato destroyed all the
                    certainty of our knowledge, by fixing the objects of it entirely out of the
                    range of human intellect, and teaching men to abandon nature and experience in
                    the pursuit of imaginary beings—the ideas, or archetypes of the beings of the
                    sensible world. He established in his system other beings separate from nature
                    as the objects of philosophy, whilst his predecessors denied that there were any
                    proper objects founded in nature. But both he and they equally removed all
                    grounds of conviction from the mind of man. Aristotle, accordingly, strenuously
                    combats the doctrine of ideas as adverse to all sound speculation. He loses no
                    opportunity, in the course of his discussions, of alluding to it and refuting
                    it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    all science, by multiplying, instead of reducing to certain definite principles,
                    the variety of the objects of contemplation. “It is like,” he says, “any one
                    wishing to reckon, but who, thinking himself unable when he had less, should
                    make more, and then reckon.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The ideal theory was, as we have before remarked, a modification of the
                    Pythagorean theory of numbers, or a mixture of logical and mathematical truth.
                    Hence the importance assigned by Plato to mathematics, as introductory to the
                    philosophy of ideas. The theory of Pythagoras was, it seems, purely
                    mathematical. What he called numbers, appear to have been imaginary limits to
                    which, as to their ultimate ratios, he referred the proportions observed in the
                    universe. Plato proceeded a step further, and endeavoured to realize these
                    ultimate natures by the help of the abstractions of language; but still retained
                    so much of the mathematical conception of them, as to make the science of them
                    dependent on the knowledge of mathematies; describing the objects of mathematics
                    as intermediate to the ideas and sensible objects.<note anchored="true"

                    elements of things.</p>
                <p>There is no point, in fact, on which Aristotle has spoken more plainly and
                    decisively, than on the non-existence of universals. It is to individuals alone
                    that he allows a real existence.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    He remarks, that when any principle is asserted of several things, it is by
                    analogy; as in fact there are distinct pinciples in each distinct thing; “for
                    what belongs to each thing, is the principle of whatever belongs to each.”<note

                    of man, Peleus is the father of Achilles—your own father of yourself.” In things
                    generically distinct, as colours and sounds, the principles differ, but are the
                    same by analogy. In things specifically the same, the principles differ, not in
                    species, but as they are distinct in each individual; <hi rend="italic">e.
                    g.</hi> the matter, the form, and the moving power, are distinct in this and
                    that man; but in the geneial principle, τω zα3cλc∣u <hi rend="italic">λογω,</hi>
                    they are the same. So cleaily has he laid it down, that none but individuals
                    have a real existence, and that all other beings are relations, or results of
                    the operation of our minds about individuals.</p>
                <p>In extending our survey to the several subjects included in the metaphysics of
                    Aristotle, we must remember, that the science of which he is treating had
                    hitherto been blended with logic under the general name of dialectic. It was
                    hardly to be expected, therefore, that Aristotle, in making the separation,
                    should altogether forget the prejudice which had united them. Nor must we
                    wonder, therefore, that much of the work should be employed in discussing the
                    meaning of terms, and in observations addressed rather to the disputant in
                    words, than to the inquirer into the principles of philosophy. But we should be
                    too hasty in judgment, if we condemned such discussions as foreign to the
                    purpose of the metaphysician. The accurate examination of the notions expressed
                    by such terms as being, oneness, sameness, contrariety, power, is illustrative
                    of the connections of our ideas; for these terms are not dependent on the
                    peculiarities of any one language, but are uniform characters of human thought.
                    It is a curious and important inquiry, accordingly, to ascertain that connection
                    of ideas of which these terms are the general expressions; to trace, <hi
                    rend="italic">e g.</hi> all the various modes of thought to which we apply the
                    term contrariety, or which we characterize under the general description of
                    qualities.</p>
                <p>The inquiry into the mind, considered in itself as a principle of life and
                    thought, forms, as we have already hinted, no part of Aristotle’s metaphysics.
                    In his philosophy such an inquiry belongs to physics, since he regards mind as a
                    principle connected with matter. This inquiry he has prosecuted in a Treatise
                    <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Oĩì</hi><hi rend="italic">the Smil,</hi> and in

                    history, is also illustrative of the nature of Soul, considered as the living
                    principle in all animated beings. In these several works, it may be observed on
                    the whole, there is less of mere speculation, and a more open display of that
                    power of real philosophy, the <hi rend="italic">δυvαμις αvαλυrj×η,</hi> which he
                    so eminently possessed. We find him stating and examining facts,<note

                    conclusions in the spirit of a modern inquirer, and at the same time with the
                    severe accuracy of his own method.</p>
                <p>The ingenuity of the ancient philosophers was exhausted in attempting to assign
                    the nature of the soul or living principle. There was no one of the elements,
                    except earth, which did not find its advocate in some theory of the soul. It was
                    represented also as a combination of all elements, or as blood, or intrinsic
                    motion, or a harmony and conjunction of contraries. Aristotle, pursuing the
                    system of his physics, wisely avoids endeavouring to refer the soul to any
                    particular dass of material objects, explaining the nature of it, as it is an
                    instance of the union of the two principles, matter and form, in a common
                    result. It is an instance of the principle of matter, so far as there must be an
                    organized body susceptible of life in every thing that lives. It is an instance
                    of the principle of form, so far as that nature, in which the life of the
                    creature consists, is perfectly developed in the animated body. His definition,

                <p>Thus, considering the principle of life as distinct from the organized system in
                    which it is evidenced, he proceeds to inquire into its peculiar laws, by
                    examining the mode of its operation. He divides its'mode of operation into five
                    classes, according to the objects about which it is exercised. It is, 1<hi

                    consequently all these modes of operation of the living principle are evidenced

                    exclusively.</p>
                <p>His observations on perception are highly important, as tending to show the
                    existence of living powers in animals, distinct from the organs by which those
                    powers are displayed. He affirms that there is always a medium interposed
                    between the perceiving power and the object perceived,—appealing to the sense of
                    sight. Sight, he observes, is not produced by placing the object on the eye, nor
                    yet can be produced by the object itself at a distance, and consequently must
                    result from something intervening between the eye and the object, so as to make
                    an impression from the object on the eye. He mistook, indeed, the nature of this
                    medium, conceiving light to be the active development of the abstract nature of

                    the air to grow all around us, we should in like manner have immediate
                    perception of all objects of sense, and thus appear to have perceptions of
                    sight, and hearing, and smelling, by one sense.</p>
                <p>Perception, then, according to Aristotle, is the power of the soul to receive
                    immaterial impressions from material objects, as the wax receives impressions of
                    a seal without the brass or gold of which the seal is made. The impressions thus
                    received he regards as the basis of all our knowledge, insomuch that a creature
                    destitute of perception would be incapable of understanding and learning.

                    existence, and the only one so indispensable. All the other senses, he says,

                    never delusive,—the same thing is always sweet or always bitter; but they may be
                    followed by different ideas in different minds. To a sick person, what is
                    naturally sweet may seem bitter, or, from accidental position with respect to
                    the spectator, an object may appear different from what it is; as, for example,
                    the apparent diameter of the sun. To the ideas thus formed immediately from
                    perception, Aristotle gives the name of phantasms; and the power of perception
                    thus modified he calls phantasia or imagination.<note anchored="true"

                    The delusiveness sometimes attributed to the senses themselves originates in
                    this faculty of imagination consequent on sensation. Together with memory, it
                    constitutes the whole intellectual nature of brutes. In man it furnishes the
                    first notices in order to the operation of his intellect. By the operation of
                    the intellect on these notices the first simple ideas are formed, from which the
                    mind proceeds to its complex and general notions.</p>
                <p>In considering the nature of the intellect, Aristotle introduces an important
                    distinction between the mere capacity or faculty of knowledge, and the actual
                    knowledge possessed by the mind; that is, between the intellect and the
                    principles of the intellect. He employs the well-known illustration of “a
                    writing tablet in which nothing is actually written,” to distinguish the
                    thinking faculty in itself from the thoughts with which it is furnished. But he
                    does not suppose, as this illustration might suggest, that ideas are objects
                    distinct from the mind itself. Where the object of thought is itself immaterial,
                    as when the mind is reflecting on itself, there, he observes, the thinking power
                    and the object of thought are the same.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    into consciousness. Hence, according to him, whilst the passive intellect, or
                    the mind as it consists of principles with which the senses have furnished it,
                    perishes, the active intellect, the power itself by which we think, exists in
                    its proper nature when separate, and is immortal and eternal.<note

                <p>It maybe perceived, from this view of Aristotle’s Theory of the Soul, how far he
                    acknowledged the immortality of man. So far as the nature of man is purely
                    intellectual, he conceived it capable of existing separately from matter, and in
                    some sense divine; but so far as it consisted of affections, which he describes
                    as <hi rend="italic">λογοι svυλοι,</hi> principles <hi rend="italic">in</hi>
                    matter, he regarded it as mortal and necessarily perishable with the body. He
                    pronounces nothing of the nature of that immortality which he thus attributes to
                    the intellect, speaking of it in a rhetorical manner rather than with the
                    precision of philosophy. At any rate, as only asserting an immortality of such
                    an abstract and undefined nature, he seems not unjustly to have been represented

                <p>As Aristotle included under Physics animate as well as inanimate nature, he has
                    carried the historical part of his natural philosophy into both these

                    were furnished to him by the conquests and the magnificence of Alexander. This
                    fact alone excites an interest in favour of the work; and this interest is fully
                    sustained by the variety of curious information contained in it respecting the
                    structure and the habits of animals, indicating a power of the most minute
                    observation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It was the

                    the animal economy, in treatises on the motion, the walking, the parts, and the
                    generation of animals. In inanimate nature he has explored the causes of
                    meteors, comets, earthquakes, of the rainbow, and other phenomena of the
                    atmosphere, in a work on Meteorology. He has also separately discussed the

                    not to be passed by the uninitiated in geometry; and had attained a perfect
                    skill in the method of mathematical investigation then known. We do not want
                    indeed more abundant proof of this, than is to be gathered from passages in his
                    Physics, in which we find him often establishing conclusions by steps of
                    mathematical demonstration.</p>

                    >Dialectic.</hi></p>
                <p>Aristotle, we have remarked, was the first to separate the proper science of
                    Dialectic from that confusion with Physics and Metaphysics in which it had been
                    entangled and perverted. In doing this he laid the foundation of a sound and
                    practical logic. There was a basis of truth, he saw, in the doctrine of Plato,
                    which referred our knowledge of all sensible objects to certain abstract
                    universal natures, the objects of pure intellect. But he saw also that Plato had
                    entirely overthrown the right application of the doctrine, by imputing to these
                    universals a real being; and, instead of treating them as the causes simply of
                    our knowledge, identifying them with the actual elements or grounds of existing
                    things. Having stated, therefore, the proper nature of these universals to be
                    that of conceptions of the mind, by which it represents to itself things as they
                    really are, and in this sense speculated on them abstractedly in the
                    Metaphysics, he further considers them, in the treatises of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Organon,</hi> as they are employed dialectically, or are
                    subservient to the communication of knowledge between man and man. There was
                    indeed another view of the application of these universals, and prior to that of
                    their employment in discourse, which remained to be considered/ This was their
                    use in enabling the mind to connect the phenomena of nature, or as they are <hi
                    rend="italic">properly</hi> the causes of our knowledge. But the state of
                    philosophy in his time did not lead him to such an investigation. It was
                    reserved for an age of more diffused civilization, and the adventurous genius of
                    Bacon, to display the principles of that analysis by which the mind arrives at
                    general principles, and obtains a real science of nature. The practice of
                    colloquial discussion on questions of philosophy, recommended as it was by the
                    instructiveness and interest of the conversations of Socrates, attracted the
                    attention of the Greek philosophers to the mode of establishing conviction by
                    deductions from admitted principles. Aristotle, accordingly, in elucidating the
                    nature of universals as the causes of our knowledge, was naturally diverted from
                    the higher path of investigation, to explore them as they acted through the
                    medium of language. In pursuing this inquiry, he laid down the principles of a
                    general science, applying to argumentation as such, to the inferences of**the
                    reasoner from probabilities, as well as to the most rigid demonstrations of the
                    mathematician.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    sustaining these intellectual exercises, by supplying not only principles of
                    correct reasoning, or rules of logic properly so called, but various modes of

                    it, so as to be completely armed for debate, was the perfect accomplishment of
                    the dialectician. This most obvious application of the science produced
                    unfortunately, in the haste to supply arms for the disputant, instead of a
                    philosophy of language, a misnamed science, conversant only about the
                    intricacies of verbal quibbling. Zeno the Eleatic, Euclid of Megara, and
                    Antisthenes, took the lead in framing systems according to this view of
                    Dialectic. Nor do the dialogues of Plato, though rich in examples of reasoning,
                    suggest any more just and exact method. Hence the logic which prevailed at the
                    time of Aristotle, and which, from the long concealment of his writings,
                    continued, even after his improvements in this branch of philosophy, to be the
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193102178" xml:id="kp-eb0703-2178-0509"/> system of the
                    Greek schools, was a mere collection of subtile points of argument, without any
                    attempt to analyze the process itself of argument. His Dialectic is the
                    reformation of that irregular and perplexed system. Whilst he adopts and
                    explains the general notion of the science, as a method of defending or
                    impugning an opinion, he takes a larger, more philosophical view of the subject;
                    investigating the grounds, both in the nature of language and in the connections
                    of thought, on which all arguments must rest. Hence his just boast, that, “with
                    regard to the dialectic art, there was not something done and something
                    remaining to be done,—there was absolutely nothing done; for those who professed
                    the art of disputation resembled the rhetoricians of Gorgias’s school. As these
                    composed orations, so the other framed arguments which might suit, as they
                    imagined, most occasions. These their scholars soon learned. But they were in
                    this manner only furnished with the materials produced by the art,—the art
                    itself they did not learn.” He goes on in the same passage to observe, that
                    “upon rhetoric much had been written; but on the art of reasoning, nothing. The
                    whole of what he had composed on that subject was from himself;”—that he had
                    “derived no benefit from former labours:” expressing his hope, accordingly, that
                    what he had “left undone would be forgiven, and that what had been done would
                    meet with a favourable acceptance.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>It is a singular fact in the history of science, that his labours in this arduous
                    work should have suffered an unjust depreciation in modern times, by being
                    estimated in contrast with the analysis of Bacon: whereas, according to his own
                    challenge, and as the reason of the case suggests, they admit only of comparison
                    with the efforts of his predecessors, and of the Stoics, who, though following
                    him, wrought upon the ancient model of the science, and exhibited that in its
                    utmost perfection. If we compare the method of Aristotle with what is known of
                    the wrangling discipline of the Stoics, we shall then judge with more fairness
                    of the philosophical character of his labours. His disciples were content to be

                    time at least of Cicero, it has probably been often confounded with that of
                    Aristotle, and thus reflected its own disrepute on his more scientific system.
                    With the method, however, of Bacon, the Dialectic of Aristotle has no natural
                    rivalry. In the period of literature preceding the researches of Bacon, it
                    happened that ingenious men, with a natural devotedness to the studies by which
                    their minds had been moulded, sought to resolve the mysteries of science by a
                    profound Aristotelian philosophy. Thus were principles of physics and
                    metaphysics mixed up with the theory of language; as, on the other hand,
                    principles belonging to the theory of language were previously applied to the
                    analysis of nature. The writings of Aristotle were regarded as a kind of
                    Scriptural philosophy, beyond which there was no appeal in controversies of
                    science.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Where a

                    century.</p></note> And when an authority of this kind is once established, it
                    is easy to see that a philosophy of mere words will soon follow. Expounding and
                    commenting on the text of the master supersedes the ques- , tioning of nature
                    herself, just as a mere textual theology supersedes an enlarged study of the
                    facts and scheme of Divine revelation. But this perversion is not to be regarded
                    as the tendency of Aristotle’s philosophy. Practically, indeed, he does not
                    altogether keep clear of the seductions of realism; but in him it is only a <hi
                    rend="italic">practical</hi> infirmity. Theoretically, he was perfectly aware
                    that “the subtilty of nature far exceeds the subtilty of human intellect;<note

                    instrument of discussion to the business of philosophical investigation. So far,
                    then, as dialectic, by sifting a question thoroughly, clearing up apparent
                    inconsistencies, and pointing out where the truth lies, may be regarded as an
                    organ of philosophy, so far Aristotle authorizes the inquirer to employ it. It
                    may serve as the precursor and companion of investigation, but not as the
                    substitute; and thus he describes it as a method of “trying,” <hi rend="italic"

                    82.)</p></note> Aristotle, therefore, evidently did not intend that the
                    philosopher, as such, should rest in the speculations of dialectic; and though
                    he has not provided in his writings an instrument of investigation, giving only
                    indirect hints of such a method, he supposes it actually resorted to in practice
                    by the philosopher. His Dialectic, accordingly, instead of being put in contrast
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Novum Organon,</hi> is to be regarded as an auxiliary
                    system, introductory to the latter, and enforcing its use.</p>
                <p>The error of the scholastics in applying dialectical principles to the philosophy
                    of nature, arose from their ignorance of the nature of philosophical truth. They
                    do not seem to have been aware that philosophical principles are but expedients
                    which the mind adopts for arranging the various objects of nature: otherwise,
                    they would have seen that a science conversant wholly about the connections of
                    our notions as expressed in language, could have no subserviency to the
                    investigation, properly so called, of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193102191"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-2191-0510"/>other sciences. When the facts of this science
                    were reduced to certain fixed principles, the whole object of the science was
                    accomplished—the result would be a philosophy of language; and to carry this
                    philosophy into other matters, was an incongruity like that of uniting
                    principles of mathematics and ethics.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    application. His reason for the assertion will appear the better by observing
                    that he included astronomy, among other branches of natural philosophy, under
                    mathematics.</p></note> There was at the same time a ground for their error, in
                    the universality of language, as the medium by which the truths of every science
                    are expressed; and its comprehensiveness, as it has the power of signifying by
                    single terms an immense variety of objects. These imposing attributes of
                    language gave at least the semblance of philosophizing to their <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> speculations. But had they studied more sincerely
                    the writings of their master, they would have seen the real use to which the
                    universality and comprehensiveness of language might be applied, without
                    trespassing on the legitimate province of investigation.</p>
                <p>A slight consideration of the nature of language may suffice to show the proper
                    business of Dialectic. Language is the record of the observations of mankind on
                    the course of nature. It is, as it were, a popular philosophy. Whatever may be
                    its origin—whether words be merely conventional signs, as Aristotle
                    teaches,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">De Interpret.</hi></p></note> or have a foundation in the nature
                    of the things denoted by them— still, their application to observed facts in the
                    course of nature, is the result of the operation of the human mind; and words,
                    in this use of them, are the creations of the intellect. The intellect takes up
                    and applies the existing signs furnished by language, however derived, to mark
                    and preserve for its future direction the dictates of its past experience. Thus,
                    the application of the term “burning” to the observed effect of fire on a
                    combustible body, is an act of the mind recording its experience of that effect.
                    Having recorded its experience by this term, it thenceforth uses the term as a
                    substitute for the actual experience. Proceeding on that fundamental law of
                    human belief and action, that all things will continue in their observed course,
                    it trusts to the word thus obtained as a guide to future conduct. It is
                    sufficient to say that any thing “burns,” to give us a representation of the
                    effect of fire, and direct us in our actions with regard to that thing.
                    Accordingly, by the use of terms, observations, in themselves individual facts,
                    are generalized. The term, originally the record of a single experience, serving
                    practically in the stead of a repeated experience, comes to stand for a number
                    of individuals. From its practical application to a multitude of similar events,
                    it obtains a speculative multiplication as the general expression of many
                    particulars, or, in short, becomes a class-term.</p>
                <p>It is thus that language may be regarded as a popular philosophy of nature. Lach
                    term denoting some observed event or object, is a general principle, connecting
                    the several events or objects to which it admits of being equally applied.
                    Whilst it practically enables us to decide and act in a number of individual
                    cases, it also speculatively presents the means of anticipating a number of
                    particulars, as notions implied in it; or, in other words, is a <hi
                    rend="italic">theory</hi> of the particulars which it denotes.</p>
                <p>But when we have once obtained a variety of terms, thus representing in each of
                    them a multitude of particulars, we can further generalize our observations by
                    reflection on the notions themselves, and recording our observations on these,
                    in like manner as on the real events and objects of nature. We then notice
                    whether the notions implied by one term, are distinct from, or are included in,
                    the notions implied by another; and, accordingly, we regard the terms
                    respectively denoting them, as classes, either totally distinct, or as more or
                    less comprehensive. We observe, for instance, whether the terms, “man,”
                    “animal,” “vegetable,”—all being records of our observations on nature,—give us
                    information of the same particulars, or of others entirely different: and we
                    find that “man” and “animal” are but different views of the same individual, as
                    for instance of Socrates; whilst the term “vegetable” is no expression of any
                    observation whatever on the same individual. We find that “animal” represents to
                    us more individual objects than “man so we regard it speculatively as a class
                    including in it “man and both the terms “man” and “animal,” as classes entirely
                    distinct from the class “vegetable,” because none of the observations referred
                    to in either of the former are the same with those referred to in the
                    latter.</p>
                <p>These principles of language are the data on which the dialectical system of
                    Aristotle is constructed. It is evident, from the mere statement of them, that
                    there is such a thing as a scientific application of language to the purpose of
                    instruction; for it is clearly seen to act as an instrument of knowledge by its
                    very nature, independently of any art in the use of it. And it is for the
                    philosopher, therefore, to inquire how it acts in producing this effect.</p>
                <p>Now, in order to a science of Dialectic, the first step appears to be, to reduce
                    those various observations on existing things, so far as these observations are
                    characterized by language, into some definite classes: for we thus bring them
                    out of that perplexing infinity which defies all grasp of the intellect, and
                    obtain a few comprehensive theories, under which the whole intellectual world
                    may be surveyed. These classes will represent to us all the different forms or
                    modifications of being, so far as it is capable of being denoted by language.
                    The next step is to examine the principle of classification in itself, and
                    notice the varieties of form which it takes; as the observations that are made
                    on any individual give us more or less comprehensive, more or less invariable
                    and scientific, views of the individual. The first step leads us to the
                    Predicaments or Categories, general designations under which all the various
                    abstractions of the mind are conveniently arranged for the purpose of the
                    dialectician. These constitute, as it were, the fixed land-marks by which he may
                    know the limits of each notion with which he has to do in any discussion. They
                    are the great sections in the geography of the intellectual world which it is
                    his office to explore and describe. The next step leads us to the Predicables,
                    or various modes of classing the same object. Here we enter on that part of the
                    science which is purely dialectical. In the arrangements of the Categories, the
                    inquiry is partly metaphysical, partly logical. We are there philosophizing on
                    the notions of the mind in connection with language; but here, we examine the
                    principle of classification evidenced in language, <hi rend="italic">in
                    itself,</hi> and endeavour to obtain comprehensive views of all the varieties of
                    form under which it appears.</p>
                <p>Thus far the science of Dialectic was sketched out before the time of Aristotle.
                    The Pythagorean philosopher, Archytas of Tarentum, has the merit of having
                    instituted <pb break="no" facs="nls:193102204" xml:id="kp-eb0703-2204-0511"
                    />those arrangements of the objects of the intellect, which Aristotle adopted
                    and explained under the title of <hi rend="italic">the Categories.</hi> The
                    objects of the mind are evidently referable to two ultimate classes. We either
                    contemplate objects as they exist <hi rend="italic">simply,</hi> or we abstract
                    some particular attribute of them, and invest it with a being of our own
                    creation. But as these attributes are various in kind, we require some more
                    distinct classification of them; and this is furnished in the ten Categories. 1.
                    Being; 2. Quantity; 3. Quality; 4&lt;. Relation; 5. Place; 6. Time; 7.
                    Situation; 8. Habit; 9. Action; 10. Passion ;—Being denoting, primarily, objects
                    as they are conceived actually to exist in nature; secondarily, the notions of
                    them as so existing; and the remaining Categories denoting the mere abstractions
                    of the human mind. These several terms are admirably explained by Aristotle in
                    his treatise on the Categories; and thus he commences his dialectic with a broad
                    and deep foundation of metaphysical truth for the structure which is to follow.
                    This treatise being further introductory to a method, not simply of reasoning,
                    but of producing conviction on any subject, he includes in his survey the
                    principles denoted by the terms, “opposite,” “contrary,” “prior,” “co-existent,”
                    “motion,” “having,” —terms of frequent recurrence in the ancient philosophy, and
                    therefore demanding notice in a work on Dialectic.</p>
                <p>Aristotle has no distinct treatise on the several heads of classification, or
                    classes of Predicables as they are technically termed; but has interwoven some

                    known to his hearers. He states them as four—property, definition, genus,
                    accident. They are deducible from the consideration of the several points of
                    view under which the same object may be contemplated. We may view it, either as
                    it falls under some general observation, and is accordingly denoted in language
                    by some class, the “genus,”—or in some circumstance belonging to it;—and this
                    circumstance may be either peculiar to it, in which case it is a property, —or
                    occasional, ill which case it is an accident. Further, as the property of a
                    thing may include all the peculiarities belonging to it, or only some one or
                    more of these peculiarities; if it includes all, it becomes the definition of
                    the thing,—in the latter case it is simply a property: so that there result the
                    four classes already mentioned. In logical treatises we commonly find another
                    class subjoined—the differentia or characteristic; and Aristotle himself refers
                    to it, though he does not consider it necessary to regard it as a head of
                    classification distinct from genus. It differs indeed from genus, only inasmuch
                    as, so far as any class is called a differentia, it is so relatively to some
                    other genus in which it is included as subordinate. How it is that the
                    properties and accidents of an individual are considered as classes, will be
                    evident from the generalizing power of language already noticed.</p>
                <p>In the Categories, then, we have the Metaphysical Being of things, so far as it
                    is denoted by language, drawn out into its various modes, and distinctly
                    characterized in each. In the classes of Predicables, we have the Dialectical or
                    Logical Being, or the various modes of existence created by language, through
                    its power of comprizing multitudes under single terms. If, for example, we say
                    “Socrates is wise,” the metaphysical being here asserted is an abstraction of
                    the mind, coming under the category of Quality: we are speaking of Socrates, not
                    as he is individually, but as the <hi rend="italic">quality</hi> of wisdom
                    exists in him. But in the same expression the dialectical or logical being
                    asserted is, the existence of Socrates as an individual in the class to which
                    the term “wise” belongs.</p>
                <p>It is highly important to observe this distinction between metaphysical and
                    dialectical being; as the right understanding of the whole doctrine of
                    propositions and syllogisms is dependent on it. Every proposition then, viewed
                    dialectically, is the reference of one class of objects to some other class, in
                    the case of an affirmative,—the exclusion of one class from another, in the case
                    of a negative. The “being,” or the “not being,” is the being implied or not
                    implied in a certain term. The schoolmen, unfortunately, neglecting the
                    distinction here adverted to, and thus reverting to that confusion of logical
                    and metaphysical science which Aristotle’s whole philosophy had laboured to
                    remove, included both kinds of being under the common term “universals.”
                    Evidently, however, it cannot properly be said of being, as it is apprehended by
                    the mind, that it is an universal. A notion of the mind is in itself an
                    individual; and its extension to more objects than one is simply an effect of
                    the mental power of generalization. But the logical being is by its very nature
                    an universal; since a term, so far as it is a class, comprizes in its meaning
                    every individual that admits of being referred to it as a class.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, to examine propositions dialectically, we have only to inquire into
                    the relative comprehensiveness, or relative exclusion, of the terms conjoined in
                    it. In this point of view, all propositions, on any subject whatever, are
                    reduced to four kinds ;—universal affirmative, in which one class is affirmed of
                    the whole of another; universal negative, in which two classes are mutually
                    excluded; particular affirmative, in which one class is affirmed of some of the
                    particulars included in the other; particular negative, in which one class
                    partly excludes another. These arc the only varieties of form under which any
                    two classes of objects can be combined in affirmations or negations. Every
                    proposition, accordingly, in order to be brought under the survey of Dialectic,
                    must be referred to one or other of these forms, as the case may be. Hence we
                    may proceed to examine these ultimate forms to which propositions are reducible,
                    independently of the things themselves about which the propositions are, and
                    draw from them logical principles applicable to every particular case. Thus, the
                    form of an universal affirmative, “every A is B,” in which the letters A and B
                    are put as the representatives of any objects whatsoever, is the proper
                    dialectical datum, from which the whole logical nature of any universal
                    affirmative proposition may be explored. So also with regard to the remaining
                    abstract forms.</p>
                <p>Aristotle, accordingly, in his treatise on <hi rend="italic">Interpretation,</hi>
                    and in the commencement of his <hi rend="italic">Prior Analytics,</hi> has thus
                    examined the nature of propositions, and deduced practical rules by which their
                    force as principles employed in reasoning may be readily ascertained. It has
                    been objected to him, that he resorted to these abstract symbols rather than to
                    more familiar means of illustration, in order that he might leave the truths of
                    the science partially veiled at least in obscurity. There may be some truth in
                    the assertion generally, that he did not intend that his written works should be
                    accessible to the public without the accompaniment of oral exposition.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Plutarch speaks of the

                    on the nature of dialectical being, may be sufficient to clear up any
                    misconstruction of the philosopher on this point. The simple principle of
                    classification, which is all that Dialectic is concerned with, could not so
                    strictly be examined, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193102217"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-2217-0512"/>in any other way but that which expresses the
                    principle itself nakedly. Every thing else is irrelevant to the matter in hand.
                    So far as any thing else is attended to in a proposition, so far the mind is
                    diverted from the logical point of view. His use of symbols, therefore, is only
                    an illustration of his accurate and perfect method of developing the
                    science.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The use of

                <p>In his <hi rend="italic">Prior Analytics</hi> he passes on to the consideration
                    of syllogisms, or arguments logically viewed. Here it is that the dialectical
                    theory is properly unfolded. Syllogisms are the perfect developments of the
                    theory of language, as language is expressive of being,—manifestations of the
                    general fact, that every term denoting being is the representative of a class of
                    observations more or less comprehensive on some object.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A <hi rend="italic">proposition</hi> that is
                    false is truly a proposition, whereas what is called an <hi rend="italic"
                    >invalid</hi> argument is strictly no argument at all, because it does not
                    exemplify the classification implied in the right use of terms.</p></note> This
                    theory is first intimated in the ordinaŗy use of single terms. It is next more
                    disclosed in the connections of terms, z. <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> in
                    propositions affirming or denying one term of another. It is lastly laid open in
                    the syllogism, in which the principle of classification is exemplified as the
                    tie of connection between two terms affirmed or denied of each other.</p>
                <p>Since, then, the evidence of the connection subsisting between the terms brought
                    together in any affirmation or negation is <hi rend="italic">the point</hi> in
                    every argument; it is evident that the reasoning on any subject whatever may be
                    exhibited abstractedly from the particular subject about which it is. Terms can
                    only be connected as they are classes more or less comprehensive of each other;
                    and this relative comprehensiveness is evidenced at once, as before shown, by
                    the abstract forms of the propositions in which they are connected. Three
                    abstract propositions, accordingly, in which the terms whose connection is
                    explored, are, first (å e. in the premises), separately stated in their relation
                    to some intermediate class or middle term,—and then in their relation to each
                    other <hi rend="italic">(i. e.</hi> in the conclusion), as it is the result of
                    their premised relations to the intermediate class,—will enable us, without
                    reference to any other consideration, to judge of the conclusiveness of the
                    argument. The syllogism is nothing more than this abstract statement of an
                    argument.</p>
                <p>Aristotle examines all the varieties of form which arguments thus abstractedly
                    stated, or syllogisms, admit; whether from the position of the middle term in
                    the premises, or from the different combinations of the four great classes of
                    propositions; pointing out, under what arrangement of the middle term, what
                    particular modes of argument alone are valid.. From his whole examination, the
                    conclusion results, that, under whatever form an argument may be expressed, the
                    principle of the reasoning is the same in every case; each instance developing
                    the theoretic power of language, according to which every term, so far as it
                    denotes being, is a class, more or less comprehensive, of observations on the
                    thing whose being it denotes.</p>
                <p>This ultimate principle of all reasoning is commonly stated in the form of a
                    theorem, enunciating, that “whatever is predicated (affirmed or denied)
                    universally, of any class of things, may be predicated in like manner of any
                    thing comprehended in that class.” This is that form of it known by the
                    scholastic designation of the <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Dictum
                    de Omni</hi><hi rend="italic">et Nullo”</hi> From the mode in which this
                    principle has been introduced in systems of logic founded on the method of the
                    school-authors, a prejudice has been excited against Aristotle, as if he had
                    employed the principle in establishing the conclusiveness of arguments already
                    granted to be conclusive. Aristotle, however, does not introduce the principle
                    in any formal manner, as a dogma or <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> ground of
                    logical truth. On the contrary, it pervades the whole of his system, as
                    resulting from every part of his inquiry. He is only concerned to show that
                    every argument, however varied in its mode of expression, is reducible to a form
                    by which the truth of his theory shall be evidenced in it. Syllogisms are not
                    proved by the principle, but the principle itself is proved by the nature of the
                    syllogism, as any other philosophical truth is deduced from varied observations
                    and experiments. In short, by his reference to the principle, he does notpm∙e
                    the conclusiveness of a given argument, but <hi rend="italic">accounts</hi> for
                    it.</p>
                <p>It is necessary to observe that most of the technical phraseology of modern
                    treatises of logic is derived, not from Aristotle immediately, but second-hand,
                    from the scholastic expositors of his doctrines. These ingenious professors of
                    science, in carrying the notions of his physics and metaphysics into the science
                    of logic, obscured, by the barbarian dialect in which the truths of the science
                    were thus delivered, its proper nature as an art of language. Thus, according to
                    them, we hear of the “substance,” and “matter,” and “form,” both of propositions
                    and of syllogisms, and other such irrelevant designations. On the contrary, the
                    technical expressions of Aristotle himself are extremely few, and those strictly
                    appropriate to the subject, elucidating the characteristic nature of the science
                    as conversant about words. The scholastic method, however, from its long
                    usurpation, has so engrafted itself on our modes of writing and speaking, that
                    some acquaintance with its detail is in fact become necessary to us at this day;
                    and may so far, therefore, be regarded as constituting a legitimate part of
                    modern Dialectic. But when the cumbrous technicalities of this system are made a
                    ground of objection to the Aristotelian logic, it may be explicitly answered,
                    that these are not parts of Aristotle’s system, as it is found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Organon,</hi> but are the refinements of his commentators.</p>
                <p>Having pointed out the several classes of syllogisms, into some one or more of
                    which every valid argument must fall, Aristotle, in pursuit of the adaptation of
                    his works to the business of disputation, proceeds to show the various
                    expedients in argument resulting from the consideration of these abstract forms.
                    This part of his subject is prosecuted through the remainder of the first book
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Prior Analytics</hi> and the second of the same
                    treatise.</p>
                <p>The examination of syllogisms is followed up in the <hi rend="italic">Posterior
                    Analytics</hi> by an inquiry into demonstration; and in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Topics,</hi> into arguments founded on probable premises. The full discussion
                    of the syllogism was premised by Aristotle, inasmuch as the syllogistic process
                    is common both to demonstration and to probable conclusions; and accordingly, as
                    the more general subject of investigation, claimed the first notice in a
                    scientific treatise of Dialectic. Properly, indeed, being the only part of the
                    science which is really universal,—belonging to argumentation <hi rend="italic"
                    >as such,</hi> under whatever form, whether by induction, example, or enthymeme
                    (all of which are only different modes of expression of the syllogism), and
                    whether the premises assumed be necessary or probable,—it is the only province
                    to which the science of reasoning legitimately extends. In examining distinctly
                    the nature of demonstration and of probability, we depart from the rigorous
                    limits of the science of reasoning, and approach those of rhetoric. But it is
                    useful, at the same time, to examine these subjects as detached from rhetoric,
                    and in their connection with logic; so far as we then confine our attention to
                    the mere force of different kinds of argument on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >understand-</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193102230"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-2230-0513"/><hi rend="italic">ing;</hi> whereas rhetoric
                    combines also the view of them in their effect on the will. We then consider
                    them as they are capable of producing either knowledge or opinion; whereas, in
                    the latter case, we look at them in that complex result which is implied in
                    persuasion. It was for the former purpose that they were required for the
                    dialectical disputant: and thus it is that the consideration of them forms an
                    important part of the <hi rend="italic">Organon.</hi> For the same reason the
                    treatise on <hi rend="italic">Sophisms,</hi> which forms the conclusion of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Organon,</hi> is directed not only to the solution of
                    fallacies which may exist in the syllogistic process, or in the reasoning
                    strictly viewed as reasoning, but to such also as may be traced in arguments
                    where the process itself, the mere logic of the case, is perfectly correct.</p>
                <p>The discussion of demonstration is an exposition of the nature of science, as it
                    was understood by the ancient philosophers. They restricted the application of
                    the term to the knowledge of necessary truths; such truths as, when ascertained,
                    were known at the same time to be incapable of being otherwise. Aristotle, then,
                    is employed, in the <hi rend="italic">Posterior Analytics,</hi> in discussing
                    the nature of the principles on which science, as it was then understood, must
                    be built. Here he had to encounter perplexities and misconceptions introduced
                    into the subject by the Platonic philosophy. In Plato’s system knowledge was
                    mere reminiscence. It was a penetration of the mind through the veil of the
                    sensible universe interposed between .itself and the realities of the
                    intellectual world —its return to those purer perceptions which it had enjoyed
                    before its union with a body. This doctrine was altogether founded on a
                    fallacious view of the nature of demonstration. Because in demonstration the
                    conclusion is necessarily implied in the premises, it was conceived that a
                    science or proper knowledge of any particular was in all cases founded on a
                    knowledge of the general principle in which it was implied. But this was an
                    inversion of the order of knowledge, which commences with the particular, and
                    ends in the general principle. In mathematical and metaphysical science the two
                    things coincide; the notions of our mind being, on the one hand, in themselves
                    particular facts, from which we may argue, to general principles; and, on the
                    other hand, in their application to the business of philosophy, being the
                    general principles of our knowledge. But Plato argued from this coincidence in
                    these sciences to the sciences in general, and therefore confused demonstration
                    with the scientific arrangement of facts. Aristotle, we find, was not free from
                    the same fault in his Physics; but in his theory of Demonstration he has
                    strictly provided against it. He has here pointed out the difference between the
                    proof of matter of fact and of matter of abstract speculation. Instead of
                    inculcating the necessity of establishing every conclusion in science by
                    syllogism or a demonstrative process, he shows that all demonstration proceeds
                    on assumed principles; which principles, accordingly, must be obtained from
                    observations generalized, and not from reasoning.<note anchored="true"

                <p>There is one part of the work which deserves a more particular notice, as
                    throwing light on his whole method of philosophizing, while it shows how far he
                    approximated to the induction of modern philosophy. To obtain an accurate notion
                    of the being of any thing, we require a definition of it. A definition of the
                    thing corresponds, in dialectic, with the essential notion of it in metaphysics.
                    This abstract notion, then, according to Aristotle, constituting the true
                    scientific view of a thing,—and all the real knowledge consequently of the
                    properties of the thing depending on the right limitation of this notion,-—some
                    exact method of arriving at definitions which should express these limitations,
                    and serve as the principles of sciences, became indispensable in such a system
                    of philosophy. But in order to attain such definitions, a process of induction
                    was required—not merely an induction of that kind, which is only a peculiar form
                    of syllogism, enume- &lt;rating all the individuals implied in a class instead
                    of the <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> whole class collectively—but an induction of
                    a philosophical character, and only differing from the induction of modern
                    philosophy so far as it is employed about language. We shall endeavour to show
                    this more fully.</p>
                <p>There are, then, two kinds of induction treated of by Aristotle. The first, that
                    of simple enumeration. Its use is, where we have not beforehand ascertained a
                    class to which we may refer the subject of our conclusion, and the search is in
                    fact for a middle term. In this case, then, a collection of all the individuals
                    which are supposed to make up the class, serves instead of a middle term.
                    Assuming, accordingly, that these individuals are equivalent to the class, we
                    draw the conclusion, that what has been affirmed or denied of these collected
                    individuals may be affirmed or denied of the class. This, then, is nothing more
                    than a syllogism. There is no process of investigation involved, but it is
                    assumed, that we have found the assertion made, true in all the individual
                    instances; and the induction itself is simply the process of bringing them under
                    a principle of classification.</p>
                <p>But there is also a higher kind of induction employed by Aristotle, and pointed
                    out by him expressly in its subserviency to the exact notions of things, by its
                    leading to the right definitions of them in words. As it appears that words, in
                    a dialectical point of view, are classes more or less comprehensive of
                    observations on things, it is evident that we must gradually approximate towards
                    a definition of any individual notion, by assigning class within class, until we
                    have narrowed the extent of the expression as far as language will admit.<note

                    obvious resemblance which it exhibits compared with other objects. This point of
                    resemblance we abstract in thought, and it becomes, when expressed in language,
                    a genus or class, under which we regard the object as included. A more attentive
                    examination suggests to us less obvious points of resemblance between this
                    object and some of those with which we had classed it before. Thus carrying on
                    the analysis,—and by the power of abstraction giving an independent existence to
                    those successive points of resemblance,—we obtain subaltern genera or species,
                    or subordinate classes included in that original class with which the process of
                    abstraction commenced. As these several classifications are relative to each
                    other, and dependent on the class with which we first commenced, the definition
                    of any notion requires a successive enumeration of the several classes in the
                    line of abstraction; and hence is said technically to consist of genus and
                    differentia; the genus being the first abstraction, or class to which the object
                    is first referred, and the differentia being the subordinate classes in the same
                    line of abstraction.</p>
                <p>Now the process by which we discover these successive genera is strictly one of
                    philosophical induction. As in the philosophy of nature in general, we take
                    certain facts as the basis of inquiry, and proceed by rejection and exclusion of
                    principles involved in the inquiry, until at last,— there appearing no ground
                    for further rejection,—we con<pb break="no" facs="nls:193102243"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-2243-0514"/> clude that we are in possession of the true
                    principle of the object examined; so in the philosophy of language, we must
                    proceed by a like rejection and exclusion of notions implied in the general term
                    with which we set out, until we reach the very confines of that notion of it
                    with which our inquiry is concerned. This exclusion is effected in language, by
                    annexing to the general term denoting the class to which the object is primarily
                    referred, other terms not including under them those other objects or notions to
                    which the general term applies. For thus, whilst each successive term in the
                    definition, in itself, extends to more than the object so defined,—yet all
                    viewed together do not; and this their relative bearing on the one point
                    constitutes the being of the thing.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    says, “what magnanimity is, we must consider the instances of certain
                    magnanimous persons whom we know, what one thing they all have so far forth as
                    they are such; as,—if Alcibiades was magnanimous, or Achilles, or Ajax,—what one
                    thing they all have; say ‘ impatience under insult ;’ for one made war, another
                    raged, the other slew himself: again, in the instances of others, as of Lysander
                    or Socrates,—if here it is, ‘ to be unaltered by prosperity or adversity
                    ;’—taking these two cases, I consider, what this ‘ apathy in regard to events,’
                    and ‘ impatience under insult,’ have the same in them. If now they have nothing
                    the same, there must be two species of magnanimity.”<note anchored="true"

                    similar process in order to ascertain the nature of any thing. He directs that
                    the investigation should commence from the genus: since, having discovered the
                    properties or sequences of the genus, we have also the sequences to the next
                    class in the series,—and so on from that class to the next in order,—until by
                    this continued process we reach the individual object examined. In the course of
                    investigation, also, he observes that we should attend to whatever is common,
                    and examine to what class of objects that belongs, and what classes fall under
                    it;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Anal. Post.</hi> ii. c. 14.</p><p/></note> and for the same reason select
                    analogies; since in both these instances we obtain genera, under which the
                    object investigated may be arranged. The process is virtually the same, as if we
                    should investigate a law of nature. But the induction of Aristotle, having for
                    its object to determine accurately in words the notion of the being of things,
                    proceeds, according to the nature of language, from the general, and ends in the
                    particular; whereas the investigation of a law of nature proceeds from the
                    particular and ends in the general. Dialectical induction is synthetical, whilst
                    philosophical induction is analytical, in the result. The former labours to
                    particularize as much as possible, counteracting the uncertainty occasioned by
                    the generalizations of language; whilst the latter is engaged in penetrating the
                    confused masses in which objects first present themselves to the mind, and
                    exploring their most general and characteristic form. Thus, the induction of
                    Aristotle was strictly <hi rend="italic">tτaγωγr</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"
                    > i</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> or the bringing term on term, each successively
                    limiting the application of the preceding one in regular series, so that at
                    length a distinct notion may be presented of the object defined.<note

                    application of the science to practice than its philosophical nature.</p>
                <p>It would appear, then, that Bacon has not done justice to Aristotle in the
                    contemptuous manner in which he has spoken of the induction taught by Aristotle.
                    It is certainly limited in its design, as having for its object the correct
                    statements of the particular notions on which an inquiry turns, rather than the
                    discovery of new truth; and it is not set forth with that fulness of method
                    which Bacon developed in the <hi rend="italic">Novum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Organum.</hi> But it is sound and valid so far as it reaches, and proves that
                    Aristotle was not intent on corrupting philosophy with dialectic, but rather on
                    applying dialectic to that very purpose which Bacon himself so much insists
                    on—the bringing the intellect even and unprejudiced to the business of science.
                    Of the application of induction in its full philosophical extent, Aristotle
                    presents abundant specimens, and particularly in his treatises on Ethics and
                    Rhetoric. His discussion of the passions in the latter treatise is a masterpiece
                    in that way. He sets out, indeed, abstractedly with definitions of the several
                    passions, but these are the results at which he has arrived by induction, being
                    obtained, as his subsequent observations show, by a close interrogation of
                    nature, by examining accurately, what belongs, or does net belong, to each
                    particular passion, and thus adducing its exclusive character or proper
                    form.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rhetoric.</hi></p>
                <p>As the speculative sciences had been confounded under a vague notion of
                    dialectic, so had rhetoric, in the ostentatious study of it prevalent before the
                    time of Aristotle, drawn into its system the practical sciences of Politics and
                    Ethics. Observations had been accumulated on the mere accessories of the art;
                    but the proper business of the rhetorician, the inquiry into the argument itself
                    of which a composition must consist, had been overlooked. Aristotle had
                    therefore to dig a foundation for the fabric of a real science of rhetoric. He
                    had to clear away misconceptions; to show the data on which rhetorical science
                    must proceed, and the relative importance of its several parts.</p>
                <p>He commences, accordingly, with pointing out the nature of its connection both
                    with dialectic and with moral science. It is first and most directly connected
                    with rhetoric, inasmuch as it is a general method of providing arguments on any
                    subject whatever. As dialectic examines and discusses the principles of various
                    sciences, considering them in their relations as principles in the abstract, and
                    not as the principles of this or that science, and is so far equally conversant
                    about all subjects; so rhetoric inquires generally into the nature of principles
                    of persuasion, and therefore is also of equal application to the various
                    subjects of human thought. In the discussion of these abstract principles under
                    the head of dialectic, it was found that they were referable to two general
                    classes —that they were either probabilities or necessary truths. And Aristotle,
                    accordingly, after having explained the nature of syllogism, or the more general
                    connection of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193102256" xml:id="kp-eb0703-2256-0515"
                    />principles, which' is independent of their peculiar nature, proceeded to
                    investigate the nature of deductions as drawn from necessary principles or from
                    probabilities. The consideration of this distinction anticipates in some measure
                    the province of rhetoric, touching on the point, as we have already observed, in
                    which rhetoric differs from logic strictly so called. As the science of
                    eloquence, its office is to speculate on the effect of different principles in
                    producing conviction, and not simply on their abstract relations, and therefore
                    it must examine the relative force of arguments as they are probable or
                    necessary. Principles, in short, as they are grounds of credibility, and not as
                    they are the basis of a reasoning <hi rend="italic">process,</hi> constitute its
                    proper subject; and in this respect it coincided with a part of the ancient
                    dialectic. But it differs again from dialectic, inasmuch as it is connected also
                    with moral science. In dialectic the force of man’s moral nature on his opinions
                    is not considered. Will such or such an opinion result from such or such
                    arguments, according to the procedure of the human intellect in forming its
                    judgments,—is the whole inquiry of dialectic. But rhetoric further considers,
                    what is the practical force of such and such arguments; what effect are they
                    found to have in actual experience; not according to their mere speculative
                    force, but as acting on the complex nature of man; through which it happens that
                    questions are not examined on their positive merit as simple questions of truth,
                    but with feelings and sentiments thwarting or biassing the discernments of the
                    judgment. Here, then, is opened a wide field for a philosophical inquiry of a
                    peculiar character, distinct from dialectic, and yet strictly founded on it and
                    implying it throughout, as well as of the highest importance in order to the
                    success of truth in the world. This inquiry is what Aristotle institutes under
                    the head of rhetoric.</p>
                <p>He has shown the most perfect comprehension of the nature of the science which he
                    had undertaken to develope in this view∙of it, by holding it in exact balance
                    between the two sciences of dialectic and morals with which it is associated.
                    There is much of logical matter in the course of his inquiry, and still more of
                    ethical; but he never suffers us to forget that we are not examining those
                    sciences <hi rend="italic">in themselves</hi> now. but in their relations to one
                    compounded of both. He would have the rhetorician versed in dialectic, and
                    deeply acquainted with human nature; but he is intent on showing him how he is
                    to apply his knowledge of both these sciences to the proper business of
                    rhetoric—the influence on the mind of the hearer or persons addressed. It is not
                    a vague and popular knowledge of those sciences which he is inculcating
                    throughout, but a popular application of authentic principles drawn from them
                    both, and a popular application founded on a deep philosophy of human
                    nature.</p>
                <p>This philosophy consists in an investigation of the kinds of evidence by which
                    the minds of men are commonly swayed in accepting any conclusion proposed to
                    them, and of those principles of their moral nature by which their judgment is
                    commonly influenced. The whole, accordingly, is an inquiry into what is probable
                    or persuasive to a being so constituted as man.</p>
                <p>Rhetoric, then, considers arguments not as they are abstractedly necessary or
                    probable. This is a question relative to opinion alone; and the result from
                    arguments under this point of view is, either a full conviction, or a
                    presumption of some point in question. Rhetoric, on the other hand, looks simply
                    to probability in the <hi rend="italic">result.</hi> Whether an argument be
                    necessary or probable in <hi rend="italic">principle,</hi> is of no consequence
                    to the rhetorician, provided it be persuasive in its <hi rend="italic"
                    >effect.</hi> He has to consider, therefore, only a probability of this kind—on
                    what grounds men commonly believe an argument to be just.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We must be careful, therefore, how we
                    understand the assertion, that dialectic is concerned about truth, and rhetoric
                    about opinion. It is to be understood simply that rhetoric has not for its
                    object to discover what any particular thing <hi rend="italic">is,</hi> but to
                    discover what will give a <hi rend="italic">persuasion</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >belief</hi> that it is. Àt the same time, those principles on which such a
                    persuasion depends, are real tiuths about which the science is conversant;
                    whence it is called by Aristotle the philosophy of discourse, ή <hi
                    rend="italic">των</hi><hi rend="italic">λoγωv &lt;p</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >λo&lt;rι&gt;φ^, Rhet. ad Alex.</hi> cap. 1.</p></note> Now men are found to
                    receive arguments as conclusive on two different grounds—either as considering
                    them logically sound, deducible from admitted principles, or as coincident with
                    their own previous observations. Hence the distinction between probability and
                    likelihood; probability denoting conclusions which appear to have been proved by
                    some reason alleged—likelihood denoting conclusions grounded on matter of fact,
                    the conclusion being something like what has been experienced. Aristotle
                    distinguishes these two kinds of rhetorical arguments as probabilities, ε∕κoτα,
                    and signs, <hi rend="italic">Gr</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">μiiu.</hi> The precise nature of the distinction he explains more
                    fully in his Analytics.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Anal. Prior,</hi> fl. cap. ult.; <hi rend="italic">Rhet.
                    ad Alex.</hi> cap. 9, 13, 15.</p></note> In his Rhetoric he directs our
                    attention rather to those practical forms which the two classes assume in
                    enthymemes and examples; enthymemes being such arguments as state a conclusion
                    with the reason of it—examples, arguments in which a conclusion is drawn from
                    particular faets, or observations.</p>
                <p>He points out, accordingly, the force and propriety of enthymemes and examples,
                    as modes of producing conviction in themselves, and relatively to each other,
                    according to the subjects in which they may be employed. And as enthymemes are
                    the more comprehensive head— for, in fact, every argument from example is in
                    principle an enthymeme, the example cited being in this case the reason of the
                    conclusion—he dwells more explicitly on the nature of enthymemes. These he
                    distinguishes, as they are entirely abstract arguments, unconnected with any
                    particular subject, and equally common to all subjects; or as they are drawn
                    from particular subjects, and belong to particular sciences. Instances of the
                    former· class (τorro∕, the <hi rend="italic">loci</hi> of Cicero) are
                    conclusions of the possibility of any thing from abstract considerations of
                    possibility,-.-of the existence of any thing from the existence of that which
                    implies it more or less. Instances of the latter (the <hi rend="italic">vδη</hi>
                    of his system) are conclusions drawn from some observation of the nature of
                    human actions, or from some principle of government or commerce, &amp;c.; to
                    which the rhetorician has occasion to appeal, so far as some particular subject
                    is considered in the arguments of every speech.</p>
                <p>The matter of proof, or the grounds of credibility in themselves, being obtained,
                    it comes in the next place to be considered how this proof is acted on and
                    modified in the result by the complex nature of man, on whom the result is to be
                    produced. The subjects to which rhetoric properly applies are those in which
                    there is some opening for the action of the moral feelings. In questions of pure
                    science the intellectual powers alone are concerned. There is no personal
                    application to the individual; no reference to his own experience for the proof
                    of the principles, as is the case with all inquiries involving human conduct;
                    where a fairness of judgment is as much <pb break="no" facs="nls:193102269"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-2269-0516"/>required in order to an acknowledgment of the
                    principles, as a clearness of intellect. Whatever may be the nature of a
                    mathematical enunciation or a fact in chemistry, when it is once stated and
                    proved, there is no question whether we approve or disapprove it. Its truth is
                    suffered to rest on its proper footing. But a conclusion respecting our own
                    nature, or involving our own conduct, immediately calls all our moral principles
                    to the survey of it Our hopes, and fears, and wishes, are heard pleading for or
                    against it. And here, then, is the proper province of the rhetorician. He is the
                    advocate by whom the case is to be laid before these internal judges: he is to
                    prepare the evidence for their reception; and by his knowledge of their former
                    judgments, to present the truth before them in such form, that it may obtain a
                    fair hearing, and be affirmed in their decisions.</p>
                <p>For the convenient arrangement of rhetorical arguments, Aristotle divides
                    rhetoric into three different kinds, according to the different occasions on
                    which it was employed among the Greeks :—1. The deliberative, or its use in
                    political debates; 2. the judicial, or its use in popular assemblies, as those
                    of Athens, in which the people collectively exercised the judicial functions; 3.
                    the demonstrative, or its use in panegyric and invective, when the orator had
                    only to gratify his hearers by the display of eloquence.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Rhet.</hi> i. cap. 3,
                    &amp;c.; <hi rend="italic">Rhet. αd Alex.</hi> cap. 2-6, 35-38.</p></note> In
                    these several heads of inquiry he has given an admirable philosophy of the
                    motives by which mankind at large are commonly actuated in their conduct and
                    opinions. And here we should notice the peculiar complexion which the happiness
                    and the virtue, described in this part of his philosophy, assume. He is led to
                    speak of happiness<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Rhet.</hi> i. cap. 5.</p></note> as the great object of human
                    desires—the point from which all views of expediency obtain their colouring. But
                    here he is not concerned to illustrate that happiness to which the aim of
                    mankind <hi rend="italic">should be</hi> directed, but that which is <hi
                    rend="italic">in fact</hi> sought in the world as it is. He therefore portrays
                    those various distinct forms with which self-love invests the idea of happiness;
                    it being evidently more to the purpose of the orator, to conform his arguments
                    to the views entertained by his hearers, however theoretically false, than to a
                    more just theory, of which they have no conception. Virtue, again, is here a law
                    of honour.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Ibid,</hi> i∙ cap. 9-</p></note> It is an appeal to those right
                    feelings which exist in the nature of man, by which virtue is approved and vice
                    disapproved. Independently, however, of discipline and mature reflection, these
                    feelings are not found in fact always duly exerted: and there is ground,
                    therefore, for a popular kind of virtue, in a philosophical survey of those
                    principles by which the human heart is <hi rend="italic">commonly</hi> swayed in
                    its decisions of right and wrong. This law of right is at least an approximation
                    to perfect virtue. It is an irregular and uncertain application of the criterion
                    of praise, which belongs to virtue, leading to the preference of the more
                    ostentatious virtues to the less obviously praiseworthy; and to the exaltation
                    of some qualities to the rank of virtues, through the want of discrimination in
                    the popular estimate. Thus virtue becomes, in the popular view, a power of doing
                    good,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    rather than an internal habit, of self-moderation. Men acquiesce in that general
                    notion of it, under which it most strikes their attention and calls forth their
                    admiration. But this, is evidently the virtue to which the orator must make his
                    appeal. He cannot calculate on finding his hearers moral philosophers, or
                    persons whose sentiments have been highly cultivated. He must therefore proceed
                    on those broad principles which may be presumed to exist in the heart of every
                    man; and to these he must conform his arguments in order to produce a moral
                    impression.</p>
                <p>Further, as the habits of thinking and feeling among men are found to be affected
                    by peculiarities of circumstances, it is necessary for the orator to have
                    studied also the varieties of human character, and to have reduced these to
                    general principles for his practical direction. Aristotle, accordingly, has not
                    lost sight of this point in his Rhetoric, but has shown a keen discrimination in
                    the outlines which he has given of the effects of different governments,
                    different periods of life, different worldly fortunes, in modifying the human
                    character.</p>
                <p>He had strongly condemned former rhetoricians for making the whole art consist of
                    an appeal to the passions; but at the same time he was aware that such an appeal
                    was a necessary part of the orator’s address, and that no arguments, no merely
                    intellectual proofs, could avail, independently of this. To neglect, indeed, the
                    affections in arguments concerning human conduct, is to neglect the proper
                    authorities to which the whole process of proof is ultimately addressed.
                    Wherever evidence is not absolutely irresistible, and there is room for
                    doubt,—though there be no further object than simply to produce belief,—the
                    hearer naturally proceeds in his analysis of the evidence, until he brings it
                    home to himself, and finds that it terminates in some principle of his own
                    nature. This it is that at last determines the wavering balance. The philosophy
                    of rhetoric, therefore, required of Aristotle to give outlines of these ultimate
                    arbiters of all rhetorical questions. And we are indebted accordingly to his
                    masterly view of the subject, for an accurate and beautiful delineation, in the
                    course of his principal treatise of rhetoric, of the leading passions of human
                    nature. Of its excellence as a specimen of the inductive method of
                    philosophizing we have already spoken.</p>
                <p>In treating both of the virtues and of the passions, Aristotle’s view was to
                    enable the orator not only to recommend his arguments to the moral sentiments
                    and feelings of an auditory, but to bring also to their support the natural
                    prejudice from authority. We involuntarily ascribe, to one who appears in the
                    character of an instructor, the advantages of superior knowledge and kind
                    intentions; and the prejudice in favour of authority is thus reasonably founded
                    on a respect for wisdom and virtue. It is important, then, to the orator to
                    avail himself of this prejudice. There must be nothing in a speech that may
                    counteract the natural tendency to believe in the speaker. On the contrary, his
                    whole argument must conspire with it. It must give the impression that he is a
                    man of intellectual ability, as well as of right sentiments and feelings. Hence
                    Aristotle deduced a third class of rhetorical proofs under the head of ethos or
                    character; the pathos or appeal to the passions, and the argumentative proof as
                    such, constituting the two other heads of classification. He thus shows how a
                    speech may at once carry conviction, interest the feelings of the hearer, and
                    give the weight of personal authority to the speaker.</p>
                <p>In the popular views of rhetorical science, the subjects of style and method
                    engross an undue importance. We are thus led to think that eloquence consists in
                    the skilful use of the ornaments of style, in the flow of periods, and the
                    structure of the composition, advantageously distributing its lights and shades.
                    The attention is diverted <pb break="no" facs="nls:193102282"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-2282-0517"/>from the material itself of eloquence, the strong
                    framework of argument, without which no eloquence can subsist. Aristotle, in
                    proceeding to the discussion of style, has cautiously maintained the
                    subordination of this part of rhetoric, to the proper business of the
                    art—persuasion; treating it as a necessary condescension to the weakness of the
                    hearers. If, however, the manner in which we express our thoughts may contribute
                    to the reception of our assertions and arguments,—and it be allowed that the
                    principles of Taste are real parts of the human constitution,—the consideration
                    of style must enter into a philosophical system of rhetoric. The effect of the
                    style is part of the whole result of the composition on the mind of the hearers,
                    and is so far, therefore, an ingredient in that probability about which rhetoric
                    is conversant.</p>
                <p>In conformity with this view of the importance of style, Aristotle lays down

                    this also was in his opinion scarcely a legitimate portion of the art. Former
                    rhetoricians had encumbered their systems with numerous artificial divisions,
                    giving precise rules for the composition of each distinct head. Aristotle’s more
                    exact method admits no other divisions but the proposition and the proof; the
                    former founded on the necessity of stating the subject of discussion, the latter
                    on the necessity of proving the point stated: though he afterwards allows the
                    convenience of a fourfold division into, 1. the proem or introduction; 2. the
                    proposition; 3. the proof; 4. the epilogue or peroration.</p>
                <p>So deeply and fully has the science of rhetoric been considered by Aristotle. His
                    principal treatise on the subject, the <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric,</hi> in three
                    books, addressed to his disciple Theodectes, and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nicoachean Ethics,</hi> are perhaps the most perfect specimens of systematic
                    sciences extant in ancient or modern literature. For extent and variety of
                    matter, the <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric</hi> may be ranked even above the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ethics.</hi> It has been justly characterized as “a magazine of
                    intellectual riches. Nothing is left untouched on which rhetoric, in all its
                    branches, has any bearing. His principles are the result of extensive original
                    induction. He sought them, if ever man did seek them, in the living pattern of
                    the human heart. All the recesses and windings of that hidden region he has
                    explored; all its caprices and affections— whatever tends to excite, to ruffle,
                    to amuse, to gratify, or to offend it—have been carefully examined. The reason
                    of these phenomena is demonstrated, the method of creating them is explained.
                    The whole is a text-book of human feeling, a storehouse of taste—an exemplar of
                    condensed and accurate, but uniformly clear and candid, reasoning.” It is
                    professedly adapted to the business of the orator, that being the original
                    occasion of an art of rhetoric. But it is in fact a body of precepts for good
                    writing, furnishing authentic principles of criticism in every department of
                    prose composition. His smaller treatise, in one book, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Rhetoric to Alexander,</hi> is more strictly a science of political
                    eloquence, being written, as the introductory address to Alexander intimates, in
                    obedience to the king, who had requested a work of that description.<note

                <p>No work of Aristotle has been more justly estimated than the fragment which has

                    as it is, it has been uniformly, regarded as the great authority of the laws of
                    criticism in poetry: subsequent writers having only extended and illustrated the
                    principles laid down in it. The excellence of this little work, which is only
                    one book of the three of which the whole treatise is said to have
                    consisted,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Du Vai’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Aristotle,</hi> ii. p. 82.V</p></note> shows how much we have to
                    regret the entire loss of other works of Aristotle on the same subject. The
                    treatises <hi rend="italic">On Tragedies</hi> and <hi rend="italic">On
                    Poets,</hi> mentioned in the catalogue of Laertius, probably contained much
                    valuable information concerning Greek writers, whose works, perhaps whose names
                    in some instances, have not been transmitted to us.</p>
                <p>That portion which time has spared of the <hi rend="italic">Poetics,</hi> is
                    almost exclusively confined to the consideration of dramatic poetry; but the
                    philosopher, with his usual depth and reach of thought, has here laid a broad
                    foundation of principles applicable to the whole inquiry. He derives the nature
                    of poetry in general from the principle of imitation inherent in man. Two
                    natural causes, he says, appear to have originated poetry; the natural power of
                    imitation,—and the pleasure which all men take in imitation, that is, in
                    recognizing likenesses between distinct objects. These two causes thus stated by
                    him are in fact but one principle: the pleasure resulting from imitation being
                    the principle itself of imitation, viewed in its tendency or proper effect, the
                    production of pleasure; though, in the language of his philosophy, the first
                    would be the motive cause, the second the final. Poetry, then, according to him,
                    is the science by which the natural principle of imitation is realized in its
                    tendency; or a collection of observations on the mode by which pleasure is
                    produced in imitations of which language is the instrument. Hence the business
                    of the poet is stated by Aristotle to consist in representing things, not “as
                    they have been, but as they might be and therefore is described by him as of a
                    more philosophical and excellent nature, than that of the historian.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Poet.</hi>
                    c. 9.</p></note> The pleasure of imitation will not be answered, unless a
                    likeness be recognized between the objects and events described, and the objects
                    and events of nature: otherwise it will be a mere pleasure in the execution, or
                    in some circumstance of the work. The poet, therefore, in order to accomplish
                    the end of his art, must possess a philosophical power of observation. He must
                    have compared objects and events, and detected points of resemblance, and thus
                    formed for himself general principles on which his imagination may model its
                    ideal world. At the same time he differs from the philosopher very much in the
                    same way in which the orator differs from the dialectician. He has not to
                    consider what is <hi rend="italic">abstractedly</hi> like in things, but what
                    will be viewed as like in its <hi rend="italic">effect</hi> on the sentiments
                    and feelings of men. Therefore it is that his creations are clothed with a
                    beauty and loveliness surpassing nature. The resemblances which he shadows out
                    partake of those hues which the wishes of the human heart reflect upon
                    them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                <p>These fundamental notions, of the art pervade the sys-tern<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193102295" xml:id="kp-eb0703-2295-0518"/> of Aristotle’s Poetics,
                    though, from the briefness of the work in its present imperfect state, they are
                    by no means <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> fully developed in it. In the work,
                    indeed, as it now is, the basis of the poetic imitation—the actions, passions,
                    and manners, of which a poem is descriptive—are exclusively considered; and we
                    have no inquiry, as in the Rhetoric, into the principles of human nature by
                    which the , pleasure resulting from the imitation is modified in its effect.
                    From this circumstance, as well as from his accounting for the pleasure of
                    poetry on the ground of a natural delight in tracing out resemblances, Aristotle
                    has been sometimes thought to have placed the excellence of a poem in the
                    mechanism of its story,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    neglected altogether the intrinsic poetry of thought and expression. But we
                    shall not do justice to the comprehensiveness of his views, if we estimate them
                    by the limits of the present work. He seems here to have premised only, what
                    ought naturally to occupy the first place in a philosophical system of the
                    art.</p>
                <p>It must be remembered, also, that Greek poetry was essentially dramatic. It was
                    expressly composed with a view to public recitation or exhibition; and in poetry
                    of this kind the character of the incidents would hold a much greater importance
                    than in poetry intended chiefly to be read. The incidents would here hold a
                    place analogous to the thoughts and expressions of the poem submitted to the
                    contemplative study of a reader. This may further account fob Aristotle’s laying
                    so much stress on the interest of the plot in tragedy.</p>
                <p>The definition of tragedy given by Aristotle is remarkable, as savouring more of
                    the spirit of Plato’s philosophy than of his own. Describing its nature as it
                    differs from epic poetry and from comedy, he further characterizes it as, “by
                    means of pity and fear, working out the purification of such passions.”<note

                    >Politics,</hi> VIIİ. 7, he speaks of “purification as an effect of music. There
                    he promises to explain his meaning when he comes to treat of poetry; but no
                    explanation occurs in the Poetics.</p></note> The purification of the soul was
                    the object to which Plato directed the noble enthusiasm of his philosophy. By
                    converse with the ideas of the intellectual world, he would have the soul
                    disenchanted of the spells which bound it to sensible objects, and cleansed of
                    the impurities of its earthly associations. Aristotle’s description of the
                    effect' designed in tragedy, applies this doctrine to the particular emotions of
                    the soul produced by pity and fear. His idea appears to be, that tragedy, by
                    presenting the objects of those passions, without the grossness and the violence
                    with which they are attended in actual life, teaches us to feel the passions in
                    that degree only in which an impartial spectator can sympathize with us. By
                    familiarity with these pure abstractions— the true philosophy of the passions so
                    called forth—a moral effect is worked on the heart; the mimic occasions on which
                    it is rightly exercised serving as a real discipline of purification. The
                    question, on what the peculiar pleasure of tragic incident depends, is not
                    distinctly considered by Aristotle. But it may be accounted for on his
                    principles, from the view already given of the purification effected by tragedy,
                    connected with his doctrine, that pleasure is the result of every affection
                    rightly exerted. 1hat moderation of the passions of pity and fear which tragedy
                    has for its aim, is that right exertion of them to which pleasure has been
                    attached by nature, as a consequent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Practical Philosophy.</hi><hi rend="italic">Ethics.</hi></p>
                <p>We have observed, that under the head of Practical Philosophy, Aristotle delivers
                    the principles of those sciences by which the goods of human life are attained
                    by individuals or societies. According to this view, the practical sciences are
                    reducible to two: 1. Ethics, by which man is furnished with the principles
                    belonging to his natural good as man; 2. Politics, which inquires into the
                    principles on which the constitution of societies may be made subservient to
                    human good. Economics ought perhaps to be stated as a third branch of science
                    under this head, though, in the view of ancient philosophy, it naturally falls
                    under politics, so far as it concerns the regulation of families: families being
                    regarded as the elements of the political union.<note anchored="true"

                    spurious.</p></note></p>
                <p>In taking a review of Aristotle’s ethical system, it would be injustice to the
                    philosopher to withhold the expression of our admiration of the real wisdom
                    displayed by him in this department of science. We are little aware, living as
                    we do in .the sunshine of gospel-truth, what a reach of thought it required, in
                    those times, to see the science of Ethics in its proper light, as a discipline
                    of human character in order to human happiness. The ethical writings of
                    Aristotle, composed amidst the darkness of heathen superstition, abound with
                    pure and just sentiments; and, instead of depressing man to the standard of the
                    existing depraved opinions and manners, tend to elevate him towards the
                    perfection of his nature. They may indeed be studied, not only as an exercise of
                    the intellect, but as a discipline of improvement of the heart; so much is there
                    in them of sound and practical observation on human nature. They are directed,
                    it must be allowed, solely to the improvement of man in this present life; but
                    so just are the principles on which he builds that improvement, that we may
                    readily extend them to those higher views of our nature and condition to which
                    our eyes have been opened. And no greater praise can be given to a work of
                    heathen morality, than to say, as may with truth be said of the ethical writings
                    of Aristotle, that they contain nothing which a Christian may dispense with; no
                    precept of life which is not an element of the Christian character; and that
                    they only fail in elevating the heart and the mind to objects which it needed
                    Divine Wisdom to reveal.</p>

                    subjects discussed, and often coincident also in whole passages·</p>
                <p>' It is well known with what eager but unprofitable subtilty the inquiry into the
                    Chief Good was prosecuted by the Greek philosophers. The speculation proceeded
                    from a misapprehension of the nature of moral philosophy. They thought,
                    consistently with their method in physics, that, as every action of human life
                    appeared the pursuit of some good, there must be some abstract principle of
                    good, the constituent of the moral nature of actions. Hence they were busied in
                    exploring the several objects of human pursuit, and comparing them, and drawing
                    conclusions as to their relative superiority in the order of pursuit. Had they,
                    however, considered sufficiently the subject of their investigation, they would
                    have seen the irrelevancy of any such inquiry to the business of moral
                    philosophy. It was in fact a mere perversion of the terms “good” and “end,”
                    which constitute part of the technical phraseology of the science. These notions
                    being once introduced into philosophy, an occasion was furnished for <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> speculation into the nature of goods and ends. It is
                    easy to see what a field for ingenuity was opened in determining the point where
                    the two notions coincided; and in this consisted the determination of the chief
                    good,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is not only in

                    actions estimated entirely by a reference , to some ultimate good or end which
                    individuals or societies have proposed to themselves, though perhaps not

                <p>Now Aristotle examined human actions with a more philosophical eye. He readily
                    saw through the vain realism of those speculations which supposed that there was
                    some quality of good admitting of abstract disquisition into its nature.<note

                    spoken of, it was not with refer - ence to some ulterior object, as was implied
                    in all those theories which laid down a speculative definition of the chief
                    good; but that it was the very characteristic of an action, to be <hi

                    Hence he was diverted from that track of inquiry which had misled, and which,
                    after him, continued to mislead, other philosophers, and struck out for himself
                    a new path of moral science. He has thrown his preliminary views, indeed, into a
                    form resembling that of the speculative philosophers, in unconscious deference
                    probably to the prejudices of the method in which he had been trained. Thus he
                    sets out in his <hi rend="italic">Niconadican Ethics</hi> with a sketch of the
                    chief good and ends of actions, according to his conceptions of its nature: and
                    this is apt to excite an idea, that in reading this work we are only examining a
                    rival system of the same kind with the Greek moral philosophy in general,—an
                    idea which Cicero<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    Aristotle’s having united two objects as together making up the chief good of
                    man. On looking, however, closely into his actual process of investigation, we
                    find it widely different in kind from those inquiries which we have already
                    condemned, the agreement being simply in the technical form of the argument.</p>
                <p>The chief good<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Laertius
                    mentions, in the Catalogue of Aristotle’s writings, a treatise, <hi

                    establishing is, the philosophical principle or general nature of actions as
                    such. To describe it more fully,—he investigates the law, according to which,
                    human actions attain the good which' is their object, and which, as being the
                    <hi rend="italic">end</hi> really designed in all actions, whatever may be their
                    immediate particular ends, is the great final cause of all—the end of ends.
                    Aristotle speaks of moral virtue as conversant about affections and actions, <hi
                    rend="italic">¶regi srgaζιις κaι</hi> wα3&gt;j.<note anchored="true"

                    >Nie.</hi> ii. c. 3, 6, 9, &amp;c.</p></note> He discriminates by these terms
                    between external and internal acts— between the works and sentiments of virtue.
                    In strictness, however, actions are the only proper subject of ethical science;
                    which is conversant about human affections, inasmuch as affections are implied
                    in actions. Actions are affections exerted towards some object, and comprehend,
                    accordingly, both external and internal acts. Am action, then, according to
                    Aristotle, is good, in which an affection attains its object; and, in that case,
                    the action itself may be regarded as a reaoςor end; the affection being
                    realized, completed, satisfied, in it. Evidently, then, it may be inquired how
                    the affections really obtain their objects in action, or what constitutes an
                    action an end. But this is a very different inquiry from one that, by comparison
                    of particular objects, searches after some definite sole object of pursuit. In
                    this it is presupposed, that every object of a natural affection is an ultimate
                    end, or an object in· which that affection, whatever it may be, rests, as in its
                    natural good.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hence the
                    just compliment to the peripatetic svstem by Origen (contra <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cels.</hi> p. 10, edit. Spene.), that it was “the most humane, and candidly
                    acknowledged human goods more than other sects.” The Stoics confounded natural
                    and moral good: “quod est bonum oinne laudabile est,” &amp;c. Cicero <hi
                    rend="italic">de Fin.</hi> iii. 8. .</p></note> Accordingly, it is sought to
                    ascertain how it is so; what that principle is by which any action whatever is
                    really a good in itself and an end. Such a principle is analogous to the chief
                    good of the speculative moralists, because it exhibits human actions in that
                    point of view in which their <hi rend="italic">goodness</hi> consists, or in
                    which they accomplish that good towards which the affections naturally tend; but
                    it differs so far as it restricts the notion of the chief good to no one
                    distinct class of objects. It ⅛ simply a general account of the right
                    constitution of nature exemplified in the multitude of individual instances. As
                    Newton does not inquire what gravity is, but developes the law by which gravity
                    acts; so Aristotle does not give an abstract notion of the chief good, but
                    explores the principle by which it is realized in human life .: and thus he
                    obtains a view of it unconnected with any speculative opinions concerning the
                    chief good or happiness of man. His theory leaves the notion of human happiness
                    entirely relative.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is

                    as he obtains the good sought in action, exemplify that law or ultimate
                    principle which constitutes an action a perfect action, or good.</p>
                <p>The whole of his several treatises of Ethics consist of a development of this his
                    characteristic view of human good. He had observed how mankind, through the
                    force of passion <pb break="no" facs="nls:193102321"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-2321-0520"/>and evil habits, mistake and pervert their proper
                    goods. Moral philosophy, he thought, might be applied to correct this
                    misapprehension of men—to reform this perversion. The force of reason, at least,
                    might be tried. He wished therefore to propose to their view the real goods
                    intended for them by the constitution of their nature, and to call the attention
                    of each individual to the pursuit of these in his own particular case. His
                    practical design throughout accordingly is, to direct the principles of our
                    moral nature towards their proper objects in such a way that they may rest in
                    these objects as <hi rend="italic">ends,</hi> and attain the proper good of man.
                    When all the principles are so regulated that this effect takes place in each,
                    the collective result is happiness, or the entire and consummate good of man.
                    Whence he takes occasion to describe happiness in general terms, as in its
                    nature “energy of soul,” <hi rend="italic">ψυχrii εvεg-γsia,</hi><note

                    “the powers of the soul exerted” “according to that virtue or excellence which
                    most consummates or perfects them.” The mode of description is drawn from his
                    physical philosophy. It is founded on a notion of some intrinsic power in the
                    soul working like the operations of the natural world. His theory of happiness,
                    then, contemplates this process of the soul at its termination, where the proper
                    nature of the soul as an <hi rend="italic">active</hi> principle is fully
                    developed. The truth is, we have then a generalized fact, descriptive of the
                    real state of the case, in the particular instances in which an affection is
                    found to have been happily exerted. He takes, indeed, into his estimate of the
                    chief good, the effect of the circumstances of the world on the virtuous
                    exercise of the powers of the soul; adding the condition of “a perfect

                    adequate opportunities in the world,—for the development of the moral

                    the happiness of his nature, must, in order to be judged of truly, be
                    contemplated in its <hi rend="italic">tendency</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> in
                    the effect that it would produce if it acted freely, without impediment from the
                    world. To think that external goods are causes of happiness, he says, is like
                    imputing the excellence of the music to the lyre rather than to the art of the
                    musician. Prosperity, he also observes, has its limit in reference to happiness,
                    since it may be <hi rend="italic">excessive,</hi> and in that case would be an
                    <hi rend="italic">impediment</hi> to happiness.<note anchored="true"

                    of the expression in his sketch of the chief good, gives the appearance of his
                    including prosperity to a certain extent as a <hi rend="italic">constituent</hi>
                    of the good; whereas in this point, as well as in the whole form of his inquiry
                    into the chief good, he is only following the abstract method of the ancient
                    philosophy. In reality he is pursuing a course of investigation strictly
                    inductive. The terms themselves, “a perfect life,” sustain the idea of the
                    soul’s working out its own perfection, in which process the perfection of its
                    physical existence would necessarily constitute a part.</p>
                <p>Thus, too, the notion of pleasure, considered as an abstract good, is distinctly

                    philosophy obtruded the question on his notice, whether pleasure was to be
                    identified with happiness, or was to be regarded as an evil. He accordingly
                    formally discusses it; refuting the existing opinions on the subject, and
                    establishing, that pleasure was a good, so far as it necessarily accompanies the
                    exercise of every principle of our nature; and consequently, that the highest
                    pleasures are attached to the exercise of the highest principles. The discussion
                    itself is thrown into a form highly abstruse and speculative; but the conclusion
                    at which he arrives is entirely practical, and of the greatest importance in
                    order to a just theory of virtue. It amounts to this, that the mere
                    gratification of every natural affection, by its exertion in action, is not to
                    be distinctly proposed and aimed at as the end of that affection. This would be
                    to grasp at the result, and neglect the means in order to it.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It may be illustrated thus:
                    In travelling, we may have some place which we desire to reach pointed out to us

                    course directly towards it, and thus making it our immediate object· But this
                    course would probably lead us into insuperable difficulties; whereas by going
                    along the road leading to it, though that road may be circuitous and indirect,
                    we safely and surely reach it.</p></note> For, the gratification is, as
                    explained by him, the mere <hi rend="italic">result</hi> of the adaptation of
                    the affection to its object, and <hi rend="italic">consequent</hi> on the

                    and a full and perceptible constitution into the proper nature.”</p></note> The
                    attainment, therefore, of the highest pleasure attached to our nature,
                    presupposes that the work of virtue has been performed in adjusting the moral
                    and intellectual principles to their objects.</p>
                <p>In proceeding to expand this great doctrine, in which his whole ethical system is
                    included, Aristotle appears to have availed himself of the ancient theory of the
                    Pythagoreans, according to which virtue was stated to be iξ∕g rou osovros,<note

                    duty,”—or the due internal constitution of our nature. This notion seems at
                    least to have afforded him an outline of his own theory of virtue, though he
                    established it for himself on an extensive basis of original observation.
                    Analyzing bur moral nature into affections, capacities, and habits, he at once
                    rejects from the estimate the two former views as inadequate to the effect, and
                    steadily directs his observation to the force of habits in modifying our moral
                    nature. He found that virtuous actions tended to form within us the character of
                    virtue, and that a character so formed enabled us to act virtuously. As it was
                    thus evident that habits were the bond of connection between virtuous principle
                    and virtuous action, he decided that the principle by which the soul worked out
                    its perfection, or, as we should rather express it according to our own ideas,
                    by which the affections of our moral nature were rightly exerted, was in itself
                    a habit.</p>
                <p>He had observed also, that, in every instance in which <hi rend="italic"

                    The soul of man is conceived to be wrought to a temperament or mean state, all
                    its affections and actions being in their due proportions.</p>
                <p>To determine, however, this due measure of the affections, or this mean to which
                    the constitution of the soul must be brought in order to the virtuous character,
                    is the great question of ethics. To what arbitration shall we resort, to fix the
                    evanescent boundaries of the territory of virtue?</p>
                <p>Now, the instances in which this self-moderation belonging to the character of
                    virtue is observed, become in themselves the objects of approbation, exciting in
                    us sentiments of love, esteem, admiration, honour, and commending themselves at
                    the same time to our intellectual perceptions. Hence the various expressions
                    introduced into moral philosophy, of moral fitness, propriety, proportion—the
                    decent, the fair, the honourable, the amiable, in conduct; the adoption of one
                    or more of which tests of the morality of actions, has given its peculiar shade
                    of opinion to different systems. Aristotle contemplates these sentiments of
                    approbation, not as they are in themselves, but as they are outwardly evidenced
                    by the praises of mankind at large accompanying certain actions.<note

                    to the action itself; or the action is not only “good” in being the attainment
                    of some natural end, but is further in itself the object of approbation. The
                    combination of these two effects is expressed by Aristotle under the term
                    zαλov,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ethic,</hi> passim; <hi rend="italic">Rhet.</hi> i.∙ cap. 9.</p></note> to
                    which we have no perfect counterpart in our language, though the word
                    “honourable,” if understood in its full meaning, may sufficiently represent
                    it.</p>
                <p>Aristotle’s classification of actions under the heads of different virtues is
                    founded on this analysis of the moral nature of actions. A distinct class of
                    natural objects of desire, to the pursuit of which within certain limits praise
                    is attached, is in his system the ground of a distinct virtue.</p>
                <p>His enumeration of the virtues is evidently incomplete. It seems chiefly intended
                    as an evidence by induction, of that moderation of the affections in which he
                    had stated the nature of virtue to consist. His division, indeed, of virtue is
                    physical rather than logical—an enumeration of the <hi rend="italic">parts</hi>
                    of virtue rather than of the <hi rend="italic">kinds</hi> of it: and his method,
                    accordingly, did not require of him an exact statement of all the particulars
                    comprized under the general term virtue. He has been accused of attending
                    chiefly to the more splendid virtues. He was very probably led, by the very
                    criterion of virtue which he employed, as well as by his view of the connection
                    between ethics and politics, to sketch more prominently those particular virtues
                    which recommend a man in society. And thus he has drawn beautiful little
                    outlines of those charms of familiar intercourse—affability, frankness,
                    agreeableness.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Eth. Nic.</hi> iv. cap. 6, 7, 8.</p></note> His introduction,
                    indeed, of these qualities among the virtues of his system, is a striking
                    evidence of the practical nature of that virtue which he inculcates. It is a
                    virtue which is not to be forgotten in any part of a man’s daily life. Whilst it
                    nerves his arm in dangers, distributes his bounty, shields him against
                    temptations of pleasure, it unbends him in the hours of leisure, and is ever on
                    his tongue, whether gravely pronouncing in his assertions and judgments, or
                    playing in the sallies of his wit. These very instances show that he did not
                    regard splendour as the exclusive attribute of virtue. On the contrary, he
                    expressly speaks of it as only the heightening and decoration of the several
                    virtues, and as meritorious because it presupposes all the virtues in their
                    perfection.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>He selects the virtue of justice<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Among his lost treatises was one <hi rend="italic">on
                    Justice,</hi> in 4 books. (Diog· Laert.)</p></note> for more particular
                    discussion. He distinguishes it as a particular virtue from the whole of virtue,
                    which it denotes <hi rend="italic">relatively,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> in
                    its being the moderation of the love of gain or self-interest. Seduced, however,
                    by the example of Plato, he departs, in his mode of treating this virtue, from
                    the strict province of ethics into that of politics. The justice which he
                    explains is a political virtue, applicable to the citizens of a common state
                    rather than to man as man. And this confusion of ethical and political justice
                    has led him into a speculative refinement, which gives the appearance of a
                    forced effort to reconcile the notion of justice with his theory of virtue.
                    Looking at justice as a dispensing power, he observed that it was concerned
                    about “a mean” in things themselves, apportioning to each person his exact due,
                    whether of reward or punishment. On the ground of this fact he points out that
                    justice is not “a mean,” as the other virtues are, but is “of the mean”—not in
                    itself “a relative mean,” but “relative to a mean.” Had he considered justice
                    solely as a moral habit, he would have seen that the distinction was
                    unnecessary, since in this point of view it conforms precisely to his general
                    notion of virtue in being a principle of self-moderation. There is, however, a
                    foundation for the remark in the circumstance, that justice admits of greater
                    exactness in its exercise than other virtues. “The rules of justice,” says an
                    excellent writer,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Adam
                    Smith, <hi rend="italic">Theor. of Mor. Sentim.</hi> part iii. chap.
                    6.</p></note> “may be compared to the rules of grammar; the rules of the other
                    virtues to the rules which critics lay down for the attainment of what is
                    sublime and elegant in composition.” In the other virtues we are thrown more on
                    our sense of propriety in forming our practical decisions. In justice we have
                    evident facts before us—the merit or demerit of individuals in themselves; and
                    these form an external standard to guide us in our conduct over and above our
                    internal convictions of right. So far, then, justice may be regarded as “of the
                    mean,” besides being also a point of propriety, or a mean within ourselves.
                    Aristotle, it should be observed, had no other more appropriate word distinct
                    from “justice” to express “honesty” or “integrity,” and consequently was led to
                    generalize too far in his analysis of justice.</p>
                <p>Aristotle’s discussion of friendship<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> Eth</hi>- <hi rend="superscript">
                    ytc</hi> ' <hi rend="superscript"> vuι</hi> * <hi rend="superscript"> ιx</hi>
                    *</p></note> is open to similar objection. He has considered it in its outward
                    effects as a social principle akin to justice, to which justice is subordinate
                    and supplementary, rather than as an internal ethical principle—the moderated
                    exercise of benevolence <pb break="no" facs="nls:193102347"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-2347-0522"/>in the heart itself. His observations, however, on
                    the subject admirably illustrate the importance of friendship to the right
                    constitution of society—the various modifications of the benevolent principle in
                    the different relations of human life—together with the peculiar amiableness of
                    virtue in itself. In the last respect, indeed, the discussion forms an essential
                    part of his moral philosophy, as it tends to show his conviction that the moral
                    principles have their seat in the heart.</p>
                <p>Indeed, this part of his Ethics, as well as his inquiry into justice, should be
                    accurately studied by all who would obtain just views of the comprehensive
                    character of the virtue of his system. Together they comprize a body of relative
                    duties. Under justice would be classed the duties of “religion, memory of the
                    dead, filial reverence, patriotism, civil obedience, veracity, honesty,”
                    &amp;C.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">De Virtut. et Vit.</hi></p></note> so far as these duties flow
                    from <hi rend="italic">claims</hi> on our respect, and are prescribed by human
                    laws: under friendship, the same duties as they are prompted by sentiment and
                    feeling, and arc known by the names of piety, gratitude, benevolence, fidelity,
                    generosity, &amp;c. Hence his beautiful summary of the character of virtue, when
                    he says, that “it is of virtue both to benefit the worthy and to love the good;
                    and to be neither apt to punish nor revengeful, but merciful, and placable, and
                    indulgent; and there follow on virtue, kindness, equity, candour, good hope;
                    moreover, such qualities as, to be domestic, friendly, social, hospitable,
                    philanthropic, and a lover of what is honourable.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>His theory, then, of virtue must be regarded as involving a minute and distinct
                    attention to all the particular virtues. And herein appears its great
                    excellence, as contrasted with those of some modern philosophers, who have
                    endeavoured to trace up all the virtues to some one principle of our nature, as
                    benevolence, or self-love, or prudence. All such theories are in truth mere
                    accommodations of language, by which different classes of phenomena are arranged
                    under the same terms; and they tend rather to give a shadowiness to the form of
                    virtue, instead of Striking it out in bold outline. Aristotle’s theory is the
                    law by which these different classes of facts are held together in fact, the
                    common process by which the operation of each virtue is carried on; and which,
                    when realized in the character of a man, gives him the command of all the
                    virtues.</p>
                <p>The ancient moral philosophy sought, like the modern, to resolve virtue into some
                    <hi rend="italic">one</hi> principle; but the endeavour of the ancients was
                    rather to ground it on some <hi rend="italic">intellectual</hi> principle.
                    Socrates contended that the virtues were instances of prudence or knowledge,
                    pgovjjffs∕ς, or λoχo∕, or <hi rend="italic">i&lt;xrtrr</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">μαu.</hi> Aristotle shows the foundation of
                    this misconception, in explaining in what respect the production of virtue might
                    be regarded as the work of the intellect. Each virtue consisting in the
                    adjustment of the action to all the circumstances of the case, the virtue of
                    each action must consequently depend on the practical judgment of the individual
                    agent; and an agent who is uniformly virtuous must exhibit this practical
                    judgment uniformly operating, enabling him to decide on the point in which the
                    virtue of acting lies.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    definition presents to the mind an exact notion of the thing defined, so the
                    principles supplied by prudence give us a perception of the moral nature of an
                    action. For example, suppose a man to have received some evident wrong—some
                    injury done to him without provocation. The affection of resentment naturally
                    leads him to requite the injustice on his assailant; but by what method of
                    action he should do so, is a matter of question. He must know exactly in what
                    way his resentment should be shown, in order to act virtuously; besides having
                    as his general principle, the inclination to act virtuously.<note

                    therefore, have had some experience of human life—some practical knowledge of
                    the nature of actions which have been approved as fulfilling the end of this
                    affection. An experience, then, of this kind, applied to the exercise of all the
                    affections, and operating invariably on the conduct, constitutes the prudence of
                    Aristotle’s system. It is thus intimately connected with the moral principles,
                    as the moral principles are with it. It is the combined result, in the
                    intellectual part of our nature, of all the virtues of the heart; as, on the
                    other hand, prudence is the diverging of the intellect through the various
                    virtues of the heart. Hence his conclusion, that it is impossible to be properly
                    good—κυj∕ως &lt;%yabov—without prudence, or to be prudent without moral virtue;
                    and consequently, that all the moral virtues are inseparable, inasmuch as the
                    possession of all is requisite for the perfecting of prudence.<note

                <p>In this account of prudence is to be traced the principle of moral obligation
                    involved in Aristotle’s theory of virtue. He considers the moral virtues as
                    those of the inferior part of the soul, and therefore as formed to obey; whereas
                    the intellectual principles, as being purely rational, had in their nature an
                    intrinsic authority. Prudence, accordingly, being the intellectual virtue
                    employed in conjunction with the moral in the production of virtue, is, from its
                    nature, supreme over its associated principles, and demands of right their
                    submission to its dictates.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    such a ground of obligation is merely theoretic; and so Aristotle himself
                    perceived it to be.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Eth.</hi><hi rend="italic">Nic.</hi> x. c. 9.</p></note> As a
                    principle of observation and reflection, it resembles in some measure the
                    supremacy of conscience; but it does not come up to the force of that
                    master-principle. Conscience rewards and punishes by its judgments, whereas the
                    dictates of prudence carry no such sanction in them. Properly, however, the
                    notion of “obligation” is inapplicable to his system. Not inculcating morality
                    as a« law, but as a philosophy, or art of life, he was not called upon to show
                    why it should be <hi rend="italic">obeyed</hi> as a law. It was enough for him
                    to point out, from observations on human conduct, that it is <hi rend="italic"
                    >in fact</hi> obeyed by all who attain their real good.</p>
                <p>But though the principle of conscience has no place in his theory, it is
                    certainly implied in his test of virtue and vice—the praise and blame of
                    mankind. The universal consent of mankind on these points he considers as
                    decisive of the moral nature of an action. But this is to allow a standard of
                    right and wrong inherent in human nature, or what is equivalent to a conscience.
                    If all agree in praising a certain modification of the affections, and in
                    blaming another, it is clear that there must be some common principles in all to
                    serve as the bases of these unanimous judgments. The same conclusion results
                    from his admission of capacities of virtue, and of the existence of natural
                    virtue, in man, antecedent to the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193102360"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-2360-0523"/>proper formation of it in the character. Indeed,
                    his analysis of prudence is in itself decisive of his real view of this point.
                    Not only are the principles on which pru- ' dence is to speculate to be drawn
                    from the heart; but the very deduction of these principles to the particular
                    cases of conduct involves moral perceptions. For how else is the precise point
                    in which the mean lies—in which the due measure of the affection exerted
                    consists—to be ascertained? If the virtue of the action consisted in an absolute
                    mean, a mere intellectual process, such as that of arithmetic or geometry, would
                    enable us to ascertain it. But the mean in question being neither more nor less
                    than what is <hi rend="italic">proper,</hi> this implies a sense of propriety.
                    Right conduct, according to him, is not such because it is neither excessive nor
                    defective; but it is neither excessive nor defective because it is right. This
                    is plain from his induction of the several virtues, in which he shows that there
                    is a mean, because there is a point of propriety; so that a moral perception
                    must precede every decision on moral questions. It is of the greatest
                    consequence, in order to a right understanding of his account of virtue, to
                    observe this necessary dependence of the knowledge of the mean, on the
                    adjustment of the moral principles to their objects. The want of attention to it
                    has led to absurd objections against Aristotle’s theory. He has been interpreted
                    as if he had said that we could have <hi rend="italic">too much</hi> courage,
                    <hi rend="italic">too much</hi> liberality, &amp;c.; which notion proceeds on
                    the false assumption, that the mean laid down by Aristotle is a <hi
                    rend="italic">quantity</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> whereas it is only a
                    proportion or correspondence existing between the principles of the agent and
                    the objects of those principles.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    as employed by Aristotle, is merely negative, marking the exclusion of all
                    unchastened feeling from the character of virtue.</p>
                <p>But though his system is defective as an authoritative law, it developes a much
                    nobler theory of duty than the philosophy which rests our obligation to virtue
                    on a ground of interest. The “prudence” of Aristotle’s ethics must be understood
                    as widely different from the prudence of such a theory. The prudence which he
                    teaches is no calculation of consequences. It is a practical philosophy of the
                    heart, inseparably connected with the love of that conduct which it suggests:
                    whereas, when we are taught to act on the ground of interest, the prudence then
                    inculcated is a mere intellectual foresight of consequences, independent of any
                    exercise of the heart.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A
                    moral philosophy of this kind is in fact a revival in a new form of the. theory
                    of Socrates, which made virtue a science. It overlooks the affections in the
                    production of virtue, as the theory of Socrates did.</p></note> Such a system,
                    whilst it overthrows the distinction between right and wrong as a fundamental
                    principle, requires either a very comprehensive power of intellect in order to
                    its practical adoption, or an express revelation from the Deity, declaring the
                    good and evil consequences annexed to actions. These are conditions which
                    sufficiently expose its futility as a guide to duty. The heart of man leaves far
                    behind this morality of consequences, and decides, even before the action itself
                    has its birth, whether it is morally right or wrong. The appeal to the revealed
                    will of the Deity is not only a <hi rend="italic">petitio principii,</hi>
                    inasmuch as no will of the Deity can be ascertained and proved divine, without
                    th⅛previous admission of principles of right and wrong; but is refuted by the
                    simple fact, that theories of virtue such as that of Aristotle have been devised
                    by men who had no belief in a Divine Providence. We speak not of the excellence
                    of such theories, but of the mere fact of their <hi rend="subscript"> (</hi><hi

                    world—in the other case we consider also what we shall gain or lose in the world
                    to come ;”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Paley’s <hi

                    assertion disproved at once by the fact, that Aristotle saw a difference between
                    the two acts, independently of that consideration on which the notion of duty is
                    there made to rest. Whether he has stated the difference correctly or not, is
                    immaterial to this point.</p>
                <p>The principle of self-love has also been well illustrated by Aristotle in its
                    relation to virtue. He distinguishes between the culpable form of it, or
                    selfishness, and that form of it which is auxiliary to virtue. Self-love, then,
                    in its good sense, may be acted on by the virtuous man, whose character is
                    already framed on the principle of “the honourable ;” and in that case, he
                    shows, it will be coincident with benevolence; since the person so pursuing his
                    own interest will also effectually promote that of others. But this is not the
                    case with the bad man; since, in pursuit of his views of self-interest, the bad
                    man will at once injure himself and others by compliance with bad passions.<note

                    evident from the above, that neither does he admit of benevolence being made a

                    moral principles, and is regulated consequently in its exercise by a prevailing
                    regard to the “honourable” or right. He has also enforced his primary notions of
                    duty by pointing out the proper amiableness of virtue, both as the only sure tie
                    of attachment between man and man,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    selfsatisfaction, and delight, in a man’s own bosom. On the latter point,

                    most powerful auxiliary principles, without exalting them, as some philosophers
                    have, to an undue place, by making the theory of virtue to rest on them.</p>
                <p>Such, then, is that account of virtue which Aristotle’s practical philosophy
                    developes. He delivers it as the theory of perfect conduct, as that which is
                    exemplified in operation whenever human good is realized in life. It is at the
                    same time, it should be observed, an account of the nature of virtue, and of the
                    internal process of our own constitution, by which virtue is produced. The
                    affections being all habitually moderated by prudence, virtue is the result; and
                    in that moderation consists the nature of virtue.</p>

                    a practical rule is not realized in human life. He was aware that a complete
                    subordination of the affections to the principle of prudence was a task of
                    difficulty above the efforts of man as he is. So also his view of vice, as that

                    degradation to which our nature is brought—that hardening of the heart, as the
                    Scripture terms it, by the habitual violation of our duty. As the end,
                    therefore, as the perfect form of vice, this state of the heart should be
                    sketched out by the moralist, to give their proper practical cogency to his
                    admonitions/ His outlines of virtue must be drawn from virtue realized in its
                    tendency—from that condition of it in which it is the attainment of man’s chief
                    good; as vice, on the other hand, must be contemplated where it stands fully
                    confessed as man’s chief evil. There may be a virtue above our nature, as there
                    may be a vice below it; and Aristotle notices both these extremes: but neither
                    of these presents a standard of human excellence or human depravity, and
                    therefore requires no distinct consideration in an ethical treatise. But the
                    actual virtues and vices of men, as they are observed in the world, exhibit an
                    endless variety of modifications within the theoretic limits of virtue and vice.
                    The affections are more or less brought into subjection to the rational
                    principle in different individuals; and men are praised and blamed in proportion
                    as they have established this command over themselves, or have lost it. And
                    hence a secondary or inferior kind of virtue results, as well as a less odious
                    vice. As it is in the indulgence of the sensual affections that human frailty is
                    most seen, Aristotle distinguishes this secondary virtue and vice by contrast
                    with the particular virtue and vice of temperance and intemperance; as if they
                    were simply what we express by continence and incontinence; but his distinction
                    of their nature is a general one, and belongs to the whole character of virtue
                    and vice.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    admitting a morality of this nature, he laboured under a speculative difficulty.
                    Socrates had denied the existence of any such imperfect vice, on the ground that
                    the virtues were sciences, and that it was impossible for a man to act against
                    his convictions of the best. Aristotle, though not agreeing with Socrates in
                    regarding the virtues as sciences,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Eudem.</hi> vii. c. 13; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eth.</hi><hi rend="italic">Nie.</hi> vii. c. 3.</p></note> still, as he
                    admitted an intellectual process in the production of virtue, felt himself
                    required to explain how this higher principle was overpowered by the weaker, as
                    it evidently was in the incontinent man. In the course of this explanation he
                    has touched on the true philosophy of those facts in which the principles and
                    practice of men are evidenced at variance. He has accounted in some measure for
                    the apparent anomaly of the same person exhibiting at different periods such
                    contrasts of character—at one time commanding the passions, at another yielding
                    to them. For he delineates, it should be observed, under the characters of “the
                    continent” and “incontinent,” not two different persons, as in the case of “the
                    temperate” and “intemperate,” but what will usually be the same person at
                    alternate intervals, since no one can very long remain either.</p>
                <p>The question of the freedom of the will has been admirably treated by Aristotle.
                    It is discussed as it ought to be in a treatise of moral philosophy,
                    independently of those metaphysical difficulties with which it is commonly
                    overlaid. What the nature of human will is, whether it must be regarded as free
                    or necessary, according to our abstract notions of liberty or necessity, forms
                    no part of his inquiry. He points out simply, what are the classes of actions in
                    which an ’ agent is generally held <hi rend="italic">not</hi> responsible for
                    his conduct; and excluding these, decides on the remainder—that, since in these,
                    men <hi rend="italic">are</hi> held responsible; as is shown by the praise and
                    blame, reward and punishment, attaching to their conduct; there, the actions are
                    voluntary. This is the extent to which the inquiry, <hi rend="smallcaps">sq</hi>
                    far as it is strictly ethical, ought to be carried. Whether we speculatively
                    conclude the will of man to be free or necessary, <hi rend="italic"
                    >practically</hi> we must proceed <hi rend="italic">as if</hi> it were free;
                    since to act on that supposition accords with the facts of human life: whereas,
                    to act on the theory that we are under a necessity, would lead us against the
                    common practice of mankind, by which we are treated as responsible. Aristotle
                    indeed argues, that though the question be decided in the negative, it leaves
                    the relative nature of virtue and vice on the same footing; if our virtues may
                    still be imputed to us, so may our vices.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    rend="italic">voluntary</hi> nature both of virtue and vice, on the ground that
                    the <hi rend="italic">agγp,</hi> the principle of the action, is <hi

                    power. Thus, though the virtuous or vicious habits that we have formed may
                    dispose us .to a particular course of behaviour, so that, as being under their
                    influence, we cannot act otherwise, yet the actions so performed are voluntary;
                    because it was in our power to do or forbear that course of conduct which led to
                    the settled habit.</p>
                <p>The principle thus described as “in ourselves,” is, in Aristotle’s philosophy,
                    the <hi rend="italic">motive</hi> of our actions. It is that from which the <hi
                    rend="italic">effect</hi> on our conduct has originated; and it comes therefore
                    under that class of principles which we have described as constituting the
                    motive or efficient cause. The term “motive,” however, is sometimes transferred
                    in popular use to the object or end of an action;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Paley speaks of “private happiness” as “our

                    which being something external to ourselves, gives occasion to question the
                    voluntary nature of actions. But, in strictness, the <hi rend="italic">end</hi>
                    chosen by the agent or object at which he aims, is in itself no cause whatever

                <p>But the principles employed in the production of moral virtue are not the whole
                    of our internal nature, nor are they the highest principles. And Aristotle’s
                    theory implies the exertion of all, and, if there be a relative superiority<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193102386" xml:id="kp-eb0703-2386-0525"/> among them, a
                    preference of the higher. He assigns, accordingly, the greatest happiness to the
                    exertion of the intellectual principles. These he had already analyzed, in
                    tracing the connection of the intellect with virtue; and, dividing them
                    according to the classes of objects on which they are exercised, had assigned
                    the pre-eminence to Sop∕α, or philosophy, the science of the highest
                    objects.</p>
                <p>That a philosopher, living, as Aristotle did, amidst the disorder and misery
                    occasioned by the want of a true and practical religion, should have sought for
                    a perfection of happiness out of the troubled scene in which moral virtue is
                    disciplined, ought not to excite our wonder. The calm regions of philosophical
                    contemplation— <hi rend="italic">sapientum</hi><hi rend="italic">templa
                    serena</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> presented a natural refuge to the anxious
                    mind, eager to realize its own abstractions in some perfect form of human life.
                    There, those principles which his theory had sketched, appeared to hold without
                    exception; and those uncertainties and limitations which elsewhere attended
                    their operation, either to vanish or to be greatly diminished. It was a search,
                    indeed, after that happiness which revelation has made known to us,—a happiness
                    out of our present sphere of exertion and duty,—in which man might obtain the
                    full end or consummate good of his being. Aristotle himself describes the
                    pursuit of this ulterior happiness in terms indicative of this; as an
                    immortalizing of our nature; as a living according to what is divine in man; as
                    what renders a man most dear to the Divinity, most god-like.<note

                    intellect,—-he determined the excellence of human happiness from a view of the

                    happiness as men, as compound beings consisting of passions and intellect, and
                    living in an evil world, results. No philosophy but that of Aristotle has
                    maintained this proposition. Plato would lead his followers into the indolent
                    reveries of mysticism; the Stoics would reduce theirs to indifference about
                    human things; the Epicureans would absorb theirs in the fulness of present
                    delights; Cicero would degrade the higher employment of the soul in the
                    contemplative life below the ordinary moral duties, confounding the <hi
                    rend="italic">dignity</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">indispensableness</hi> of
                    an employment. But Aristotle directs us to pursue that happiness which is beyond
                    our attainment as compound beings, at the same time whilst we actively exert
                    ourselves in the discharge of those duties which belong to us as men.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Politics.</hi></p>
                <p>The observed inefficiency of ethical precepts in themselves to produce morality
                    in the lives of men, and the consequent appeal to some external sanction for
                    their enforcement, led to such works among the ancients as the Politics of
                    Aristotle. The Christian observes the same fact, and draws from it a strong
                    argument for the necessity of a divine revelation. Aristotle and other Greek
                    philosophers looked to the influence of education directed by civil laws and
                    institutions, and to the rewards and punishments of civil government, as the
                    great instruments for bringing mankind to that course of action in which their
                    real interest consisted.</p>
                <p>Aristotle was induced to ascribe this moral force to the law of the state,
                    through the current notion of ancient philosophy, which confounded moral and
                    political good. The good of man as an individual was conceived perfectly
                    coincident with his good as a member of society; and the science of politics,
                    therefore, was supposed to include under it that of ethics. Had not these
                    philosophers been misled by the abstract terms “good” and “expedient,” they
                    could hardly have thus blended together the heterogeneous objects of moral and
                    political science. They would have seen that the social union is inadequate to
                    the promotion of that good of man which results from his internal nature, and
                    that it could reach no further than to the protection of the individual from
                    external aggression on his person and property, and allowing him the
                    unobstructed exercise of his virtue. “Civil government,” savs Bishop Butler, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> m</hi> can by no means take cognizance· of every work which
                    is good or evil; many things are done in secret, the authors unknown to it, and
                    often the things themselves; then it cannot so much consider actions under the
                    view of their being <hi rend="italic">morally</hi> good or evil, as under the
                    view of their being mischievous or beneficial to society; nor can it in anywise
                    execute <hi rend="italic">judgment</hi> in rewarding what is <hi rend="italic"
                    >good,</hi> as it can, and ought, and does, in punishing what is <hi
                    rend="italic">evil.”</hi></p>
                <p>In consequence of this mistaken view of the end of the social union, the ancient
                    political philosophy was not a system of jurisprudence so much as a speculation
                    concerning the most perfect form of government,—theories of social happiness,
                    rather than the principles of laws by which the relative rights of men might be
                    maintained. Ingenious men amused themselves with fancying how society might be
                    modelled, so as to exhibit that ideal optimism which they had pictured to
                    themselves; instead of attending to the real phenomena of human life, and
                    deducing from them the right administration of society under its actually
                    existing forms.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Draco,

                <p>Aristotle, in common with other Greek philosophers, constructed a theory of
                    politics on this delusive principle. Proposing to himself the perfect polity, as
                    that in which the virtue and happiness of the man and the citizen exactly
                    coincide, he proceeds to sketch out the form of it, and thus to obtain an
                    outline of the institutions on which his ethical system must practically depend
                    for its support. But he was not, like other philosophers, so fascinated by
                    theory as to overlook the practical nature of the science. He complains of his
                    predecessors, that however well they might have treated the subject in other
                    respects, thcy had at least failed in the useful. They had contented themselves
                    with devising forms of polity which could only be effected with a concurrence of
                    every favourable circumstance, whereas the practical usefulness of the science
                    required the delivery of principles applicable to the improvement and security
                    of existing governments. We know, indeed, from the titles of other works on
                    politics which he is said to have written, <hi rend="italic">the Polities of One

                    exhausted in the theory of a perfect polity. The observations, too, on justice
                    and on civil policy, contained in his Ethics and Rhetoric, are proofs of the
                    practical views with which he contemplated the subject: and even in the work now
                    before us, which developes his professed theory of politics, the substance of
                    the inquiry is, sound and enlightened instructions of policy, drawn from
                    experience of human nature, and applicable to all times and circumstances. From
                    its connection with his .Ethics, it was intended in fact to be applied by each
                    individual in the practical business of education. He wished the individual to
                    obtain by means of it that scientific knowledge of the effects of institution
                    and discipline on the human character, which might assist him in the treatment
                    of the particular cases of his own actual experience.<note anchored="true"

                    completely with his Ethics, the object of which was, as before stated (p.

                    viewed in his social capacity, at its best estate, and unimpeded by external
                    obstacles, may be conceived to tend. It is a view of the end or <hi
                    rend="italic">πλoς</hi> in his political system, corresponding to his account of
                    the chief good in his Ethics. He arrives at it by the same train of thought
                    which led him to his account of the chief good. He considered, first, that man,
                    independently of any calculations of expediency, was naturally a political
                    animal;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Polit <hi
                    rend="italic">.</hi> i. 2, iii. <hi rend="italic">6.</hi></p></note> as in his
                    Ethics he assumes that man is endued by nature with active principles tending to
                    his own good. He admits that expediency is instrumental in cementing the union
                    among men, but does not rest society on this principle; wisely judging that man
                    is induced originally to associate with man by various internal principles of
                    his nature, and not simply by motives derived from reflection on his wants,
                    which last are in truth only secondary causes, and auxiliary to the former, in
                    like manner as the principle of self-love is auxiliary to the natural affections
                    on which virtue is founded. As, then, in his Ethics he went on to inquire what
                    principle rendered actions perfect, exhibiting them attaining the end for which
                    nature had constituted the affections, and as this principle formed the chief
                    good of his ethical system, so in his Politics he carries on his view of the
                    social nature of man to the point where the union to which it tends appears
                    self-sufficient and perfect. The mode in which the social principles might be
                    found to operate in this ultimate case would present the perfection of social
                    virtue; and from this specimen of social virtue would be deducible, right forms
                    of government, institutions, and laws, just as the several rules of right moral
                    conduct are drawn from the whole moral nature of man contemplated in its
                    perfection.</p>
                <p>To put ourselves, accordingly, into that posture of mind in which Aristotle
                    appears to have contemplated the subject, we must suppose the case of a society
                    analogous to that of an individual. The analogy between the principles of the
                    heart, as a constitution or system of related principles tending to a common
                    end, and the elements of a political community, could not but be familiar to the
                    mind of a disciple of Plato, who delighted in drawing his outlines of moral
                    virtue from the imagery of social life. But Aristotle, though sometimes
                    imitating the beautiful language of Plato in his ethical descriptions, has
                    inverted the analogy, and framed his representation of a perfect society after
                    the resemblance of the internal constitution of the heart. We must imagine,
                    then, the various members of a community, when brought to the standard of
                    perfection implied in the notion of a perfect constitution, all obtaining their
                    respective dues in a manner analogous to the due moderation of the affections in
                    the virtuous character. A “mean” is to be attained in the one case as in the
                    other.</p>
                <p>Agreeably to this view of his mode of speculation on the subject, Aristotle
                    describes the perfect polity as a mixture of oligarchy and democracy, as a state
                    which appears both these forms of government, and neither of them; in which no
                    one of the component elements of society has a preponderance, but the claims of
                    freedom, of wealth, and of virtue,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Nobility, according to Aristotle, is “ancient wealth and
                    virtue or “the virtue and wealth of ancestors and does not, in his view, there
                    ore, form a distinct head of claims. According to Laertius, he wrote an express

                    duly considered. A form of government which is thus a “mean” throughout,
                    Aristotle designates by the name of “Polity;” appropriating to it the general
                    name, and thus distinguishing it as the perfect form, the proper constitution of
                    a σoλ∕ς, or city,—a city being the “end” of the social union.</p>
                <p>If, indeed, not mere protection from mutual injury, but the promotion of virtue,
                    were the object of the social union, as Aristotle contends, it must be allowed
                    that that only can be a perfect constitution of society in which the standard of
                    political rights is the same with that of moral right. In this ultimate perfect
                    form, upon such a supposition, the science of politics becomes absorbed in that
                    of ethics. The community in this case acts as the dispenser of the laws of
                    morality; and its honours and its penalties are but the channels through which
                    virtue works its own rewards of happiness, and vice its own punishments of
                    misery.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bishop Butler’s

                    contend, on the other hand, to intrude on a province far beyond that of
                    political science. Schemes for the moral perfection of society belong to the
                    wisdom of a providence more than human, working good out of evil, and, from a
                    boundless survey of all the relations of things, accomplishing important results
                    by means apparently incompetent. Man, in his designs of moral good, has only to
                    attend closely to the mechanism placed under his observation—to use the
                    appointed means—to cultivate given powers—to provide against foreseen
                    consequences—and then trust that the happiness, which must surely be the end of
                    the whole under a wise and good Providence, will be the result of his
                    well-ordered exertions. Thus, it is manifest to our view, that from the
                    ungoverned passions of men evil will ensue. Society, therefore, may lawfully be
                    employed as an instrument for preventing this misery, so far as external means
                    can reach it; and so far, too, it may encourage virtue, and indirectly promote
                    human happiness.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    aim of its constitution, and it bewilders itself with theories, no one of which
                    will in any probability realize its plausible expectations; whilst, on the
                    contrary, some evil must certainly ensue from artificial attempts on so large a
                    scale. For it is impossible, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193102412"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-2412-0527"/>as Aristotle himself well observes, but that,

                    however, is justifiable in point of consistency here, with the rest of his
                    philosophy. Excluding from the course of nature a providence distinct from
                    nature itself, he proceeded, according to his system, to attribute an internal
                    self-adjusting power to society considered as an effect of nature. The maxim,
                    that“Nature does nothing in vain,” is at the base of his moral and political
                    philosophy, as well as of his physical. The perfect polity is an illustration of
                    this maxim. It is the perfecting of the self-provisions of nature in the human
                    species.</p>
                <p>The real excellence, however, of Aristotle’s theory of the perfect polity
                    consists in this, that if we admit a Divine Providence, to whose foresight we
                    ascribe the final cause or ultimate tendency of the social union, it is a
                    negative description of the policy which should be pursued in every
                    well-constituted state. It points out the manner in which the public welfare
                    must be sought; that is, by not making any one of the objects commonly pursued
                    in the political world the express object of pursuit to the community. On the
                    hypothesis, that the happiness of the world is the care of Him who ordered it,
                    every soejety should be so constituted as that no appointment of Providence be
                    overlooked, but every part of the social machinery be brought into action. The
                    love of conquest, for instance, will not be the aim of such a state. Such a
                    policy would employ its military resources only, to the exclusion of its other
                    materials of happiness. Aristotle particularly points out this in the instance
                    of Lacedemon, whose whole policy was framed for war; whereas, as he observes, a
                    state should be adapted for living well in peace, and enjoying that repose which
                    is the end of its engaging in war.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> ii. cap, 9, vii. cap.
                    14.</p></note> Nor, again, will the mere accumulation of wealth be the express
                    aim of the state in its whole policy. Such a ruling principle would tend to
                    degrade the great mass of the population, and to undo the very connection itself
                    between the members of the community, by pushing the boundaries between the rich
                    and poor to the extremes of opulence and pauperism; of which condition of things
                    the natural result is the tyranny of an oligarchy. Lastly, if even liberty is
                    made the exclusive aim of state policy, unhappiness is the sure result. Whilst
                    the members of the community grasp at an unrestrained licentiousness, they
                    disregard the various gradations of society, by which the sphere of human duties
                    is enlarged, and the greatest securities against violations of liberty are
                    provided; and thus a wild democracy usurps the place of a just polity. Now,
                    Aristotle’s theory excludes all such gross schemes of policy. It admits only the
                    general pursuit of the public welfare; which, like the private happiness
                    sketched in his Ethics, is not to be made a <hi rend="italic">distinct</hi>
                    object under any particular form, but must be the <hi rend="italic">general</hi>
                    pursuit of the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> organization of the society; as
                    private happiness is the <hi rend="italic">result</hi> of the general regulation
                    of all the moral principles. It is true that he supposes a society to constitute
                    itself in order to its own moral happiness; and herein is the defect of his
                    theory. But if it be considered that this was-a necessary substitute in his
                    system for a Divine Providence, his theory, it will be concluded, did not imply
                    that the individual members of the community should expressly propose to
                    themselves, as their object of pursuit, that happiness to which the social
                    system itself should tend. It was evidently to be brought about by that
                    mysterious agency which, from not admitting a real Providence, he was compelled
                    to ascribe to nature.</p>
                <p>This is further illustrated in his description of the three right forms of
                    government, and the three improper or deviations from the former. He admits that
                    the public welfare may be promoted under other forms—under a monarchy or an
                    aristocracy, as well as under “a polity.” These three forms are indeed
                    coincident in principle, according to Aristotle, being variations produced by
                    differences in the character of the people among whom they arise.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>
                    iii. cap. 17.</p></note> The perfect “polity” presupposes an equality among the
                    members of the society,—that all are capable in turn of governing, as well as of
                    being governed. But there may in some cases be marked differences between a
                    family, or an individual, or a class of individuals, and the bulk of the people;
                    and in these cases the rule of justice requires that there should exist in the
                    first a monarchy, in the latter an aristocracy. So far, indeed, does Aristotle
                    carry this principle as to say, that any single person eminent in worth above
                    the rest of the community, as one of a more divine nature, ought to have entire
                    obedience from the rest, and to be perpetual sovereign.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid,</hi> iii cap. 13, p.
                    355, Du Vai.</p></note> The three forms, then, of monarchy, aristocracy, and
                    polity, are right; because, being founded on the relative merit of the members
                    of each society, and the standard of merit being virtue, the rule of justice is
                    maintained in them. The public good follows, therefore, not from the ascendancy
                    of this or that principle of policy in the government in each case, but from a
                    due regard to all the subsisting relations in the state. But in the
                    corresponding perversions of these right polities—in a tyranny, an oligarchy,
                    and a democracy—particular principles prevail, and particular interests,
                    accordingly, are consulted, to the violation of justice and the sacrifice of
                    public good.</p>
                <p>Aristotle appears the only political theorist among the ancients who never lost
                    sight of the moral nature of man in his speculations. The systems of other
                    theorists, as Plato, Phaleas of Chalcedon, Hippodamus of Miletus, and the
                    polities of Lacedemon, Crete, and Carthage, for the most part treated human
                    society merely as a physical mass, capable of being moulded into particular
                    forms by the mechanism of external circumstances. Aristotle, on the contrary,
                    lays the chief stress on the force of “customs, philosophy, and laws,”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Polit. ii. cap. 3.</p></note>
                    for producing the best constitution of society. Still as, in his Ethics, in
                    order to the development of his theory of the chief good of man, he supposes a
                    condition of human life adequate to the exercise of the moral powers; so, in his
                    Politics, he supposes a concurrence of circumstances favourable to the existence
                    of the perfect polity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Ibid. vii. cap. 1, 12.</p></note> In this theory, as in that, there must be
                    no impediment from without to the operation of the principles. Here, as in the
                    Ethics, the production of the desired effect is the combination of three
                    principles— nature, custom, reason.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Ibid. vii. cap. 13.</p></note> Therefore, also, as there
                    must be certain elements of virtue in the heart in order to the moral
                    improvement of an individual, so there must be the proper elements of the
                    perfect social life in the community where the perfect polity is to be reared.
                    Then, upon these natural principles of the bead and heart, a course of public
                    education is to proceed, disciplining the members by custom and by reason to the
                    perfection of the social character, in a manner analogous to the discipline of
                    the private moral character.</p>
                <p>We find the same fundamental agreement with the moral<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193102425" xml:id="kp-eb0703-2425-0528"/> system of the Ethics, in the
                    method of education proposed by Aristotle for the citizens of his polity. The
                    maturity of the intellectual powers is here also to be the end to which the
                    system tends. The members of the community are to be trained so as to be capable
                    of enjoying the leisure and repose of a peaceful state. This they are to regard
                    as their ultimate proper sphere of happiness, whilst at the same time they are
                    disciplined to the virtues of that active life by which alone the permanence of
                    their tranquillity can be secured. It is obvious how this harmonizes with the
                    doctrine of the Ethics, which sets forth the happiness of the theoretic life as
                    the highest bliss of our nature, but not independently of the practical duties
                    of common life. For thus Aristotle directs the course through which the young
                    must pass,—to commence with the body, then to proceed to the disposition of the
                    heart, and to end with the intellect; the inferior principles being disciplined
                    in subordination to, and with reference to the higher. Even the sports of
                    childhood were not neglected by him in this scale of education; and he would
                    further provide for the best bodily constitution of the citizen, by regulating
                    the period of marriages with a view to a healthy offspring, and the care of the
                    mothers during pregnancy. Here, indeed, we are shocked at finding in such an

                    of the infirmity of a philosophy which substitutes an intrinsic agency in
                    nature, for the counsels of an active and intelligent Being working on nature;
                    for, according to such a philosophy, every thing adverse to the perfection of
                    nature is a stumbling block. On the hypothesis of a Providence, the good and the
                    evil may be contemplated with equal assurance that “the best” will in the end
                    prevail. In the former case human reason removes, suppresses, and destroys; in
                    the other it moderates, counteracts, and overrules, doing nothing with rash
                    violence, but gently conspiring with the appointed course of things, in opening
                    a way for good out of the evil. In Aristotle, the immoralities here noticed are,
                    moreover, at direct variance with the whole spirit of his moral philosophy.</p>
                <p>Again, the same moral complexion characterizes both the public and private
                    discipline of the philosopher. The honourable, <hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                    to</hi> %αλov, predominates over both. By this standard every institution,
                    whether of bodily or mental exercise, was to be regulated. No illiberal arts,
                    such as required manual rather than intellectual skill, were to be taught; nor
                    even were the liberal sciences to be pursued excessively, or with exclusive
                    devotion to any particular ones, or with mercenary views; the occupation of
                    leisure being the end proposed by the system of education. What was useful or
                    necessary was to be learned, but in subserviency to the honourable; and the
                    honourable rather than the useful or necessary.<note anchored="true"

                    14.</p></note> Hence the stress laid by Aristotle on the arts of painting and
                    music. It was. in the result, a general cultivation of the mind by literature
                    combined with moral discipline, and not the storing it with particular sciences,
                    to which his system of education was directed. He saw that the tendency of
                    particular studies was evidently to contract the mental powers to that
                    particular range of vision to which they were confined; whereas he sought rather
                    to impart a largeness and masculine strength to the understanding, commensurate
                    with the varied demands of the world in which human life is cast. It was what we
                    should express by the education of the accomplished gentleman,—of one who,
                    exempt from the drudgery of life, and having his actions freely at his own
                    disposal, might be qualified for the highest functions to which nature has
                    destined man in forming him a moral and social being. For it should be observed,
                    that Aristotle throughout supposes an entire immunity from all servile
                    employments, both to the happy man and the happy citizen.<note anchored="true"

                    physically incapable, either of the happiness of moral beings, or of that of
                    social life. Persons so imperfectly constituted he conceived to be wholly
                    dependent on others, and to be by nature <hi rend="italic">relative</hi> beings
                    or slaves, their proper nature being comprized in this relationship of

                    the menial offices; whilst others more gifted by nature enjoyed leisure for the
                    proper duties of man, in the various relations of a moral and social being.<note

                <p>The condition of slavery was thus, we perceive, rested by Aristotle on abstract
                    philosophical grounds. He viewed it as an institution of nature; differing in
                    this from other philosophers, and from the popular notion of his own countrymen,
                    who either founded it on the right of conquest, or an assumed original
                    difference between Greek and Barbarian. This was a far more liberal view of the
                    subject than that which prevailed generally; since it implied, that no one had a
                    right to retain another as his slave when the individual was not thus physically
                    dependent on others. Every one had a right to be free, who was capable of
                    enjoying freedom in the performance of the duties for which man in his
                    perfection was constituted. This doctrine further imposed on the master a strict
                    moral attention to his slave. The slave was thrown on him not only for support,
                    but for direction in his duties.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>That religion should have formed no part of the actual business of education in
                    his system, was further consistent with his Ethics. The moral %αλov terminated
                    in the perfect fulfilment of all those relations in which man was placed as a
                    being of this world. It was heightened by the consideration, that gods might
                    delight in looking down on such perfection, and that in its ultimate state it
                    might resemble the excellence of divinity. But it did not strike its roots into
                    religion: nor did the καλ&lt;w of social life. The accomplished citizen might be
                    taught to contemplate himself in the thoughtful activity of a philosophical
                    leisure, as holding a dignified station among men, analogous to the divine

                    taught between his social virtues and his religious system. The religious
                    colouring was only the borrowed light of philosophy. All active religion was
                    consigned to the instrumentality of a particular body of men—the priests. The
                    obligatory force of religion was recognized; but being lodged in an external
                    establishment, as its depository and proper sanctuary, reverence was sought for
                    it by outward bonds of respect, by <pb break="no" facs="nls:193102438"

                    intrusted, and the splendour of public spectacles connected with it. Aristotle,
                    accordingly, treats the subject merely as one of policy. He observes, that no
                    one of the rank of a mechanic or peasant should be appointed a priest, since it
                    was proper that the gods should be honoured by the citizens; and he points out
                    the importance of the religious character to the absolute sovereign of a state,
                    in order to the obedience of the subject.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Aristotle’s account of his theoretic polity leaves off abruptly at the end of the
                    8th book; and the treatise is thus, as now extant, an imperfect development of
                    his peculiar views. But the theory of the perfect polity is only a part of the
                    very valuable materials of the <hi rend="italic">Politics.</hi> The work
                    embraces a wide survey of the social nature of man. Throughout, indeed, it may
                    be studied as elements of the philosophy of history. It lays open the principles
                    of preservation and decay inherent in the different constitutions, and points
                    out the common principles, on which the maintenance of civil order, under any
                    form whatever, must essentially depend.</p>
                <p>Nor has the science of political economy been altogether overlooked by Aristotle.
                    Incidental remarks on points belonging to the inquiries of the economist occur
                    in his Politics. The nature of money, and of the wealth to which the
                    introduction of money has given rise, particularly attracted his attention. It
                    may suffice to show how accurately he has philosophized on this subject, to
                    observe, that he has traced the origin of money to its convenience as a medium
                    of exchange; and hence deduced its value as consisting in its power of
                    representing <hi rend="italic">demand.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>On the whole, justly to appreciate the labours of Aristotle in political science,
                    we should compare them with the elaborate and eloquent work of Plato on the same
                    Subject—the celebrated <hi rend="italic">Republic.</hi> Aristotle evidently had
                    this work before him in the composition of his own, and in several places has
                    made express allusions to it. In fact, his two treatises of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nicoachean Ethics</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Politics,</hi>
                    are together a refutation of the erroneous doctrines in moral and political
                    philosophy contained in Plato’s political speculations. It is but a small
                    portion of Plato’s <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> which strictly belongs to
                    politics; the bulk of it being devoted to moral and metaphysical discussions.
                    Aristotle’s more exact philosophy discriminates the subjects heterogeneously
                    blended in that episodic work. Aristotle has taken all that is excellent in the
                    treatises of Plato into his own treatises, but at the same time has shown his
                    own originality of thought in the correction and enlargement, as well as the
                    systematic arrangement, of the principles there diffusely delivered. He candidly
                    acknowledges that every thing that Socrates says, has in it “a vastness, and an
                    exquisiteness, and an originality, and a penetration but modestly asserts for
                    himself a right of discussing the doctrines, on the ground that <hi

                    difficult.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>Plato’s theory was metaphysical throughout. That oneness which he sought to
                    establish in his perfect republic was an abstract unity, the realizing of which
                    constituted in his view the best polity, as in his Ethics the realizing of the
                    abstract one “idea” of good constituted the morality of actions. Thus his
                    governors are philosophers, and his virtue is wisdom. A character, on the other
                    hand, decidedly practical, pervades the moral and political disquisitions of
                    Aristotle. They are immediately adapted to the actual need of man. They have
                    not, on this very ac- ’ count, that peculiar charm which belongs to Plato’s
                    writings. The. speculative perfection shadowed out by Plato imparts an
                    imaginative air to his disputations, and interests the feelings, whilst we read,
                    amidst the reluctance of our judgment. And thus his works tend to a practical
                    effect, independently of, and in opposition to, their real speculative
                    character. But Aristotle, throughout intent on the business of human life,
                    forbears to seize the imagination with romantic pictures of excellence, either
                    in man individually or in society. He points out such happiness as is attainable
                    by man, in that condition of the world in which man has been placed; or at least
                    to which human endeavours may reasonably be directed. His discussions on moral
                    subjects are accurate observations, and powerful reasonings, applied to things
                    as they are. But this character in them renders them of more general use than
                    Plato’s speculations. The man of genius and of sensibility would perhaps feel a
                    stronger stimulant to moral and social energies from the study of the animated
                    pages of the <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but the
                    generality of mankind would undoubtedly be more assisted in the work required of
                    them from the constitution of their nature, by the real principles of human
                    conduct delivered in the unambitious philosophy of Aristotle’s Ethics and
                    Politics.</p>

                <p>From the review which we have taken of the extant writings of Aristotle, it would
                    appear that the great object of the philosopher was to discipline the mind by ä
                    deep and extensive course of literature. The various inquiries embraced in those
                    writings,—the unwearied research into subjects, the most repulsive from their
                    abstruseness, or the most interesting from their connection with the feelings
                    and actions of man,—the richness of illustration from the volumes of ancient
                    genius and observation of mankind with which they abound,—are so many proofs of
                    the noble object proposed in his philosophy. It may be fully concluded, that it
                    was not the mere sophist of former days, or the disputant on any given question,
                    that Aristotle aimed to accomplish; but the really wise man; by cultivating all
                    the moral and intellectual powers of the soul; in order that the great moral of
                    the whole—- the good towards which the constitution of nature tends —might be
                    realized in each individual man so instructed and disciplined. Agreeably to this
                    view of his philosophy îs the answer attributed to him, when, on being asked
                    what advantage had accrued to him from philosophy, he replied, “To do without
                    constraint what some do through the fear of the laws.”<note anchored="true"

                    Mentor, Ariston, Themistagoras, Philoxenus; besides a collection entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Epistles of the Selymbrians.</hi> We have already noticed a hymn
                    in praise of the virtues of his friend Hermeias, which formed matter of
                    accusation against him on the ground of impiety. This hymn has been preserved by
                    Diogenes Laertius. It consists of twenty-three lyric verses, in the manner and
                    with something of the spirit of Pindar; celebrating Hermeias among the heroes
                    who had sacrificed their lives for the cause of virtue. His biographer has also
                    preserved tfie four lines inscribed by him on the statue of Hermeias erected at
                    Delphi. His poetical talent was further displayed in verses addressed to
                    Democritus, and in the composition of an elegy; of both of which poems the first
                    lines are given by Laertius. The titles of various other philosophical works
                    occur also in the catalogue of his writings. So laborious and so diversified
                    were the literary pursuits of this great philosopher. These were works, too,
                    written, we must remember, not by a sequestered individual enjoying the privacy
                    of a privileged leisure, like that of the priests of Egypt, but amidst the
                    agitation and troubles of Grecian politics, and in the courts of princes. We may
                    well, therefore, wonder at the abstractedness of mind, the single-hearted zeal
                    of philosophy, which thus steadily pursued its course, creating its own leisure,
                    and keeping the stillness of its own thoughts. Probably, indeed, such writings
                    as those of Aristotle could hardly have been produced, except with a concurrence
                    of the opposite circumstances observed in his case. They imply at once the man
                    of the world and the retired student,—ample opportunities for the contemplation
                    of human nature in all the various relations of life, —familiarity with the
                    thoughts of others by reading and conversation,—as well as intense private
                    meditation—that communing with a man’s own heart, which alone can extort the
                    deep secrets of moral and metaphysical truth.</p>
                <p>The style of his writings bears the impress of his devotion to the real business
                    of philosophy. The excellence of his style is, we believe, the last thing to
                    attract the notice of his readers; and yet, as a specimen of pure Greek, it is
                    found, when examined, to stand almost unrivalled. The words are all selected
                    from the common idiom of the language, but they are employed with the utmost
                    propriety; and by their collocation are made further subservient to the
                    perspicuity and force of his meaning. There is nothing superfluous, nothing
                    intrusive, in his expressions; but the very ornaments add to the terseness of
                    the style. The metaphors and illustrations employed are apt and striking
                    analogies, availing as arguments, whilst by their simplicity they familiarize
                    the truth conveyed to the mind. That these excellencies should escape the notice
                    of the reader whilst he is engaged in the matter itself of the author, is a
                    proof of the strict adaptation of the style to the matter. We can imagine, that
                    to the Greek reader nothing could have been easier than to comprize the meaning
                    of the philosopher. To the modern reader, of course, the necessity of studying
                    the language gives an apparent hardness to expressions, whose propriety depends
                    on an accurate perception of the genius of the language. Thus, what was a
                    facility to the ancient reader, is a difficulty to the modern, until the modern,
                    by study of the language, has brought himself as much as possible into the
                    situation of the ancient. This observation will be illustrated by a comparison
                    of the style of Plato with that of Aristotle. Plato’s style, undulating with
                    copiousness of diction, is more attractive to the modern reader; his meaning is
                    more readily apprehended at the first glance, by the number of expressions which
                    he crowds on a point, and their accumulated force of explanation. But in
                    Aristotle, if we miss the force of a term or a particle,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is surprising that Brucker <hi
                    rend="italic">(Hist. Cr. Phil.</hi> vol. i. p. 803) could speak of Aristotle’s
                    use of the particles as “singular,” and the construction of his sentences as
                    unusual. The perfect idiom of the language seems, on the contrary, strictly and
                    beautifully observed</p></note> or overlook the collocation of the words, we
                    shall often entirely pervert his meaning.</p>
                <p>There are, however, passages in which Aristotle departs from his usual
                    ccnciseness, and approaches towards the eloquence of Plato. The concluding
                    chapters of his <hi rend="italic">Ni.</hi><hi rend="italic">comachean
                    Ethics</hi> may here be particularly pointed out; or a part of his ninth book of
                    that treatise, in which, evidently imitating Plato, he compares the tumult of
                    uncontrolled passions to the disturbance of civil sedition. There is a dignity
                    and a pathos in these passages, controlled by the general character of severe
                    precision belonging to his style, and admirably harmonizing with it.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, indeed, his style is chargeable with too strict a conciseness, as well
                    as, on the other hand, with too great prolixity. Both these opposite faults are
                    in him the same in principle; resulting from extreme accuracy,—an excess in
                    writing, which he has himself compared to that illiberality remarked in too
                    close an attention to trifles in contracts.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Nor is it meant to be denied that there is a considerable obscurity in the
                    writings of Aristotle: but it is important to distinguish this obscurity from
                    that of mere style. It is an effect of the peculiar design with which he appears
                    to have composed his philosophical works. They are evidently for the most part
                    outlines for the direction of the philosopher himself and his disciples in their
                    disputations —notices of points of inquiry rather than full discussions of them.
                    This is particularly observable in the treatises of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metaphysics,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Nicoachean Ethics,</hi> and the <hi

                    were not published in his lifetime, and that they thus constantly remained by
                    him to receive successive improvements which his further observation had
                    suggested. This may account for the abruptness in those treatises. In our
                    progress through them, we come to discussions, which we had not been led to
                    expect by any thing previous in the work. The seventh book of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ethics,</hi> for instance, appears to have been an after-thought;
                    and so also the eighth and ninth of the same treatise. The work might have been
                    regarded as complete in itself without them. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metaphysics,</hi> indeed, we can hardly judge what was the exact plan of the
                    author in the arrangement of the work, since it has descended to us in an
                    imperfect, irregular form. But there are the same marks in it of successive
                    additions from the author.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>His method of discussion is conformable with the principles proposed in his
                    Dialectic. It is throughout a sifting of the opinions and questions belonging to
                    the subject of inquiry, by examining each in its several points of view, and
                    showing the consequences involved in it. Accordingly, generally before he states
                    his own immediate doctrine, he considers what may be urged on both sides of the
                    question, stating the objections strongly and fairly, and giving the most candid
                    construction to the views of his predecessors.<note anchored="true"

                    passing on, having just glanced at them; at other times he devotes several
                    sentences to their explanation. This, which is his method in parts of his
                    system, is only a specimen of what is the collective result of the whole. His
                    philosophy, dialectically viewed, is an analysis of the theories proposed by the
                    philosophers who had preceded him. ’ 1t is consistently with this, that he

                    vi. 5). “It is a practice with us all,” he observes <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Coelo,</hi> ii. 13, p. 4G7), “to pursue an inquiry, not as it belongs to the

                    a thing implied in the classifications of language; and afterwards inquires into

                    acknowledged principles of physics or philosophy in general.</p>
                <p>W ιth respect to the originality of his writings, there can be no doubt that he
                    derived important aid from the labours of his predecessors, and especially from
                    those of Plato. An accurate examination of his writings will convince the
                    reader, that they are the productions of one who had deeply drunk of the
                    fountain of Plato’s inspiration. But they show at the same time such a disciple
                    as we may suppose the spirit of Plato would have delighted in; one who cherished
                    the authority of the preceptor, and yet had the courage to love the truth still

                    ideas,—∙ the origin of the universe,—and the immortality of the soul. He has
                    been charged, indeed, with invidious opposition to Plato, with corruption and
                    misrepresentation of the tenets of his predecessors in philosophy. Jewish
