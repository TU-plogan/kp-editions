                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                    rend="smallcaps">Michaud d’,</hi> a French engineer and military writer of
                    eminence, and memorable as the inventor of the floating batteries employed
                    against Gibraltar, was born at Pontarlier in the year 1733. He was originally
                    destined for the church; ‘but, instead of em-plying himself in the studies
                    suited to that profession, he became wholly engrossed with plans of
                    fortifications, and was at length admitted, with the consent of his parents,
                    into the corps of engineers. He distinguished himself at several sieges during
                    the seven years’ war; and had acquired so much reputation by his professional
                    services and by his writings, that he was specially employed to assist in the
                    last grand effort made by France and Spain for the reduction of Gibraltar in
                    1782. It was about this period that he projected the famous floating batteries;
                    an invention which inspired the combined armies with the greatest hopes of
                    success, and which at first occasioned no small degree of alarm in the British
                    garrison. “The battering ships,” says Drinkwater, in his interesting account of
                    this memorable siege, “were ’ found to be no less formidable than they had been
                    represented. Our heaviest shells often rebounded from their tops, whilst the 32
                    pound shot seemed incapable of making any visible impression upon their hulls.
                    Frequently we flattered ourselves they were on fire; but no sooner did the smoke
                    appear than, with the most persevering intrepidity, men were observed applying
                    wa ter, from their engines within, to those places whence the smoke issued.” Of
                    the ultimate fate of these expensive and formidable engines of attack all
                    British readers must be sufficiently informed. Not one of the whole ten escaped
                    destruction from the bombs and red-hot balls poured upon them from the garrison.
                    Μ. d’Arçon, however, published a memoir to show that his batteries were wilfully
                    exposed to destruction through the envy and jealousy which the contrivance had
                    excited among the Spaniards; and this statement seems to have obtained the
                    general concurrence of his countrymen. But projectors do not readily admit umy
                    inadequacy in their schemes; nor will a vain-glorious people, who have been
                    foiled in war, ever ascribe their disgrace to the superior skill or constancy of
                    their enemy.</p>
                <p>Μ. d’Arçon appeared in the capacity of a general in the first years of the
                    Revolution; and, in particular, was employed in the invasion of Holland, where,
                    in 1793, he besieged and took several fortified places. He soon afterwards
                    withdrew or was driven from public life, and remained in retirement till 1799,
                    when he was made a member of the Conservative Senate by Buonaparte. He died the
                    following year, aged sixty-seven. He was a member of the Institute, and author
                    of the following works :—1, Reflexions d’un Ingénieur, en réponse à un
                    Tacticien, 1773, 12mo; 2, Correspondance sur l’Art de la Guerre, entre un
                    Colonel de Dragons et un Capitaine d’Infanteric, 1774, 8vo; 3, Défense d’un
                    Système de Guerre Nationale, &amp;c. 1779, 8vo; 4, Mémoires pour servir à
                    l’Histoire du Siège de Gibraltar, 1783, 8vo; 5, Considérations sur l’influence

                    government, and contains a sort of digest of all his observations and opinions
                    on military subjects.—See <hi rend="italic">Biographie Moderne,</hi> tome i.,
