                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">APPELLATION</label>, the name by which any thing is known or
                    distinguished when spoken of. Nothing can be more foreign to the original
                    meaning of many words and proper names than their present or vulgar
                    appellations; frequently owing to the history of those things being forgotten,
                    or an ignorance of the language in which they were expressed. Who, for example,
                    would dream that the legal proclamation called “0 yes,” was a proclamation
                    commanding the talkers to become hearers, being the French word <hi
                    rend="italic">Oyez,</hi> listen, retained in our courts ever since the law
                    pleadings were held in French? Or would any person suppose that the headland on
                    the French coast near Calais, called by our seamen Blackness, would be so titled
                    from its French name of <hi rend="italic">Blanc Nez,</hi> or the <hi
                    rend="italic">White Head-land?</hi></p>
                <p>King Henry the Eighth having taken the town of Boulogne in France, the gates of
                    which he brought to Hardes in Kent, where they are still remaining, the
                    flatterers of that reign highly magnified this action, which, Porto Bello like,
                    became a popular subject for signs; and the port or harbour of Boulogne, called
                    <hi rend="italic">Boulogne Mouth,</hi> was accordingly set up at a noted inn in
                    Holborn. The name of the inn long outliving the sign and fame of the conquest,
                    an ignorant painter, employed by a no less ignorant landlord to paint a new one,
                    represented it by a bull and a large gaping human mouth; answering to the vulgar
                    pronunciation of <hi rend="italic">bull and mouth.</hi> The same piece of
                    history gave being to the <hi rend="italic">bull and gate,</hi> originally meant
                    for Boulogne gate, and represented by an embattled gate or entrance into a
                    fortified town.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">barbed s pole</hi> has been the subject of many
                    conjectures; some conceiving it to have originated from the word <hi
                    rend="italic">poll</hi> or head, with several other conceits as farfetched and
                    as unmeaning; but the true intention of that party-coloured staff was to show
                    that the master of the shop practised surgery, and could breathe a vein as well
                    as mow a beard. The white band which encompasses the staff was meant to
                    represent the fillet thus elegantly twined about it.</p>
                <p>Nor were the <hi rend="italic">chequers,</hi> at this time a common sign of a
                    public house, less expressive,—being the representation of a kind of
                    draught-board called <hi rend="italic">tables,</hi> and showing that there that
                    game might be played. From their colour, which was red, and the similarity to a
                    lattice, it was corruptly called the <hi rend="italic">red lettuce,</hi> which
                    word is frequently used by ancient writers to signify an ale-house.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> has explained the sign of the <hi
                    rend="italic">bellsavage inn</hi> plausibly enough, in supposing it to have been
                    originally the figure of a beautiful female found in the woods, called in French
                    <hi rend="italic">la belle</hi><hi rend="italic">sauvage.</hi> But another
                    reason has since been assigned for that appellation, namely, that the inn was
                    once the property of Lady Arabella Savage, and familiarly called <hi
                    rend="italic">Bell Savages Inn,</hi> probably represented as at present, by a
                    bell and a savage or wild man, which was a rcbus for her name; rebuses being
                    much in fashion in the 16th century.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">three blue balls</hi> prefixed to the doors and windows of
                    pawnbrokers’ shops, by the vulgar humorously enough said to indicate that it is
                    two to one that the things pledged are never redeemed, were in reality the arms
                    of a set of merchants from Lombardy, who were the first that publicly lent money
                    on pledges. They dwelt together in a street, from them named Lombard Street, in
                    London, and also gave their name to another at Paris. The appellation of Lombard
                    was formerly all over Europe considered as synonymous with that of usurer.</p>
                <p>At the institution of yeomen of the guards, they used to wait at table on all
                    great solemnities, and were ranged near the buffets. This procured them the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">lnffe∙ tiers,</hi> not very unlike in sound to the jocular
                    appellation of <hi rend="italic">beef-eaters,</hi> now given them; though
                    probably it was rather the voluntary misnomer of some wit, than an accidental
                    corruption arising from ignorance of the French language.</p>
                <p>The opprobrious title of <hi rend="italic">bum bayliffe,</hi> so constantly
                    bestowed on the sheriff’s officers, is, according to Judge Blackstone, only the
                    corruption of <hi rend="italic">bound bayliffe,</hi> every sheriff’s officer
                    being obliged to enter into bonds and to give security for his good behaviour,
                    previous to his appointment. 1</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">cordwainer</hi> seems to have no relation to the occupation
                    it is meant to express, which is that of a shoemaker. But <hi rend="italic"
                    >cordonier,</hi> originally spelt <hi rend="italic">cordaunier,</hi> is the
                    French word for that trade; the best leather used for shoes coming originally
                    from Cordova in Spain.</p>
