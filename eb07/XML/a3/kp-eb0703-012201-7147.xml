                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">ANDREWS, <hi rend="smallcaps">James Pettit</hi></label>, a
                    late English historian and miscellaneous writer, was the younger son of Joseph
                    Andrews, Esq. of Shaw-house, near Newbury, Berks, where he was born in the year
                    1737. He was educated privately, and is said to have discovered an early taste
                    for literature and the fine arts. He joined the Berkshire militia when they were
                    first called out, being then about 18 or 19, and held the rank of lieutenant in
                    that regiment until it was disbanded. On the institution of the new system of
                    London police, he was appointed one of the commissioners for the district of
                    Queen’s Square and St Margaret’s, Westminster, and discharged the duties of that
                    office with great industry and integrity until his death, which took place at
                    his house in London, on the 6th of August 1797, in the 60th year of his age. He
                    married Miss Ann Penrose, daughter of the Rev. Mr Penrose, late rector of
                    Newbury, by whom he had two sons and a daughter. He seems to have possessed a
                    cheerful and social disposition, and enjoyed the conversation of a large circle
                    &gt;of literary acquaintance, who frequently met at his house and experienced
                    his hospitality.</p>
                <p>Mr Andrews appears to have devoted a considerable portion of his time to literary
                    pursuits; and he is the author of several works which are not undeserving of
                    notice. The first publication upon which we find him employed is an edition of
                    the poems of his friend and relation Penrose, in 1781; to which he prefixed an
                    introduction, containing a short account of the life and character of the
                    author. His first original production, so far as we have been able to ascertain,
                    was a pamphlet in behalf of the chimneysweepers’ apprentices in 1788, which is
                    said to have led to the act of parliament passed not long afterwards for the
                    purpose of ameliorating the condition of that unfortunate class of beings. In
                    1789 he published <hi rend="italic">Anecdotes, Ancient and Modern,</hi> 8vo, a
                    work of pleasantry, in the composition of which he acknowledged having received
                    assistance from the late lauréat Mr Pye, the facetious antiquary Captain Grose,
                    and others. To this volume he added a Supplement in 1790.</p>
                <p>The most extensive work undertaken by Mr Andrews was his <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of Great Britain, connected with the Chronology of Europe; with
                    Notes,</hi> &amp;c. The first volume, which commences with Caesar’s invasion,
                    and ends with the deposition and death of Richard II., was published in 1794 in
                    4to. A second volume, in which the history is continued from the deposition and
                    death of Richard H∙tθ the accession of Edward VI., appeared in 1795. The plan of
                    this work is new, and in some respects singular; a certain portion of the
                    history of England is given on one page, and a corresponding portion of the
                    contemporaneous history of Europe on the one opposite. The notes consist oţ a
                    variety of curious and amusing particulars, not immediately connected with the
                    main story. Appendixes are also added at proper intervals, containing an account
                    of the state of literature, science, religion, government, man <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193097160" xml:id="kp-eb0703-7160-0123"/>ners, <hi rend="italic"
                    >&amp;c.</hi> at different periods. The author, however, did not live to
                    complete this curious and extensive work, no more of it having appeared than the
                    two volumes above mentioned. In 1796 he published a continuation of Henry’s <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Britain,</hi> in one volume 4to and two volumes
                    8vo.</p>
                <p>The other productions of this author are, <hi rend="italic">An Account of Saxon
                    Coins found in Kintbury Churchyard, Berks,</hi> printed in the seventh volume of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Archaeologia</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Account of Shaw,</hi> in Mr Mores’s Berkshire Collections; <hi
                    rend="italic">The Savages of Europe,</hi> a popular French novel, which he
                    translated, and illustrated by prints from his own designs. Mr Andrews was also
                    a frequent contributor to the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman’s Magazine.</hi> See
                    the <hi rend="italic">Gen. Biog. Diet,</hi> by Chalmers; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introduction to Poems by the Bev. Thomas Penrose,</hi> 1781; <hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Andrews,</hi><hi rend="italic">Lancelot,</hi> bishop of
                    Winchester, was born at London in 1555, and educated at Cambridge. After several
                    preferments he was made bishop, first of Chichester, then of Ely, and in 1610
                    was raised to the see of Winchester. This very learned prelate, who was
                    distinguished by his piety, charity, and integrity, may be justly ranked with
                    the best preachers and scholars of his age. He appeared, however, to much
                    greater advantage in the pulpit than he does now in his works, which abound with
                    Latin quotations and trivial witticisms. He died at Winchester House in
                    Southwark, September 27, 1626, in the 71st year of his age, and was buried in
                    the parish church of St Saviour’s, where his executors erected to him a very
                    fair monument of marble and alabaster, on which is an elegant inscription in
                    Latin, written by one of his chaplains. His most popular works are, his <hi
                    rend="italic">Sermons,</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Lectures on the Ten
                    Commandments,</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Orphan Lectures,</hi> each forming
                    a folio volume. There is a collection by Felix Kyngston, of some other pieces
                    written by him, which was published in 4to in 1629.</p>
