                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">ANGEL</label>, a spiritual intelligent substance, the first
                    in rank and dignity among created beings. The word <hi rend="italic">angel</hi>
                    is Greek, and signifies a <hi rend="italic">messenger:</hi> the Hebrew qκb□
                    signifies the same thing. The angels are in Daniel, chap, iv. ver. 13, &amp;c.
                    called tw, or <hi rend="italic">watchers,</hi> from their vigilance: for the
                    same reason they are, in the remains we have of the prophecy attributed to
                    Enoch, <hi rend="italic">nameàEgregori</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> which word
                    imports the same in Greek.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">Angel,</hi> therefore, in the proper signification of
                    the word, does not import the nature of any being, but only an office; in which
                    sense angels are called the <hi rend="italic">ministers of God,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ministering spirits.</hi> That there are such beings, invisible
                    and imperceptible to our senses, endued with understanding and power superior to
                    those of human nature, created by God, and subject to him,—ministering to his
                    divine providence in the government of the world,— are truths fully attested by
                    Scripture. Nay, the existence of such invisible beings was generally
                    acknowledged by the heathens, though under different appellations: the Greeks
                    called them <hi rend="italic">demons,</hi> and the Romans <hi rend="italic"
                    >genii</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lares.</hi> Epicurus seems to have been the
                    only one among the ancient philosophers who absolutely rejected them.</p>
                <p>As to the nature of these beings, we are told that they are spirits; but whether
                    pure spirits divested of all matter, or united to some corporeal vehicles, has
                    been a controversy of long standing. Not only the ancient philosophers, but some
                    of the Christian fathers, were of opinion that angels were clothed with ethereal
                    or fiery bodies, of the same nature with those which we shall one day have when
                    we come to be equal to them. But the more general opinion, especially of later
                    times, has been, that they are substances entirely spiritual, though they can at
                    any time assume bodies, and appear in human or other shapes.</p>
                <p>Besides their attendance on God, and their waiting and executing his commands,
                    they are also presumed to be employed in taking care of mankind and their
                    concerns: and that every man had such a tutelar or guardian angel, even from his
                    birth, was a firm belief and tradition among the Jews; and our Saviour himself
                    seems to have been of the same sentiment. The heathens were also of that
                    persuasion, and thought it a crime to neglect the admonitions of so divine a
                    guide. The Romans thought the tutelar genii of those who attained the empire to
                    be of an eminent order, on which account they had great honours shown them.
                    Nations and cities also had their several genii. The ancient Persians so firmly
                    believed the ministry of angels, and their superintendence over human affairs,
                    that they gave their names to their months, and the days of their months, and
                    assigned them distinct offices and provinces: and it is from them the Jews
                    confess to have received the names of the months and angels, which they brought
                    with them when they returned from the Babylonish captivity; after which, we find
                    they also assigned charges to the angels, and in particular the patronage of
                    empires and nations; Michael being the prince of the Jews, as Raphael is
                    supposed to have been of the Persians.</p>
                <p>Although the angels were originally created perfect, good, and obedient to their
                    Master’s will, yet some of them sinned and kept not their first estate, but left
                    their habitation, and so, from the most blessed and glorious, became the most
                    vile and miserable, of all God’s creatures. They were expelled the regions of
                    light, and cast down to hell, to be reserved in everlasting chains under
                    darkness, until the day of judgment. With heaven they lost their heavenly
                    disposition, which delighted once in doing good and praising God; and fell into
                    a settled rancour against the Deity, and malice against men. Their inward peace
                    was gone; all desire of doing good departed from them, and instead thereof,
                    revengeful thoughts and despair took possession of them, and created an eternal
                    hell within them.</p>
