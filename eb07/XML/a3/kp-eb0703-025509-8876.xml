                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Etymologists</hi> derive the word antiquities, and many
                    other kindred words, from an obvious source, the Latin preposition <hi
                    rend="italic">ante,</hi> before. The great arbiter of language, custom, has
                    ordained that it should mark out and relate to periods of time, not immediately,

                <p>The early records and older monuments of every nation, of whatever kind they may
                    be, may properly be named antiquities; but this term ordinarily calls up in the
                    mind the one or the other of the two grand divisions into which the practice of
                    the learned has long continued to separate so much of the wide field as has

                    carefully cultivated. It either awakens the recollections of the Greeks and the
                    Romans, who are commonly known by the designation of the ancients, and of some
                    other nations, who are remembered chiefly on account of their connection with
                    them, and points out the <hi rend="italic">antiquities of the scholar,</hi>
                    which are often described by the Greek appellation, archaeology; or it reminds
                    us of the history of our ancestors, and of the other European people in the
                    middle ages, which forms the <hi rend="italic">antiquities of the
                    antiquary.</hi> We are anxious to mark strongly the distinction between
                    archaeology, or the study of the Grecian and Roman antiquities, and the study of
                    the antiquary,— the antiquities of the middle ages and of times subsequent. The
                    former pursuit it is scarcely possible to carry to an improper excess, because
                    we may derive advantage and improvement from almost every department of the
                    studies of the archaeologist,—so admirable were the institutions of Greece and
                    Rome, and to such a wonderful pitch did the cultivation of the human intellect
                    attain, especially in Greece. But in the middle ages, on the contrary, there was
                    little peculiar of which human nature ought not to be ashamed; and whatever we
                    would not wish to unlearn as to those barbarous times, we would only consent to
                    remember for the purpose of avoiding it in future. It is not to be denied,
                    however, that even in the darkest and rudest of those days of barbarism, several
                    useful and agreeable institutions existed, the loss of which we have abundant
                    cause to deplore, and to regret that they were swept away by ignorant and
                    bigoted men, who, under the specious pretence of reformation, destroyed much
                    that was valuable; yet it is certain—and to those who are well read in the
                    history of classical antiquity the proofs of the assertion are sufficiently
                    familiar—that the institutions which shed a light (if it were but a dim one, it
                    was still a comfort and a guide in a period of darkness, and the absence of it
                    has left a void in society) were not the offspring of the middle ages, but were
                    precious relics still remaining, vestiges still unobliterated, ruins still
                    standing, of older and better times—the creations of the wisdom and virtue of
                    the ancient world. The antiquities of the middle ages, so far as they are the
                    peculiar productions of those ages, are not wanting in good taste alone—that is
                    a defect comparatively of trifling importance, and it might more easily be
                    pardoned; but they are deficient in a good •spirit also. This is undeniably a
                    more serious charge, a more grievous deficiency: they are devoid of a patriotic,
                    a benevolent, a humane intention; they are manifestly without the purpose of
                    benefiting the many, of bringing profit to the people at large, of working the
                    good of mankind in general; they seek to aggrandize some feudal tyrant, it may
                    be sometimes a petty tyrant, but still a tyrant—to fasten the yoke upon the neck
                    of the vassal—to add another link to his chain; not, like the happier
                    institutions of earlier and better times, to instruct and gladden the citizen of
                    a free state. It is chiefly on account of this important and remarkable
                    distinction that we give the preference to the study of archaeology over the
                    more vulgar and more modern study of what are most commonly denominated
                    antiquities. We will not affect, however, to be insensible to the superior
                    allurements of the former pursuit, or to be ignorant of the intrinsic excellence
                    in all other respects of the relics of ages of extraordinary refinement.</p>
                <p>The consideration of these precious relics is not to be undertaken without
                    difficulty. Their number and variety would perplex any one who entered upon the
                    delicate office of explaining them, even if their nature and uses were as
                    obvious in all instances as they are obscure and mysterious in many, and if the
                    space that was afforded for explanation were as unlimited as on the present
                    occasion, from the miscellaneous composition of the publication in which it
                    finds a place, it is necessarily confined. Not only are the remains themselves
                    numerous and al most infinite, but the works in which they have been re
                    presented in figures, or described in words, are so bulk and numberless, that it
                    is not only impossible to give a detailed account of them, but it would be vain
                    to endeavour to enumerate each individual. We must content ourselves, therefore,
                    with arranging the vast subject under several heads, with treating briefly and
                    in general terms of each, and with allowing ourselves to dwell a short time, as
                    an indulgence, on one or two matters that appear in our eyes to be of paramount
                    importance.</p>
                <p>If it were possible to explain fully and in a satisfactory manner all the
                    monuments of antiquity that are at present known, the subject would not be
                    exhausted. Every year brings important additions to the large stock of antiques;
                    and the exposition of them, like the study of nature, in consequence of new
                    discoveries, is infinite and inexhaustible. The learned Montfaucon, after much
                    experience, expresses, in these remarkable words, his sense of the labours of an
                    archaeologist, which appear to terminate only that they may commence again: “Il
                    n’est guère de matière si vaste que celle des monumens de l’antiquité. On voit
                    tous les jours sortir de l’obscurité quelque chose de singulier, et qui n’avoit
                    pas encore été remarqué. Lorsqu’on croit finir ses recueils, on est souvent
                    obligé de recommencer sur nouveaux frais: à peine a-t-on achevé un ouvrage, que
                    des matériaux se présentent pour un autre. La terre en cache one infinité que le
                    pur hazard fait découvrir. On en déterre dans les champs, on en trouve dans les
                    villes: quand on se flatte d’avoir épuisé tous les cabinets, il en sort encore
                    de nouveaux, inconnus quelquefois même à ceux qui les possèdent. Presque toutes
                    les parties de l’Europe en fournissent: le Levant et l’Egypte nous en envoient
                    trèssouvent et de fort curieux; et ce qui surprend davantage, il s’en est
                    rencontré, qui exposés depuis plusieurs siècles à la vue de tout le monde, ont
                    demeuré aussi inconnus, que s’ils avoient été cachés en terre, jusqu’à ce que 1a
                    réflexion nous les a fait estimer ce qu’ils valent.”</p>
                <p>The productions of the fine arts occupy a distinguished place among the remains
                    of antiquity; and as these generally are closely connected with the pagan
                    religion, it will be necessary to premise a few observations respecting the
                    worship of Greece and Rome.</p>
                <p>Men of learning, after the most laborious investigation and study of the ancient
                    religion, have usually come to the conclusion that it is a profound and
                    impenetrable mystery, and that such it was in the time of Cicero, and as far
                    back as the earliest records extend. All the explanations that have hitherto
                    been given are equally unsatisfactory, the astronomical not less so than the
                    rest. Meanwhile the beauty of the mythology is undoubted it is like nature, for
                    whose wonderful operations the modern theories will not account better than the
                    ancient while the excellence of her works cannot be denied or questioned. It was
                    a collection of fables from all countries, but it had one characteristic unity,
                    the unity of beauty, and was admirably adapted to the wants of the imagination,
                    and to satisfy the craving of the fancy in human beings of every age and rank.
                    To admit that all of its creations are allegorical, is equally impossible as to
                    deny that some are. This solution indeed ought to be applied sparingly: a good
                    allegory is no doubt satisfactory, but an indifferent one is scarcely tolerable,
                    and nothing is more tiresome and offensive than allegory long sustained or
                    frequently repeated. Theorists have used this key with much confidence, and have
                    sought to lay open by its assistance the sense of the ancient mysteries.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193098902" xml:id="kp-eb0703-8902-0257"/>
                <p>Each department of mythology has been exposed inits turn •to their fruitless
                    attempts, and the origin of the twelve signs of the zodiac has been a favourite
                    point of inquiry. Every speculator has found in them a confirmation of his own
                    views, a theory after his own heart, plainly written in the heavens in legible
                    and indelible characters, to unfold to mankind matters of very different
                    natures, and of very unequal importance ;—a complete development, as some
                    assert, of the foundation of every mode of religious faith, or a plan of diet,
                    as others affirm, so salubrious as to obviate the possibility of disease in the
                    human frame, or of moral evil and consequent misery in the mind of man.</p>
                <p>We may enumerate amongst mythic curiosities the French notion, version, or
                    recension, of the ancient mythology, which we see exemplified in their poetry,
                    in their statues and paintimrs, and in innumerable engravings, but perhaps most
                    perfectly and fully on the French stage, and especially in the ballets which
                    follow the opera. It is a fantastic, affected, insipid, and strange thing,
                    perfectly unlike the original, of which, with a marvellous credulity, an acute
                    and sceptical nation firmly believes that it is a faithful imitation. The French
                    have the merit of affording great encouragements to the study of antiquity, but
                    unhappily they have no feeling for the true antique: they want every quality
                    that is required for comprehending it, and possess all those that can impede the
                    pursuit. They want, in short, nature, ease, grace, and simplicity.</p>
                <p>The pagan religion was addressed to the imagination and the feelings, and not to
                    the understanding, from which no submission was required: it sought only to
                    amuse and delight, not to convince. If the forms of the gods were sometimes
                    whimsical,—if strange actions were sometimes attributed to them,—we are told
                    that the object was to attract attention, which ever has been, and ever will be,
                    not less difficult than desirable. The modern practice of endeavouring to obtain
                    hearers by scolding has been found, and ought to be acknowledged, as equally
                    unpleasant and inefficient. Innumerable passages will occur to the scholar,
                    especially in the writings of Cicero, to show that the influence of superstition
                    did not cramp the understanding of the philosopher,—that it was either a
                    plaything or an engine of state, and a part of the powers of government. There
                    is evidence also, that in much earlier times it was not considered necessary to
                    manifest a very lively faith. Valerius Maximus relates, that in the first Punic
                    war, in days of pristine simplicity and primitive piety, when Publius Claudius
                    was consulting the augurs, <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> on being told that the
                    sacred chickens refused to eat, “Then throw them into the sea,” he said, “that
                    if they will not eat, they may drink.” If the sacred chickens eat the corn that
                    was placed before them, it was a favourable omen; if they devoured it so
                    greedily as to drop a part, success was certain; if, on the contrary, they
                    refused it, here was mischief in the wind; but if they attempted to fly away on
                    quitting the ivory coop, inevitable destruction was impending. The consultation
                    respected the event of a naval engagement; the profane remark of the consul,
                    therefore, was more apposite: “P. Claudius, bello Punicoprimo, cum praelium
                    navale committere vellet, auspiciaque, more majorum, petiisset, et pullarius non
                    exire cavea pullos nuntiasset, abjici eos in mare jussit, dicens, Quia esse
                    nolunt, bibant.”</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the slight influence which the pagan religion possessed over
                    their thoughts and actions, the higher classes were attached to it; great men
                    were glad to be deified, and their relations considered it an honour and a
                    happiness. It was esteemed formerly as advantageous to have a god, as in
                    Catholic countries it still is to have a saint, in the family. It was not only
                    an addition to the splendour of an illustrious house, but possibly it also
                    gratified the spirit of monopoly, as nothing, was required to go out of the
                    family, not even prayers' and sacrifices; and, moreover, every kind of favour
                    might be reasonably expected from an uncle a god, or an aunt a goddess. Whatever
                    parts of this religion were mysterious, it is at least clear and indisputable
                    that it was essentially and fundamentally of a popular character, and was
                    totally and entirely designed for the public amusement and gratification: it was
                    a political institution for the education of the people. We cannot be surprised,
                    therefore, that it captivated the multitude, who were well aware that it might
                    have been difficult to bestow so much upon them in any other form; and that it
                    was used as a pretext to cover, not taxes and severe exactions, but large,
                    frequent, and liberal donations from the wealthy to the poor. Among the cheerful
                    ancients, as well as among graver people, the immortal gods were often compelled
                    to furnish a decent excuse to enable men to do without censure whatever they
                    wished: there was this important difference, however, that the religious
                    hypocrisy of the former sought commonly to shelter under the awful sanction of
                    celestial patronage, objects, not of a narrow and selfish, but of a liberal and
                    patriotic nature. Works of art being for the most part public property, were
                    frequently vested in a god or a goddess, as a trustee for the people; religion
                    supplied the means of enjoying the only species of property that can
                    advantageously be enjoyed in common. The temples were in truth the museums in
                    which works of art were preserved and exhibited, and the ancient usage still
                    lingers in countries that have not been reformed, where the churches, although
                    not avowedly, are substantially" galleries for the display of the productions of
                    the fine arts. Wherever well-stored libraries and rich collections of paintings
                    and statues, and similar objects of <hi rend="italic">virtù,</hi> are accessible
                    at all hours to the public, the wants of private persons are greatly <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> diminished. It was not only through these
                    exhibitions, which were constantly present to their eyes, that the people were
                    gratified by the ancient religion,—the occasional and periodical festivals were
                    of frequent recurrence, and were a source of joy and happiness for many ages to
                    all ranks. The subject is an agreeable one: it is pleasant to go back to the
                    enjoyments of the ancient world; and we regret that on the present occasion we
                    are only permitted to allude to this interesting topic. Μ. de Pauw speaks
                    sensibly of the excellent effects of these festive institutions, in the

                    l’Attique avoient leurs vices, ils avoient aussi leurs vertus; et Dicéarque
                    lui-même se loue de Thumanité et de la politesse avec laquelle il avoit été recu
                    sur toutes les grandes routes de cette contrée. Ensuite il assure que nulle part
                    au monde on ne pouvoit vivre plus agréablement qu’à Athènes; soit qu’on eût de

                    procurer tous les agrémens imaginables, et il-y-a, ajoute-t-il, tant de
                    spectacles, tant de fêtes, tant de jeux, tant de divertissemens, que les
                    citoyens indigens n’y pensent jamais à leur pauvreté.” <hi rend="italic"

                    opposite condition, who have resided in countries where there are no public
                    entertainments, no festivals, no popular amusements, no holydays, are able to
                    bear testimony, that there wealth can procure for the rich few pleasures, and
                    that the many are reminded of, and never see cause to forget, their indigence.
                    Festivals are very useful to the lower classes, especially in country places, as
                    they tend to check the selfishness of individuals, by which their minds are apt
                    to be cramped, and make them feel that they form a part of a great whole:
                    humanity and politeness are wanting wherever they are discouraged, and an

                    cheerfulness and courtesy of the Athenians were the fair fruits of a system of
                    reasonable indulgence; and intellectual culture being generally diffused, caused
                    an extreme toleration of all pursuits and opinions. If the people are enabled to
                    judge of works of art, their critical powers will be engaged and exercised more
                    usefully and agreeably than in scanning the actions of their superiors, which
                    they are unable to estimate correctly. Where no congenial occupation is
                    supplied, every low and ignorant fellow may grow into a sour bigot, and, it
                    maybe, into an oracle and a prophet, and in that capacity may imagine that it is
                    his duty to seek to shape the conduct and creed of wiser men according to the
                    misconceptions of his wayward fancy.</p>
                <p>It is very desirable that some competent person should undertake to give a plain
                    and faithful account of a religion which has never met with fair treatment from
                    its historians. It indicates a bad taste, to say the least of it, to imitate and
                    repeat the absurd and vehement declamations of the fathers of the Christian
                    church against the gods of the ancients. In their times those deities were
                    dangerous rivals; there is certainly no cause to fear them now. No one can see
                    any reason to apprehend that the world will return again to the old worship. The
                    pope and the archbishop of Canterbury may rest in equal security that they will
                    never receive a short notice either to sacrifiée a black heifer to Proserpine,
                    or to vacate their respective palaces and offices; the unpleasant option will
                    never be offered to either. It is a mere waste of words, therefore, to persist
                    in calling the heathen, of whom we have learned so much, blind, and to rail at
                    their gods. A religion which was exempt from sordid rites, and of which the end
                    and object were the gratification and cultivation of the people, at least
                    deserves to have its story told and its fortunes related without scurrility,
                    passion, or prejudice. Persons of good taste will be equally offended, on the
                    other hand, at the attempts that <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> are often made by
                    writers, of more zeal than discretion, to wrest the pagan mythology, and to
                    compel it to seem to consent with the mysteries of the Christian religion. Lord
                    Bacon wisely says, in allusion to such unholy and offensive practices, “But I
                    have interdicted my pen all liberties of this kind, lest I should use strange
                    fire at the altar of the Lord.” Nor should that excessive dread of idolatry,
                    which characterizes a barbarous people, find a place in such a work: it is time
                    to discard the absurd notion, that it is impossible to see and admire a
                    beautiful statue without worshipping it—that true piety and a taste for the fine
                    arts are of necessity incompatible.</p>
                <p>The admirable Heyné complains of the unnatural and forced hypotheses of mythists,
                    and of their disposition to torture the meaning of the ancient fables, and to
                    pervert them to signify matters that were diametrically opposed to the spirit
                    and sense of antiquity. He at the same time lays down a golden rule, to guide
                    the future historian of mythology; and happy will he be who shall have the good
                    sense and the good fortune to be governed by it. “To compose a plain narrative,
                    representing the primitive form under which each fable has been handed clown to
                    us by the first poets and the first artists, and afterwards to show the changes
                    and additions that have been made by later poets and artists.” “Il nous manque
                    également pour l’étude dont il est question (the study of antiquity), des
                    traités sur les connoissances accessoires, et surtout, un bon ouvrage sur la
                    fable. Nous avons à la vérité beaucoup d’écrits sur la mythologie; mais je ne
                    sais quel mauvais génie se saisit de tous ceux qui veulent traiter cette
                    matière. Ils commencent par établir quelque hypothèse, d’après laquelle ils
                    cherchent à dénaturer et à forcer le sens des anciennes fables; et aucune de ces
                    hypo-thèses ne se trouve établie sur l’esprit même de fanti- <hi

                    qu’en un simple réeit, qui nous présente la forme primitive sous laquelle chaque
                    fable nous a été transmise par les premiers poètes et par les premiers artistes.
                    Nous devons connoitre aussi les changemens et les additions que les artistes et
                    les poètes postérieurs y ont faits. La meilleure explication est celle qu’on
                    peut tirer de eette méthode et de cette manière d’exposer les choses, en partant
                    des tems de la première origine des fables, et en les suivant dans les différons
                    changemens qu’elles ont éprouvées.” ·</p>
                <p>The inexhaustible quarries of fine marble at Athens, and in other parts of
                    Greece, furnished materials for innumerable statues and other sculptures: many
                    of the most celebrated works were executed . in ivory. These, of course, have
                    entirely perished; but of those in marble we are so fortunate as to possess some
                    specimens from the hands of the most renowned artists, and it is universally
                    allowed, that even in their present state, all of them having received more or
                    less injury, they are fully worthy of the fame that has attended on the memory
                    of the great men by whom they were fashioned. It has been asserted, that the
                    most lovely of all things are the Greek statues and the Greek tragedy; and
                    ingenious, and perhaps somewhat fanciful persons, have imagined that they
                    perceived a certain resemblance in the peculiar style of the sculptors and
                    tragedians of Athens.</p>
                <p>The sentiment of repose is strongly inculcated by the best productions of the
                    Grecian chisel, and critics are sometimes dissatisfied with the small amount of
                    action and the little apparent exertion; and they affirm that the expression is
                    occasionally even that of listlessness. In inferior productions, on the
                    contrary, we observe an excess of action, and a straining, that are painful to
                    the spectator, especially if he regards them for a long time; we find the same
                    sobriety, frugality, and even parsimony, in the other compositions of the
                    ancients, especially in their writings, which must seem cold and languid to the
                    admirers of the exaggerated expressions of modern authors.</p>
                <p>In classical works, the more exalted the personage, the more calm and dignified
                    are his emotions; but the hero of a modern drama or other work of the
                    imagination often seems, by his violence and unnatural contortions, to be
                    convulsed by the powerful action of a Galvanic battery, rather than impelled and
                    agitated by mere human feelings; unless we may adopt a more obvious and simple
                    solution of the difficulty, and suppose him to be a maniac. We presume to speak
                    on this subject with great diffidence and distrust, but we must confess that the
                    ancients have sometimes carried the sentiment of repose to an excess, especially
                    in <hi rend="italic">bas</hi><hi rend="italic">reliefs,</hi> in which the
                    figures, although they are engaged in pursuits demanding the utmost energy, and
                    of intense interest to all concerned, appear frequently to be more than
                    half-asleep. It cannot be denied, however, that an excess of tranquillity is
                    less displeasing than a display of unnecessary and outrageous violence.</p>
                <p>• The nakedness and full draperies of ancient times form a striking contrast with
                    the close, strict, and scanty clothing of modern days, and show us symbolically
                    ⅛° former copiousness and pristine candour, in opposition to the disingenuous
                    concealments and narrow poverty or degenerate souls. Statues and other marbles
                    and sculptures may be so easily, cheaply, and perfectly copied, by means of
                    plaster-casts, that no considerable city ought to be without a public museum,
                    containing a copy of all the best pieces of this kind in existence. If a few
                    churlish persons should for a time refuse permission to take a cast, a drawing
                    or some other imitation of the sculpture that <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193098928" xml:id="kp-eb0703-8928-0259"/> was wanting might occupy the
                    place of the cast, and an inscription might inform the visitor where the
                    original was to be found, and give the name of its unworthy possessor, who
                    refused to the lovers of art the facilities which others had cheerfully granted.
                    We possess many excellent antiques in bronze. If the colour be less agreeable
                    than that of marble, the superior toughness of the material admits of greater
                    spirit and freedom of execution; and of this advantage the ancient workmen knew
                    how to avail themselves to the utmost, as any good collection of these remains
                    will fully demonstrate, especially the many admirable specimens that are
                    exhibited in the <hi rend="italic">Studii</hi> at Naples.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable, and perhaps the most inimitable, excellence of ancient art,
                    is· the perfection that was displayed in cutting gems, whether the figure be
                    sunk beneath the plane surface of the stone, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >intaglio,</hi> or projected above it, as in the <hi rend="italic">cameo.</hi>
                    If, on the one hand, gems are imperishable, and almost indestructible, on the
                    other they are easily lost by reason of their small size. The prodigious number
                    of engraved stones already known to the curious, and which is continually
                    augmented by the discovery of new and beautiful specimens, proves that a vast
                    amount of labour and of exquisite skill was formerly employed on these minute
                    and delicate works. Rings, which were originally composed of coarse materials,
                    and were used as seals, tokens, and for other purposes of necessity, in progress
                    of time gradually grew into articles of immense luxury and cost. The taste for
                    these ornaments had become universal in the civilized world in the time of
                    Alexander the Great, who was fond of having his portrait cut on gems; and men
                    were equally fond of wearing his image, not through a servile adulation, for the
                    fashion or passion continued for several centuries after his death, but from a
                    notion that it was lucky, which was indeed the chief motive in the choice of
                    subjects for rings. In modern times we waste our gems by engraving upon them the
                    ugliest device of a barbarous age—coatarmour; in like manner much valuable
                    material and much precious labour were expended anciently, in the days of waning
                    liberty, to preserve the worthless portrait of some dull sample of a
                    Jove-descended king. The public acts of free states had sometimes been sealed
                    with the likeness of an individual who had been a benefactor to the community,
                    as a lasting and delicate compliment, that might flatter, but could not wound,
                    the generous modesty of a disinterested patriot. The emperors of Rome, with that
                    more than Aristophanic genius for burlesque and caricature for which they were
                    remarkable, and of which the comic effect was the more striking and humorous,
                    because the masters of the world were perfectly unconscious that they were
                    heaping ridicule upon their own sacred heads, adopted the usage with many
                    aggravations and additions for their own glory. The patriotic Tiberius extended
                    the laws of treason—laws by which it was declared to be high treason to treat
                    with disrespect the statues of the emperor—in order to protect from insult, by
                    the last and highest penalties, his own image on a ring. We desire to confine
                    our censure to the abuse of portraits. Many of the antique likenesses of
                    individuals, who are remembered on account of their virtues or their talents,
                    are highly interesting: there are several valuable collections of this kind in
                    other places, but the Capitoline Museum at Rome is the grand repertory of
                    ancient portraits. We read that in ancient times there were large collections of
                    engraved gems, both glyphs and anaglyphs, as in our own days; and we have
                    moreover innumerable books, containing representations of the most celebrated
                    <hi rend="italic">Dactyliothecae, of</hi> very various degrees of merit, to
                    enumerate which would be tedious. The amulets and astrological characters on
                    rings have given occasion to the display of much. curious learning. Superstition
                    has long been familiar with ' the importance of rings: Apollonius of Tyana
                    deemed them so essential to quackery, that he had seven—for each day of the week
                    a different one, marked with the planet of the day. The scenic mask, whether
                    tragic or comic, but especially the latter, was a favourite device: we have seen
                    many gems that exhibit beautiful and surprising examples of that wonderful
                    creation of the fancy. It affords one instance also of the many that might be
                    cited to show that ancient forms are often preserved in a whimsical manner, and
                    applied to purposes very remote from those for which they were originally
                    designed. We have often observed an antique comic mask carved in stone on the
                    end of a spout on our churches, and the exaggerated mouth from which jests not
                    less grotesque than itself, but well seasoned with Attic salt, were used to
                    issue, giving free vent to mere rain-water: so universal and indestructible is
                    the influence of antiquity. As a class, coins are perhaps the least interesting
                    of antiques; for, with few exceptions, they serve to illustrate nothing but the
                    succession of a family or dynasty of kings. They have, however, long been
                    favourite objects with collectors, partly on this account, and partly because
                    persons who cannot attain to the comprehension of any other part of the study of
                    antiquities, can at least understand the formation of an unbroken series, and
                    that it is often difficult to complete it. We may concede also in favour of this
                    branch of the science, that the Numismatists have sometimes rendered assistance
                    to chronology, and have even cleared up certain points of geography, and
                    therefore in subordinate departments have aided the historian.</p>
                <p>Certain eminent artists and accomplished critics have given it as their decided
                    opinion, that enough remains of the ancient painting to demonstrate that the
                    ancients were as much superior to the moderns in this art, as they are admitted
                    to have been in sculpture. It seems probable that the first efforts of design
                    were mere shadows or outlines; of this early style the fictile vases afford
                    examples. We have, however, many specimens of finished works in fresco, which
                    are preserved at Rome and in Naples. Of the former, the Roman remains, some
                    idea, although, it must be confessed, a very inadequate one, may be derived from
                    the engravings in Turnbull’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Ancient
                    Painting.</hi> Of the latter, the <hi rend="italic">Pitture di Ercolano</hi> are
                    more faithful and satisfactory representations. The style of the ancient
                    painters, so far as our imperfect materials will permit us to judge, rather
                    resembled that of Perugino and Raphael in grace, beauty, and sweetness, than the
                    sub!i-mity and graphic <hi rend="italic">ΐηινοτης</hi> of the angelic and
                    immortal Michael.</p>
                <p>Michel più che mortal, Angiol divino.</p>
                <p>Of the celebrated encaustic painting we know nothing, but that the ancients have
                    left us some brief and vague descriptions, and the moderns have made some
                    fruitless attempts to revive or re-discover it.</p>
                <p>Of the Mosaic painting we have some very lovely vestiges, and some of them are as
                    fresh and as fair as when they were first laid; with patient industry they may
                    be imitated, either with stones, with morsels of glass, or with small tiles
                    coloured and glazed. This kind of work is of bewitching beauty: the eyes of
                    Homer had been so captivated with it, that he continued after his blindness to
                    describe heaven by its pavement; at least if the critics will permit us to give
                    this sense to the word <hi rend="italic">δα∙πiδοv.</hi></p>
                <p>We learn from the remains of ancient painting, that it was usual to adhere
                    scrupulously to particular colours for the draperies of certain gods and heroes;
                    and we may trace the same practice in the works of many of the Italian masters,
                    who assign invariably the appropriated colours to <pb break="no"

                <p>In countries where fuel was scarce the process of burning bricks was expensive;
                    unburnt bricks were therefore much used. In consequence of the greater heat of
                    the sun they were hardened in southern climates more perfectly than the very
                    limited portion of sunshine that northern regions enjoy could possibly effect;
                    and we read that the desiccation was continued for several years before they
                    were consigned to the builder. If the rain, which in the south at certain
                    seasons falls in torrents, were warded off, wherever the air is generally dry
                    such structures would last for a long period (the perpetual humidity of our
                    atmosphere, even if we were able to prepare them properly, would speedily
                    decompose them); but, even under the most favourable circumstances, a pile of
                    unburnt bricks is a perishable structure, and many celebrated edifices have
                    accordingly perished. More durable and more ornamental materials, however, have
                    been fortunately very plentiful in those countries where invention and a pure
                    taste in architecture were most prevalent; and some of the most celebrated of
                    the productions of antiquity have resisted the gradual attacks of time, and the
                    sudden violence of barbarians. In a few instances they are nearly entire; in
                    many more, enough remains to enable us to restore the building to its original
                    state, or to build another exactly similar to the former. Nor have architects
                    been wanting in diligence in this respect; very accurate surveys, and exact and
                    minute admeasurements and drawings, models and descriptions of every kind, have
                    been executed by competent persons, to the great benefit of their art. We should
                    be enabled to judge very correctly of the effect of the ancient temples and
                    other edifices of celebrity, many of which have been admirably restored in small
                    drawings and engravings by architects, if the restorations were painted in
                    fresco on the walls of our public buildings in various points of view, and of
                    the full size of the originals. Since Greece, and especially Athens, has been so
                    carefully explored, and the results of much valuable labour made public, our
                    taste in architecture has been greatly improved. The various members, at least,
                    and the details of the buildings that have been lately erected in Great Britain,
                    are more elegant than they were formerly. Unfortunately, however, we do not seem
                    to possess an architect capable of combining the beautiful parts into one
                    harmonious whole. It should appear, therefore, that a more profound and enlarged
                    study of antiquity is required to make the artist in this line a master of
                    general effect. A literary work may be faultless in its details, and yet it may
                    be inefficient as a whole; it may be impossible to fix blame upon any single
                    page or paragraph, yet the entire history of Greece, or of Rome, may be unworthy
                    of the events which it undertakes to record. The narration, although the style
                    be chaste and correct, may be lifeless, spiritless, and uninspiring. So is it in
                    architecture; and such is the present state of that art in Great Britain. Our
                    architects seem equally incapable of producing a whole, either in the Grecian or
                    the Gothic style, although the parts may sometimes in themselves have merit. A
                    silhouette, shade, or profile of the object in question, especially if it be
                    taken in various points of view, will afford the most simple, ready, and
                    satisfactory means of determining, and is the most certain and conclusive test
                    whether the effect as a whole be good. If our latest erections be tried in this
                    manner, the contours will invariably prove to be insipid and uninteresting, and
                    often ill proportioned and ugly.</p>
                <p>The Romans surpassed the rest of mankind less in the arts of government than in
                    that remarkable art which Seneca aptly compares to the constitution of civil
                    society, the building of arches and vaulted roofs of masonry. The, astonishing
                    and colossal relics of their mastery in this useful and difficult department of
                    architecture have received much less attention than many works of very inferior
                    beauty and utility. The most vulnerable part of a building is the wooden frame
                    of the roof, which is always in danger of being destroyed by fire. It seems,
                    however, to be unnecessary in the construction of edifices of some kinds to use
                    wood at all. The tiles or other external covering might be supported, as they
                    were in some of the ancient temples, by light arches of masonry, which, as the
                    weight they would have to bear would be insignificant, might be built so
                    slightly as not to oppress the parts beneath that sustain them. Many of the
                    arches in the circus of Caracalla, near Rome, are composed of large earthen
                    vessels walled together, instead of bricks or stones; and of this contrivance
                    there are other examples at Rome. The superior lightness is manifest; the
                    strength of an earthen vessel, and its power of resisting mere pressure, is
                    considerable. That such structures were sufficiently solid, is demonstrated by
                    their standing to this day. The expedient is worthy of imitation, and of more
                    attention than it has hitherto received. The cupola of the church of San Vitale
                    at Ravenna is the most remarkable specimen of this sort of building, being
                    composed entirely of cylindrical earthen vessels, which are placed in a
                    horizontal position, and are so arranged as to form one spiral coil, the end of
                    the one vessel being always inserted into the mouth of the other, like the pipes
                    that convey water through our streets. This very curious structure is exactly
                    coeval with the body of the civil law, being of the age of the emperor
                    Justinian; and it is said to be in equally good repair, and as likely to last
                    for some ages longer, as the <hi rend="italic">Corpus Juris.</hi> Μ. d’Agincourt
                    has fully explained this simple but ingenious contrivance, and has expressed in
                    a plate, more than it is possible to convey by verbal description alone, in his
                    great work entitled <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">de l’Art

                <p>The same disposition of stones, and the same artifices, which would serve to
                    support more securely the roof of a temple of masonry, would be equally
                    effectual in diminishing the tendency of the roof to fall in a cavern or
                    excavated temple; and we see, in fact, that they were actually employed in the
                    latter case, and with results equally satisfactory. The ordinary configuration
                    of the artificial roof of a temple is well adapted to lighten the natural roof
                    of a cavern, especially if the peculiarities of formation be carried to a
                    greater extent than we usually find in edifices. The part that would fall in
                    first, and bring down the rest with it, is the middle, it being most distant
                    from the supports: this is cut away and formed into hollow pannels, deepening in
                    gradual succession. The Etruscan catacombs supply remarkable instances of all
                    these contrivances. We even find the hole in the centre of the cupola, which is
                    designed to lighten the living roof, where it is least able to hang in the air,
                    and which also serves to admit the day. Of the two problems to support a natural
                    and an artificial roof, the one is precisely the converse of the other; it being
                    necessary in the former to hew away whatever portion of space would not be
                    occupied by the structure in the latter. Certain architectural critics
                    attribute, we know not how correctly, the undercrofts or crypts which are
                    commonly found beneath cathedral churches, to the catacombs; of which, they
                    assert, they are an imitation and memorial; because the catacombs were, it is
                    said, the first places of worship used by the early Christians. It is certain
                    that the catacombs at Rome serve as a crypt to the church of St Sebastian, and
                    it is also certain that the sepulchral chambers of the Pagans, <pb break="no"

                    which are far more ancient than the Christian worship, al- .,thou&lt;⅛ they were
                    never built under the floor of temples, closely resemble crypts. .</p>
                <p>The tombs of the ancients are very interesting to the archaeologist, because,
                    besides a multitude of pots and pans, and some vases of merit, they have
                    furnished a countless host of lamps, that have formed the subject of many
                    amusing volumes, and some excellent paintings in fresco, and other objects of
                    considerable importance. The ancients sought to alleviate as much as possible,
                    by calling up ideas of cheerfulness, grace, and beauty, the’ heavy burthen of
                    death. The Greeks were eminently distinguished by the warmth and the strength of
                    the domestic affections. Their tragedies present many lovely pictures of the
                    vigorous and luxuriant growth of all the more tender charities, and every part
                    of the history of their rites of sepulture brings fresh proof of the power and
                    prevalence of the most amiable feelings among this ingenious and cultivated
                    people. The creation of families, and the maintenance of them in the closest
                    union and intimacy, is undoubtedly the most desirable object of public and
                    private institutions; for it is from his family in childhood and in youth, in
                    manhood and in old age, that man’s happiness is mainly derived. We must be
                    careful, however, not to mistake the means for the end, and we must always
                    remember that laws, institutions, and principles, that were designed to advance
                    an end, are only valuable so far as they serve the purpose for which they were
                    designed. Men who do not steadily look to final causes are apt to gild and hang
                    garlands on a scaffolding pole, and, in their insane worship of their wooden
                    idol, to forget the marble palace, for the sake of which alone the unsightly
                    pole was erected. The great success of the Greeks in the cultivation of these
                    affections may be principally attributed to their extraordinary toleration and
                    liberality; for, in other countries, where there is more prudish precision than
                    mild and temperate forbearance, by drawing the silken bonds too tight, they are
                    often broken. If those rules of decorum which are to be observed only with a
                    certain moderation, and ought often to be considerably relaxed with a wise
                    equity, are enforced by the arbiters of society with a rigid and literal
                    severity, they will infallibly create heartlessness, hypo-i crisy, and disgust,
                    and there will be but little domestic happiness or affection. Genius is in its
                    nature eccentric; and if no allowances be made for its aberrations, men of
                    talent will be converted into enemies,—and they are most formidable ones. If the
                    treatment that may not be unsuitable to the humble and patient ass be attempted
                    towards the generous steed, it will rouse a spirit of resistance and revenge not
                    unworthy of the lion. Many writers have discoursed at great length of the
                    ancient sepulchral rites. The folio of Mark Anthony Boldetti, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Osservazioni</hi><hi rend="italic">sopra</hi><hi rend="italic">i
                    Cimitcr, de</hi><hi rend="italic">Santi</hi><hi rend="italic">Martiri, ed
                    antichi Cristiani di Roma,</hi> contains a great body of curious information,
                    and many valuable inscriptions; and the compilation is made palatable by a
                    certain simplicity and amusing credulity. It is difficult to believe, if we
                    reason from analogy, that were it possible to restore the ancient system of
                    music, it would not richly repay the labour that might be bestowed on the
                    task.</p>
                <p>It is not from the contemplation of the remains of antiquity in the fine arts
                    alone that we may hope to derive benefit; in many of the mechanical arts the
                    ancients were decidedly our superiors; and by assiduous study of the specimens
                    of various articles, and of the descriptions of certain processes, we may hope
                    that ingenious practical men will learn to restore lost arts, and to amend arid
                    im-- prove those which we possess. The ancient locks, for' example, were of an
                    admirable and very various construction. Bramah’s justly celebrated inventions
                    are merely, as is commonly known, an adoption of as many of the devices of the
                    ancient locksmiths as modern artists are at present able to understand. In the
                    manufacture of glass, the ancients were as much our superiors as in several
                    other arts. This is demonstrated by the accuracy, variety, and delicacy of the
                    forms into which they have moulded vessels of this substance. Among the other
                    excellencies of this manufacture, we may mention the gems formed of paste in
                    imitation of stones, to which we owe the preservation of some of the most
                    beautiful antique engravings, the originals having been lost: many of these are
                    of a large size. The manufacturers of porcelain have not hitherto been very
                    successful in impressing their works with the stamp of genius and true taste;
                    the Chinese origin is still manifest in the shapes of even the best pieces of
                    crockery: herein let them pray the aid of the ancients. The construction of the
                    antique chariots is perhaps not altogether unworthy of our attention, for even
                    the smallest and lightest of our carriages appear to be unnecessarily large and
                    heavy. Among the minor difficulties that were mastered by the skill of
                    antiquity, was that of driving and managing many horses abreast. We see on a gem
                    in the work of Count Caylus <hi rend="italic">(Recueil</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Antiquités,</hi> tome i. Plate LX. fig. 4) a chariot
                    with 20 horses yoked in this manner. Three horses abreast are often used on the
                    Continent, and with a good effect. We have heard that an equestrian amateur
                    tried the experiment in England successfully, but we do not remember to what
                    extent. The Grecian breed of horses, it is believed, was much smaller than the
                    English carriage-horses. If a London drayman, therefore, would be surprised to
                    meet an Athenian team rapidly advancing in a single line, the Attic charioteer
                    would scarcely be less astonished at the immense bulk of the animals that slowly
                    march in a long file. This branch of the subject, however, would lead us too far
                    from our original design.</p>
                <p>It would be dangerous to enter upon the disputed ground of Etruscan art; for even
                    the most experienced and confident critics confess that it is sometimes very
                    difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish Etruscan monuments from those of
                    the early ages of Greece. It is certain, however, that this ancient nation was
                    much addicted to superstition and the fine arts. The lax erudition of

                    travellers assert with one voice, that we cannot safely and correctly judge of
                    their peculiar character or general effect from the ordinary engravings. We are
                    required, moreover, in order to arrive at sound and solid conclusions on this
                    difficult question, to distinguish most carefully between the original and pure
                    Egyptian works, and the modern and spurious imitations that were manufactured
                    when the rites of Isis were fashionable in Rome; and generally to be on our
                    guard against whatever was executed whilst Egypt was under the sway of the
                    Romans, and to esteem it as very inferior to the genuine productions of the
                    country. A still further degree of caution may perhaps be necessary: the
                    degradation of the old style probably was gradually pre- <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193098967" xml:id="kp-eb0703-8967-0262"/>pared, and advanced slowly
                    during the period of more than three centuries, when Egypt was under the Grecian
                    dominion of the Ptolemies, before it passed by conquest into the hands of the
                    Romans. Plato indeed informs us, at the commencement of his second book <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Legibus,</hi> that the Egyptian sculptors
                    and painters were forbidden by law to change in any respect the forms of the
                    statues and paintings, but were required to follow scrupulously the ancient
                    models—and that there were in his days works in the temples of Egypt 10,000
                    years old; that they had not an old-fashioned antique appearance, but were
                    precisely like the latest productions, and were neither more nor less beautiful.
                    This testimony to the rigid adherence of their artists to patterns of such
                    extraordinary antiquity may possibly add to our confidence in the genuineness of
                    Egyptian antiquities in general.</p>
                <p>In the midst of beauty we are often shocked by a certain ugliness; so, in the
                    Egyptian statues, in their very ugliness there is, if we may use an apparent
                    contradiction in terms, a certain beauty—a gravity, a dignity, a seriousness, a
                    certain decorum: there is perhaps in the air and expression a display of moral
                    beauties, while, save health and strength, all physical ones are wanting.
                    Grotesque and whimsical as these figures are, they awaken a feeling of
                    reverence; but the statues of the Hindoos, if we may judge from the
                    representations of them which we see in Europe, are endowed with an unredeemed,
                    unreclaimed, and unmixed ugliness, and inspire only disgust and contempt. The
                    Egyptian statues possess one quality, which is esteemed no vulgar merit in works
                    of art,—a perfect repose: it is striking at first sight, and the more
                    attentively and the longer we contemplate them, the more profound does it
                    appear. Men of good sense, good taste, and learning, who have been sufficiently
                    fortunate to have had opportunities of judging of the Egyptian architecture,
                    assert that the general effect is very wonderful, and that the feeling of repose
                    is produced in an eminent degree by the prodigious proportions of their colossal
                    edifices,—a sense of endless duration and of eternal rest. It is a striking
                    thing to pass at once, by opening a door or raising a curtain, from the filth,
                    noise, glare, and bustle of a hot and busy street, to the calm purity, cool
                    shade, and quiet beauty of a richly adorned church. The transition must have
                    been still more striking when the Egyptian temples stood, as did most of them,
                    in crowded cities, to be suddenly translated from the tumult, and turbulence,
                    and the storms of active life, to the deep, unbroken rest, the waveless harbour,
                    of those who had long been dead. The magnitude, solidity, and ponderous weight
                    of the objects have no doubt some share also in the effect which the
                    contemplation of them produces on the mind. We feel that beauty is always
                    alluring, and we feel also, as we before observed, that a certain kind of
                    ugliness is sometimes respectable and imposing. But the Egyptian works of art
                    are not invariably ugly; there is nothing in which determined admirers will not
                    find beauty; but less suspicious witnesses, ordinary unprejudiced travellers,
                    declare they have found statues that were actually beautiful, particularly the
                    countenance of the famous »Sphinx.</p>
                <p>We have ventured to make these remarks on Egyptian art at the hazard perhaps of
                    appearing dogmatioal, for to express any opinion must have that appearance in
                    the eyes of those who have none; and it may be also somewhat paradoxical, for
                    such is the lot of all who venture to think for themselves, or even to adopt any
                    received opinions, except the most popular.</p>
                <p>The judgment of Strabo was not favourable to the Egyptian architecture. He seems
                    to consider it a barbarous style, that has nothing graceful or picturesque, and
                    that it displays only a vain waste of labour. His words are confined to some
                    particular temple, which he criticises: they seem, however, to admit of a
                    general application, and they express the opinion of many. Eσr∕ ⅛ <hi

                <p>“Immensa res est Aegyptiorum religio, seu cultus vetustatem specternus, seu
                    varietatem.” The immensity of the subject will deter us from entering upon it.
                    We may remark, however, in passing, that the worship of one favourite deity
                    still subsists in that country; we mean of <hi rend="italic">Aelurus,</hi> the
                    god cat. So great is the fondness of the Mahometans for that animal, and so
                    excessive their indulgence towards him, that they may be said still to worship
                    him in Egypt. The lady cat was not less a favourite than her lord; she was
                    equally adored, and her image was as frequently made. This matter is treated in
                    the 8th chapter of the 6th book of the supplement to Montfaucon.</p>
                <p>The Egyptians acquired some celebrity among other nations on account of their
                    adoration of vegetables and pot-herbs. No other people, however pious, have made
                    a pantheon of the kitchen-garden, unless we suppose that the Welsh, who are very
                    prone to religion, have succeeded them in the worship of the onion, in its
                    milder representative the leek; for the respect they show to that sacred plant
                    seems to be greater than the importance of its divine presence in mutton broth,
                    or even its fragrance to a Celtic nose, will warrant; and it seems, therefore,
                    to partake somewhat of the nature of a religious observance.</p>
                <p>An attentive consideration of the structure of the Greek' and Latin languages is
                    a labour that always insures its! own reward; but this department of the study
                    of anti- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> quity must be reserved for another
                    occasion. The assi- <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> duous reading of old books
                    forms of course a most important part of the study of which we treat. We would
                    not, however, determine the antiquity of a work merely by the number of ages
                    since it was written. A book may have been published in remote times, and yet it
                    may closely resemble a production of yesterday. If it affords examples of the
                    ancient modes of thinking and acting, it is well worthy of the attention of the
                    archaeologist, who estimates it according to the antiquity of the sentiments,
                    and not the date of the composition.</p>
                <p>The early antiquities of Greece are unfolded by several of the best masters of
                    language in the Greek tongue. Homer displays the heroic ages with a purity and
                    fidelity which are not less remarkable than his other transcendent merits. His
                    wonderful poems abound in every kind of archaisms, or may more truly be said to
                    be entirely composed of them. When we read him, we learn to think as Achilles
                    and Ulysses thought; we go back at once to the times when his specious miracles
                    were wrought; we are contemporaries of Priam and Helen; and we become as well
                    acquainted with the leaders of the Greeks as if we had passed a night with them
                    in the Trojan horse. Herodotus is the beautiful Ionic bridge of nine arches, by
                    which we pass from the heroic ages to the times of wonderful men—of Plato,
                    Pericles, Demosthenes, and the other worthies who flourished at different
                    periods of the Athenian republic, but are seen clustering together when viewed
                    at the distance we now regard them.</p>
                <p>Herodotus breathes the genuine spirit of antiquity. Be was wisely ordained to
                    effect the difficult and delicate transition from the mythic to the historical:
                    he has performed his office with pre-eminent skill, and has passed the golden
                    chain to his successors as he received it fro <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi> the
                    hands of him who took it up at its origin, the throne of the Olympian Jove.
                    These two authors, and the other <pb break="no" facs="nls:193098980"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-8980-0263"/>depositaries of Grecian antiquities, are studied,
                    not indeed so generally, so attentively, or so philosophically as we could wish;
                    but nevertheless they attract a certain degree of respect and observation. We
                    lament that the early antiquities of Rome, which are pregnant with interest and
                    instruction, are not always sought to be derived from the best sources. Virgil
                    is full of the sentiments and feelings of a Roman, and we cannot affirm that his
                    epic is neglected; nor the history of Livy, who has eloquently, and briefly
                    related the first fortunes of the eternal city; but we assert with regret, that
                    the most valuable and faithful historian of that remarkable period is at present
                    most unaccountably overlooked. We will venture to enlarge somewhat upon the
                    nature of the work to which we allude, in the hope that a few details may be a
                    relief to our readers after the very general observations we have alone been
                    able to make on an extensive subject; and we shall be truly happy if we attract
                    the public attention to, and succeed in any degree in rescuing from unmerited
                    neglect, the Roman Antiquities of Dionysius of Halicarnassus. If we compare our
                    English literature with that of other countries, we shall find it rich in many,
                    and indeed in most respects. There are a few subjects, however, as to which our
                    poverty is remarkable: it is perhaps the most remarkable as to translations from
                    Greek and Latin authors. The French have many good ones, which are much read. In
                    former times men of considerable eminence enriched the Italian language with
                    several valuable and excellent translations; and more recently in Germany,
                    writers of the greatest learning, and the highest reputation, have undertaken
                    this important task, and they have succeeded admirably, having produced
                    specimens of extraordinary merit, singular fidelity, and extensive popularity.
                    With us, on the contrary, if we make a very few exceptions, translators have
                    been persons of slender attainments and of very moderate diligence, who have
                    executed their important office in a slovenly manner, and whose productions are
                    hardly known by name, not only to ordinary readers, but even to persons of very
                    extensive general knowledge and large acquaintance with books in the English
                    language. The forcible expressions of Dryden concerning one of the early
                    translators of Polybius, are in a great degree applicable to our best English
                    interpreters: “Neither did that learned Italian, who had undertaken him, succeed
                    very happily in that endeavour; for the perfect knowledge of the Greek language
                    was not yet restored; and that translator was but as an one-eyed man amongst the
                    nation of the blind—only suffered until a better could be found to do right to
                    an author whose excellence required a more just interpreter than the ignorance
                    of that age afforded.”</p>
                <p>This deficiency is to be regretted, not only on account of the great majority of
                    readers (who are not, and cannot be acquainted with the learned languages,
                    especially with the Greek), because they are not furnished with the means of
                    studying in their own tongue the matter of many estimable authors; but it is to
                    be deplored also on account of the proficients in the learned languages
                    themselves, for of the great numbers who study them, few attain to a sufficient
                    familiarity, and enjoy leisure enough to read in the original all the voluminous
                    works that deserve to be perused, and to form a general idea of their contents.
                    The classical student is commonly only able to master some short works as
                    specimens of the rest, and some select passages from the larger works, and to
                    obtain thereby a higher and nobler idea of the force and beauty of style, and of
                    the powers of language and its perfections; and, by learning the grammar of
                    other languages, to gain a notion of universal grammar, and to learn us native
                    language grammatically; and therein he has his reward. But in order to make
                    himself acquainted with the contents of many important works, he needs
                    translations nearly as much as those who are entirely ignorant of the languages
                    in which they are written.</p>
                <p>It is singular that the same city produced the two great archaeologists of former
                    days: that Halicarnassus gave birth to the father of Grecian history, Herodotus,
                    to whom we owe our knowledge of the antiquities of Greece; and to Dionysius, the
                    author'of the Roman Antiquities, to whom we are equally indebted for the
                    principal part of the information that we possess respecting the earliest
                    institutions, and the history of the first ages of Rome. Dionysius came to Rome
                    in the reign of Augustus, at the conclusion of the civil wars. He resided for 22
                    years in the imperial city, and spent that long period in diligently collecting
                    materials for his work, in studying the Latin language, in reading all the
                    authors who had written concerning Roman affairs, and in constant personal
                    intercourse and intimacy with the great men of the time. His history was
                    comprehended in twenty books, and extended from the foundation of the city to
                    the commencement of the first Punic war, from which epoch Polybius had related
                    the Roman affairs with singular judgment and fidelity, in his inestimable work.
                    Of the twenty books eleven only remain, which comprise little more than the
                    first three centuries of the existence of Rome. The author manifests a profound
                    acquaintance with the matters of which he treats. He fully illustrates the
                    manners and customs of the ancient Romans, their laws, religion, and discipline
                    in peace and war, explaining many antiquated expressions and names, and relating
                    the origin of states and cities; and his knowledge of geography and chronology
                    is remarkable, and gives an additional value to his work. He is not only more
                    full than Livy, since he expands into eleven books a period of more than 300
                    years, which is condensed into three books by the Roman historian; but he is
                    admitted also to be more exact and correct, and is universally acknowledged to
                    be the most valuable of all the historians of Roman affairs.</p>
                <p>The Greek writers are our best and most instructive guides in all that respects
                    the Romans, because they wrote for Greeks, that is to say, for persons who were
                    ignorant of the Roman manners and institutions; and they address themselves, as
                    it were, <hi rend="italic">to us.</hi> The Romans wrote in the Latin language,
                    and their compositions were intended to be read by those who were already
                    familiar with the subjects of which they treat. They allude therefore to
                    domestic matters with extreme brevity; and their allusions are always obscure,
                    and would commonly be unintelligible to us, but for the explanations with which
                    we are supplied by the more copious Greeks, who being strangers themselves,
                    write with a fulness which strangers can understand. Without the foreign
                    authors, and especially without Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the knowledge of the
                    moderns, if it were derived from Latin sources alone, would be very scanty and
                    unsatisfactory. The most valuable Roman histories are those which are written in
                    Greek. Except Plutarch’s Lives, Greek writers concerning Roman affairs have been
                    little read in England. The histories in Greek are all imperfect; they have
                    discovered more or less, and some portions only remain. An old French translator
                    of Appian expresses his high sense of their value in a quaint manner. In
                    reference to this, he says that the Deity was so much offended at the bloodshed,
                    oppression, and cruelties, through which the Roman empire was founded, that in
                    order to deprive the Romans of a part of the glory which they sought by these
                    misdeeds, and as an adequate punishment, he has not suffered any one of the
                    histories which manifest their glory to reach us entire.</p>

                <p>It would be easy to bring a host of testimonies to the great value of Dionysius.
                    Among the ancients, Eusebius praises his remarkable accuracy; Cyril bears
                    witness of his great fame; Photius celebrates his diligence, and the simplicity,
                    sweetness, and beauty of his style; and Suidas his universal erudition. Since
                    the restoration of letters, learned men have vied with each other in commending
                    him. It is needless to repeat the encomiums of Paulus Manutius, Joseph Scaliger,
                    Justus Lipsius, Sigonius, Petavius, Salmasius, Isaac Casaubon, Le Clerc, and
                    Vossius, or even to enumerate the names of the great critics by whom he has been
                    extolled, and of whom some, as Henry Stephens, prefer him on many accounts to
                    his great rival Livy. One reason for his preference is philosophical, and worthy
                    to be stated; he says that the history of Livy is military, and that of
                    Dionysius civil. Dionysius is much read on the Continent by the French, Germans,
                    and Dutch. He is the delight of the Italians, and has long been a favourite and
                    popular author in Italy. Angelo Maio, in his courtly yet dignified dedication of
                    a work, of which we will speak presently, to the present emperor of Austria,
                    says that the emperor once told him he had often read the history of Dionysius
                    with great interest: “Tum etiam addidisti magno tibi studio Halicarnasseum
                    Dionysium jam inde ab annis virentibus lectitatum.” Although a lively interest,
                    and as it were a certain sympathy, is felt by the English in Roman history, he
                    has not yet become familiar to us. An Englishman, Hudson, published at Oxford an
                    excellent and splendid edition of the original Greek text; but it has found few
                    readers in this country. The Greek poets are chiefly studied at our
                    universities, and some portions of some of the Attic prose writers: the style of
                    Dionysius is certainly difficult to those who are not acquainted with other
                    authors. He is not read therefore in the ordinary course of education; and the
                    studies of scholars who are so happy as to be able to keep up their knowledge of
                    Greek are commonly directed by circumstances into a different channel. The Roman
                    Antiquities have been translated into English some time since, by Edward
                    Spelman. Although this is not by any means one of our worst translations, yet it
                    is not such as ought to satisfy the lover of Roman history. It is not easy to
                    assign a reason why the writer, from whom we derive the best and most detailed
                    account of the institutions of Rome, should not be a general favourite in
                    England; and why we take our information at second hand from those who have
                    compiled histories of Rome by drawing largely upon him. Dionysius has been
                    blamed for inserting fables; but, if it be a crime, he is less guilty in this
                    respect than Livy; and it is not easy to say by what authority he could take
                    upon himself to reject those portions of early history which, however
                    incredible, were generally received in Rome; and, in the account of an
                    extraordinary people, the history of their superstitions is not without its use.
                    He was moreover a person of distinguished piety; and it is not a little curious
                    to compare the religious feelings, notions, and practices, of those times with
                    the superstitious observances of the over-zealous of our own days. He was well
                    skilled also in the philosophy of the ancient world, and is rich in valuable and
                    instructive reflections, which illustrate the state of opinion in the Augustan
                    age; and his morality (and this is no ordinary merit in any writer, but
                    especially in a historian) is generally of the highest order; and he powerfully
                    and authoritatively inculcates, with all the powers of consistent integrity, and
                    the authority of superior learning, the paramount importance of justice, whether
                    public or private, and the great interests of virtue. A notion has prevailed in
                    England, which appears to have originated in France, that he is not an agreeable
                    writer. It is commonly asserted and believed that his style is flat and languid,
                    and he is said to be a rhetorician. A conceited French Jesuit, named René Rapin,
                    set the fashion in France, which has prevailed there, and in England also to a
                    certain extent, t <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> undervalue Dionysius as a writer.
                    His petulant editor Reiske has adopted it, and Mr Gibbon, a man infinitely
                    superior to Rapin or Reiske, repeats the censure, but with considerable
                    mitigation. Mr Gibbon derived his tastes and his principles chiefly from French
                    writers; and the style which he has adopted in his own immortal work shows that
                    he had no taste for a full and copious narrative, but was of opinion that a
                    history, like the response of an oracle, should be conveyed in brief, obscure,
                    enigmatical allusions. A modern French writer, Schoell, strong in the confi.
                    dence of ignorance, ventures to say, “son style, formé d’après celui de Polybe,
                    son modele, n’est pas toujours d’une pureté classique.” Dionysius, in common
                    with all judicious critics, duly appreciated the civil prudence and military
                    knowledge, the fidelity, accuracy, and good sense, and all the estimable
                    qualities of Polybius; but so far was he from taking his style as a model, that
                    he places him among those writers whose style is the most faulty, and whose
                    works, on that account, it is hardly possible to read to the end. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Be</hi><hi rend="italic">Structura Orationis,</hi> sect. 4.) As
                    to the complaint that he was a rhetorician, it cannot be denied that we are
                    indebted to him for the best rhetorical treatises in the Greek tongue. It is
                    certain that he was a rhetorician, but that he was nota <hi rend="italic"
                    >mere</hi> rhetorician is equally certain. The cultivation of language was
                    carried to so great an extent in the time of Dionysius, that the most eminent
                    men produced works on that subject; and Julius Caesar himself, as is well known,
                    was the author of a grammatical or rhetorical treatise, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Be</hi><hi rend="italic">Analogia,</hi> which was esteemed. That Caesar was not
                    a <hi rend="italic">mere</hi> rhetorician, was a misfortune to Rome and to the
                    world.</p>
                <p>The error of undervaluing a writer of the Augustan age because he was skilled in
                    rhetoric, arises from confounding different times. Subsequently there were no
                    other pursuits than grammar, rhetoric, and the like; learned mèn were <hi
                    rend="italic">mere</hi> rhetoricians, and nothing more, and were not good even
                    in that narrow line, to which a hopeless despotism had confined their
                    energies.</p>
                <p>Dionysius has also been censured for having introduced too many orations into his
                    history; but he abounds less in speeches than many other historians who are
                    highly esteemed. He had studied oratory with great attention, and had composed
                    criticisms on the principal orators of Greece, which are still extant, and are
                    highly and deservedly prized. It was natural, therefore, that he should
                    endeavour to put in practice the rules of composition which he had laid down in
                    such a masterly manner; and many of his harangues have been warmly praised by
                    very competent judges, for great magnificence of language, a rich vein of good
                    sense, a remarkable elegance and address in the selection and arrangement of
                    arguments, and indeed for all the resources of eloquence. If the speeches are
                    sometimes long, they are never superfluous; they are, in truth, merely a mode of
                    relating events, and differ from ordinary narrative in manner only. Occurrences,
                    instead of being told in the common course of history, for the sake of variety,
                    and to produce a lively and dramatic effect, are detailed in an oration: they
                    are shown not only as effects, but as causes—as causes in actual operation, and
                    as producing the consequences that flowed from them; and are thus more deeply
                    impressed on the mind of the reader. No one can pretend that the person to whom
                    the speech is attributed delivered it in the precise words used by the
                    historian. That he did make a speech at Rome, where it was usual to do so on <pb

                    rend="subscript"> l</hi> many occasions, is highly probable: it may in many
                    cases ,be related by contemporary writers as a fact, and as a part of the
                    history of the transaction. In order that he may fully understand the subject,
                    and, of course, the motives of the principal actors, a careful writer, who is
                    about to compose a history, studies the whole matter with the utmost diligence.
                    It is true that he may have failed alto- ∏∙ether; for men fail in all
                    undertakings: but if he has been successful in discovering the motives of the
                    speaker, it is likely that the speech is in substance the same as that which was
                    actually delivered ;—that it was the same in words we cannot suppose ;—indeed,
                    some of the best histories are in a language different from that which was
                    spoken by the persons whose acts or fortunes are related.</p>
                <p>Since sceptical history has been fashionable, too low a value has been put upon
                    such writers as Dionysius. The French invented sceptical, or, as they term it,
                    philosophical history; and they conducted their inquiries, although somewhat
                    arbitrarily, yet with a certain tact, with ingenuity and good taste. The Germans
                    adopted it, as they are wont, without acknowledgement; and using greater
                    erudition [and elaboration, and every variety of uncommon sense, 'outraged and
                    caricatured it, and rendered investigation so ridiculous, that the only way to
                    avoid being laughed at seems now to be to believe every thing we read. It was
                    once asked, What is truth? and the question did not receive an answer: in like
                    manner we may ask, What is probability? If every reader may reject whatever
                    appears improbable to himself, the page of history will soon become as naked and
                    bare as the head of the middle-aged bigamist, who, as the fable tells us,
                    married an old and a young wife.</p>
                <p>If Livy and Dionysius, who lived so much nearer to the times of which they write,
                    were unable, by reason of the great antiquity, to discover the truth, how is it
                    possible for a professor on the banks of the Rhine, the Seine, or the Thames,
                    nearly 2000 years after, to find what has been so much longer hidden? Livy
                    honestly and modestly gives up the hopeless attempt in despair, and says, “Cura
                    non deesset, si qua ad verum via inquirentem ferret: nunc famae rerum standum
                    est, ubi certam derogat vetustas fidem.” It would be a pious and profitable
                    work, to the studious reader at least, if not to the patriotic translator, to
                    make a new translation of the Roman Antiquities, a book which has been justly
                    called a <hi rend="superscript"> flt</hi> grave, learned, accurate, and golden
                    volume,” the production of an author who has been said with equal justice “to
                    have written better about the Romans than they did about themselves.” To
                    translate it as it deserves, and to the entire satisfaction of the translator,
                    would demand great natural and acquired powers, and a very long period of
                    uninterrupted leisure; but to induce some learned man to attempt to render it
                    into English, in some respects at least according to the idea of accurate
                    interpretation which we form in the mind, and to give it in such a shape as
                    would be acceptable and agreeable to the English reader, and might become
                    popular, is all that we can venture to hope in our most sanguine moments.</p>
                <p>Angelo Maio, the librarian of the Vatican library at Rome, published, a few years
                    since, from a manuscript in the Ambrosian library at Milan, an abstract or
                    epitome of the last nine books, which are lost. Photius informs us that
                    Dionysius made such an epitome of the entire work himself; and the learned
                    editor is of ,opinion that the manuscript which he discovered contains a copy of
                    the author’s own abridgement. Some critics have doubted whether it be the work
                    of which Photius speaks; but it ' <hi rend="superscript"> as</hi> not been
                    doubted that the fragments are portions of the lost books of Dionysius, although
                    they question whether the selection was made by himself.</p>
                <p>As they contain many very interesting passages, and relate to that period of the
                    republic of which the existing memorials are the most scanty, and have never
                    been published in English, it would be desirable to add a translation of the
                    epitome, and thus to complete, as far as is possible, the history of Rome from
                    its foundation to the beginning of the first Punic war. A benevolent translator,
                    who sought to serve his country by the diffusion of useful knowledge, would
                    give, in a preface of moderate dimensions, an account of the author, and of his
                    other compositions, and of the different editions and translations of this work,
                    so far as they are of importance; of its general design and nature; and such
                    observations respecting the Romans, as would facilitate the understanding of
                    their ancient history. He would add notes to illustrate obscure passages, to
                    point out ambiguities, and wherever the interpretation admits of variety;
                    together with references to authors who confirm, contradict, or differ from
                    Dionysius; comprehending also additional explanations of the laws, rites,
                    customs, and institutions, wherever these are to be obtained, and the author
                    seems to need them; and such information respecting the .earlier writers who are
                    cited in the Roman Antiquities, and their works, as can be gleaned from
                    trustworthy sources. In writing notes, to be plain and intelligible ought to be
                    the constant aim of an annotator. He ought especially to keep in view the grand
                    object, utility; he should religiously avoid the discussion of trifles, however
                    tempting they may be on account of their, difficulty, or as furnishing
                    opportunities for the display of fruitless ingenuity, a vain ostentation of
                    learning, and the empty parade of citation; he should seek to gather the fruits
                    of erudition, wherever they are within his reach, and should permit the leaves
                    of pedantry to remain untouched, and rustle in the winds.</p>
                <p>We have ventured thus to enlarge upon the merits of Dionysius, because we are
                    persuaded, that a careful perusal of the historical works of this neglected
                    author would greatly assist the student in forming correct and clear notions of
                    the more ancient, fundamental, and original institutions, which properly belong
                    to the study of antiquities.</p>
                <p>We may consider the civil law as forming a most valuable ingredient in the
                    general education of a scholar and a citizen on three accounts. Isř, It is
                    useful to the legislator, to teach him, by the efficacious discipline of good
                    examples, in what manner to make laws, and how to clothe them in language at

                    point of view; but we are afraid to commit ourselves to this vast ocean of
                    erudition, and must be satisfied with having merely indicated it as an
                    inexhaustible mine of antiquarian wealth.</p>
                <p>The beauty, variety, and richness of the precious re-, mains of antiquity (that
                    we may resume the general con-, sidération of the subject) are sometimes even
                    oppressive; and they overpower the mind, when it contemplates attentively the
                    great theme of ancient excellence. We endeavour naturally to discover the cause
                    of this excellence, but we are not competent fully to solve the problem ;— we
                    are perhaps able to make some approaches towards its. solution. The inhabitants
                    of Athens, that we may go at once to the centre and fountain-head, were not less
                    distinguished for and characterized by an intense love of and passion for the
                    beautiful, and by the universality of good taste, than by an extreme tolerance.
                    There was nothing extravagant in the productions of the imagination in <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193099019" xml:id="kp-eb0703-9019-0266"/> that free city;
                    but how much, and what monstrous extravagance, do we constantly find, combined
                    with great genius and invention, in the compositions of men who lived under
                    despotism? If good taste was universal in Athens, it was very general in
                    Florence in the best days of that state, when its inhabitants enjoyed a great
                    but inferior degree of civilization. Under the ecclesiastical government of
                    modern Rome there has always been, on account of the weakness of the rulers,
                    much licentiousness, and a considerable portion of practical freedom, together
                    with a correct taste in the fine arts. We may remark, by the way, that the papal
                    government, like that of Athens, for many ages contrived to produce the greatest
                    effects with the most scanty means; and the history of the holy see proves that
                    its occupier, like the people of Athens, seldom failed to promote learned and
                    able men, and freely to acknowledge on all occasions the pre-eminence of
                    learning. Clement VIII., on nominating the celebrated Jesuit and archbishop of
                    Capua, Bellarmin, declared publicly, “We choose him cardinal because the church
                    of God does not possess his equal in learning.” The history of the successors of
                    St Peter, if such they were, is replete with examples of the same wise policy.
                    To convince ourselves that good taste prevails exactly in proportion as works of
                    art are addressed to the people at large, and designed for public inspection, it
                    is only necessary to look around us. At Rome, where they are freely thrown open
                    to all, the works of the government are in a pure taste; in Paris they arc less
                    public, and less correct: if there be any country in the west of Europe where
                    the monarch lives in complete seclusion among his household ministers and women,
                    as in the East, we may safely conclude, that whatever works are executed at the
                    public expense, but are not intended to be submitted to the public view, are
                    conceived in the worst and most vulgar and degraded taste, and that they are
                    worthy of a Byzantine emperor or an oriental prince. The history of the
                    declining empire, and the specimens of art of the first ages of Christianity
                    that still remain, demonstrate that the fine arts were corrupted and lost when
                    they ceased to be employed for public purposes, and ministered only to the
                    private and selfish gratification of emperors and wealthy individuals, who
                    consumed the property of the people in monstrous and guilty luxury.</p>
                <p>If the greatness of the ancients be a wonderful and inexplicable thing, it is not
                    less wonderful how this greatness was destroyed and annihilated. The more we
                    consider the ancient world, the more astonishing does this total destruction
                    appear. Many ingenious men have attempted to assign the true causes, but no one
                    has fully succeeded hitherto in explaining the extraordinary catastrophe. If we
                    might venture to hazard a conjecture on the obscure subject, we should be
                    inclined to attribute it principally to intolerance. The steady growth of this
                    baneful disposition gradually destroyed every thing: by continually dividing and
                    subdividing, the great masses were reduced to smaller, these again to fragments,
                    and finally to mere dust, which was blown away by the wind. The greatest men are
                    always the least orthodox, because they think most; and men who think for
                    themselves cannot fall into the common tracks, at least for a long line of road.
                    The ignorant and dull, on the contrary, who do not exercise their
                    understandings, but the memory only, learn easily to repeat the watchwords of
                    some narrow sect, which, as they are few in number, are not easily forgotten;
                    and having no originality to lead them astray, they outbid their superiors, and
                    produce more of the only coin that is current, and have nothing to fear but the
                    more tenacious memories of their inferiors in ability. Wherever orthodoxy of any
                    kind whatever is acknowledged as the test and criterion of success and merit;
                    the mark of contraband is set upon talent, and a premium, a right of
                    pre-emption, and a secure monopoly, are given to the base and vile. It is to
                    this fatal cause we would attribute the utter extinction of the ancient glory. •
                    In studying the remains of antiquity, we ought to entertain with modest
                    confidence the encouraging hope, that the day will arrive when the ancient
                    excellence will be equalled, or even surpassed; and we ought especially to
                    cherish and foster the generous desire of imitating the objects which we
                    reverently admire. It has even been said that we ought to be prejudiced in
                    favour of these works, to be predisposed to admire them,· to view them with the
                    eye of faith; that it is very easy to persuade ourselves we see nothing
                    remarkable in them, but very difficult to appreciate them fully, and to
                    understand thoroughly their value. We conceive, however, that it is-not easy to
                    show that any advantage would be gained by substituting faith as a guide for the
                    understanding in the place of reason, or that our judgment ought not to be
                    directed by certain rules, which will admit of being stated, examined, and
                    compared among themselves, and with the principles of things. To place the
                    standard of excellence high, and to set a high value upon excellence, is
                    favourable to a generous emulation, and conduces to ultimate success. It is
                    unnecessary to caution the reader against a blind admiration of antiquity. The
                    general indifference of an age, in which he who knows any thing is apt to
                    imagine that he knows it <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> through the
                    uninstructed force of his own mind, and which is sufficiently disposed to
                    consider itself wiser than any that preceded it, to the knowledge of past times,
                    will insure him against an excess in this respect. It is not without much
                    hesitation that the maxim, <hi rend="italic">peritiores</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vetustas facit,</hi> will now be admitted.</p>
                <p>We will readily concede, however, that the respect for the wisdom of our
                    ancestors may easily be carried too far, especially if that wisdom was
                    manifested in barbarous ages; and a reverence for authority that leads us
                    entirely to distrust our own powers would disable us, and render us incapable of
                    exertion or improvement. It would be difficult to decide whether we should err
                    more grossly in believing nothing that we read, or in yielding implicit faith to
                    the assertions of every author.</p>
                <p>The taste of the present age is somewhat inclined to favour historical
                    scepticism. A specimen of easy credulity will not be the less amusing on account
                    of its old-fashioned air. We transcribe the following passage from <hi
                    rend="italic">L’</hi><hi rend="italic">Antiquité Expliquée</hi> of Montfaucon,
                    tome i. p. 44:— “Jupiter le Pluvieux, Pluvius, appelle par les Grecs Zw¢ <hi
                    rend="italic">ομβξ</hi> ∣ <hi rend="italic">ος,</hi> et par Lucien <hi
                    rend="italic">υίτιος,</hi> étoit honoré par les Athéniens, qui lui avoient
                    dressé un autel sur le Mont Hymette. Nous le donnons d’une manière bien
                    extraordinaire, tel qu’il est représenté dans la colonne Antonine. C’est un
                    vicillard à longue barbe, qui a des ailes, et qui tient les deux bras étendus,
                    et la main droite un peu élevée: l’eau sort à grands flots de ses bras et de sa
                    barbe. Les soldats Romains de l’armée de Marc Aurele, que la secheresse et la
                    soif avoit réduits à one extrême nécessité, reçoivent cette eau dans le creux de
                    leurs boucliers. Les Romains, plongés encore dans le paganisme, attribuèrent ce
                    prodige à leur Jupiter Pluvieux. Mais ce furent, dit avec plus de raison
                    Baronius dans ses Annales, les soldats Chrétiens qui obtinrent cette pluie qui
                    sauva l’armée.” This passage is conceived in the true spirit in which marvellous
                    relations ought to be read, if we desire to have history stuffed full of
                    wonders. The miracle itself ought to be accepted as an undoubted' fact, without
                    scruple <hi rend="superscript"> or</hi> hesitation; and the only difference of
                    opinion among historians ought to be as to the authority or influence to which
                    it is justly to be attributed. There would have <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193099032" xml:id="kp-eb0703-9032-0267"/>been many more specimens of
                    ancient art in existence at 'present, if this amicable and pacific credulity had
                    prevailed ’n all ages, and to the full extent to which it might, with advantage
                    to society, be carried; if the tolerant rule of conduct had been to repair the
                    temple, to spare and hospitably to entertain the statue, to preserve the
                    sculpture or painting, but to apply different names to them, and to use them for
                    various purposes, according to the fancy and fashion of the age. The figure of
                    Jupiter Pluvius of Montfaucon is really very curious: he is flowing with water,
                    which is descending in torrents from every part, his left wing only excepted. We
                    find the same figure of this deity in the work of the learned Roman John Baptist
                    Casalius, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Urbis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ac Romani olim Imperii Splendore</hi> (p∙ 49), represented in a rude but
                    spirited sketch, with the attendant circumstances: for the particulars of the
                    story we are referred to Baronius, <hi rend="italic">sub anno</hi> 176. The
                    crosses <hi rend="italic">fleuris</hi> on the shields of the soldiers in the
                    latter engraving are, we presume, an addition of the engraver, or perhaps of
                    Pope Sixtus V., who repaired the column of ∖ntoninus.</p>
                <p>The captivating fables of the ancient mythology are useful as a part of liberal
                    education; and it is good for children to read them in order to form the
                    imagination. It is a vulgar and a pernicious error to believe that this faculty
                    may be neglected with impunity. Persons in whom, through a narrow and vicious
                    institution, the cultivation of the invention has been neglected, have rarely
                    reached great eminence; and if by diligently exercising the reasoning powers
                    they have for a short time attained to some small reputation, they have scarcely
                    ever been able to sustain, much less to increase it. Whenever they have
                    attempted to exert their unformed fancy, and to extend thereby their fame, they
                    have commonly made themselves ridiculous, by failing in inventing something
                    probable, and falling into the monstrous: their fictions moreover want the
                    attractiveness which a practised taste can alone give to the creations of the
                    imagination. The most acute logical powers, and the most profound knowledge of
                    the rules of rhetoric and criticism, are unavailing without the higher faculty
                    of invention, which discovers arguments and apposite illustrations, and finds
                    the proper media of conviction and persuasion. Truth is undoubtedly the end of
                    knowledge, but it commonly happens that the end can only be attained through the
                    means of fiction. Whatever departments of knowledge are suited to the wants and
                    capacities of children, are also adapted for the lower orders, who in many
                    respects are always children of a taller stature. The common people can
                    understand and feel the advantage of amusements, of cultivating the feelings and
                    the taste for the beautiful, but they are unable to learn the abstract sciences,
                    and it would be of no service to endeavour to teach them. As men begin to take
                    an interest in general matters, they cease to be curious concerning particulars.
                    To get rid, therefore, of the minute and troublesome curiosity which is the
                    infallible characteristic of the ignorant and vulgar, and is strong exactly in
                    proportion to the want of mental cultivation, every encouragement ought to be
                    afforded to honourable recreations and liberal studies. The equality <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> of the political rights of every citizen has been
                    perhaps more distinctly acknowledged in modern times; and if it be clearly
                    ascertained and firmly secured, much, no doubt, is done to assure the wellbeing
                    of civil society. Many other institutions besides those which are required for
                    this purpose are nevertheless essential, or at least highly conducive, to the
                    happiness of mankind. Men have other wants besides security, liberty, and
                    equality; and for some of them better provision was made in certain states of
                    antiquity than in the present days the people have thought proper to demand, or
                    their rulers to grant. For the amusement of the lower classes, although
                    diversions may; be more requisite in some climates than in others, they' are of
                    more importance in all than is commonly supposed: for the cultivation of their
                    tastes, and for many parts of their education, much labour and money, much
                    thought and talent, were employed in Greece and in Rome. Refinement and civility
                    were accordingly universally diffused, and the general happiness of society was
                    greatly augmented; for the people were rendered capable of new and exquisite
                    pleasures, and these pleasures were liberally supplied to them. In countries
                    where no wish to gratify and indulge the lower ranks is manifested by their
                    superiors, but rather a desire to thwart their diversions, and a sullen pride in
                    interfering with the few pleasures they are capable of creating for themselves,
                    the unhappy result is, that a general rudeness and disgusting brutality become
                    the common characteristics of the labouring classes.</p>
                <p>To be fully impressed with the great truth, that amusement is as necessary to man
                    as bread, it is requisite to consult the golden pages of antiquity: it is
                    unfortunately not very easy to state in a few words where the student can find
                    the best expositors of those pages. A good work is needed to guide us in the
                    vast labyrinth of past ages; a work that would avoid on the one hand a vague and
                    desultory manner of treating the subject, and on the other those minute details
                    which are interesting only to professed artists and archaeologists; a work that
                    would reject the husks and retain the nutritive parts of erudition. Writers have
                    hitherto in general· reversed this rule, and given abundant cause for the
                    complaint, “Eantique n’a servi à la plupart des savans qu’à étaler one immense
                    érudition, et il a été regardé comme peu fait pour nourrir l’esprit.” No profane
                    literature is more tiresome than the commentaries on ancient works of art by
                    ordinary antiquaries; they are dull and heavy with heaped up citations. There is
                    much scope for felicitous innovation in such a work as we desire. Of many of the
                    remains of ancient art only conjectural explanations have been given, which in
                    some cases are tolerably satisfactory; in many others it is impossible to
                    acquiesce in them: so is it also in truth with many passages of the
                    classics,—the ignorant reader can alone rest content with the interpretation
                    they ordinarily receive.</p>
                <p>It is sometimes a difficult matter to detect restorations; and the art of the
                    critic, who would decide as to the genuineness of antiques, is not unfrequent]y
                    perplexed. By not distinguishing the modern restorations from the original
                    composition, many ludicrous mistakes have been committed: it would be the duty,
                    therefore, of the accomplished guide to render us assistance in this delicate
                    department, and to lay down for our direction sound canons of criticism.
                    Impediments have been thrown in the way of the study of antiquity. This
                    legitimate pursuit has been superseded and brought into discredit by the
                    spurious imitation of the antiquary, by an insane fondness for our own barbarous
                    antiquities, for heraldic trumpery, and similar trifling. We recall the
                    remembrance of days when every thing was worse than at present, that we may
                    learn to shun, not to imitate. They are happy who have had free access in their
                    youth to good copies and representations of the antiques, and thrice happy who
                    have, been able at any period of life to study many of the originals. .</p>
                <p>The sedulous vulgar, seeking to degrade what they are unable to understand, speak
                    slightingly of looking at pictures, as if it were one of the many forms of
                    idleness; but the studious read not in books alone, and it must be a good modern
                    book which contains as much instruction as a tolerable engraving of an antique.
                    The ancient works of art have been engraved with a suitable spirit <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193099045" xml:id="kp-eb0703-9045-0268"/> and effect by the
                    Italians almost alone of nations. Whenever the French artists draw or engrave
                    from the antique, they pretend to imitate the severity and simplicity of the
                    ancients, and outrage even their own natural hardness, and, with very few
                    exceptions, cease to be only painful, and become intolerable. It is to be
                    regretted that this acute and enterprising nation cannot enter into the feeling
                    of the antique; for they have, with the most laudable zeal and exemplary
                    diligence, studied the science of antiquity. The numerous plates in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Encyclopédie Méthodique</hi> on the subject of antiquities are
                    ugly, and the explanations and disquisitions are confused and senseless. <hi

                    is an immense body of information, written in French and in Latin, adorned with
                    numberless plates. The learned and laborious compiler, Dorn Montfaucon, as we
                    before observed, is credulous and injudicious; and so much has been discovered
                    since his time, that his work is very incomplete. It is however deservedly
                    popular; scarcely any other work is consulted in England, except by a few. The
                    great size of this compilation, which consists, including the supplement, of ten
                    ponderous volumes in folio, places it out of the reach of all but the wealthy;
                    and so is it unhappily with many other works that are important and indeed
                    essential to the study of antiquities. They are to be found, it is true, in
                    every well-stocked library; but private collections are of course accessible to
                    a few only: and although there are many excellent and ample libraries; where the
                    books are the property of the public, students are, with very f <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ew</hi> exceptions, shut out. Count Caylus, a true practical
                    phi. losopher, complains somewhere of the jealousy of the king of Spain with
                    regard to antiques. In this matter as Well as in others, and elsewhere as well
                    as in Spain, subjects have hitherto been too complaisant to their rulers, and
                    the best governments have not been sufficiently liberal in encouraging learning.
                    We will refer the student to one valuable guide, the admirable Winckelmann,
                    recommending him at the same time to read his works, like all German books, with
                    extreme caution; not because the author has any design to deceive others, but
                    because he is indued with a remarkable aptitude to be himself deceived.</p>
                <p>If we have succeeded in any degree in leading the fu∙ ture inquiries of our
                    readers to the conclusion, that the spirit and tendency of the institutions of
                    antiquity were generally favourable to the advancement and improvement of the
                    human mind, we shall have laid a solid ground for the veneration which we are
                    ourselves disposed to claim for them. On account of their intrinsic merit in
                    other respects, but especially on account of their popular character, and their
                    design to promote human happiness, we venture with some confidence to adopt and
                    repeat the well-known advice of Pliny: “Reverere gloriam veterem, et hanc ipsam
                    senectutem, quae in homine venerabilis, in urbibus sacra est: sit apud to honor
                    antiquitatis, sit ingentibus factis, sit fabulis quoque.”</p>
