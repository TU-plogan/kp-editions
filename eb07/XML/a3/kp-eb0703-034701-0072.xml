                    true insects, . and as such classed by Linnaeus in his order Aptera, under the

                    >Acarus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Scorpio.</hi> The Arachnides were first
                    formed into a distinct class by Μ. Lamarck, whose arrangement of the Linnaean
                    Aptera is admitted by Latreille to approach the most nearly to the natural
                    order.</p>
                <p>The third primary division in the system of Cuvier, that of the articulated
                    animals <hi rend="italic">(animalia articulata),</hi> contains four great
                    classes, viz. <hi rend="smallcaps">Annelides, Crustacea,</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Arachnides,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Insecta.</hi> We have
                    already stated our intention (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Animal Kingdom)</hi> to
                    treat of the first of these classes under the title of Helminthology, of the
                    last under Entomology, and of the two intermediate classes in the order of their
                    alphabetical occurrence. We shall I therefore now proceed with the history and
                    classification of Arachnides.</p>
                <p>The naturalists who preceded Lamarck appear to have confounded this class either
                    with the true Insecta, or with the crustaceous tribes, such as crabs and
                    lobsters. It was in the course of his public lectures (in 1800) that the
                    last-named, observer instituted for their reception a separate class, under the
                    title which they now bear.</p>
                <p>Cuvier, in one of his earliest works (<hi rend="italic">Tableau</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Elémentaire</hi><hi rend="italic">de l’Hist. Nat.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Animaux,</hi> 1798), continued, with his contemporaries, to
                    class the Arachnides with insects, of which he regarded them as forming the
                    third principal division, preceded only by the Crustacea and Myriapoda; thus far
                    departing from and improving the old Linnaean system, by assigning them a higher
                    place in his general arrangement, but not yet admitting them to the honour of a
                    separate class.</p>
                <p>Lamarck published the first edition of his <hi rend="italic">Systeme</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des</hi><hi rend="italic">Animaux sans Vertèbres</hi> in the year
                    1801, and he there explains the reasons which induced him to form the separation
                    previously advocated in his lectures.</p>
                <p>Μ. Latreille did not admit the <hi rend="italic">classic</hi> separation of the
                    Arachnides, either in his <hi rend="italic">Histoire Naturelle de Crustacés et
                    des Insectes</hi> (1802-5), or in his later work, the <hi rend="italic">Genera
                    Cηιstaccorum</hi><hi rend="italic">et Insectorum</hi> (1806-7), but merely
                    placed them at the head of the class of insects. In a subsequent volume, however
                    <hi rend="italic">(Considérations Generales sur</hi><hi rend="italic">l’</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ordre Naturel des Crustacés,</hi> &amp;c. 1810), he practically
                    admits the propriety of Μ. Lamarck’s views; and in it we find the Arachnides
                    forming a separate class, and constituted of the same materials as those used by
                    his predecessor. In that portion of Baron Cuvier’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Regne</hi><hi rend="italic">Animal</hi> (vol. iii. 1817) of which Μ. Latreille
                    is the author, we find the same arrangement followed, with this exception, that
                    in the last-named work the Myriapoda and Chelopoda are removed from the
                    Arachnides and placed at the head of the class Insecta—a modification likewise
                    adhered to both in the <hi rend="italic">Familles Naturelles du Règne
                    Animal</hi> (1825), and in the recent edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Règne</hi><hi rend="italic">Animal</hi> itself ( 1829), which contains the
                    latest view of Μ. Latreille. By these, in as far as concerns our general
                    principles of arrangement, 've shall be chiefly guided in the course of this
                    article; but we conceive it due to Μ. Lamarck to present our readers, in the
                    first place, with a short statement of his opinions.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the <hi rend="italic">Histoire Naturelle

                <p>He defines the Arachnides as follows: Oviparous animals, at all times provided
                    with articulated legs,—not subject to metamorphoses, nor ever acquiring new
                    kinds of organs. Respiration tracheal or branchial: stigmatiform openings for
                    the entrance of the air. A rudimentary heart and circulation in the greater
                    proportion of species. Copulationes plures per vitam in plurimis.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Animalia ovipara, pedibus
                    articulatis in omni tempore instructa, ad metamorphoses non subjecta, nec nova

                    aeris intromissione stigmatiformibus. Cor circulatioque in pluribus inchoatis.

                <p>It is known that no vertebrated animal provided with feet has ever more than
                    four; and that among such as are invertebrated, those which in a state of
                    complete development are provided with feet, have never less than six. Amongst
                    invertebrated animals, insects have essentially the smallest number of feet; for
                    the various orders and families of that class, when arrived at their final
                    development, have never more than six. They are hence called <hi rend="italic"
                    >hexapods</hi> by some modern writers. It is otherwise, however, with the
                    Crustacea and Arachnides, the greater proportion of which have more than six
                    feet. Certain species, in their earliest state, have no more than that number;
                    but their other feet appear as they advance in age. A few are hexapod, or
                    six-footed, during the entire term of their existence; but in addition to those
                    characters which determine the class to which they belong, various other
                    relations connect them with their congeners, and show that they are not genuine
                    insects.</p>
                <p>Among those articulated animals which possess no system of circulation, insects
                    alone undergo genuine metamorphoses; and none of the Arachnides are subject to
                    such changes. Now, as all Arachnides are essentially distinct from the
                    Crustacea, and as they differ from insects in the important characteristic just
                    mentioned, it follows, according to Μ. Lamarck, that they constitute an
                    assemblage of beings which ought not to be held in separation, however
                    diversified they may be in various points of their organization.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable circumstances in the structure of Arachnides are the
                    following: That while many of these creatures are obviously provided with a
                    circulating system, others present no vestige of that system; that the former
                    breathe by means of branchial cells, while the latter respire through tracheae;
                    and that certain tribes are provided with antennae, and others are entirely
                    destitute of any such organs. These apparent non-conformities of structure
                    result from this, that throughout the extended course of their class, the
                    organization of the Arachnides undergoes rapid and remarkable changes; and if in
                    the course of our observations we were to attend not only to the differences of
                    external or internal parts, but to the progress of nature in the order of her
                    productions, we would sooner perceive the propriety of that succession or change
                    of organization even among animals really allied to each other by the great
                    majority of their relations; and it would not have been deemed necessary to
                    remove to another class such of the Arachnides as were antennated, because it
                    would have been then more clearly perceived how incompatible was such a change
                    with the assignment of their natural and appropriate place in the system.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193100085" xml:id="kp-eb0703-0085-0348"/>
                <p>The class of Arachnides, as established by Lamarck in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cours,</hi> contained five or six small families, which, though each possessed
                    of particular characters of distinction, it would have been difficult to
                    separate from their common frame-work, without considerable inconvenience to
                    whatever other class one or more of such families might have been removed. If,
                    for example, the antennated Arachnides should be classed among insects, we then
                    destroy the most simple and satisfactory definition which can be given of the
                    last-named class, while we are forced to assign to the animals with which we
                    unite them a position in the general series unsuitable to their real nature and
                    attributes. If we transport the tracheal Arachnides to the class Insccta, in
                    order to enable us to define the latter class by the exclusive character of
                    respiring by tracheae, then insects can no longer be said to be uniformly
                    distinguished by the possession of antennae, and the genus Phalangium, &amp;c.
                    would be separated from the class which contains the spiders. For these reasons
                    Lamarck is of opinion that the division which contains his Arachnides, whether
                    antennated or non-antennated, ought to be preserved in its integrity, if we wish
                    to avoid the impropriety of associating with insects other forms of animal life
                    which nature has distinguished by different characters.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Animaux sans
                    Vertèbres,</hi> tome v∙ p. 6.</p></note></p>
                <p>A class may be constituted of natural materials, and contained within suitable
                    limits, and nevertheless present among its various families animals of very
                    different forms and construction. During every period of its existence, a
                    butterfly presents an aspect very dissimilar to that of a scarabaeus, yet both
                    belong to the true Insccta. When strong general affinities <hi rend="italic"
                    >{analogies d’ensemble)</hi> prevail, those special diversities of structure
                    which are occasionally observable are insufficient to authorize a separation of
                    classes. The genera Aranea, Phalangium, and Galeodes, are very nearly related to
                    each other, although the first respire by obvious branchial cells, while the
                    others enjoy a tracheal respiration.</p>
                <p>The non-antennated Arachnides arc in general provided with eight feet; and the
                    Acarides and Pyenogonides conduct· naturally to the Phalangides, such as the
                    genus phalangium and others. Now, if these Acarides belong essentially to the
                    Arachnides, can the parasitical genera, such as Pediculus and Ricirtus, which
                    lead towards them so evidently, be regarded as belonging to another class? The
                    transition is so gradual and prepared, that the Acarides, provided for the most
                    part with eight feet, like the other non-antennated Arachnides, yet present us
                    with many genera (such as Astoma, Leptis, Caris) which have never more than six.
                    Lamarck maintains the necessity of preserving the class Arachnides according to
                    the limits which he has himself assigned to it, because its being so preserved
                    relieves the class of insects from species with which that class has little or
                    no connection. Without citing the impossibility of assigning a suitable position
                    among insects to tribes like the Parasites, the Thysanoura, and the Myriapoda,
                    the strongest objection to the reunion of these animals with insects is, that it
                    will alter the general and truly natural characters assigned to the latter, viz.
                    that of presenting, after exclusion from the egg, a particular state of <hi
                    rend="italic">larva,</hi> singularly varied according to the different orders in
                    the forms and parts of the animal, and that of finally exhibiting an <hi
                    rend="italic">imago</hi> or perfect state very different from the larva, and
                    distinguished by six articulated legs, two reticulated eyes, and a pair of
                    antennae.</p>
                <p>Arachnides, on the contrary, although in many instances antennated, and, like all
                    other living beings, undergoing successive developments of parts from the period
                    of their birth, yet offer not the condition of a larva distinct from that of the
                    perfect state: they preserve, not of course the ' dimensions, but the form and
                    proportions of the parts with which they were originally produced; and if a few
                    of them acquire additional parts in the course of their development, these are
                    not of a new kind, but merely supernumerary to such as previously existed; for
                    example, a pair of feet, or another segment to the abdomen. But this kind of
                    development is different from that called metamorphosis in insects. All of these
                    acquire either a new form, or parts of structure of a different kind from those
                    which they possessed when first produced from the egg; and their state of larva,
                    manifestly distinct from that of the perfect insect, is never equivocal.</p>
                <p>Thus the Arachnides of Lamarck, distinguished in a general point of view from
                    true insects by the want of metamorphoses, yet breathing in air, are remarkable
                    for the singular gradations which their organization presents us when we compare
                    the different families with each other. In fact, these animals exhibit, in their
                    totality, different groups, which offer among themselves such great
                    dissimilarities of organization, as might almost furnish the materials of as
                    many classes; but such a proceeding would injure the simplicity of systematic
                    arrangement, and would be unsuitable, in as far as these great divisions might
                    still be connected together by characters of general application, the same, in
                    truth, as those by which the class of Arachnides is itself distinguished.</p>
                <p>Although certain Arachnides possess organs adapted to a circulating system, they
                    do not on that account belong to the crustaceous class. They are chiefly
                    distinguished from that class by their respiratory organs, which, whether
                    tracheal or branchial, are always placed in the interior of the body, whilst in
                    the Crustacea they are external. In the former, also, the opening which admits
                    the fluid to be respired is stigmatiform; but it is not so in the latter. .</p>
                <p>Even the structure of the eyes affords an index to the Arachnides. All true
                    insects have two eyes, with plane facettes, presenting the appearance of a very
                    delicate network; but in the Arachnides the eyes are smooth, whether isolated,
                    as among the greater number, or grouped as in spiders, and form a small mass, of
                    which the surface is granular or sub-granular, and not in facettes. Arachnides
                    form a class superior to insects, because many of them are more highly
                    organized, and all of them are more nearly allied to the Crustacea than genuine
                    insects. It does not follow from this that all the individuals of that class are
                    superior to the most perfect insects, or that they have derived their existence,
                    according to the French phraseology, by transition from these last-named
                    creatures, or by an advance or progression in the scale of organization. For in
                    the progress of animal life from the lower to the higher groups, the Arachnides
                    appear to commence almost at the same epoch as the genuine insects, and present
                    a dichotomous or double ramification, corresponding in its level with that which
                    bears the entire class of insects. About that same point of the animal kingdom
                    there seems in fact to be three distinct streams or courses of life, immediately
                    succeeding the Epizoana, viz. that of the apterous insects (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Puleae),</hi> which leads successively to all the other forms of insect life;
                    that of the antennated parasitical Arachnides <hi rend="italic">{Pediculus</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Ricinus),</hi> which leads to the Acarides and other
                    non-antennated Arachnides; and that of the wandering <hi rend="italic"
                    >{vαgabunda)</hi> antennated Arachnides (Thysanoura and Myriapoda),from which
                    the crustaceous tribes may be said to spring.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Thus, of those great divisions which appear to derive their origin almost from
                    the same point in the scale, the first is formed of an enormous series of
                    animated beings, characterized by the strongly contrasted aspects of larva and
                    perfect insect; and the others are true Arachnides, and consequently present no
                    such marked distinction between the conditions of the young and old. In the most
                    perfect of the arachnidean class, such as spiders and scorpions, Cuvier has
                    demonstrated a muscular and dorsal heart, subject to sensible systole and
                    diastole; and on the abdomen he discovered several stigmatic openings (from two
                    to eight), which lead to an equal number of particular purse-shaped cavities,
                    each of which contained a great many small and very delicate laminae or plates.
                    These isolated cavities, and the plates with which they are filled, arc without
                    doubt the respiratory organs of these Arachnides. Cuvier regards them in the
                    light of lungs; while Lamarek himself is inclined to view them rather as
                    branchial cavities analogous to those observable in the leech and earth-worm—the
                    property of branchia being, in the first place, the power of becoming habituated
                    to the respiration of air (water being their usual medium), whilst the true lung
                    respires air alone; and, in the second place (and this character applies of
                    course <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi> to lungs also), never to exist except
                    in animals which are possessed of a circulating system.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Finally, from the dorsal heart already mentioned two large vessels derive their
                    origin, and arc then ramified over the membrane of the respiratory cavities.
                    Cuvier regards these vessels as pulmonary, the one acting as an artery, the
                    other as a vein—and other vessels spring from the same dorsal trunk, and
                    distribute themselves to various parts of the body. In these animals there is
                    even a liver, composed of four pair of glandular clusters, which discharge their
                    fluid at four different points of the intestine.</p>
                <p>It is among the Arachnides that we find the first establishment of organs for the
                    circulation of the animal fluids; and in the same class we perceive, as it were,
                    the termination of tracheal respiration by ramified tracheae, with a view to the
                    substitution of the branchial system, which, though in itself admitting of
                    considerable variation, is always characterized by its more local restriction.
                    jAmong the Arachnides also we find the commencement of the principal of the
                    conglomerated glands.</p>
                <p>The respiratory sacks, which Cuvier pointed out in the spiders and scorpions,
                    were also detected by Μ. Latreille <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> m the genus
                    Phryna, in such a manner as to connect, by that dominating feature in their
                    structure, the Arachnides <hi rend="italic">pedipalpes</hi> and the Arachnides
                    <hi rend="italic">jilcuses</hi> of that author. Although among the Phalangides
                    the respiratory sacks have not yet become perceptible, yet the aeriferous
                    tracheae have changed their character, and no longer consist of a double cord
                    with a series of plexus, but are merely branched or ramified. The same order
                    prevails among the Acarides, and results mainly from the reduced number and
                    altered position of the stigmata. Among the animated Arachnides, in which the
                    stigmata are more numerous, and in general lateral, the tracheal cords, like
                    those of insccth, have as many plexus as stigmata; and such Arachnides, in fact,
                    approach the most nearly to the class of insects. Thus tracheal respiration
                    changes by degrees its nature and mode of action, as the stigmata undergo an
                    alteration in regard to their number and position; and, becoming more and more
                    reduced and restricted) it prepares the way, as it were, for branchial
                    respiration, which only shows itself effectively along with the establishment of
                    a circulating system. It results from these considerations that, in spite of the
                    difference of organization observable in different families of Arachnides, '
                    these families are nevertheless related and united by natural affinities, which
                    it is impossible to mistake, and would be improper to separate, and which .
                    appear to place them at an almost equal distance from Insects and Crustacea. In
                    their aspect, however, they in general resemble somewhat more nearly the latter
                    class. For example, the cancerides or crabs represent in some respects, by their
                    short bodies, and heads confounded with the thorax, the usual form of spiders;
                    while the cray-fish and Thalassinae <hi rend="italic">(Cancer anomalus,</hi>
                    Leach) recall the figure of the scorpion. . , .</p>
                <p>The greater proportion of Arachnides dwell on the land, a few inhabit the waters,
                    and a certain number are parasitical on the bodies of other animals, of which
                    they suck the juices. In general they are carnivorous, and live on blood, or at
                    least on animal substances; a very limited number existing on vegetable matter.
                    Many are furnished with mandibles, which perform the functions of a trunk or
                    sucker; and others are provided with an isolated or separate trunk, frequently
                    accompanied both by mandibles and palpi. They are for the most part solitary
                    animals, of gloomy habits, and forbidding aspect; they court concealment, and
                    avoid exposure to strong light.· The bite of many species is dangerous, in
                    consequence of a poisonous or irritating fluid frequently instilled into the
                    wound. The offensive organ in the scorpionides is placed at the extremity of the
                    abdomen.</p>

                <p>In his <hi rend="italic">Considerations</hi><hi rend="italic">Generales,</hi> Μ.
                    Latreille founds the orders of the class Arachnides on two principal points as
                    the first basis. These animals are either masticators or suckers. The jaws of
                    the former are simple, and fitted for cutting and triturating the substances on
                    which they feed; those of the latter, when they exist at all, serve only to
                    seize their prey, and are terminated by a movable piece, either solitary and
                    hooked, like a claw or crotchet, or accompanied by a fixed projection like a
                    small finger. In the latter case the mandibles have the appearance of a pair of
                    pincers. The Arachnides of this division compress with their pincers the small
                    animals on which they prey, and so force the alimentary juices to pass by
                    degrees into the oesophagus. The body of their prey having undergone this
                    operation, is thrown aside. In spiders the claw of the mandible seems to execute
                    an additional function. It distils a poisonous liquid, analogous in its nature
                    to that which exudes from the mouth of the scolopendra, and the tail or sting of
                    the scorpion. Moreover, all the masticating Arachnides are furnished with
                    antennae, while the suctorial tribes, with the exception of two genera, Ricinus
                    and Pulex, are unprovided with these organs. Thus the primary divisid∙s of this
                    class by Latreille nearly correspond to Lamarck’s two orders, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Antennistes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Palpistes.</hi></p>
                <p>Μ. Latreille then subdivides the masticating Arachnides into three orders— <hi
                    rend="italic">Tetracera, Myriapoda,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Thysanoura.</hi>
                    The last alone present a thorax distinct from the abdomen, and have no more than
                    six feet. In the two first-named orders the organs of movement amount at least
                    to the number of fourteen, disposed along the sides of the body, each segment of
                    which, with the exception at most of the last three, carry one or two pair. The
                    Tetracera (genus <hi rend="italic">Oniscus of</hi> Linnaeus) are distinguished
                    by four antennae; there are only two in the Myriapoda. The Tetracera have
                    besides several jaws, and are furnished with plates or foliaceous appendages on
                    the inferior surface of the posterior extremity of their bodies. The number of
                    their feet is invariably fourteen. They are related in several particulars to
                    the Crustacea. De Geer observed, that in Assellus and Idotea there is a kind of
                    membranous cavity, frequently filled with air, beneath the plates of the tail;
                    and similar parts are observable in the true crustaceous Squillae of Fabricius.
                    In Oniscus the air penetrates the body by openings, which are covered by the
                    first folds of the tail. The other Tetracera probably receive it i∏ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> a</hi> similar manner: at all events they are not provided
                    with distinct external stigmata, like the Arachnides of the sue-ceeding orders.
                    We still find in this first division species which inhabit the sea; but as soon
                    as we enter the crder Acera (scorpions, spiders, &amp;c.) we find none occurring
                    in that element.</p>
                <p>The structure of suctorial Arachnides is reducible to three principal forms or
                    combinations of organs; 1tf, Those possessed of antennae, and of which the head
                    is distinct from the thorax— <hi rend="italic">Parasita;</hi> 2<hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi>, Those which are unprovided with antennae, each segment of the body
                    furnished with a pair of legs, and the head distinct— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pyenogonides ∙</hi> 3&lt;7, Those which are unprovided with antennae, but of
                    which the head and thorax are confounded as it were in a single segment, which
                    alone is provided with feet— <hi rend="italic">Αcem,</hi> This last-mentioned
                    order, according to Latreille, would form the first, if the organs of the mouth
                    alone were considered, as these are more complicated than in any other suctorial
                    Arachnides. The Acera have two palpigerous maxillae, and frequently a lip, with
                    two strong mandibles. The generality of the Pyenogonides have also mandibles,
                    which have been taken for palpi, and true palpi, which have been erroneously
                    regarded as antennae; but their mouth consists of a tunnel or syphon of a single
                    piece, lt is still more simple in the Parasites, being nothing more than a very
                    short projection, containing a small sucker, or a cavity of which the sides are
                    dilatable, and accompanied by two crotchets.</p>
                <p>In regard to the <hi rend="italic">families of</hi> the Arachnides, the Tetracera
                    offer two principal groups. Some dwell in salt or fresh water, are usually fixed
                    upon other animals, of which they suck the blood, and have, with the exception
                    of the genus Bobyra, four very obvious and distinct antennae. They constitute
                    the first family, that of <hi rend="italic">Asellota.</hi> Others are more
                    terrestrial than aquatic. They wander from place to place, love obscure and
                    sombre situations, and live upon putrid substances; their two intermediate
                    antennae are but slightly developed. They form the second family, called <hi
                    rend="italic">Oìiiscides.</hi> According to Latreille, the structure of the
                    mouth in Scolopendra is so different from that of Julus, that it is difficult to
                    conceive the motive which influenced Fabricius to unite these Arachnides into a
                    single order, that of <hi rend="italic">Mitosata.</hi> In Julus, the maxillae
                    and the lip are soldered together, forming one transverse plate, without
                    distinct palpi, or their place supplied by tubercles. The Scolopendrae have
                    their maxillae separated, four projecting palpi, and the labia in the form of
                    hooks, subservient to the same uses as the mandibles of spiders. These
                    considerations, and the figure of the antennae, have required the establishment
                    of two families, which compose Latreille s order Myriapoda, viz. <hi
                    rend="italic">Chilognatha</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Syngnatha.</hi> Proceeding
                    upon the same principles, he divides the order Thysanoura likewise into two
                    families, the <hi rend="italic">Lepisrnenae</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Podurellae.</hi> The next orders, Parasita and Pyenogonides, contain few
                    genera, and do not admit of subdivision into families. The last order, Acera, is
                    composed of eight families, viz. Scorpionides, Pedipalpi, Aranides,
                    Phalangita&gt; Acaridiae, Riciniae, Hydrachnellae, and Microphthira.</p>
                <p>Before commencing our systematic exposition of t class, we shall lay before our
                    readers the sentiments of Mr Kirby. “I must next say something on the orders of
                    the Arachnida. Every one at first sight sees that <hi rend="italic">sp∙
                    ders</hi> and <hi rend="italic">scorpions</hi> are separated by characters so
                    strongly marked, that they look rather like animals belonging <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t0</hi> different classes, than to the same. These form the
                    t"° primary orders of the <hi rend="italic">Arachnida,</hi> and they appear to
                    be connected by two secondary or osculant ones,—on the one side by <hi
                    rend="italic">Galeodes,</hi> and on the other by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thelyphonus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Phrynus.</hi> This class, although there
                    is an appearance of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193100124"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-0124-0351"/>eight legs, is, strictly speaking, of a <hi
                    rend="italic">Hexapod</hi> type; for the anterior pair, ordinarily regarded as
                    legs, and performing their function, are really the analogues of the maxillary
                    palpi of perfect insects. This will be evident to you if you examine any species
                    of <hi rend="italic">Galcodes.</hi> These animals, if we look at them cursorily,
                    we snould regard as decapods; but when we trace the two anterior pairs of
                    apparent legs to their insertion, we find that both proceed from the <hi
                    rend="italic">head,</hi> which in that genus is distinct from the trunk; while
                    the three last pairs, which alone are furnished with claws, are planted, as legs
                    usually are, in the latter part. The first pair represent the ordinary palpi of
                    <hi rend="italic">Araclinida,</hi> are analogous to the labial ones of hexapods,
                    and, as likewise in Phrynus and Thelyphonus, are more robust than what are
                    usually taken for the first pair of legs; but they differ in being considerably
                    longer, and, instead of terminating in a <hi rend="italic">chela,</hi> are
                    furnished with a retractile sucker.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    second pair are more slender and shorter than the first. They correspond
                    precisely with what are deemed the first pair of legs of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Octopods</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Arachnida,</hi> and are clearly analogous
                    to the maxillary palpi of insects. Whether the base of the first 'pair of these
                    palpi is in any respect analogous to the labium of insects (as that of the
                    second seems to be to their maxillae), I am not prepared to assert; it will
                    therefore be most advisable to namt these palpi <hi rend="italic">anterior

                    in that genus are clearly analogous to those of the Phrynidea (which in their
                    turn as clearly represent those of the Aranidea), it follows, that in all they
                    are organs of the part representing the head, and therefore not in a <hi

                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Regne</hi><hi rend="italic">Animal</hi> (2d edition,
                    1829), Latreille includes in the class Arachnides only those species which
                    correspond to the <hi rend="italic">Arachnides</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >palpistes</hi> of Μ. Lamarck. By this arrangement he is of opinion they may be
                    classed and defined in a more simple and rigorous manner. According to his most
                    matured views, then, the Arachnides, like the Crustacea, are destitute of wings,
                    and are not subject to metamorphoses, but only to simple changes. Their sexual
                    organs are removed from the posterior extremity of their bodies, and situated,
                    with the exception of certain males, at the base of the abdomen. ’ They bear a
                    resemblance to insects in as far as the surface of their bodies present openings
                    or transverse clefts named <hi rend="italic">stigmata,</hi> for tĥe entrance of
                    air, but in smaller number than in insects (eight at most, "generally two), and
                    placed only at the inferior part of the abdomen. Their respiration is farther
                    carried on either by aerial branchia, performing the office of lungs, inclosed
                    in the cells of which the openings just mentioned are the entrance, or by means
                    of radiated tracheae. The organs of vision consist of small simple eyes,
                    variously grouped when numerous. The head, usually distinct from the thorax,
                    presents, as analogous to the antennae of insects, two articulated appendages,
                    in the form of small talons .of two or more pieces, which have been improperly
                    compared to the mandibles of insects, though moving in a different direction.
                    They, however, cooperate in the action of the jaws, and are represented in those
                    Arachnides of which tĥe mouth is formed like a syphon or sucker by two pointed
                    plates or lancets.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    do not differ from feet properly so called, except in the tarsi, composed of
                    only a single joint, and usually terminated by a small crotchet; they almost
                    entirely resemble the ordinary feet of the Crustacea.</p></note> or by a lobe or
                    appendage of that article; a beak-shaped projection, named sternal tongue <hi

                    a very small chaperon, terminated by a minute triangular lip, and of a
                    longitudinal inferior keel, usually hairy :—these, and the parts called
                    mandibles, compose, under certain modifications, the general structure of the
                    mouth in the class Arachnides. The pharynx is placed in advance of a sternal
                    projection, which has been regarded as a lip; but when w¢f consider its position
                    behind the pharynx, and the absence of palpi, it is probably rather analogous to
                    a tongue <hi rend="italic">(languette).</hi> The feet, like those of insects,
                    are generally terminated by two crotchets, sometimes by three, and are all
                    attached to the thorax, which is almost always formed of a single articulation,
                    for the most part intimately united to the abdomen. The abdomen in the greater
                    proportion of species is soft, or but slightly protected. »</p>
                <p>When considered in relation to their nervous system, the Arachnides are obviously
                    distinguished both from the Crustacea and Insects; for, with the exception of
                    the scorpions, the ganglia or swellings of the nervous cords never exceed three
                    in number.;</p>
                <p>The greater proportion of Arachnides feed on living insects, the bodies of which
                    they seize or adhere to, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193100137"

                    bodies of vertebrated animals. A few, such as certain mites, feed on cheese, and
                    on flour and other vegetable productions. In some of the species two of the feet
                    are not developed till the animals have changed their skin; and in general it is
                    not till after their fourth or fifth moult, or casting of their exuviae, that
                    the Arachnides attain to their completed state.<note anchored="true"

                    which perform the office of lungs, and are named pneumo-branchiaby Latreille.

                    and from thence by special vessels to the various parts of the body. Latreille,
                    however, seems to think, from the relations which exist between these creatures
                    and the crustaceous tribes, that such circulation may be effected in thθ
                    contrary direction. See the <hi rend="italic">Règne</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    confounded with the thorax, and presents two pincers <hi rend="italic"
                    >(mandibulae</hi> of authors, <hi rend="italic">chelicères</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">antenne-pinces</hi> of Latreille) terminated by two finger-like
                    projections, of which one is movable, or by a single hook or claw, always
                    movable. The mouth is composed of a lip <hi rend="italic">(labium)</hi>; of two
                    palpi, which sometimes assume the shape of arms or talons; of two or four
                    maxillae, formed, when there is only a pair, by the radical article of the
                    palpi, and when there are four, by that same article and the corresponding
                    portion of the first pair of feet; and of a languette of one or two pieces. If
                    we were to assume as a basis the progressive diminution in the number of the
                    pulmonary sacks and stigmata, then the scorpions which have eight, while the
                    other Arachnides have only four or two, would form the leading genus of the
                    class, and the family of <hi rend="italic">Pedipalpi</hi> would take precedence
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Araneides</hi> or spinners; but these last-named
                    Arachnides are to a certain extent isolated, by reason of the sexual organs of
                    the male, by the hook of their frontal talons, by their pediculated abdomens,
                    and the peculiarities of their spinning apparatus, as well as by their natural
                    habits; and the scorpions also appear to form a more natural transition from the
                    pulmonary Arachnides to the family of the pseudo-scorpions, the first of the
                    second order.</p>
                <p>Of all the Arachnides the <hi rend="italic">Pulmonariae</hi> exhibit the greatest
                    analogies to the crustaceous class, especially to the genus Limulus and others
                    of the paecilopodous order. The pneumo-branchia and their stigmatiform openings
                    may frequently be detected externally by yellowish-white markings, disposed in
                    two longitudinal series. The first two are placed immediately beneath the sexual
                    organs, at least in the females, at a small distance from the origin of the
                    abdomen, and on its second segment, when that part is annular or divided into
                    segments. Thus the second segment in these Arachnides corresponds in its
                    characters to the first segment of the female Limulus. We may also perceive in
                    them the indications of conglomerated glands, and even in certain species traces
                    are observable of chili-ferous vessels.</p>
                <p>The claw of the mandibles in spiders, and the terminal joint of the tail l’n
                    scorpions, form a species of dart, perforated by one or two openings, which give
                    issue to a poi-I sonous liquid secreted by special glands. This poison is mortal
                    to such small creatures as form the natural prey of the Arachnides, and is even
                    productive of dangerous consequences to man and the larger animals. Its mode of
                    action on animals unprovided with a circulating system is not clearly
                    understood, but the phenomena attending it might reasonably be adduced in
                    support of that theory which advocates the agency of poison from the bite of
                    venomous reptiles as being carried on as much through the medium of the nervous
                    as the circulating fluid. The almost instantaneous death of animals from the
                    bite of certain snakes has been regarded as a proof that the vascular system was
                    not alone concerned; and the same sudden effect produced upon those classes in
                    which, as far as we can perceive, no vascular system exists, demonstrates some
                    other mode of action.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the researches of Cuvier, Marcel de Serres, Leon Dufour,
                    Treviranus, and other observers, our knowledge of the internal organization of
                    several genera of Arachnides is extremely deficient. Hence it is difficult to
                    trace the boundaries of the orders in a manner at once natural and precise. At
                    the same time it has been remarked, that the accurate observation of the eyes
                    and other external organs furnish characters which coincide with the
                    distinctions deduced from internal structure, as far as the latter has been
                    ascertained.</p>

                <p>This extensive family corresponds to the genus Aranea of Linnaeus, and contains
                    all those species commonly called spiders—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arachnides</hi><hi rend="italic">fileuses</hi> of Latreille. The characters
                    are, two or four branchial pouches; from six to eight simple eyes; last article
                    of the mandibles <hi rend="italic">(clielicères)</hi> in the form of a corneous
                    claw, perforated at the extremity for the emission of poison, and folded upon
                    the preceding joint; abdomen usually soft, without divisions, its extremity
                    furnished with from four to six small teat-like appendages, pierced with
                    numerous holes for the passage of the silk or spinning materials;<note

                    terminated in the female by small hooks, and in the male by the generative
                    organs. The maxillae are neyer more than two in number. The languette consists
                    of a single piece, always external, and placed between the maxillae; its form
                    more or less square, sometimes triangular or semicircular. The thorax, usually
                    impressed with a form resembling the letter Y, indicating the space occupied by
                    the head, is composed of a single article. The legs, of which the forms are
                    analogous, though the dimensions differ considerably, are composed of seven
                    joints, of which the first two form the haunch, the third the thigh, the fourth
                    and fifth the leg, and the remaining two the tarsi; the last is terminated by a
                    couple of hooks, which are usually toothed or pectinated, and in many species
                    there is an additional tooth of smaller size, but not pectinated. The intestinal
                    canal is straight: there is first a stomach composed of several sacks; and
                    towards the middle of the abdomen a second dilatation occurs. According to
                    Marcel de Serres the heart is situated in the abdomen, and stretches throughout
                    its whole length; there is a considerable swelling towards its superior
                    extremity, after which it assumes and retains the cylindrical form. It is very
                    muscular, and its pulsations are strong and frequent. The pulmonary pouches,
                    usually two in number, are always situated on the lower surface of the abdomen,
                    near its origin, and are covered by a coriaceous skin, generally of a red
                    colour; the stigmatiform opening proper to each pouch is placed towards its
                    base, on the inner side. These pouches are formed of a white membrane, strong
                    but flexible, which presents on its interior, transverse, projecting, parallel,
                    nearly semicircular folds or plates, which constitute the respiratory organ. The
                    liver is proper to the abdomen, of which it occupies the chief portion. It is
                    composed of an infinity of minute glands fixed to the intestinal canal, and
                    filled with a peculiar liquid, thick, and of a brown colour. The interior of the
                    abdomen also contains the silk vessels, four in number, long, cylindrical,
                    folded, yellow. They open into a common canal, situated at the origin of the
                    spinners.</p>

                <p>The silk vessels with which both sexes of many species fabricate those webs so
                    remarkable at times for their symmetrical form and exquisite delicacy of
                    structure, vary in shape and position according to the habits of the species.
                    The formation by these creatures of skilfully wrought nets for the capture of
                    their prey, is a fact of such every-day occurrence and observation, that we
                    cease to regard it in its proper light, as one of the most admirable and
                    surprising instincts of animal life. According to Reaumur, the silk undergoes
                    its first elaboration in two small reservoirs, shaped like a drop of glass
                    placed obliquely, one on each side, at the base of six other reservoirs in the
                    form of intestines, which lie side by side, and folded six or seven times. The
                    latter derive their origin from a little below the commencement of the abdomen,
                    and proceed to the nipples by a slender thread. It is in the last-named vessels
                    that the silk acquires that greater consistence and those other qualities which
                    render it fit for use. A certain degree of dryness or evaporation seems
                    necessary for the proper formation of the threads; but when the atmosphere is in
                    a favourable condition the requisite change appears to take place almost
                    instantaneously.</p>
                <p>Various opinions have been entertained regarding the origin of those white,
                    flaky, filamentous, silky substances which are frequently found floating in the
                    atmosphere during the mornings of spring and autumn. They are called <hi
                    rend="italic">fils de la vierge</hi> by the French, and Lamarck still maintains
                    the opinion that they are meteoric productions. The results of chemical
                    analysis, as well as of ordinary observation, render it little less than certain
                    that they are produced by small spiders of the genera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epeira</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Thomisus.</hi> The innumerable threads which
                    the sun-beams occasionally bring to view over the entire surface of ploughed
                    fields are also formed by spiders of the genus Lycosa. Latreille is of opinion
                    that many of these creatures, before they are sufficiently provided with
                    spinning materials to form webs, content themselves by ejecting simple
                    longitudinal thrêads. They are merely apprentices to the weaving art.</p>
                <p>The habits of spiders vary greatly. Some rest in the centre of their webs, the
                    outstretched cordage of which warns them of the temporary entanglement of their
                    prey, on which they instantly rush, and devour after the infliction of a mortal
                    wound. Others seek the protection of a leaf or other natural harbour, and only
                    appear in the more open parts of their premises when lured by an expected
                    capture. Many spin comfortable tunnels, or horizontal watchtowers, as they maybe
                    called, in which they repose till the vibration of their nets calls them into
                    active service. An extensive tribe of erratic species (the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vagabunda)</hi> spin no webs at all, but trust to strength, activity and
                    cunning, for their daily, or, it may be, monthly fare· for spiders, though
                    voracious in times of abundance, are capable of frequent and long-continued
                    abstinence. The webless species are often endowed with the faculty <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi> f leaping, and after insidiously approaching their prey
                    by the most wary and almost imperceptible footsteps, they spring upon it at
                    once, and inflict the fatal wound. Several kinds hunt down their insect food by
                    speed of foot· and a few are nocturnal, and surprise their defenceless and
                    unsuspecting victims during the darkness of the night. According to Mr Sheppard,
                    a large species, which occurs among the fen ditches of Norfolk, actually
                    constructs a sort of raft of weeds, or floating island, on which it allows
                    itself to be wafted about, and from which it seizes upon drowning insects; and
                    another <hi rend="italic">(Lyccsapiratica</hi> of Walckenaer) gives chase to its
                    prey over the surface of the water.</p>

                <p>The passion of love, so powerful in its influence over the most savage beasts,
                    rules with a feeble and transitory sway over the subjects of our present
                    inquiry. The male spider approaches the female with the greatest circumspection,
                    fearful lest the sexual feeling should not have banished that thirst for blood
                    which under ordinary circumstances induces them to prey as readily on each other
                    as on winged insects. It therefore not unfrequently happens, that if a small
                    male approaches a large female, whose feelings unfortunately do not coincide
                    with his own, instead of being caressed he is eaten. According to Audebert, the
                    female of the domestic spider is capable of producing successive generations
                    without any renewal of intercourse with the male. He also states that he kept
                    the same individuals in life for five or six years.</p>
                <p>All female spiders, including even the erratic and webless species, are provided
                    with reservoirs of silky matter, which, if not used in spinning, are at all
                    events employed in forming a protecting covering for the eggs. The most casual
                    observer of nature must have frequently remarked the care with which the anxious
                    mother carries about and watches over her unhatched offspring; and the delicate
                    colour of the silken bag which contains the eggs, and the fine contrast which in
                    some cases it presents to the body of the parent, cannot have escaped
                    observation. The truth is, that spiders, though frequently of a repulsive
                    aspect, are as often distinguished not only by great beauty of colour, but by
                    extreme elegance of form and delicacy of structure. We are prejudiced against
                    the race in general, because all those that dwell within doors are of a dark and
                    lurid hue, and from their haunts and habits have become objects of aversion and
                    disgust. Thomson has well described,</p>

                <p>But many of those which live in fields, woods, and gardens, are worthy of being
                    admired for their beauty, no less than for their singular instincts and
                    remarkable modes of life.</p>
                <p>The external appearance varies considerably in the same species, according to the
                    age of the individual. The younger they are, the less varied is their colouring.
                    The number and colour of the eggs differ according to the species. There is
                    seldom more than a single laying of eggs in each year. In some species the eggs
                    are free or unattached in the cocoons which contain them, in others they are
                    fixed by agglutination. In the course of the summer season they are usually
                    hatched in from fifteen to thirty days, according to the temperature. The eggs
                    of such as deposit in autumn (as <hi rend="italic">Epeira</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >diadema,</hi> a fine species, which occurs in gardens, near the outskirts of
                    woods, and in moors and furzes) are, however, seldom hatched till the
                    commencement of the ensuing spring.</p>
                <p>Some species of spider appear to possess the power of reproducing lost or
                    mutilated parts, after the manner of the Crustacea. It is somewhere remarked,
                    that in proportion to the simplicity of organic structure in an animal, its body
                    is more capable of repairing by reproduction such portions as have been
                    destroyed or deteriorated. This would induce the belief that frogs and lizards
                    are lower in the scale than insects, and that the latter, which do not possess
                    the reproductive power, are more highly organized than spiders and other
                    Arachnides. This, however, is not the case; and we may therefore infer that the
                    principle itself is erroneous, or at least incapable of general application. The
                    ascertainment of the fact, that spiders were capable of effecting this repair of
                    parts, is due to the ingenious observations of MM. Vincent Amo-roux and Amédée
                    Lepelletier. It was also, however, observed by Sir Joseph Banks in this country,
                    and communicated by him to Dr Leach, by whom the circumstance was recorded in
                    the Supplement to the sixth or preceding edition of this work.</p>
                <p>As Sir Joseph was writing one evening in his study, a web-spinning spider, above
                    the medium size, passed over some papers on the table, holding a fly in its
                    mouth. Surprised to see a spider of this description walking about with its
                    prey, and struck with something peculiar in its gait, he caught and placed it
                    under a glass for examination, when he perceived, that instead of eight legs, it
                    had only three. This mutilation accounted sufficiently for its inability to spin
                    a web; but the singular circumstance of its having changed its natural habits,
                    and having become a hunting instead of a spinning spider, and his desire to
                    ascertain whether its limbs would be reproduced, induced Sir Joseph to prolong
                    its captivity. On the following morning the creature destroyed two flies by
                    sucking out their juices, leaving the bodies entire. Two or three days
                    afterwards it devoured the body and head of a fly, leaving only the wings and
                    legs. After this time it sometimes sucked and sometimes swallowed the flies.</p>
                <p>Soon after its confinement it attempted to form a web on the side of the vessel,
                    but performed the operation very slowly and awkwardly, owing to the want of the
                    proper number of legs. However, in the course of about a fortnight it had
                    completed a small web, upon which it generally sat, and no doubt regarded with
                    complacency. A month after being caught it shed its skin, leaving the slough on
                    the web. After this change five new legs began to appear, which for a short
                    period were of little or no use to it in walking. These new members, however,
                    extended themselves considerably in the course of three days, and became about
                    half as long as the old ones. The web was now increased, and the spider
                    continued immovably sitting on it in the day-time, unless drawn from it, or
                    attracted by a fly thrown to it as its usual provision. Twenty-nine days
                    afterwards it again cast its skin, leaving the slough hanging in the web,
                    opposite to a hollow cell it had woven so as to prevent itself from being
                    completely seen. The legs were now larger than before the change of the skin,
                    and they continued to increase for several days, but did not attain the size of
                    the old legs. It was then put into a small bowl as a more commodious and
                    convenient residence, where it spun a larger and more perfect web. We are not
                    acquainted with the result of any further observations on the subject.</p>
                <p>Various attempts have been made at different periods to fabricate gloves and
                    stockings from the silk of the spider. Nearly a century ago, Bon of Languedoc
                    succeeded in making a pair of each of these articles from this frail material:
                    they were nearly as strong as those of common silk, and of a fine gray colour.
                    Reaumur was appointed by the Royal Academy to report on the advantages which
                    might result from the regular prosecution of a manufactory from spider-silk; but
                    his opinion was, that the natural fierceness and voracity of spiders rendered
                    them entirely unfit to be bred and brought up together. From 4000 to 5000 were
                    distributed in cells, each containing from 50 to 200 individuals; but in a short
                    time only a few were left alive. He also stated, that the web of the spider was
                    not equal to that of the silk-worm, either in strength or lustre. The cocoons of
                    the latter weigh from three to four grains, so that 2304 worms produce a pound
                    of silk. But the bags of a spider, when cleaned of filth and dust, do not weigh
                    above the third part of a grain, so that the work of twelve spiders does not
                    exceed that of a single silk-worm, and to form a pound of silk 27,648 spiders
                    would be required; and as it is the females alone that spin the bags, if they
                    are kept in pairs for the purpose of breeding, 55,296 individuals would be
                    necessary to the formation of every pound. Even this calculation applies only to
                    good spiders of the domestic' breed, for those found in gardens scarcely yield
                    the twelfth part of silk of the house species; therefore 280 would not produce
                    more than a single silk-worm, and 663,555 would' scarcely yield a pound of
                    silk.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                <p>Sir George Staunton, in his <hi rend="italic">Embassy to China,</hi> states that
                    spiders’ webs are met with in the forests of Java of so strong a texture as to
                    require to be cut through with a knife; and in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions</hi> (1668) we are informed that the spiders of
                    Bermudas suspend their webs between trees seven or eight fathoms distant, and
                    that they are so strong as to entangle birds as large as thrushes. “The web of a
                    house-spider,” observe Messrs Kirby and Spence, “will, with occasional repairs,
                    serve for a considerable period; but the nets of the geometric spiders are in
                    favourable weather renewed, either wholly, or at least their concentric circles,
                    every twenty-four hours, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193100189"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-0189-0356"/>even when not apparently injured. This difference
                    in the operations of the two species depends upon a very remarkable peculiarity
                    in the conformation of their snares. The threads of the house-spider’s web are
                    all of the same kind of silk, and flies are caught in them from their claws
                    becoming entangled in the fine meshes which form the texture. On the other hand,
                    the net of the garden spider is composed of two distinct kinds of silk; that of
                    the radii not adhesive, that of the circles extremely viscid. The cause of this
                    difference, which, when it is considered that both sorts of silk proceed from
                    the same instrument, is truly wonderful, may be readily perceived. If you
                    examine a newly formed net with a microscope, you will find that the threads
                    composing the outline and the radii are simple, those of the circles closely
                    studded with minute dew-like globules, which from the elasticity of the thread
                    are easily separable from each other. That these are in fact globules of viscid
                    gum, is proved by their adhering to the finger, and retaining dust thrown upon
                    the net, while the unadhesive radii and exterior threads remain unsoiled. It is
                    these gummed threads alone which retain the insects that fly into the net; and
                    as they lose their viscid properties by the action of the air, it is necessary
                    that they should be frequently renewed·”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Dr Lister was of opinion that spiders possessed the power of again withdrawing
                    their webs within their bodies,—a fact which, with Degeer, we may reasonably
                    doubt, when we consider the immediate atmospheric change which takes place in
                    the nature of the thread after it is once protruded. In fact, when a spider
                    asceħds on the same cord by which it had previously dropped from a height, a
                    small ball or rounded web will be found adhering to it, composed of the coil
                    which it has collected in its re-ascent. The extreme tenuity of the component or
                    elementary threads of the spider’s web has been well explained by Lecuwenhoeck.
                    He states that the threads of the minutest spiders, some of which are not equal
                    in bulk to a grain of sand, are so fine that four millions of them would not
                    exceed the thickness of a human hair. Now we know that each spinner, of which
                    there are four, is pierced by about a thousand holes, consequently that every
                    compound or ordinary thread is composed of 4000 still finer. Thus a spider’s
                    thread, of the thickness of a human hair, may in some instances be composed of
                    not fewer than <hi rend="italic">sixteen thousand millions</hi> of single
                    threads!</p>
                <p>The bite of an ordinary spider occasions almost instant death to most insects.
                    The great species of South America attack vertebrated animals, such as
                    humming-birds and young pigeons, and their bite is often attended with dangerous
                    consequences even to the human race. Spiders are themselves preyed upon by
                    birds; and a winged insect of the genus <hi rend="italic">Sphex</hi> pierces
                    them with its sting, carries them off, and buries them dead or alive in holes
                    where its eggs are deposited, the larvae produced from which afterwards feed
                    upon the dead body of the spider. Most species perish about the commencement of
                    winter, although many others are known to exist for several years. According to
                    Sparmann, they form an article of food to the Bosjiesmen of Southern Africa; and
                    Labillardiere relates, that the inhabitants of New Caledonia eat with avidity

                <p>The ascent of spiders into the air, and the extension of their webs from tree to
                    tree across an open space, or even over a running stream, have frequently
                    excited the attention of naturalists. Dr Lister relates, that attending minutely
                    to a spider at work weaving its net, he observed it suddenly desist, and,
                    turning its nipples to the wind dart out a thread with the violence of a water
                    jet. This thread, taken up by the wind, was carried to some fathoms’ length,
                    still issuing from the body of the animal. Some time after the spider leapt into
                    the air, and the thread mounted her up swiftly. He afterwards made the same
                    observation on about 30 other species of spiders, and found the air filled with
                    young and old sailing on their threads, and probably seizing insects in their
                    passage, as he found legs and wings, and other manifest signs of slaughter, on
                    these threads, as well as on the webs below. These observations were
                    corroborated by Dr Hulse, who made the like discovery about the same time. It is
                    Dr Lister’s opinion that this darting of threads was known to Aristotle and
                    Pliny (vide <hi rend="italic">Hist. Aizim.</hi> lib. ix. cap. 89; and <hi
                    rend="italic">Elm.</hi> lib. x. cap. 74), but he believes their sailing was
                    first observed by himself. On these sailing spiders he further observes, that
                    they will often dart, not a single thread alone, but a whole sheaf at once,
                    consisting of many filaments, all of one length, but divided from each other,
                    and distinct; and the longer they become, the more they spread, and appear like
                    the numerous rays of a blazing star. He observed, too, that some species seemed
                    to use their legs as oars, sometimes closing, and again spreading them out, as
                    occasion might require. When the air is still it is highly probable they can
                    direct their course, and perhaps mount or descend at pleasure. In rowing, he
                    observed they always take their flight backwards. These threads mount to an
                    almost incredible height, and may always be observed in a fine clear day in
                    autumn, when there is little or no wind. In a letter to Mr Ray, he further
                    states, that “I one day observing the air full of webs, forthwith mounted to the
                    top of the highest steeple on the minster (at York), and could there discern
                    them exceedingly high above me.”</p>
                <p>If a spider is placed on the top of a pole surrounded by water, it nevertheless
                    effects its escape by means of a silken line, which is ere long found to extend
                    from the pole to some other object on the outside of the pool. It is evident
                    that the spider possesses the power of permitting the material of which its
                    threads are composed to escape at pleasure; but whether this is accomplished by
                    a projectile force, by electrical agency, or by the mechanical action of the
                    external currents of the atmosphere, is still a subject of dispute. The
                    beautiful regularity with which the radiated parts of the web are usually
                    disposed favours the idea expressed by a French writer, that the animal
                    possesses the power of shooting out its threadsand directing them at pleasure
                    towards a determined point; whilst the observations of Messrs Rennie and
                    Blackwall indicate the necessity of a current of air as a moving force. It
                    appears, from the experiments of the latter gentleman, that when spiders are
                    placed upon an insulated twig surrounded by water, and exposed to a current of
                    air, however slight, either naturally or artificially produced, they directly
                    turn the thorax towards the quarter from whence it came, and elevating the
                    abdomen, they emit from their spinners a small portion of glutinous matter,
                    which is instantly carried out in a line, consisting of four finer ones, with a
                    velocity equal or nearly so to that of the air. They next carefully ascertain
                    whether their lines have become firmly attached to any object, by pulling at
                    them with their anterior pair of legs; if the result satisfies them, they gh <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ue</hi> the nearer end to the twig, and then march across.
                    “Such was invariably the result when spiders were placed where <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193100202" xml:id="kp-eb0703-0202-0357"/>the air was liable to be
                    sensibly agitated: I resolved therefore to put a bell glass over them, and in
                    this situation they remained 17 days, evidently unable to produce a single line
                    by which they could quit the branch they occupied, without encountering the
                    water at its base; though, on the removal of the glass, they regained their
                    liberty with as much celerity as in the instances already re-corded.” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Linn. Trans,</hi> vol. xv.) Mr Blackwall affirms with confidence,
                    that in motionless air, spiders have not the power of darting their threads even
                    through the space of half an inch. Mr Murray, Mr Bowman, Mr Mark Watt, and
                    others, maintain a contrary opinion.</p>
                <p>Lastly, Mr Virey thinks it more probable that spiders actually fly (by vibrating
                    their feet) through the air, than that they are acted upon either by electrical
                    influences or the agitation of the air. He does not assert that they have
                    wings.</p>
                <p>The bodies of spiders decompose so rapidly after death, that both their forms and
                    colours are speedily altered and effaced. It is therefore with great difficulty
                    that they are preserved as subjects of examination in museums. Hence, perhaps,
                    our comparative ignorance both of their structure and habits.</p>

                    underneath instead of inwards.</p>

                    straight and elongated, with the inner angle of its upper portion projecting,
                    performs the function of a jaw. The languette is small and nearly square. The
                    last joint of the palpi in the male is button-shaped, and bears at its extremity
                    the reproductive organs; and the two anterior legs in that sex are provided with
                    two strong spines or spurs at their inferior extremity.</p>
                <p>This genus, as established by Walckenaer, is composed of the bird-catching
                    spiders <hi rend="italic">(A. avicularia,</hi> Linn.), and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Araignées</hi><hi rend="italic">mineuses</hi> of Olivier. It contains several
                    species of great size and singular habits. The foreign kinds arc as yet
                    imperfectly characterized. The habits of a large species found in Martinique,
                    where it is called <hi rend="italic">Matoutou,</hi> have been well described by
                    Moreau de Jonnés. It spins no web, but lies concealed in holes and crevices of
                    the volcanic tufa, from which, however, it makes frequent excursions in search
                    of prey, which consists not only of insects, but of humming-birds and other
                    species of the feathered race. It hunts chiefly during the night. It is
                    possessed of great muscular strength, and unwillingly quits an object of which
                    it may have become possessed.</p>
                <p>hen induced to seize upon any hard and polished substance, it leaves traces of a
                    poisonous liquid, which, had the substance been of a yielding nature, it would
                    have injected into the wound. This liquid is lactescent, or of a milky aspect,
                    and very abundant in proportion to the size of the animal. The female carries
                    her eggs in a cocoon of white silk, of a very close texture, which she holds by
                    means of her palpi, beneath the thorax. When attacked, she drops her eggs to
                    defend herself, and secures them again when the combat has ceased. The young,
                    when first produced, are entirely white; and the earliest change which they
                    experience is the appearance of a black spot in the centre of the dorsal surface
                    of the abdomen. From eighteen hundred to two thousand young have been observed
                    to proceed from a single silk bag; but of these it is probable that an immense
                    proportion perish in infancy, by the depredations both of birds and insects.</p>
                <p>Several species of this genus inhabit Europe, and their characters and economy
                    are detailed by Olivier, Latreille, the Abbé Sauvage, and other writers. Our

                    said to dwell in the clefts of trees, and in hollows among rocks and stones.
                    According to Madame Merian, it surprises small birds on their nests, and sucks
                    their blood with avidity. It forms a tube-shaped cell, narrow at its posterior
                    extremity, composed of a fine white semi-transparent tissue, resembling muslin.
                    The cocoon of this species is like a large walnut in size and form. Its native
                    countries are Cayenne and Surinam. Other nearly allied species also occur in
                    those parts of South America, as well as in Africa and the East Indies. Their

                <p>The species of this section inhabit dry and mountainous places, where they form
                    tunnels or subterranean galleries, sometimes two feet in depth. At the entrance

                    undistinguishable from the surrounding soil. There is what we may not improRerly
                    call a mat of silk fastened to the inner surface of the door, on which the
                    animal frequently reposes, probably for the sake of guarding the entrance, and
                    being at hand to secure its passing prey. A fine silk tube, which is the proper
                    dwelling, clothes the interior of the gallery. Μ. Dufour is of opinion that the

                    opening of its door with its utmost strength, and continues struggling in the
                    entrance till the light has fairly entered, after which it retreats into the

                    that it always shuts close of its own accord. It preys upon beetles and other
                    large and strong insects. When its door is cut off or unhinged, it forms another
                    in its place, which, according to Rossi, differs from the first in not being
                    movable. The Italian author does not mention by what means its entrance and exit
                    are then accomplished; but Latreille has suggested that the experiment may have
                    been tried just before the commencement of winter, and that the second operculum
                    was closed with a view to exclude the rigours of that inclement season.</p>

                    der</hi><hi rend="italic">Insectem</hi> Plate L. fig. 2). It has since been
                    observed by several French entomologists at Sevres, near Paris, and was
                    discovered in this country by Dr Leach, near Exeter. Its habits are curious and
                    interesting. It constructs for its dwelling a silky seabbard, intermingled with
                    moss, eight or ten inches long. Its direction is at first horizontal over the
                    surface of the ground, and then perpendicular beneath the surface. The eggs are
                    deposited at the bottom, enveloped in a white web. The animal itself is slow in
                    its movements. It is most frequently met with in the month of July. It appears
                    to have been described and figured by Roemer as the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The genera of this great division are possessed of only a pair of pulmonary
                    sacks, and corresponding stigmata. The palpi, composed of five joints, are
                    inserted on the exterior side of the maxillae, near their base, generally in a
                    sinus. The languette is advanced between the maxillae, and is sometimes nearly
                    square, sometimes triangular or semicircular. The spinners are six in number.
                    The last article of the palpi in the males is more or less ovoid, and usually
                    contains the generative organs in an excavation.</p>
                <p>The first four tribes of this section may be considered as forming a large group,
                    which we name <hi rend="italic">Sedentaria.</hi> They either spin webs for the
                    capture of their prey, or throw out isolated and irregular threads for the same
                    purpose. Their eyes are grouped across the front of the thorax. Of these there
                    are usually eight; four or two in the centre, and two or three on each side.
                    Sometimes there are only six eyes.</p>
                <p>The first three of these tribes, viz. <hi rend="italic">Tubitelae, Inaqui∙
                    teloe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Orbiielae,</hi> are sometimes included under
                    the more general appellation of <hi rend="smallcaps">Rectigrade,</hi> from their
                    straightforward mode of progression, particularly as contrasted with that of the

                    crustaceous class, can direct their steps in different directions without
                    turning the body. In these tribes the relative length of the legs is variable.
                    In many the first and the last pair are the longest; in others the two <pb

                    while in some the third and fourth pair are the most extended. The eyes, in

                <p>The spiders of this genus live under stones, in the clefts of walls, and among
                    leaves. They form little dwelling-places of white silk. The cocoons of some are

                <p>This is the most frequent inhabitant of our houses, and an object of more than
                    common aversion. It sometimes attains to a large size. According to Homberg, it
                    is subject, especially in the kingdom of Naples, to a disease which renders it
                    more than usually hideous. Its body becomes covered with scales, among which a
                    number of mites engender. Geoffroy was of opinion that a spider was supplied
                    only with a certain portion of spinning material; that if the web was
                    intentionally destroyed, and an individual frequently obliged to reconstruct its
                    web, it became at last incapable of further exertion in that line, and would
                    probably perish for want of the usual means of subsistence.</p>
                <p>The spiders of this country are entirely harmless, from their want of power to
                    pierce the skin. But that they arc furnished with a poisonous liquid, which they
                    instil into the wound of their victims, cannot be doubted. Olivier, indeed,
                    reports, that a farmer in one of the Isles d’Hières was bitten by a large spider
                    while turning a sheaf of wheat. The wound occasioned at first only a slight
                    inflammation, so trivial that it was for some time neglected, till its increase
                    created alarm. Gangrene and death ensued. They may be taken internally with
                    impunity. “J’ai vue,” says Latreille, “le célèbre astronome Lalande avaler de

                    the surface of which it spins a beautifully constructed web. “The habitation of
                    <hi rend="italic">aranea aquatica,</hi> the other spider to which I alluded, is
                    chiefly remarkable for the element in which it is constructed, and the materials
                    that compose it. It is built in the midst of water, and formed in fact of air!
                    Spiders are usually terrestrial; but this is aquatic, or rather amphibious: for
                    though she resides in the midst of water, in which she swims with great
                    celerity, sometimes on her belly, but more frequently on her back, and is an
                    admirable diver, she not unfrequently hunts on shore, and having caught her
                    prey, plunges with it to the bottom of the water. Here it is she forms her
                    singular and unique abode. She would evidently have but a very uncomfortable
                    time were she constantly wet; but this she is sagacious enough to avoid, and, by
                    availing herself of some well-known philosophical principles, she constructs for
                    herself an apartment, in which, like the mermaids and sea-nymphs of fable, she
                    resides in comfort and security. The following is the process :—First she spins
                    loose threads in various directions, attached to the leaves of aquatic plants,
                    which may be called the frame-work of her chamber; and over them she spreads a
                    transparent varnish resembling liquid glass, which issues from the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193100241" xml:id="kp-eb0703-0241-0360"/> middle of her
                    spinners, and which is so elastic that it is capable of great expansion and
                    contraction; and if a hole be made in it, it immediately closes again. Next she
                    spreads over her belly a pellicle of the same material, and ascends to the
                    surface. The precise mode in which she transfers a bubble of air beneath this
                    pellicle is not accurately known; but from an observation made by the ingenious
                    author of the little work from which this account is abstracted, he concludes
                    that she draws the air into her body by the anus, which she presents to the
                    surface of the pool, and then pumps it out from an opening at the base of the
                    belly, between the pellicle and that part of the body, the hairs of which keep
                    it extended. Clothed with this aerial mantle, which to the spectator seems
                    formed of resplendent quicksilver, she plunges to the bottom, and, with as much
                    dexterity as a chemist transfers gas with a gasholder, introduces her bubble of
                    air beneath the roof prepared for its reception. This manoeuvre she repeats ten
                    or twelve times, until at length, in about a quarter of an hour, she has
                    transported as much air as suffices to expand her apartment to its intended
                    extent, and now finds herself in possession of a little acrial edifice—I had
                    almost said an enchanted palace—affording her a commodious and dry retreat in
                    the very midst of the water. Here she reposes unmoved by the storms that agitate
                    the surface of the pool, and devours her prey at ease and in safety. Both sexes
                    form these lodgings. At a particular season of the year the male quits his
                    apartment, approaches that of the female, enters it, and enlarging it by the
                    bubble of air that he carries with him, it becomes a common abode for the happy
                    pair.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    and colour. We are indebted to Treviranus <hi rend="superscript"> 0r</hi> an
                    account of its anatomical structure. The heart presents a character not observed

                <p>VΛT ττr - <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> species. From its inferior and anterior
                    part proceed two muscles, which, at first united in one, diverge as they
                    approach the posterior portion of the abdomen. The heart itself exhibits several
                    branches, the two anterior of which are sent to the branchia; and the function
                    of these last-named organs, according to Treviranus, is to absorb humidity from
                    the atmosphere, and convey it to the circulating system. The true respiratory
                    organs are discoverable in a species of stigmata placed in the thorax and
                    abdomen. These stigmata are not pierced, like those of insects; but numerous
                    vessels are seen distributed over their surface.</p>
                <p>The sceptre or diadem spider, as this species is frequently called, pairs about
                    the end of summer, and deposits its eggs in autumn. The eggs are of a fine
                    yellow, inclosed in a cocoon of a close texture, but covered with a looser
                    substance of a yellowish hue. This spider forms no nest, but shelters itself
                    beneath a leaf or some other natural covering. Its web is large and vertical.
                    The young are hatched in spring, and are at first yellow, with a blackish spot
                    on the upper part of the abdomen.</p>
                <p>Μ. Vautier has described a singular species of this genus, remarkable for the
                    posterior enlargement of its abdomen, which is terminated by a couple of arched
                    and elongated spines. <hi rend="italic">{Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">des

                <p>The species which constitute this tribe are, like those of the preceding, of
                    sedentary habits; but they differ in their mode of progression, being able to
                    walk sideways and backwards, as well as straight forward like the others. Hence
                    the designation of the tribe. Their four anterior feet are always longer than
                    the others. In some the first pair are longer than the second; in others they
                    are nearly equal. The mandibles are usually small, with their crotchets
                    transversely folded, as in the preceding tribes. The eyes are always eight in
                    number, frequently unequal, and forming by their union a crescent, or the
                    segment of a circle. The maxillae in the generality of this species are inclined
                    upon the lip. The body is generally flattish, crabshaped, with the abdomen
                    large, rounded, and triangular.</p>
                <p>The genera included in this division can scarcely be said to spin webs,—they
                    merely throw out a few isolated threads. They are usually found on plants,
                    tranquil and stationary; sometimes concealed between two leaves, of which they
                    fasten the edges together. They watch their eggs with great care till the young

                    of those exertions, the successful 'ssue of which depends on agility as well as
                    cunning. “Such,” says Evelyn, “1 did frequently observe at Rome, which, espying

                    be more imperceptible, unless the fly moved; and then would the spider move also
                    in the same proportion, keeping that ust time with her motion, as if the same

                    backwards, or to either side, without at all turning her body, like a

                    within the sphere of her reach) she made a fatal leap swift as lightning upon
                    the fly, catching him in the pole, where she never quitted hold till her belly
                    was full, and then carried the remainder home.”<note anchored="true"

                    cavities of walls, where they form silken tunnels, covered externally by minute
                    particles of earth and sand. In these retreats they undergo the periodical
                    renewal of their skins; and also pass the winter, after having previously closed

                    the abdomen, and when the mothers go abroad, they have thus no difficulty in
                    carrying their eggs along with them. As soon as the young are hatched, they
                    collect on the back of the female parent, and remain there till they gain

                    each side along the belly. Mandibles terminated by two fingers, of which the
                    exterior is movable.</p>
                <p>The thorax of scorpions assumes the form of a lengthened square. There is a
                    triangular appendage at the base of each of the four anterior feet, which in
                    combination produce the appearance of a lip of four divisions; but of these,
                    according to the views of Latreille, the lateral pair ought to be regarded as
                    maxillae, and the two others as forming the languette. The abdomen is composed
                    of twelve articulations, including those of the tail, which are six in number.
                    The first division of the abdomen is composed of two parts, the anterior of
                    which bears the sexual organs, the posterior the comb-shaped appendages. These
                    last-named parts are composed of a principal portion, narrow, lengthened,
                    jointed, movable at its base, and furnished along its inferior side with a range
                    of small, narrow, elongated, parallel plates, hollowed interiorly, united to the
                    principal piece before mentioned, and somewhat resembling the teeth of a comb;
                    their number seems to vary according to the species, and probably even with the
                    age of the individual. The uses of these organs in the economy of the animal
                    have not yet been determined. The four following segments of the abdomen have
                    each a pair of pulmonary sacks and stigmata. Immediately behind the sixth
                    segment the abdomen becomes suddenly narrow, and the six following knotty rings
                    compose the tail, terminated by an arched slender point, beneath the extremity
                    of whjch are two small holes, from which, at <pb break="no" facs="nls:193100306"

                    fluid, contained in an interior reservoir. The tarsi resemble each 'other, and
                    are composed of three articulations, the last of which is armed with a pair of
                    crotchets. The four posterior legs have a common base, and the first article of
                    the haunches is as it were soldered; the posterior pair are in part joined by
                    their back part to the abdomen.</p>
                <p>Two nervous cords, which derive their origin from the brain or superior ganglion,
                    unite at intervals and form seven other ganglia, of which the last belongs to
                    the tail. In all other Arachnides, according to Latreille, the number of these
                    ganglia never exceeds three.</p>
                <p>Eight stigmata mark the position of an equal number of whitish purses, containing
                    a great number of small delicate plates, among which it is believed the air
                    permeates. A muscular vessel prevails along the back, and Communicates by means
                    of two other vessels with each of these purses. The intestinal canal is straight
                    and slender. The liver is composed of four pair of glandular bunches, which
                    discharge their fluiddnto the intestines at four points. The females are
                    viviparous.</p>
                <p>Scorpions occur in the warmer regions of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America.
                    Several of the larger exotic species are poisonous, but the bite of the European
                    kinds is rarely attended by fatal consequences, except to small animals.
                    Maupertuis tried various experiments upon dogs and poultry with the scorpions of
                    Languedoc. Only one dog died. The others, as well as the poultry, though
                    repeatedly stung by <hi rend="italic">exasperated</hi> scorpions, suffered no
                    injury. Redi’s experiments on pigeons were followed by a different result. They
                    generally died in convulsions in about five hours after the infliction of the
                    wound. Some, however, appeared to suffer no inconvenience from the bite of these
                    animals. This difference may be attributed to the particular condition, or
                    rather the quantity of the poison contained in the vessels at the time of the
                    trial. The scorpions of Tuscany are so harmless that they are handled by the
                    peasants without any fear.</p>
                <p>Scorpions generally inhabit sombre and shady places, under stones, among old
                    ruins, deserted dwelling-houses, and even, though more rarely, such as are
                    occupied by man. They prey upon various kinds of insects, which they sting with
                    their envenomed tails. They arc very fond of tĥe eggs of spiders and of insects.
                    In running, they usually carry their tails curved forwards over their backs; and
                    they possess the power of moving them in all directions, either as offensive or
                    defensive weapons. We have already mentioned that they produce their young
                    alive. Redi states the number of these to amount to between 26 and 40, but some
                    species are more prolific. Maupertuis found from 27 to 65 in the bodies of those
                    which he examined. They were suspended or connected by a lengthened thread, and
                    each was inclosed in a very delicate membrane. The European kinds appear to
                    produce in August, and arc afterwards observed to change their skins. Some
                    naturalists are of opinion that they couple twice a year. The female carries her
                    young for several days upon her back, and watches over and defends them for
                    about a month.</p>
                <p>In the preceding generalities we have given the principal characters of the old
                    genus scorpio. That genus has been recently divided into two, in conformity with
                    the number of the eyes.</p>

                    Europe.</p>

                <p>This is the species experimented on by Maupertuis. He inclosed about 100 in one
                    place, and after the lapse of a few days he found only 14 survivors, which had
                    killed and eaten their companions. It occurs in France, Portugal, and Spain;

                <p>The Tracheal Arachnides are distinguished by their respiratory organs, which
                    consist of radiated or branched tracheae, receiving air only by two stigmatic
                    openings. They possess no (ascertained) circulating system, and their eyes vary
                    from two to four. Müller assigns six eyes to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydrachna</hi><hi rend="italic">umbrata,</hi> but Latreille is of opinion that
                    some optical or other deception may have interfered with the usual accuracy of
                    the great Danish naturalist. The respiration of the Pyenogonides is unknown, no
                    stigmata having been observed in that family.</p>
                <p>The Arachnides of this order are the smallest of their class. Some species are
                    almost microscopical. They are naturally divided into two great divisions. Those
                    which belong to the first are more nearly allied to the preceding order, the
                    pulmonary Arachnides, in the form and structure of their masticating organs;
                    such as pertain to the second have the parts of the mouth more simply
                    constructed of certain parts, which, in union with the languette, constitute a
                    kind of trunk or sucker. But many of the species arc so minute, even in their
                    general dimensions, that the examination of these organs, and the consequent
                    classification of the species in accordance with a <hi rend="italic"
                    >cibarian</hi> system, are attended with considerable difficulty, and, in the
                    opinion of Latreille, ought not to be had recourse to, except in default of
                    other more obvious characteristics.</p>
                <p>The long-legged spider (commonly so called), which is a species of <hi

                    with a pair of hooks. The posterior pair of feet have five remarkable sealy
                    excrescences placed upon foot-stalks, and ranged along the inferior surface of
                    their first two articulations. The eyes, two in number, are very close to each
                    other, and are situated on an eminence of the anterior portion of the first
                    segment of the thorax, which presents the appearance of a large head bearing the
                    anterior pair of feet, in addition to the masticating organs.</p>
                <p>According to M. Dufour the terminal article of the palpi incloses a particular
                    disc-shaped organ, of a whitish colour and pearly lustre, not visible externally

                    placed on a small articulation. Latreille perceived a pretty large stigmatic
                    opening on each side of the body, between the first and second feet, and another
                    cleft at the base of the abdomen. The abdomen is oval and composed of nine

                    terminated at each extremity by a tubular article, of which the anterior portion

                    constitutes the mouth. Both sexes have eight feet proper for running; but the
                    females are moreover provided with two false feet, placed near the anterior
                    pair, and serving to carry the eggs.</p>
                <p>The species of which this family is composed inhabit the sea. They usually keep
                    themselves concealed among , sea-weed along the shores, and feed upon small
                    marine animals. Their movements are slow. Their bodies are generally linear, the
                    legs very long, composed of from eight to nine articles, and terminated by two
                    unequal crotchets, of which the smaller is cleft. The first articulation of the
                    body, or that which represents the head and mouth, forms an advanced, nearly
                    cylindrical tube, pierced at its extremity by a triangular opening. It also
                    bears the mandibles and palpi. The former are linear or cylindrical, composed of
                    two pieces, of which the last is pincer-shaped, with the inferior or fixed claw
                    shorter than the other. The palpi are filiform, with a crotchet at the end, and
                    composed of from five to nine articles. Each of the succeeding segments of the
                    body, with the exception of the last, serves as a point of attachment to a pair
                    of legs; and the segment which articulates with the mouth is provided on its
                    dorsal portion with a tubercle bearing the eyes, and on its ventral portion (in
                    the females) with a small additional pair of feet on which the eggs are
                    distributed. The terminal segment is small, cylindrical, and pierced at its
                    extremity. The stigmatic openings in the bodies of this family have not yet been
                    discovered.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Recent
                    observations induce the belief that these creatures breathe through their

                    their being erected into a separate order, intermediate in some respects between

                    accordance with the views of M. Latreille. M. Milne Edwards, who has studied
                    these animals in their native places, informed that celebrated entomologist,

                    the appearance of rings, formed by the folds of the epidermis. The anterior

                    the observations of Μ. Szovits, a naturalist recently employed by the Russian
                    government to explore the Caucasus, that the bite of these bugs of Minna, as
                    they are sometimes called <hi rend="italic">{Argas</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Persicus</hi> of Fischer), is in reality by no means dangerous.</p>
                <p>The three following genera correspond to the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydrachna</hi> of Müller. Their habits are aquatic, and their forms oval, or
                    nearly globular, and of a soft consistence. The number of their eyes varies from
                    two to four, and even to six, according to Müller. They were usually confounded
                    with the mites till the time of the last-named observer, who inferred that as
                    they lived habitually in a different element, they ought to form a separate
                    division. They resemble small spiders, and probably on that account received the
                    name of Hydrachna, which signifies water-spider. Fabricius, who only employed in
                    the formation of his groups characters drawn from the structure of the mouth,
                    has united Hydrachna with Trombidium. The observations of Latreille have led not
                    only to the distinct separation of these two genera, but to the subdivision of
                    the genus Hydrachna into at least three distinct groups of species, all of which
                    may be readily distinguished from the various kinds of mites (Acari) by their
                    ciliated or natatorial legs.</p>
                <p>The minute beings now under consideration occur <pb break="no"

                    slowly moving waters. The spring season is the most favourable for the
                    observance of 'their habits. They <hi rend="italic">run</hi> through the water
                    with great rapidity, with a continual movement of their legs. Their dispositions
                    are carnivorous, and their food consists of animalcular species, of minute
                    insects, small flies, and aquatic larvae. Müller kept many Hydrachnae in vessels
                    of water full <hi rend="italic">oianimalcula infusoria,</hi> millions of which
                    were eaten in a few days, soon after which the Hydrachnae were found in a state
                    of great languor, and transparent from exhaustion. They speedily revived when a
                    few drops of water containing animalcules were mingled with that through which
                    they swam.</p>
                <p>The males are usually much less than the females, and the sexes frequently differ
                    in colour. Only four or five species were known before the time of Müller, to
                    whose persevering labours we owe the best elucidation which has yet been given
                    of their history.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See O.

                    occasions an insupportable itching. “Acarus Autumnalis,” says Dr Shaw,
                    “popularly known by the name of the harvest bug, is also one of the most minute
                    of the genus, and is of a bright red colour, with the abdomen bent on its hind
                    part, with numerous white bristles. This troublesome insect will make itself
                    sufficiently known to most people, during the months of July, August, and
                    September. It is easily distinguishable on the skin by its bright red colour,
                    and adheres so tenaciously when it has once fixed itself, as to be scarcely
                    separated without violence; its motion when disengaged is pretty quick, though
                    by no means equal to that of some other acari. On the part where it fixes it
                    causes a tumour, generally about the size of a pea, sometimes much larger,
                    accompanied by a severe itching. These insects abound on vegetables, and are
                    generally contracted by walking in gardens, amongst long grass, or in corn
