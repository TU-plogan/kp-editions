                    includes those branches of the piscatorial trade which are usually followed, not
                    so much for profit, as for pleasant recreation. That the practice of “casting
                    angles into the brook” had its origin in necessity, the mother of so many
                    inventions, can hardly be doubted; but it is equally clear that the refined
                    skill exhibited in this pursuit at the present day has been derived from leisure
                    and the love of sport, aided by the more delicate gear which modern ingenuity
                    has invented for the deception of the finny race.</p>
                <p>The comparative merits of angling, and of the kindred occupations of the fowler
                    and the huntsman, are not likely to be determined by any portraiture which a
                    lover of these exciting amusements might draw of their various excellencies, but
                    must depend on the tone and temper of mind possessed by different persons, and
                    their greater or less accordance with individual tastes. This much, however, may
                    be safely stated as a general and admitted truth, that the value of a pursuit
                    increases in proportion as it becomes attainable by the mass of our
                    fellow-creatures; and as angling is a much cheaper and more convenient pleasure
                    than either hunting or shooting, it may&gt; in so far as regards those
                    advantages, claim a decided preference. Be it remembered that Dr Johnson’s
                    description of a rod with a fly at one end and a fool at the other <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193097290" xml:id="kp-eb0703-7290-0133"/> is not admitted
                    among the memorabilia of the lovers of old Izaak Walton.</p>
                <p>The recreation of angling has been followed by many of the best and wisest of men
                    in modern ages. Sir Henry Wotton found from experience, that after prolonged
                    study of worldly occupation, it was “a rest to his mind, a cheerer of his
                    spirits, a diverter of sadness, a calmer of unquiet thoughts, a moderator of
                    passions, a procurer of contentedness;" and, besides the immediate excitement of
                    the sport itself, few occupations yield so much pleawure to the lovers of rural
                    scenery and the admirers of he picturesque. The most beautiful scenes in nature
                    usually adorn or consist of the banks of lakes and rivers; and the composition
                    of a perfect landscape, whether in nature or art, is incomplete without the
                    accessory of either tranquil or flowing waters. The pursuits of the artist and
                    the angler are therefore peculiarly compatible, and each lends an interest to
                    the other.</p>

                <p>Markham, in his <hi rend="italic">Country Contentments,</hi> describes not only
                    he outward apparel, but the inward qualities, of an angler. He must be generally
                    accomplished in all the liberal sciences, and, as a grammarian, ought to be
                    qualified to write and discourse of his art in true and fitting terms. He must
                    be possessed of <hi rend="italic">sweetness of speech</hi> to entice others to
                    so laudable an exercise, and of strength of argument to defend it against envy
                    and slander. “Then nust he be strong and valiant, neither to be amazed with
                    terms, nor affrighted with thunder; and if he is not temperate, but has a
                    gnawing stomach that will not endure nuch fasting, but must observe hours, it
                    troubleth the mind and body, and loseth that delight which only maketh pastime
                    pleasing.” “He must be of a well-settled and constant belief, to enjoy the
                    benefit of his expectation; for then to despair, it were better never to be put
                    in practice: and he must ever think when the waters are pleasant, and any thing
                    likely, that there the Creator of ill good things hath stored up much of plenty;
                    and though your satisfaction be not as ready as your wishes, yet you must hope
                    still, that with perseverance you shall reap the fulness of your harvest with
                    contentment. Then he must be full of love both to his pleasure and his
                    neighour—to his pleasure, which otherwise will be irksome and tedious—and to his
                    neighbour, that he never give offence in any particular, nor be guilty of any
                    general destruction: then he must be exceeding patient, and neither vex nor
                    excruciate himself with losses or mischances, as in losing the prey when it is
                    almost in the hand, or by breaking his tools by ignorance or negligence; but
                    with pleased sufferance amend errors, and think mischances instructions to
                    better carefulness.”</p>
                <p>In regard to the antiquity of angling, it has been traced by some to the time of
                    Seth, who is asserted to have taught it to his sons; and so highly have others
                    esteemed the knowledge of the art, as to maintain that its rules and maxims w¢re
                    engraven on those pillars by which an acquaintance with music, the mathematics,
                    and other branches of useful knowledge, was preserved by God’s appointment from
                    extinction in the days of Noah. It is frequently alluded to in the holy
                    Scriptures; as in Isaiah, xix. 8, “The fishers also shall mourn, and all they
                    that cast angle into the brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the
                    waters shall languish so in the prophet Habbakuk, i. 15, “They take up all of
                    them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their
                    drag; therefore they rejoice and are glad.” We deem it unnecessary to multiply
                    quotations from ancient authors, whether sacred or profane; but shall rest
                    satisfied with pointing out, at the close of this article, the principal works
                    on angling which have appeared in our own language, and in relation to the
                    practice of the art in British streams.</p>
                <p>As expert angling never was and never will be successfully taught by rule, but is
                    almost entirely the result of assiduous and long-continued practice, we purpose
                    being very brief in our disquisition on the subject. We shall commence by
                    stating our belief that fly-fishing, by far the most elegant and interesting
                    branch of the art, ought not to be regarded exclusively as an art of imitation.
                    It no doubt depends on deception, which usually proceeds on the principle of one
                    thing being successfully substituted in the likeness of another; but Bacon’s
                    distinctive definitions of simulation and dissimulation place the subject in a
                    truer light. As simulation consists in the adoption or affectation of what is
                    not, while dissimulation consists in the careful concealment of what really
                    is—the one being a positive, the other rather a negative act—so the great object
                    of the fly-fisher is to dissimulate in such a manner as to prevent his expected
                    prey from detecting the artificial nature of his lure, without troubling himself
                    by a vain effort to simulate or assume, with his fly, the appearance of any
                    individual or specific form of insect life. There is, in truth, little or no
                    connection between the art of angling and the science of entomology; and
                    therefore the success of the angler, in by far the greater proportion of cases,
                    does not depend on the resemblance which subsists between his artificial fly and
                    the natural insect. This statement is no doubt greatly at variance, as well with
                    the principles as the practice of all who have deemed fishing worthy of
                    consideration, from the days of Isaiah and Theocritus, to those of Carrol and
                    Bainbridge. But we are not the less decidedly of opinion, that in nine instances
                    out of ten a fish seizes upon an artificial fly as upon an insect or moving
                    creature <hi rend="italic">sui generis,</hi> and not on account of its exact and
                    successful resemblance to any accustomed and familiar object.</p>
                <p>It may be asked, upon what principle of imitative art the different varieties of
                    salmon-fly can be supposed to bear the most distant resemblance to any species
                    of dragonfly, to imitate which we are frequently told that they are intended?
                    Certainly no perceptible similarity in form or aspect exists between them, all
                    the species of dragonfly, with the exception of one or two of the sub-genus
                    Calep-terix, being characterized by very clear, lace-like, pellucid wings,
                    entirely unadorned by those fantastic and gaudy colours, borrowed from the
                    peacock and other “birds of gayest plume,” which are made to distinguish the
                    supposed resemblance. Besides, the finest salmon-fishing is in mild weather
                    during the colder seasons of the year, and in early spring, several months
                    before any dragonfly has become visible on the face of the waters, as it is a
                    summer insect, and rarely makes its appearance in the perfect state till the
                    month of June. If they bear no resemblance to each other in form or colour, how
                    much more unlike must they be, when, instead of being swept down the current, as
                    a real one would be, the artificial fly is seen cross-îng<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193097303" xml:id="kp-eb0703-7303-0134"/> and recrossing every stream
                    and torrent, with the agility of an otter, and the strength of an alligator?
                    Now, as it is demonstrable that the artificial fly generally used for salmon
                    bears no resemblance, except in size, to any living one; that the only tribe
                    which, from their respective dimensions, it may be supposed to represent, does
                    not exist in the winged state during the period when the imitation is most
                    generally and most successfully practised; and if they did, that their habits
                    and natural powers totally disenable them from being at any time seen under such
                    circumstances as would give a colour to the supposition of the one being ever
                    mistaken for the other; may we not fairly conclude that, in this instance at
                    least, the fish proceed upon other grounds, and are deceived by an appearance of
                    life and motion, rather than by a specific resemblance to any thing which they
                    had previously been in the habit of capturing? What natural insect do the large
                    flies, at which sea-trout rise so readily, resemble? These, as well as gilse and
                    salmon, frequently take the lure far within the bounds of the salt-water mark;
                    and yet naturalists know that no such thing as a salt-water fly exists, or at
                    least has ever been discovered by their researches. Indeed no true insect
                    inhabits the sea. What species are imitated by the palmer, or by three fourths
                    of the dressed flies in common use? An artificial fly can, at the best, be
                    considered only as the representation of a natural one which has been drowned,
                    as it is impossible to imitate the dancing or hovering flight of the real insect
                    over the surface of the stream; and, even with that restricted idea of its
                    resemblance to nature, the likeness must be scarcely perceptible, owing to the
                    difference of motion, and the great variety of directions in which the angler
                    drags his flies, according to the nature and special localities of the current,
                    and the prevailing direction of the wind.</p>
                <p>The same observations apply, with almost equally few exceptions, to bait-fishing.
                    The minnow is fastened upon swivels, which cause it to revolve upon its axis
                    with such rapidity, that it loses every vestige of its original appearance; and
                    in angling with the par tail, one of the most killing lures for large trout, the
                    bait consists of the nether half of a small fish, mangled and mis-shapen, and in
                    every point of view divested of its natural form.</p>
                <p>Fly-fishing has been compared, though by a somewhat circuitous mode of reasoning,
                    to sculpture. It proceeds upon a few simple principles, and the theory is easily
                    acquired, although it may require long and severe labour to become a great
                    master in the art. Yet it is needless to encompass it with difficulties which
                    have no existence in reality, or to render a subject intricate and confused,
                    which is in itself so plain and unencumbered. In truth, the ideas which at
                    present prevail on the matter degrade it beneath its real dignity and
                    importance. When Plato, speaking of painting, says that it is merely an art of
                    imitation, and that our pleasure arises from the truth and accuracy of the
                    likeness, he is surely wrong; for if it were so, where would be the superiority
                    of the Roman and Bolognese over the Dutch and Flemish schools? So also in regard
                    to fishing: The accomplished angler does not condescend to imitate specifically,
                    and in a servile manner, the detail of things; he attends, or ought to attend,
                    only to the great and invariable ideas which are inherent in universal nature.
                    He throws his fly lightly and with elegance on the surface of the glittering
                    waters, because he knows that an insect with outspread gawzy wings.would so
                    fall; but he does not imitate (or if he does so, his practice proceeds upon an
                    erroneous principle), either in the air or on his favourite element, the flight
                    or the motion of a particular species, because he also knows that trouts are
                    much less conversant in entomology than Μ. Latreille, and that their omnivorous
                    propensities induce them, when inclined for food, torisewiflμ equal eagerness at
                    every minute thing which creepeth upon the earth or swimmeth in the waters. On
                    this fact he generalizes,—and this is the philosophy of fishing.</p>
                <p>We are therefore of opinion that all, or a great proportion, of what has been so
                    often and sometimes so well said about the great variety of flies necessary to
                    an angler, —about the necessity of changing his tackle according t <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi> each particular month throughout the season,—about one
                    fly being adapted solely to the morning, another to noonday, and a third to the
                    evening,—and about every river having its own particular flies, &amp;c. is, if
                    not erroneous, at least exaggerated and misconceived. That determinate relations
                    exist between flies of a certain colour and particular conditions of a river,
                    is, we doubt not, true; but these are rather connected with angling as an
                    artificial science, and have but little to do with any analogous relations in
                    nature. The great object, by whatever means it is to be accomplished, is to
                    render the fly deceptive; and this, in fact, we believe to be more frequently
                    effected when fishing with flies which differ in colour and general appearance
                    from those which are upon the water. When a particular fly prevails upon a
                    river, an artificial one in imitation of it will never resemble it so closely as
                    to appear the same to those below <hi rend="italic">(i. e.</hi> the fish): on
                    the contrary, a certain degree of resemblance, without any thing like an exact
                    similitude, will only render the finny tribe the more cautious through
                    suspicion; while a different shape and colour, by exciting no minute or
                    invidious comparisons, would probably have been swallowed without examination.
                    Indeed, it seems sufficiently plain, that where means of comparison are allowed,
                    and where exact imitation is at the same time impossible, it is much better to
                    have recourse to a general idea, than to an awkward and bungling individual
                    representation. How often has it been asserted, with all the gravity of
                    sententious wisdom, that the true mode of proceeding in fly-fishing is to busk
                    your hook by the river-side, after beating the shrubs to see what colour of
                    insect prevails. A very expert angler, who perhaps carried the opposite theory
                    rather too far (although he always filled his pannier), was in the habit of
                    stirring the briars and willows to ascertain what manner of fly was not there,
                    and with that he tempted the fishes.</p>
                <p>It is admitted, that during mid-summer, when the weather is calm, the sky clear,
                    and the river low, and when what is called fine fishing is necessary, a close
                    imitation both of the appearance and motions of the natural fly may frequently
                    be tried with advantage; in which case the tackle may be allowed to drop gently
                    down the stream: but it more usually happens, from the style of fishing
                    practised during the vernal and autumnal states of a river, that the hook is not
                    deceptive from its appearing like a winged fly which has fallen from its native
                    element, but from its motion and aspect resembling that of some aquatic insect.
                    When the end of the line first falls on the surface of the water, the fish may
                    be deceived by the idea of a natural fly; and it is on that account that the
                    angler should throw his tackle lightly and with accuracy, and it is on that
                    account also that we would advise the more frequent throwing of the line: but so
                    soon as the practitioner begins to describe his semicircle across the river, the
                    character of the lure is changed, and the trout then seizes the bait, not as a
                    drowning insect, but as a creature inhabiting its own element, which had
                    ventured too far from the protection of the shallow shore or the sedgy bank.
                    That this is the case, a subsidiary argument may also be drawn from the fact,
                    that in most rivers the greater number and the finest fish are generally killed
                    by <pb break="no" facs="nls:193097316" xml:id="kp-eb0703-7316-0135"/>the
                    drag-fly, which, during the process of angling, swims an inch or two under
                    water.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, as these opinions of ours may not accord with the practice of other
                    anglers, we shall proceed somewhat more methodically to explain a few of the
                    principles of the art as usually received and followed.</p>
                <p>The great secret in fly-fishing, after a person has acquired the art of throwing
                    a long and a light line, is perserverance,—that is, constant and continuous
                    exertion. Fish are whimsical creatures, even when the angler, with all
                    appliances and means to boot, is placed apparently under he most favourable
                    circumstances. Let him, however, ommence his operations with flies which, upon
                    general principles, he knows to be good,—for example, a water-mouse body and
                    dark wing, hare-ear and moorfowl wing, red hackle and teal or mallard wing. It
                    may frequently happen that for an hour, or even two hours, he will kill nothing;
                    but then it will as often happen that for another couple of hours he will pull
                    them ashore with a most pleasing celerity.</p>
                <p>Next comes a pause of another hour or more, during which little or nothing is
                    obtained, so that if the intermediate period is frittered away, success is
                    doubtful or impossible. We believe that the appetites and motions of the finny
                    tribes are regulated and directed by certain (to us) almost imperceptible
                    changes in the state of the atmosphere, with which, as they do not proceed from
                    any determinate or ascertained principles of meteorological science, it is not
                    easy for the angler to become acquainted; and therefore the only method to
                    remedy the <hi rend="italic">désagrément</hi> thus arising, is to fish without
                    ceasing as long as he remains by the “pure element of waters.” The art of
                    angling, if worthily followed, and with an observant eye, will probably one day
                    or other be the means of throwing considerable light on the science of
                    electricity, it present one of the most obscure, though at the same time the
                    most important and influential, of all the subjects of physical learning.</p>
                <p>The best <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> flies, either to use fresh, or to serve
                    as models for the artificial kinds, are, <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> the
                    different sorts of stoneflies <hi rend="italic">(Phryganea</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Limnephilus),</hi> which are usually found by the water-side.
                    Their common colours are various shades of brown; they have pretty long feelers
                    or antennae, which, in a state of repose, are bent over their shoulders and
                    along their sides; their wings are held decumbent, or close to the sides. They
                    fly heavily, and are produced from aquatic larvae called caddis or case-worms,
                    remarkable for their curious dwelling-places, which are hollow tubes composed of
                    sand, small shells, and pieces of wood, agglutinated together, and made heavier
                    or lighter, according to circumstances, that they may the more easily sink or
                    swim. They are open at either end, and the worm crawls along the stones and
                    gravel, by protruding its legs at the anterior extremity. They disencumber
                    themselves from their aquatic habitations, and assume the winged state in spring
                    and the earlier part of summer. <hi rend="italic">Secondly,</hi> The different
                    kinds of May flies <hi rend="italic">(Ephemerae),</hi> called green drakes,
                    &amp;c. are also produced from larvae, which, for a long time previous to their
                    appearance as perfect insects, have inhabited the waters.</p>
                <p>There are many species of this genus, all of which are greedily sought for by
                    trout. They are easily known by their tapering abdomens, veined wings, short
                    antennae, and the long slender setae or hairs which terminate their bodies. They
                    chiefly abound from May to mid-summer. <hi rend="italic">Thirdly,</hi> The small
                    black or ant-fly, is the winged female of the common black ant, and occurs in
                    the nests or hills of that insect during the summer and autumnal months.</p>
                <p>There is scarcely any season of the year, excepting the winter months, in which
                    an experienced angler may not successfully ply his trade.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Although Izaak Walton, that “great master in
                    the art of angling,” informs us that no man should in honesty catch a trout till
                    the middle of March, yet the grayling is in best condition during the winter
                    season. “I do assure you,” says Charles Cotton, in the second part of the
                    Complete Angler, “which I remember by a very remarkable token, I did once take,
                    upon the sixth day of December, one, and only one, of the biggest graylings, and
                    the best in season, that ever I yet saw.or tasted; and do usually take trouts
                    too, and with a fly, not only before the middle of this month, but, almost every
                    year, in February, unless it be a very ill spring indeed; and have sometimes in
                    January, so early as new-year’s tide, and in frost and snow, taken grayling in a
                    warm sun-shine day for an hour or two about noon; and to fish for him with a
                    grub it is then the best time of all.”</p></note> In the mid-summer season, when
                    the pools are very clear and shallow, and the streams almost dried up, little
                    can be done without a stirring breeze; so also after a heavy summer flood,
                    immediately ensuing a continuance of dry weather, when the mountain torrents are
                    a sheet of dingy foam, and the crystal depths of the river are converted for a
                    time into an opaque flow of muddy water, the fly-fisher’s occupation’s gone. But
                    when the turmoil ceases, and the soft south wind begins to disperse or break in
                    upon the dense array of clouds, so as to chequer the streams, and rocks, and
                    “pastoral melancholy” of the green mountains with the enlivening beams of the
                    returning sun, with what pleasure does the angler approach the banks of a
                    favourite and accustomed river! How various and delightful are his sensations!
                    Custom cannot stale their infinite variety :—on the contrary, the longer and
                    more assiduously the pleasure is pursued, the greater the immediate enjoyment,
                    and the more extended the train of agreeable remembrances for after-days. How
                    exciting the first cast into a breeze-ruffled pool, when the unwetted gut still
                    lies in rebellious and unyielding circles on the surface, and yet almost at the
                    same moment the sounding reel gives notice that these circles have been
                    instantaneously stretched into a straight and tightened line! Then comes the
                    long and continuous vibration of rod and reel, indicating the secure hooking of
                    a goodly fish; or that sullen and pulse-like tug, by which a still goodlier one,
                    when hooked in a deep pool, frequently manifests a desire to <hi rend="italic"
                    >dig</hi> its way to the bottom; or that more interrupted music which results
                    from the fantastic leaps of some whimsical individual, which skims and flounders
                    on the top of the water like a juvenile wild-duck.</p>
                <p>The ordinary rules for fly-fishing are, to be most assiduous when the streams are
                    somewhat disturbed and increased by rain,—when the day is cloudy, and the waters
                    moved by a gentle breeze, especially from the south. If the river contains long
                    placid pools, then a steady stirring breeze is very desirable, as angling in
                    such situations resembles lake-fishing, where nothing can be achieved upon a
                    glassy surface. If the wind is low and the weather clear, of course the best
                    angling is in the swiftest streams, and in those curling and perturbed eddies
                    which head the smoother depths. In fishing the smoother pools of no great depth,
                    be careful that the shadows of neither rod nor angler come upon the surface; but
                    if a person is skilful in other respects, he need not fear his own shadow in a
                    broad river, but wade boldly down the centre of the stream, fishing its various
                    depths and currents before him and on either side. In clear rivers the flies
                    should be small and rather slender-winged; but when the waters are muddy or
                    increased by rain, a larger lure may be <pb break="no" facs="nls:193097329"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-7329-0136"/>made use of. When the streams are brown with rain,
                    an 'orange-coloured fly is good; in very clear weather a lightcoloured one; and
                    a dark fly is advisable for troubled waters.</p>
                <p>Though a great deal no doubt depends on a quick eye and an active and delicate
                    hand, we are no great advocates for what is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >striking</hi> a fish. If a large trout rises in a deep pool, it may be of
                    advantage so to do; and this will be sufficiently accomplished by inclining the
                    rod quickly aside, so as to draw out a few inches of the line; for if the reel
                    is not allowed to run, this operation is apt to snap the gut, or otherwise
                    injure the tackle. But if a trout, whether great or small, rises in a current or
                    rapid stream, the sudden change in its position, immediately after it has seized
                    the fly, is generally quite sufficient to fix the barb, without any exertion on
                    the part of the angler.</p>
                <p>A variable state of the atmosphere is bad for angling; but neither is a uniformly
                    dull gloomy day the most favourable. It is scarcely possible to lay down any
                    general rules on this branch of the subject. We have half filled a pannier
                    during an electric hail-storm, when “sky lowered and muttered thunder,” and the
                    aspect of the day was such as to deter more experienced though less zealous
                    sportsmen from leaving the shelter of their homes. If the river is not too low,
                    we always prefer what in ordinary language might be called a fine cheerful day,
                    more particularly if there is a fresh breeze. And what we would more
                    particularly press upon the notice of the angler, as soon as he becomes master
                    of the line, is, that he should cast his flics more frequently than is the usual
                    practice, and, generally speaking, fish rapidly. This should be more especially
                    attended to in streams where the trout are numerous and not large.</p>
                <p>Before enumerating and describing the different kinds of artificial flies in
                    greatest repute, we shall mention a few of the principal materials used by the
                    fly-fisher. The articles which he employs in common with those who prosecute the
                    other branches of the trade, are of course rods, hair and gut lines, reels and
                    hooks, panniers and landing-nets; but in addition to these he must be provided
                    with a great variety of feathers, such as the slender plumes called hackles,
                    from the necks and backs of common poultry, and the wings of a considerable
                    number of birds, such as woodcocks, snipes, rails, plovers, ducks, grouse,
                    partridges, and others. The furs of quadrupeds are also indispensable; and of
                    these the most useful are hares, squirrels, moles, martens, mice, and
                    water-rats.</p>
                <p>The most esteemed hackles are the <hi rend="italic">duns.</hi> The red, striped
                    down the centre with black, and the red with a blackish root, are likewise
                    useful, and more easily obtained. Since the introduction of Spanish poultry (by
                    which name are designated the black breed with white tops), black hackles are
                    now more common than formerly. The proper time for plucking hackles is about
                    Christmas. The feathers of the ostrich and peacock are of frequent service; and
                    for salmon and sea-trout the gaudy plumes of parrots and other brilliantly
                    attired foreign species, however unlike the generality of our northern insects,
                    ought to be collected by every fly-fisher.</p>
                <p>The silks commonly used by the angler arc of three kinds :—l&lt;tf, Barbers’
                    silk, used double, for splicing the top-pieces of rods; 2<hi rend="italic"
                    >dly,</hi> a more delicate kind, for fastening on the rings through which the
                    reel-line runs; 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> fine netting silk for whipping
                    hooks and dressing flics. When we mention a pair of small pliers, fine-pointed
                    scissors, needles, and wax, we have noted the principal materials for the
                    angler’s trade.</p>
                <p>In regard to rods, their length and formation arc so much matters of individual
                    taste, that few general rules can be laid down upon the subject. According to
                    Daniel, the wood should be cut about Christmas, and allowed^ to season for a
                    twelvemonth. Hazel is very generally used, especially that from the <hi
                    rend="italic">cob-nut,</hi> which grows to a great length, and is for the most
                    part very straight and taper. The but-end should rather exceed an inch in
                    diameter, and the shoots for stocks, middle pieces, and tops, should be as free
                    from knots as possible. The tops are made from the best rush ground shoots. All
                    these pieces should be kept free from moisture till the ensuing autumn, when
                    such as are required to form a rod are selected; and, after being warmed over a
                    gentle fire, they are set as straight as possible, and laid aside for several
                    days. They are then rubbed over, by means of a piece of flannel, with linseed
                    oil, which produces a polish, and brings off the superfluous bark: they are then
                    bound tight to a straight pole, and kept till next spring, by which time they
                    will be seasoned for use. They are then matched together in due proportions, in
                    two, three, or more parts, according to the desired length, or the opinion of
                    the maker as to the number of pieces of which a rod should be composed. A
                    well-constructed spliced rod of no more than two pieces casts a line with fully
                    as much force, neatness, and accuracy as any other; but it is inconvenient to a
                    traveller, or to any one whose dwelling is not close upon a stream. If the
                    pieces are not ferruled, they must be spliced so as to join each other with
                    great exactness. The principal object to be kept in view in the formation of
                    rods in general is, that they should taper gradually and bend regularly. A
                    frequent defect is their bending too much in the middle, owing to that part not
                    being sufficiently strong.</p>
                <p>We have said that the length of a rod is rather a matter of taste than of
                    established rule. It must, however, bear a relation to the size of the river and
                    the nature of the expected capture. A trouting rod is usually made from <hi
                    rend="italic">12 to</hi> 14 feet in length, though some prefer them of greater
                    extent, as giving more command over lakes and spreading pools. It should be made
                    as light as is consistent with strength and durability, as a heavy rod is
                    cumbersome, fatiguing, and unwieldy; and a light one gives a more ready power in
                    casting under hollow banks, or among trees or bushes. For pike and barbel a
                    proper length is 16 feet; for perch, chub, bream, carp, eels, and tench, a
                    shorter rod may be used; and 8 or 10 feet is sufficient for dace, gudgeon, ruff,
                    bleak, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> The portability of a rod depends of course
                    on the number of joints; but its excellence being almost in the inverse ratio,
                    care must be taken not to sacrifice its goodness merely for the sake of a
                    convenient form.</p>
                <p>According to Mr Bainbridge, the best rods are made from ash, hickcry, and
                    lance-wood; ash for the bottom piece, hickery for the middle, and lance-wood for
                    the top-joints. If real bamboo can be procured of good quality, it is preferable
                    to lance-wood. Rose-wood and partridge-wood from the Brazils may also be used
                    for the top-pieces. The extreme length of the top-piece is usually composed of a
                    few inches of whalebone. The rings for the reelline may be made by twisting a
                    piece of soft brass-wire round a tobacco-pipe, and soldering the ends together.
                    They ought to diminish in size as they are made to approach the top, and must
                    form a straight and regular line with each other when the rod is put up for
                    use.</p>
                <p>In finishing a rod the usual varnish is copal varnish, or Indian rubber dissolved
                    over a slow fire in linseed oil. It may be stained by a dilution of nitric acid
                    or oil of vitriol. When rods are stored for the winter, after use, they ought to
                    be rubbed over with tallow or salad oil. As few anglers require to make their
                    own rods, we deem it unnecessary to enter into a full detail of a mechanical
                    practice which can only be sufficiently executed by an individual of
                    professional<pb break="no" facs="nls:193097342" xml:id="kp-eb0703-7342-0137"/>
                    experience. We shall merely mention, that, in addition to the woods already
                    named, elder, holly, yew, mountain ash, and briar, all of which are indigenous
                    to this country, furnish materials to the makers of rods.</p>
                <p>As lines may be purchased from the tackle-makers at a cheaper rate than they can
                    be made by an amateur whose time and labour are of value for any other purpose,
                    we shall not here enter into a detail of their formation. The best hair is
                    procured from the tail of a well-grown stallion. 31ack hair is generally strong,
                    but the colour is not very serviceable. Transparent and almost colourless hair
                    is the most approved; and it ought to be round, regular, and free from
                    blemishes. In the formation of lines each hair in a link should be equal, round,
                    and even, which proportions the strength and prevents single hairs from
                    breaking, and thus weakening the others. Chesnut or brown-coloured hairs are
                    best for ground angling, especially in muddy water. Some anglers stain their
                    lines a pale green for fishing in weedy waters. Black is occasionally used in
                    streams which flow from mosses, and are themselves of an unusually dingy
                    hue.</p>
                <p>The following are some of the methods used by anglers for dyeing their lines,
                    whether of hair or gut.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">For a pale watery green.&gt;—</hi> To a pint of strong ale add
                    half a pound of soot, a small quantity of walnut leaves, find a little powdered
                    alum; boil these materials for half or three quarters of an hour, and when the
                    mixture is cold steep the gut or hair in it for ten or twelve hours.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">For a brown.—</hi> Boil some powdered alum till it is
                    dissolved; add a pound of walnut-tree bark from the branches when the sap is in
                    them, or from the buds, or the unripe fruit. Let the liquid stand till nearly
                    cool, and skim it; then put in the gut or hair, and stir it round for about a
                    minute, or till it appears to have imbibed the desired tint. It ought not to be
                    strongly tinctured, as it is apt to rot when too dark. For a <hi rend="italic"
                    >bluish watery tint</hi> the above ingredients are also used, with the
                    substitution of logwood instead of walnut.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">For a yellow.—</hi> The inner bark of a crab-tree boiled in
                    water, with some alum, makes a good yellow, excellent for staining tackle used
                    among decayed weeds, the colour of which it closely resembles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A tawny hue</hi> is obtained by steeping hair among lime and
                    water for four or five hours, and then allowing it to soak for a day in a
                    tan-pit. In the absence of other ingredients, both gut and hair may be easily
                    stained by being left for twenty-four hours in strong tea, either with or
                    without a few log-wood scrapings.</p>
                <p>The hair to be dyed ought to be selected from the best white. Silken or hempen
                    lines may be tinted by a decoction of oak bark, which is said to add to the
                    durability of these materials.</p>
                <p>We shall now proceed to consider the subject in relation to the different species
                    of fish which form the principal objects of the angler’s art.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Salmon. (Salmo Salar.)</hi></p>
                <p>As the natural history, classification, and characteristic distinctions of fishes
                    will be given at length under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Ichthyology</hi>
                    in this work, we shall not here enter into any description of either the
                    structure or habits of the class, but confine ourselves for the present almost
                    entirely to such points as are most essential to the practical knowledge of the
                    angler.</p>
                <p>This fine fish delights in large and rapid rivers. It bites best from six in the
                    morning till eleven in the forenoon, and from three in the afternoon till
                    sunset. A moderate breeze is of advantage; and the best months are March, April,
                    May, and June. The salmon is justly regarded by the angler as the king of fish;
                    and when we consider that they occasionally measure four feet in length, and
                    weigh upwards of 70 pounds, we may conceive how difficult a capture and how
                    valuable a prize they sometimes prove. The most successful bait, as well as the
                    most agreeable in the usage, is the artificial fly. This is made in imitation
                    both of dragonflies and butterflies of various kinds; but the principles which
                    we have already endeavoured to establish at the commencement of this article
                    make it unnecessary to describe the natural species. Even those who most warmly
                    advocate the necessity of imitating existing insects in the formation of their
                    lures, admit that the salmon is so capricious as frequently to rise at an
                    artificial fly which bears no resemblance to any natural form of insect
                    life.</p>
                <p>The following are the descriptions of six artificial flies which have been found
                    very successful in raising salmon. No. 1 (see Plate XLV. fig. 1) is recommended
                    as a spring fly, and is composed of the following materials: Wings of the dark
                    mottled brown or blackish feather of a turkey; body of orange camlet mixed with
                    a little mohair; and a dusky red or bright brown cock’s hackle, plucked from the
                    back where the fibres are longest, for the legs. The hook should be of the same
                    size as represented in the plate; and it has been observed that all large
                    salmonflies should be dressed upon two or three lengths of gut twisted together,
                    and that the silk in dressing be brought beyond the shank of the hook, and
                    wrapped four or five times round the gut, so that it may not be speedily cut by
                    the sharpness of the steel.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Bainbridge’s <hi rend="italic">Fly-Fither’s Guide,</hi> p. 96.</p></note>
                    This same fly, dressed with the wings of a somewhat brighter shade, and with the
                    addition of a little gold wire or thread wrapped round the body at equal
                    distances, will also serve for a more advanced season of the year. No.2 (see
                    Plate XLV. fig. 2) is of smaller size, and may sometimes be dressed upon very
                    strong single gut. Any feather of a coppery or dingy yellow colour, if not too
                    coarse in the fibres, will be suitable for the wings; the body is of
                    lemon-coloured mohair, mixed with a small portion of light brown fur or camlet,
                    with a pale dusky ginger hackle over the whole. The chief object to be attended
                    to in dressing this fly is to produce that uniform hue, devoid of gaudy
                    colouring, from which it has received the name of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >quaker</hi><hi rend="italic">fly.</hi> Of No. 3 (see Plate XLV. fig. 3) the
                    wings are made from the plumes of a cormorant, or from the mottled feathers of a
                    dark mallard: the body is of dark sable, ribbed with gold wire, over which a
                    dusky red hackle is thickly wound: the mottled feathers of a drake are used for
                    the tail; and previous to fastening off, a small portion of flos silk should be
                    unravelled and fastened at the extremity of the hook. This fly, though, like the
                    preceding, of a somewhat sombre cast, is frequently used with success in summer.
                    No. 4 (see Plate XLV. fig. 4) belongs to the gaudy class of lures, “which,” says
                    Mr Bainbridge, “however fanciful or varied in shade or materials, will
                    frequently raise fish when all the imitations of nature have proved
                    unsuccessful; indeed so fastidious and whimsical are the salmon at times, that
                    the more brilliant and extravagant the fly, the more certain is the angler of
                    diversion.” In this, of course, we perfectly agree. The wings of the fly in
                    question are formed of the extreme end of a Guinea fowl’s feather, not stripped,
                    but having the fibres remaining on both sides of the middle stem. A blood-red
                    hackle is fastened on with the wings, and so arranged <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193097355" xml:id="kp-eb0703-7355-0138"/>as to extend beyond them: the
                    dyed feathers used by <hi rend="superscript"> f</hi> military men will suit, if
                    another showy biped, the scarlet maccaw, is not accessible. The green feather
                    which forms the eye of the peacock’s tail should be fastened at the head, and
                    left hanging downwards, so as to cover the body for the space of half an inch;
                    and a few filaments of the same part of the feather may be fastened at the tail.
                    No. 5 has the wings formed from the darkish brown speckled portion of a
                    bittern’s wing stripped off from the stem: the head ought to be of the same
                    colours as the body, which is formed of the reddish brown part of a hare’s fur,
                    and deep copper-coloured mohair; a bittern’s hackle is put over the body for
                    legs, and a forked tail is added, made of a pair of single filaments of the same
                    feather as the wings. Of No. 6 the wings are formed of the mottled feathers of a
                    peacock’s wing, intermixed with any fine plain dusky red; the best mixture for
                    the body is the light brown inner hair from a bear’s skin, sable fur, and
                    gold-coloured mohair; gold twist, a large black cock’s hackle, and a red one a
                    little larger, with a bit of deep red mohair for the head. In addition to these,
                    we might enumerate the brown fly, the blue fly, the king-fisher, the prime dun,
                    the great palmer, the golden pheasant, the gray mallard, and many others; but
                    such as are above described will suffice for the purposes of the present
                    treatise. Fig. 6 of Plate XLV. represents an excellent spring fly; and an
                    approved summer kind is shown on the same plate, fig. 5.</p>
                <p>It may be stated at once, that so far from imitating nature, the maker of salmon
                    flies can scarcely form them in too unnatural and extravagant a manner. Let him
                    call in the aid of fancy at all times and places, at least in this country; for
                    the cold and cloudy clime of Scotland assuredly furnishes nothing resembling the
                    hires most frequently and most successfully used. The superabundant use of gold
                    and silver wire ought, however, to be avoided, as it not only causes the fly to
                    sink too much in the water, but prevents its being neatly or lightly thrown.
                    Spring flies for salmon are usually made of a larger size, though not so gaudily
                    dressed as those of summer.</p>
                <p>A salmon rod is generally proportioned to the size of the river which the angler
                    frequents; but it ought not to be less than 15 feet in length. The reel ought to
                    be large enough to contain 80 or 90 yards, so as to admit of abundance of line
                    being given out when required; for many fish, when struck, run out to a great
                    distance, and with such immense rapidity as to prevent the possibility of the
                    angler’s moving in the proper direction with "sufficient quickness. A salmon,
                    for the most part, darts violently up the stream; and, as the command and
                    direction of the fish is more easily kept with a short than a long line, it is
                    advisable to prevent his getting too far ahead, by keeping the rod well back in
                    the opposite direction, and by running towards him along the margin of the
                    stream. When he gains the head of the current, a salmon frequently throws
                    himself several times out of the water, on which occasions the angler must yield
                    him freely a little of the line; but during his general and less violent
                    manoeuvring, he will of course be the sooner exhausted the more firmly he is
                    held. When he appears to be making for some safe haunt or secret sheltering
                    place, the great object is to turn him towards safer ground, either by relying
                    on the soundness of the tackle, or, if he proves very powerful as well as very
                    obstinate, then a pebble or two may be thrown, so as to fall a little in advance
                    of his position, and he will probably turn himself round. Some fish become very
                    sulky, and will lie after being hooked, for a long time, motionless near the
                    bottom. In this case also the pebbles must be had recourse to; for the more a
                    fish is kept in motion, the sooner he becomes exhausted. When he begins to show
                    his side, and exhibits other unequivocal symptoms of exhaustion, a favourable
                    landing-place should' be looked for; and when the proper time arrives, which can
                    only be learned by the (sometimes dearly bought) lessons of experience, then is
                    he to be drawn by degrees to the gravel bank, or the gaff applied, and the prize
                    secured.</p>
                <p>When feeding, salmon are usually found at the foot of a strong stream,
                    terminating in an eddy or whirlpool. “And first,” says our father Walton, “you
                    shall observe that usually he stays not long in a place, as trouts will, but, as
                    I said, covets still to go nearer the spring-head; and that he does not, as the
                    trout and many other fish, he near the water side or bank, or roots of trees,
                    but swims in the deep and broad parts of the water, and usually in the middle,
                    and near the ground; and that there you are to fish for him; and that he is to
                    be caught as the trout is, with a worm, a minnow, which some call a penk, or
                    with a fly.”</p>
                <p>When the water is either too much discoloured for the use of the artificial fly,
                    or, running into the opposite extreme, becomes (especially in very still
                    weather) too clear and bright, salmon may be successfully angled for with the
                    worm. In this case trolling tackle is sometimes used.</p>
                <p>In trolling with minnow or other small fish, the foot lengths ought to be about
                    three yards long, and furnished with one or two swivels, to prevent the line
                    from twisting, as well as to enable the bait to play freely. A lead or shot
                    proportioned to the strength of the stream should be fastened to the line, about
                    a foot above the bait. The top of the rod should be stiffer than that used for
                    fly-fishing; and when the hook is baited, it ought to be thrown first across,
                    and then drawn up the stream.</p>
                <p>The salmon fry leave the spawning beds early in spring, and ere long make their
                    way towards the sea. In a few months they again seek their native streams,
                    having, during a very short period, attained to the weight of several pounds.
                    Without entering into the merits of the much-disputed question (still in some
                    points of difficult solution) as to the difference or the identity of samlets,
                    salmon fry, salmon trout, white trout, gilse, and salmon, suffice it to say,
                    that all the migratory kinds of trout, usually characterized by their small
                    number of spots, their silvery colour, and the superiority of their flesh, may
                    be angled for with much larger and more gaudily plumed flies than those used in
                    the capture of river-trout. Flies dressed upon the same principles as those used
                    for salmon, but of smaller size, will be found well adapted for whitings, and
                    the different kinds of sea or migratory trouts above mentioned.</p>

                <p>This species varies greatly in size and colour, in accordance probably with the
                    nature and abundance of its food, the strength and depth of the river in which
                    it occurs, and the physical properties of soil and climate. Fish seem, more than
                    most animals, to depend on peculiar and unappreciable circumstances, for the
                    full and characteristic development of their characters; and they consequently
                    exhibit great contrariety of aspect among individuals of the same species. If a
                    canal or reservoir, or any other great accumulation of water, is formed by the
                    hand of man, where the hand of nature had from time immemorial recognised only
                    some small and solitary streamlet, the lapse of a very few years produces large
                    and heavy fish, where none but trouts of the most trifling size had ever been
                    seen before. The writer of these observations kept a minnow little more than
                    half an inch long in a glass tumbler for a period of two years, during which
                    time there was no perceptible increase in its dimensions.</p>

                <p>Had it continued in its native stream, subjected to the fattening influence of a
                    continuous flow of water, and a consequent increase in the quantity and variety
                    of its food, its cubic dimensions would probably have been 20 times greater; yet
                    it must have attained, prior to the lapse of a couple of years, to the usual
                    period of the adult state, in regard to birds and quadrupeds, the individuals of
                    the ame species are not distinguishable from each other by any peculiarities
                    either of form or colour, at least within the limits of a restricted locality;
                    but it appears to be otherwise with several species of fish, more especially
                    trouts. Those of the Clyde and Tweed, although both rivers draw their primary
                    sources almost from the same mountain, present a constant and well-marked
                    difference in their external aspect; and a corresponding dissimilarity exists
                    among the characteristic varieties of almost every river and lake in Scotland;
                    “which I tell you that you may the better believe that I am certain, if I catch
                    at rout in one meadow he shall be white and faint, and very 1ike to be lousy;
                    and as certainly, if I catch a trout in the next meadow, he shall be strong, and
                    red, and lusty, and much better meat. Trust me, scholar, I have caught many a
                    trout in a particular meadow, that the very shape and the enamelled colour of
                    him hath been such as hath eyed me to look on him; and I have then with much
                    Measure concluded with Solomon, ‘ Every thing is beautiful in his season.’”<note

                <p>No fish affords the angler more varied or more constant sport than the trout. For
                    nine months in the year, under favourable circumstances, fly-fishing may be
                    practised for it with success. Westerly and southerly winds are the most
                    favourable, especially in spring; but during warm and cloudy summer weather, the
                    point from which the wind blows is of slight consequence. “He who considers the
                    wind,” says Solomon, “will never sow ;” and the same remark is not inapplicable
                    to angling. Whoever desires to become a successful practitioner in the art, must
                    angle in all weathers, and under every variety of circumstances, however
                    unpropitious the prospect may be. Trout are generally supposed to rise more
                    freely during a dark and lowering day, following a clear bright night, as
                    brilliant moonshine detains them in their lurking-places; and on the ensuing day
                    they are consequently more inclined for food. On the other hand, after a gloomy
                    or darkish night they are less easily tempted, having glutted themselves with
                    moths and other nocturnal insects, which, during the summer months, are abundant
                    on the waters. In throwing the line the angler should endeavour to make his gear
                    fall as lightly as possible on the surface, and his flies should drop opposite,
                    or somewhat above his own position, and then be played gently and neatly
                    downwards and across the stream. When a trout is seen to rise at a natural fly
                    or other insect, the artificial one should be offered him by being thrown, not
                    directly over him, but about a yard higher up the stream; and, if he is inclined
                    to rise again, he will probably meet it half-way. When a fish, on being hooked,
                    descends beneath the surface, and struggles in the depths below, it is a pretty
                    sure sign that he is well secured; but when he flounders on the surface, or
                    leaps occasionally into the air, more care is necessary, as in that case the
                    hook will frequently be found to be only skin-deep. In playing and landing a
                    large trout the same precautions are necessary as in salmon-fishing, although in
                    regard to smaller fish, if the angler is standing in the centre of a stream, and
                    finds it inconvenient to wade frequently ashore, a few additional turns will
                    exhaust the capture, which may then be drawn rapidly and steadily to the hand,
                    and secured by a firm grasp behind the gills. We have frequently practised a
                    summary method of landing even tolerably sized fish, which, though it cannot
                    always be effected, is, when possible, a great saving of time. If, from the
                    moment the trout is struek, he is prevented from redescending in such a manner
                    that the upper part of his head and eyes are retained above or on a level with
                    the surface, he will for the space of a good many seconds be so much astonished
                    as to be incapable of any active exertions, and will frequently allow himself to
                    be drawn in that position, and without resistance, straight ashore.</p>
                <p>The following flies are in repute among anglers. The <hi rend="italic">black
                    gnat</hi> appears about the end of April. The body is formed of a black strip
                    from an ostrich feather, and ought to be dressed thick and short; the wings of a
                    pale starling’s feather, or dressed as a hackle with a pale dun.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">March brown</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dun drake</hi> is
                    frequently visible by the middle of March. The wings are made from the mottled
                    feathers of a partridge’s tail, and the body of hareear fur, intermixed with a
                    little yellow worsted; a grizzled hackle for legs.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">hazel fly</hi> is of a round form, and difficult of
                    imitation. It is a killing fly in May and June, especially where bushes abound.
                    The body is composed of ostrich harl of two colours, black and purple twisted
                    together; the wings of the sandy-coloured feathers from under the wings of a
                    thrush, or the reddish plumes of a partridge’s tail; a bluish hackle, twisted
                    pretty full, serves both for the under wings and legs.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">great dark dun,</hi> according to Mr Bainbridge, is one of
                    the earliest flies which appear upon the water, and may be used in February, if
                    the weather is mild. The wings are formed from the dun feathers of a mallard’s
                    wing; the body of mole-fur, mixed with a little dark brown mohair; a dark
                    grizzled hackle for legs. Salmon frequently rise at this fly, which may be used
                    with success early in the morning during the whole fishing season.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">wrens tail</hi> has no wings: the body is of sable fur,
                    with a little gold-coloured mohair, and a feather from the tail of a wren.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">grouse hackle</hi> is also wingless: the mixture for the
                    body is dark olive, dusky yellow, and a little gold-coloured mohair. It is
                    formed of a fine mottled grouse’s feather of a reddish brown, running a little
                    dusky towards the hütend of the stem, and the downy portion, if any, plucked
                    away.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">stonefly</hi> is found along the edges of streams, and is a
                    favourite article of food among trout. It is a species of Phryganea, and springs
                    from a caddis or aquatic larva. The wings lie flat, and are imitated by the
                    mottled feather of a hen-pheasant or peahen. The body is composed of dark brown
                    fur from a bear’s skin, or the deeper part of a hare’s ear, mixed with yellow
                    camlet or mohair; a longish grizzled haekle is wrapped under the wings.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">mealy brown</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fern fly</hi> is
                    excellent for grayling in May. Its wings should be formed from the under part of
                    a throstle or fieldfare’s wing, especially from such feathers as have a
                    yellowish tinge. Its body is of a dusky orange, from the light brown fur of a
                    fox’s breast, with a pale dun hackle for legs.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">orange fly</hi> has four wings made of the blue feather of
                    a mallard-teal. The head is of the dark fur from a hare’s ear; the body
                    gold-coloured mohair mixed with orange-camlet and brown fur, a small blue cock’s
                    hackle for legs. This is said to be an alluring fly to young salmon.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193097381" xml:id="kp-eb0703-7381-0140"/>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">hares ear</hi> îs chiefly used as a drop-fly. The wings
                    'are from the light part of a starling’s wing feather, and the body of dark
                    hare-ear fur. According to Daniel, when the streams are deep, the same body
                    winged with a railwing’s feather and a red hackle is very killing during the
                    summer season.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">yellow dun</hi> is used in the morning and evening during
                    the months of April and May, and again in September. The body, is made of yellow
                    yarn unravelled, or with marten’s fur, and mixed with a little pale ash-coloured
                    fox-cub fur; the wings are formed upright, from the under part of a snipe’s
                    wing, with a pale dun hackle for legs.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">hawthorn fly</hi> is in use from the middle of April to the
                    end of May, from ten o’clock till three. It has transparent wings, which may be
                    imitated with the palest feather of a snipe or mallard’s wing; horn shavings, or
                    the membranous substance found in the core of an apple, serve the same purpose;
                    the body is of black ostrich harl, with a black hackle for legs.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">summer dun</hi> has a thicker form than most of the dun
                    flies, and is dressed upon a short-shanked hook. Mole-fur ribbed with
                    ash-coloured silk is employed for the body; the wings are from the wood-pigeon,
                    with an ash-coloured hackle for legs.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">black-hackle fly</hi> is an approved lure during warm
                    weather, early in a summer morning. The body is formed of a thin-dressed ostrich
                    harl, cut close; the wings, four in number, are from the pale feather of the
                    starling’s wing.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">red spinner</hi> is used as a dropper. The wings are formed
                    of the grayish feather of a drake, tinged with reddish yellow; the body a red
                    hackle, with a twist of gold. This fly is eagerly taken by chub in the evenings
                    of July.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">little yellow May</hi> or <hi rend="italic">willow fly</hi>
                    resembles the green drake, on a small scale. The body is formed of yellow fur
                    from the marten’s neck, or of yellow worsted unravelled, and mixed with a very
                    small portion of hare-ear fur; the wings are of mallard’s feather dyed yellow.
                    This fly appears early in May, and may be used till the appearance of the green
                    drake, of which it is the usual precursor.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">brown dun</hi> is made of otter’s fur mixed with
                    lemon-coloured mohair; the wings are from the fieldfare, with a ginger hackle
                    for legs. This is an excellent fly towards the approach of twilight.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">green drake</hi> or <hi rend="italic">May fly</hi> appears
                    about the second or third week of May, and continues about a month. The body is
                    made of hog’s down, or light bear’s hair, intermixed with yellow mohair; or of
                    barbers’ yellow silk only, warped with pale flos silk, and a small strip of
                    peacock’s harl for the head: a bittern’s hackle is the best imitation of the
                    legs and dark stripes of the body; with the long hairs of the sable or polecat
                    for the tail. The rayed feathers of a wild mallard, dyed of a greenish yellow,
                    suffice for wings.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">blue blow</hi> is a very small fly used during the summer
                    months, and for the first fortnight in August. It is made of a lapwing’s top, or
                    any dark blue fur, dressed on a very small hook. The wings are of thistle-down
                    or bluish-white hackle.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">black midge</hi> is also a small species, the body of which
                    is dressed with brownish-black silk, and a blue cock’s hackle. It is taken
                    freely after a shower in the summer evenings.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">gray drake</hi> follows the green of the same name,
                    although they sometimes occur together. It is an excellent afternoon fly for
                    large trouts. The body is formed of a dirty-white ostrich harl, dressed with
                    flesh-coloured silk, and ribbed with a dark-grizzled cock’s hackle; the head is
                    made of peacock’s harl, like that of the green drake; the wings from a mottled
                    mallard feather, or that' of a mallard-teal, and the tail of sable or polecat’s
                    hair.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">cinnamon fly</hi> has four wings, large in proportion to
                    the body. They are made from the pale reddish-brown feathers of a hen, dressed
                    full; the body of dark brown fur, with a ginger hackle for legs. This fly,
                    according t <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> Mr Bainbridge, is excellent for the
                    Welsh rivers during the months of August and September.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sandfly</hi> forms an excellent lure, and may be very
                    generally used from April to September. The wings are formed from the
                    sandy-coloured feathers of the landrail’s wing, with a ginger hackle for legs;
                    and the bright sandy-coloured fur from the neck of a hare, mixed with a little
                    orange mohair for the body. If dressed as a hackle, the feathers from under the
                    thrush’s wing resemble the natural hue of the wings of the insect.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">great black ant</hi> makes its appearance in sultry
                    weather, from the middle of June to the latter end of August. The wings are made
                    of the pale-blue feathers from beneath a snipe’s wing, or from a tomtit’s tail.
                    The body is of black ostrich harl, made thick towards the tail and beneath the
                    but of the wings; the legs of a reddish-brown hackle.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">great red ant</hi> is nearly contemporaneous with the
                    preceding, which it resembles in size and form. The wings are made of a light
                    starling’s feathers; the body of gold-coloured mohair, or copper-coloured
                    peacock’s harl, with a ginger hackle for legs.</p>
                <p>Among the preceding flies will be found some which will assuredly suit for any
                    river, or for any period of the fishing season. The angler who places implicit
                    confidence in the generally received opinion, that in every stream, and at each
                    season, there is one particular fly in much more special request than any other,
                    will do well to prepare for an unknown river, by making ready a couple of lines,
                    each with three flies all of different kinds. For example, a March brown at the
                    end of the line, a dun hackle, with a lighter or darker body to suit the weather
                    or complexion of the stream, for the first dropper, and a red hackle with
                    peacock body for the second dropper; or, 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> a sand fly
                    at the end, with a grouse hackle or wren’s tail, with orange body, for the first
                    dropper; and a pale yellow or cream-coloured hackle over a bluish body, or one
                    of the ant flies, as the second dropper. These are promising flies for most
                    seasons of the year, though, like the others, they require to be changed
                    according to the circumstances of time and place, or the varying caprices of the
                    finny tribes.</p>
                <p>As night fishing is a favourite amusement with many anglers, we shall describe a
                    few of the flies in most repute for the practice of nocturnal sport.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">white moth,</hi> with wings made from the feathers of a
                    white owl, the body of white ostrich harl, with a white cock’s hackle over
                    it.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">brown moth</hi> is winged from the feathers of a brown owl,
                    or the back feathers of a brown hen; the body is of dark bear’s hair, covered
                    with a brown cock’s hackle.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">mealy cream</hi> is made from the tawny feathers of a white
                    owļ for the wings, with some soft fur of the same colour, and a pale yellow
                    hackle for the body.</p>
                <p>The following selection has been recommended by an experienced angler, in
                    relation to the alleged succession of flies during several of the principal
                    months of the fishing season. Is/, For March, a dun fly, made of dun wool, and
                    the feathers of a partridge wing; or the body made of black wool, and the

                    June, a greenish fly, the body made of black wool, with a yellow list on either
                    side, the wings taken off the wing of a buzzard, bound with black broken hemp: 5
                    <hi rend="italic">th,</hi> The moorish fly, the body made of dusky wool, and the

                    drake: 7 <hi rend="italic">th,</hi> For July, the wasp fly, the body made of
                    black wool, cast about with yellow silk, and the wings of drakes’ feathers: 8
                    <hi rend="italic">th,</hi> The steel fly, approved in the middle of July; the
                    body made with greenish wool, cast about with the feathers of a peacock’s tail,
                    and the wings made of those of a buzzard: 9 <hi rend="italic">th,</hi> For
                    August, the drake fly, the body made with black wool cast about with black silk,
                    the wings of the mail of a black drake, with a black head.</p>
                <p>When rivers are very low and clear, from a long continuance of summer drought, it
                    has been recommended to use a pair of wings made from the feather of a landrail,
                    or the mottled feather of a teal, with a well-cleaned gentle fixed upon the
                    hook. During a similar condition of the water, even when no wind is stirring,
                    and the sun shining in its greatest lustre, trouts may be taken with a small <hi
                    rend="italic">wrens tail, grouse, smoky dun,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">black
                    hackles,</hi> the angler fishing straight down the water, by the sides of
                    streams and banks, and keeping well out of sight, with as long a line as can be
                    neatly managed, and the foot-lengths very fine. At these times the fish may be
                    often seen with their dorsal fins above water, and with skilful management may
                    be made to snap at the above-named flies, When one is hooked, the rest dart off;
                    but if the angler keeps concealed, they will return again in a very short time;
                    and thus several fish may be taken even in summer from the clearest pools.
                    Another plan has also been recommended as likely to prove successful when the
                    weather is bright and the water low: Take a line of about a yard in length, and
                    fix it to a short, stiff rod, and having baited the hook with a natural fly,
                    such as the stonefly, or the gray or green drake (Ephemerae), drop it between
                    bushes over steep hollow banks, or under the projecting roots of trees.</p>
                <p>In fishing a river with which the angler has no previous acquaintance, the most
                    approved practice is to try the eddies which are frequent at the corners of
                    streams, and where the circular movement of the current throws out a frequent
                    sustenance for the finny race. There the larger trout often lie; and it must
                    consist with the experience of every angler, that an excellent capture is
                    sometimes made repeatedly from some small spot behind or beside a particular
                    stone, where from day to day one well-sized fish seems to succeed another in the
                    favourite feeding ground. In this knowledge of peculiar localities consists the
                    chief advantage of a previous acquaintance with the water. The smaller fish are
                    found in most abundance in the widely spread and shallow streams, as well as in
                    the extended parts of pools of no great depth. As a general rule, the angler may
                    be advised to fish with the wind on his back and the sun in front, which not
                    only gives him a greater command of his line, but prevents himself or his shadow
                    from being so distinctly perceived. A strict adherence, however, to this plan is
                    by no means advisable, as the angler’s position in relation to sun and wind must
                    frequently vary with the natural course of the river, the obstruction of
                    overhanging wood, and the greater or less command of pool and stream presented
                    by the varying form of the adjoining shore.</p>
                <p>As <hi rend="italic">bait-fishing</hi> for trout, though regularly followed by
                    some is less generally admired and practised than the more elegant use of the
                    artificial fly, fewer words will suffice. When the streams are swollen and
                    discoloured, fine' trout may be taken with a running line without float, and so
                    leaded that it shall touch the ground without resisting the force of the stream.
                    The lead should be fixed about eight or ten inches above the hook; and the best
                    baits are well-scoured earthworms. The dew, the garden, and the lob worms are
                    one and the same in species, although they vary considerably in form, size, and
                    colour, according to age, and season, and the nature of the soils. The lobworm,
                    according to Daniel, is of two sorts, the old, <hi rend="italic">knotted,</hi>
                    the young, without knots, which some for distinction call <hi rend="italic"
                    >maiden lobs,</hi> and others <hi rend="italic">red</hi> worms. The latter kind,
                    with a red head, a streak down the back, and a broad tail, are the most
                    esteemed. By some they are called squirreltails. These and other worms, it need
                    scarcely be observed, are easily obtained in fields and gardens, especially
                    where there has been any recent mixture of vegetable or animal remains. They may
                    be preserved for a considerable period, and even improved in their texture and
                    condition, by being kept in damp moss, changed from time to time, and
                    occasionally wetted with a little new milk. In dry weather, when worms are
                    difficult to be obtained, they may be procured by emptying a few buckets of
                    water in situations where they were known to occur during a moister season. The
                    brandling worm is streaked from head to tail in alternate circles of a red and
                    yellow hue, and is darker at its anterior than posterior portion. They occur in
                    old dunghills, in heaps of rich vegetable mould, and among rotten tan bark. They
                    have this advantage over the others, that they may be used without preparation
                    or scouring. Though the choice of worms does not seem a very suitable subject
                    for poetry, it has been thus versified by Mr Gay in the <hi rend="italic">Rural

                <p>The preceding rhymes apply chiefly to the kind called gilt-tails. <hi
                    rend="italic">Gentles</hi> are the larvae of different kinds of carnivorous
                    winged flies. They may be kept in a mixture of oatmeal and bran, and are readily
                    produced in a piece of liver, or any other flesh or fish, exposed in an earthen
                    vessel to prevent their escape when grown to a proper size. All kinds of
                    maggots, as well as those called gentles, serve admirably for the more delicate
                    kinds of bait-fishing. The caddis worms, before alluded to as the larvae of the
                    Phryganea or stonefly, when taken out of their cases, are a favourite bait for
                    trout; and different kinds of grasshoppers are likewise used with great success.
                    The creeper or water cricket, an aquatic ∙ larva, found under stones within the
                    water-mark, ought also to be attended to by the natural bait-fisher.</p>
                <p>The palmer worms or wool beds are the hairy caterpillars of certain nocturnal
                    moths. Though refused by almost all birds except the cuckoo, they are swallowed
                    by trouts, and may be preserved alive for many weeks in a box with damp earth,
                    strewed over with the leaves of the tree or bush on which the species was
                    observed naturally to feed.</p>
                <p>The young brood of wasps and bees are useful to the angler; and for eight or ten
                    days after their first appearance in summer there is no better or more killing

                    Salmon roe is greatly lauded by Barker, who appears to have been the first to
                    discover its merits. “I have found an experience of late which you may angle
                    with, and take great store of this kind of fish. First, it is the best bait for
                    trout that I have seen in all my time, and will take great store, and not fail
                    if they be there. Secondly, it is a special bait for dace or dare, good for
                    chub, or bottlin, or grayling. The bait is a roe of a salmon or trout. If it be
                    a large trout, that the spawns be any thing great, you must angle for the trout
                    with this bait as you angle with the brandling, taking a pair of scissors and
                    cut so much as a large hazel-nut, and bait your hook; so fall to your
                    sport,—there is no doubt of pleasure. If I had known it but twenty years ago, I
                    would have gained a hundred pounds only with that bait: I am bound in duty to
                    divulge it to your honour, and not to carry it to my grave with me. I do desire
                    that men of quality should have it, that delight in that pleasure. The greedy
                    angler will murmur at me, but for that I care not.”</p>
                <p>Many kinds of pastes are prized by the bait-fisher. They may be used for chub,
                    carp, and bream in September and during all the winter months, and may be made
                    up about the size of a hazel-nut; if fqŗ roach and dace, the bigness of a pea
                    will suffice. All pastes are improved by being mixed up in the making with a
                    little cotton wool, which makes them firmer and more tenacious, and hang better
                    on the hook. They suit well for fishing in quiet places, with a small hook and
                    quill float. We shall here subjoin a few recipes for the making of fishing
                    pastes, which, although we introduce them under the head of the river-trout, may
                    be regarded as equally efficacious in the capture of other kinds of fish.<note

                    among anglers for rubbing over their baits, but as we believe their beneficial
                    effects were entirely imaginary, we shall not occupy our pages by their
                    repetition. A single extract from Izaak Walton will suffice. “And now I shall
                    tell you that which may be called a secret: I have been a-fishing with old
                    Oliver Henley, now with God, a noted fisher both for trout and salmon, and have
                    observed that he would usually take three or four worms out of his bag, and put
                    them into a little box in his pocket, where he would usually let them continue
                    half an hour or more before he would bait his hook with them. I have asked him
                    his reason, and he has replied, ‘ he did but pick the best out, to be in
                    readiness against he baited his hook the next time.’ But he has been observed,
                    both by others and myself, to catch more fish than I or any other body that has
                    ever gone a-fishing with him could do, and especially salmons; and I have been
                    told lately, by one of his most intimate and secret friends, that the box in
                    which he put those worms was anointed with a drop, or two or three, of the oil
                    of ivy-berries made by expression or infusion; and told that by the worms
                    remaining in that box an hour, or a like time, they had incorporated a kind of
                    smell, that was irresistibly attractive, enough to force any fish within the
                    smell of them to bite.” We need scarcely remind the reader of the “Complete
                    Angler,” that that admirable work is of higher value for the manner in which the
                    subject is discussed, and the beautiful accessories of pure style,, poetical
                    sentiment, and picturesque illustration, than for the amount of direct practical
                    information which it conveys. The simplicity and goodness of Izaak Walton’s
                    nature seem to have induced a greater degree of credulity than was always
                    consistent with an accurate perception of the truth, and hence every chapter
                    abounds with statements which could not pass current in these more critical
                    days. As a useful work in relation to the mere angler, it cannot be said to hold
                    a high rank, although it must ever delight the general reader, and all who
                    desire to refresh themselves by “the pure well of English

                <p>Minnow-fishing for trout is a favourite pastime with many anglers, and the
                    process is one by which very large fish are frequently captured. The tackle used
                    resembles that for salmon, but is lighter and finer, with a single line of gut
                    at the bottom. The hooks vary in size according to the general dimensions of the
                    trout angled for; and the middlesized and whitest minnows are the most esteemed.
                    The following were Walton’s directions for baiting, with a view to this
                    department of the sport. Put your hook in at his mouth and out at his gill; then
                    having drawn your hook two or three inches beyond or through his gill, put it
                    again into his mouth, and the point and beard out at his tail, and then tie the
                    hook and his tail about very neatly with a white thread, which will make it the
                    apter to turn quick in the water: that done, pull back that part of your line
                    which was slack when you did put your hook into the minnow the second time; I
                    say, says Walton, pull th <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> t part of your line back
                    so that it shall fasten the head, so that the body of the minnow shall be almost
                    straight on your hook: this done, try how it will turn by drawing it across the
                    water or against a stream; and if it do not turn nimbly, then turn the tail a
                    little to the right or left hand, and try again, till it turn quick. We may add,
                    that the practice of fishing with the artificial minnow is justly discarded by
                    all judicious anglers. For representations of the minnow tackle, and hooks
                    baited, see Plate XLV,, fig. 12, 13, and 19.</p>

                    account of this interesting fish to a manuscript of Sir William Jardine s, with

                <p>It appears that the gray or great trout of the British fresh-water lakes, though
                    never described or characterized as a distinct species, has at various times
                    excited the attention of ichthyologists. Trout of enormous dimensions are
                    mentioned by Pennant as occurring in the Welsh lakes; and Donovan gives Loch
                    Neagh in Ireland as another locality. Very large trout have been killed in
                    Ulis-water in Cumberland, and still larger in Loch Awe in Argyllshire. The late
                    Mr Morrison of Glasgow claimed the merit of discovering these fish in the
                    last-named locality about 40 years ago; and the largest recorded to have been
                    killed there weighed 25 pounds. Mr Lascelles, a Liverpool gentleman, has also of
                    late years been equally assiduous and successful in their capture; and it
                    appears that any persevering sportsman is almost certain, with the proper
                    tackle, to obtain specimens in Loch Awe, of this great fish, weighing from 10 to
                    20 pounds. The largest we have lately heard of weighed 191 pounds. It is said to
                    be by far the most powerful of our fresh-water fishes, exceeding the salmon in
                    actual strength, though not in activity. The most general size caught by
                    trolling ranges from 3 to 15 pounds: beyond that weight they are of uncommon
                    occurrence. If hooked upon tackle of moderate<pb break="no" facs="nls:193097420"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-7420-0143"/> strength, they afford excellent sport; but the
                    general method of fishing for them is almost as well adapted for catching sharks
                    as trout; the angler being apparently more anxious to have it in his power to
                    state that he had caught a fish of such a size, than to enjoy the pleasure of
                    the sport itself. However, to the credit of both parties, it may be stated, that
                    the very strongest tackle is sometimes snapped in two by its first tremendous
                    springs. The ordinary method of fishing for this king of trouts is with a
                    powerful rod, from a boat rowing at the rate of from three to four miles an
                    hour, the lure a common trout from three to ten inches in length, baited upon
                    six or eight salmon looks, tied back to back upon strong gimp, assisted by two
                    swivels, and the wheel-line strong whip-cord. Yet all this, in the first
                    impetuous efforts of the fish to regain its liberty, is frequently carried away
                    for ever into the crystal depths of Loch Awe!</p>
                <p>When in their highest health and condition, and indeed during the whole of the
                    time in which they are not employed in the operation of spawning, these fish
                    will scarcely ever rise at a fly. At these periods they appear to be almost
                    entirely piscivorous; so, with the exception of night lines, baited also with
                    trout, trolling is the only advisable mode of angling for them. The young,
                    however, rise very freely at ordinary lake-trout flies, and are generally caught
                    in this way from one to one and a half pound weight. They occur abundantly near
                    the outlet of the lake.</p>
                <p>About the middle of August, and during the three following months, the parent
                    fish retire, for the purpose of spawning, to the deep banks of the lake in the
                    neighbourhood of the gorge, and into the gorge of the lake itself, where it
                    empties its immense waters, forming the river Awe. They are said to remain
                    engaged in this operation for two or three months, and at this time their
                    instinctive tendencies are so far changed, that they will rise eagerly at large
                    and gaudily dressed salmon-flies, and may be either angled for from the banks,
                    or trolled with a cross line, where the outlet of the lake is narrow. They do
                    not appear either to ascend the rivers which enter the loch, or to descend the
                    Awe to any extent, though an occasional straggler has been taken some way down
                    the river. Their spawning places are exclusively on the banks, or at the gorge
                    of the loch, and they never attempt to seek the salt-water. When in good season,
                    and in their strongest condition, they appear to roam indiscriminately through
                    every part of the loch, though there are certain spots which may be depended
                    upon than others, and where an experienced angler will have little difficulty in
                    hooking one of these fine fish. To their great strength we may observe that they
                    add unequalled rapacity; and after attaining to the weight of three or four
                    pounds, they appear to feed almost exclusively on smaller fish, and do not spare
                    even their own young. A small trout of this species, not weighing more than l½
                    pound, will often dash at a bait not much inferior to itself in size; and
                    instances are recorded of larger fish following with eager eye, and attempting
                    to seize upon others of their own kind after they had been hooked and were in
                    the act of being landed by the angler. It is probably on account of this strong
                    manifestation of a more than usually predaceous habit, that Sir William Jardine
                    has named the species <hi rend="italic">salmo ferox.</hi></p>
                <p>When in perfect season, and full-grown, it is a very handsome fish, though the
                    head is always too large and long to be in accordance with our ideas of perfect
                    symmetry in a trout. The body is deep and thickly formed, and all the members
                    seem conducive to the exercise of great strength. The colours are deep purplish
                    brown on the upper parts, changing into reddish gray, and thence into fine
                    orange-yellow on the breast and belly. The whole body, when the fish is newly
                    caught, appears as if glazed over with a thin tint of rich lake-colour, which
                    fades away as the fish dies, and so rapidly, that the progressive changes of
                    colour are easily perceived by an attentive eye. The gill-covers are marked with
                    large dark spots; and the whole body is covered with markings of different
                    sizes, and varying in amount in different individuals. In some these markings
                    are few, scattered, and of a large size; in others they are thickly set, and of
                    smaller dimensions. Each spot is surrounded by a paler ring, which sometimes
                    assumes a reddish hue; and the spots become more distant from each other as they
                    descend beneath the lateral line. The lower parts of these fish are spotless.
                    All the fins are broad, muscular, and extremely powerful^- and it is from the
                    number of their bony rays that the specific characters which distinguish this
                    species from the common trout <hi rend="italic">(salmo</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >farid)</hi> are the most easily and accurately evolved. The dorsal fin is of
                    the same colour with the upper part of the fish; it is marked with large dark
                    spots, and contains fifteen rays, which number exceeds by three that which
                    characterizes the common trout. The caudal fin is much larger and more fleshy.
                    The pectoral, ventral, and anal fins, are very muscular on their anterior edges,
                    and of a rich yellowish-green colour, darker towards their extremities. They
                    contain respectively 14, 10, and 12 rays, whereas the numbers in the
                    corresponding fins of the common trout are 13, 9, and 11. The tail is remarkable
                    for its breadth and consequent power. In adults it is perfectly square, or might
                    even be described as slightly rounded at its extremity: in the young it is
                    slightly forked, and appears to fill up gradually as the fish advances in age.
                    In the common trout, on the contrary, the forked shape of the tail is a
                    permanent characteristic.</p>
                <p>The flavour of this great lacustrine species is coarse and indifferent. The
                    colour of the flesh is orange-yellow, not the rich salmon-colour of a fine
                    common trout in good season. The stomach is very capacious, and on dissection
                    (differing singularly in this respect from the salmon) is almost always found
                    gorged with fish.</p>
                <p>We have bestowed a somewhat lengthened notice on the species above described; but
                    we doubt not that the novelty of the subject will not only plead our excuse, but
                    render the information now given highly acceptable both to the sportsman and the
                    naturalist. It is certain that a more attentive examination of the finny tribes
                    which inhabit our lakes and rivers would bring to light several new species, and
                    more clearly illustrate the history of others which are still involved in
                    obscurity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr Lascelles
                    lately killed two trouts in Loch Laggan, which weighed 12 pounds each. These
                    were probably of the same species ιth the great trouts of Loch Awe. In that
                    magnificent chain of English lakes of which Windermere is the chief, and which
                    includes Grassmere and Rydal, we think the species not synonymous with the <hi

                    these beautiful waters, when full-grown, seem to range from three to five
                    pounds, and have in one or two rare instances been ken or the weight of six and
                    even eight pounds. Those of Ullswater, again, which does not belong to what we
                    have denominated the mdermere chain, correspond more nearly in size and other
                    characters with the species found in the lakes of the Scotish Highlands, e would
                    particularly recommend to the attention of sportsmen the great fresh-water river
                    trout, or bull trout as we believe it is metιmes called. This is regarded by
                    some anglers as an aged or overgrown individual of the ordinary kind <hi
                    rend="italic">(salmo fario)</hi>; and by others, especially when found in the
                    autumn, as a lake trout which had left its more usual haunts for the purpose of
                    spawning. The curacy of the latter opinion is, however, interfered with by the
                    occasional occurrence of this variety in such unambiguous situa <pb

                    falls, the waters of which have no communication with any lake. This species
                    sometimes attains th weight of 8, 10, or even 12 pounds; but it differs from the

                    many of the lesser Highland lakes, such as Loch Ard and Loch Chon, ascend the

                    (with the. artificial fly) are rarely caught above the weight of three pounds.
                    We last year (1829 received some very singular trouts from a small loch called"

                    their upper jaws were truncated like that of a bull-dog. They do not occur in

                    weighed 67 pounds, are probably identical with those of Loch Awe, Ullswater,
                    &amp;c. Though equal to salmon, both in size and strength, they differ in their
                    habits from those fish, and do not appear at any time to seek the waters of the
                    ocean. Indeed their existence in the lake of Constance, the available
                    communication of which with the sea is cut off by the falls of Schaffhausen,
                    demonstrates their independence of saline waters. It does not appear, from any
                    information which has reached us on the subject, that these great continental
                    lake-trouts ever rise at the artificial fly.</p>

                    It affords excellent sport to the angler fishing from a boat about 50 yards off
                    the deeper parts of the shores. They rise freely to small salmon or sea-trout

                <p>These fish, which, in a culinary point of view, are deservedly the most highly
                    prized of all the permanently freshwater species, arc scarcely attainable by the
                    angler’s skill. Of late years they have risen more freely than in former times
                    in the meres of the north of England; but the capture of a char by rod and line
                    is still regarded as an uncommon occurrence. They appear to retire during the
                    warmer months to the deepest of the still waters, as the fishermen engaged in
                    throwing their nets for pike, perch, and trout, over the very grounds where,
                    during the colder season of the year, the char abound, never catch any of these
                    fish in summer. Although a good deal has been written upon the subject, it does
                    not appear that the distinctive history of the two species above named has been
                    as yet made out. Both the case char and the red char are found in Windermere;
                    and the principal distinction in their habits and history consists in this, that
                    the former ascends the rivers, where it spawns about Michaelmas; whereas the
                    latter deposits its ova along the shores of the lake, and not till the end of
                    December or the beginning of the year. In angling for char the same flies may be
                    used as those best adapted for the smaller-sized laketrouts; and as the latter
                    occur wherever the former is found, the spojtsman has the better chance of
                    making amends for the probable disappointment which will attend his pursuit of
                    the one, by a more successful capture of the other.</p>

                    mouth than the trout. It rises well to the camlet fly, and to several of the
                    other small-sized trout-flies. We killed it readily in Switzerland with a
                    moorfowl wing and hare-ear body. They may also be taken with the caddis worm and
                    other ground baits. According to the Rev. Mr Low, the grayling is frequent in
                    the streams of the Orkney Islands, though very rare in the rivers of the
                    mainland of Scotland.</p>

                <p>This “fell tyrant of the liquid plain” is not regarded as indigenous to the
                    waters of'Britain, but is said to have been introduced in the time of Henry
                    VIII. That it was well known in England at an earlier period is however evident,
                    both from the book of St Alban’s, printed by Wynken de Worde in 1496, and from
                    the account of the great feast given by George Nevil, archbishop of York, in the
                    year 1466. There is in truth no evidence either of its non-existence in this
                    country at a remote period, or of its importation during comparatively recent
                    times.</p>
                <p>The voracity of this fish is almost unexampled, even in a class remarkable for
                    their omnivorous propensities. Goslings, young ducks, and coots, water-rats,
                    kittens, and the young of its own species, besides every kind of freshwater
                    fish, have been found in the stomach of the pike. It is said to contend with the
                    otter for its prey, and has been known to pull a mule into the water by the
                    nose. This fish is in season from May to February, and is angled for by trolling
                    with a strong-topped rod. The hooks are generally fastened to a bit of brass
                    wire for a few inches from the shaft, to prevent the line from being snapped.
                    Different methods are used in angling for pike. <hi rend="italic">Trolling,</hi>
                    in the more limited sense of the word, signifies catching fish with the gorge
                    hook, which is composed of two, or what is called a double eel-hook; <hi
                    rend="italic">live bait-fishing</hi> is practised with the aid of a floated
                    line; and <hi rend="italic">snap-fishing</hi> consists in the use of large

                    strike the fish the moment he feels it bite, immediately after which he drags it
                    <hi rend="italic">nolens</hi><hi rend="italic">volens</hi> ashore.</p>
                <p>Trolling for pike may be practised during the winter months, when trout fishing
                    has ceased; and the colder season of the year is in fact more convenient for the
                    sport, owing to the decay or diminution of the weeds which usually surround
                    their favourite haunts. With the exception of chub and dace, which bite pretty
                    freely at the bottom all winter, scarcely any other fish can be relied upon for
                    sport during the more inclement portion of the' year. To bait a gorge hook, take
                    a baiting needle, and hook the curved end to the loop of the gimp, to which the
                    hook is tied; secPlate XLV.fig.20; then introduce the point of the needle into a
                    dead bait’s mouth, and bring it out at the mid· die of the fork of the tail, by
                    which means the piece of leal which covers the shank of the hook, and partof the
                    connect ing wire, will lie concealed in the interior of the bait: Ŵ shank will
                    be in the inside of its mouth, and the barbsorthe outside, turning upwards. See
                    Plate LXV. fig. 24. T∣ keep the bait steady on the hook, fasten the tail part
                    just <pb break="no" facs="nls:193097446" xml:id="kp-eb0703-7446-0145"/>above the
                    fork to the gimp, with a silk or cotton thread; or a neater method is, to pass
                    the needle and thread through the side of the bait, about half an inch above the
                    tail, so as to encircle the gimp in the interior. The baits used vary in weight
                    from one to four ounces, and the hooks must be proportioned to the size of the
                    fish with which they are baited. The barbs of the hook ought not to project much
                    beyond the sides of the mouth, because, as the pike generally seizes his prey
                    crosswise, and turns it before it is pouched or swallowed, if he feels the
                    points of the hook he may cast it out entirely.</p>
                <p>In trolling for pike, it is advised to keep as far from the water as possible,
                    and to commence casting close by the near shore, with the wind blowing from
                    behind. When the water is clear and the weather bright, some prefer to fish
                    against the wind. “After trying closely,” says Mr Salter, “make your next throw
                    further in the water, and draw and sink the baited hook, drawing it straight
                    upwards near to the surface of the water, and also to right and left, searching
                    carefully every foot of water; and draw your bait with the stream, because you
                    must know that jack and pike lay in wait for food with their heads and eyes
                    pointing up the stream, to catch what may be coming down; therefore experienced
                    trollers fish a river or stream down, or obliquely across; but the inconsiderate
                    as frequently troll against the stream, which is improper, because they then
                    draw their baited hook behind either jack or pike when they are stationary,
                    instead of bringing it before his eyes and mouth to tempt him. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Note.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Be particularly careful, in drawing up or
                    taking the baited hook out of the water, not to do it too hastily, because you
                    will find by experience that the jack and pike strike or seize your bait more
                    frequently when you are drawing it upwards than when it is sinking. And also
                    further observe, that when drawing your bait upwards, if you occasionally shake
                    the rod, it will cause the bait to spin and twist about, which is very likely to
                    attract either jack or pike.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>These fish are partial to the bends of rivers and the bays of lakes, where the
                    water is shallow, and abounding in weeds, reeds, water lilies, &amp;c. In
                    fishing with the gorge hook, and the angler feels a run, he ought not to strike
                    for several minutes after the fish has become stationary, lest he pull the bait
                    away before it is fairly pouched. If a pike makes a very short run, then remains
                    stationary for about a minute, and again makes one or two short runs, he is
                    probably merely retiring to some quiet haunt before he swallows the bait; but
                    if, after remaining still for three or four minutes, he begins to shake the line
                    and move about, the inference is that he has pouched the bait, and feels some
                    annoyance from the hook within, then such part of the line as has been slackened
                    may be wound up, and the fish struck. It is an unsafe practice to lay down the
                    rod during the interval between a run and the supposed pouching of the bait,
                    because it not unfrequently happens that a heavy fish, when he first feels the
                    hooks in his interior, will make a sudden and most violent rush up the river or
                    along the lake, and the line is either instantly broken, or is carried, together
                    with both the rod and reel, for ever, beyond the angler’s reach. “When the pike
                    cometh,” says Colonel Venables, “you may see the water move, at least you may
                    feel him; then slack your line and give him length enough to run away to his
                    hould, whither he will go directly, and there pouch it, ever beginning (as you
                    may observe) with the head, swallowing that first. Thus let him lye untill you
                    see the line move in the water, and then you may certainly conclude he hath
                    pouched your bait, and rangetb about for more; then with your trowl wind up your
                    line till you think you have it almost streight, then with a smart jerk hook
                    him, and make your pleasure to your content.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>The fresher and cleaner the bait is kept, whether for trolling, live-bait, or
                    snap-fishing, the greater is the chance of success.</p>
                <p>As pike, notwithstanding their usual voracity, are sometimes, as the anglers
                    phrase it, more on the play than the feed, they will occasionally seize the bait
                    across the body, and, instead of swallowing it, blow it from them repeatedly and
                    then take no further notice of it. The skilful and wily angler must instantly
                    convert his gorge into a snap, and strike him in the lips or jaws when he next
                    attempts such dangerous amusement. The dead snap may be made either with two or
                    four hooks. (See Plate XLV. fig. 21.) Take about twelve inches of stout gimp,
                    make a loop at one end, at the other tie a hook (size No. 2), and about an inch
                    farther up the gimp tie another hook of the same dimensions; then pass the loop
                    of the gimp into the gill of a dead bait-fish, and out at its mouth, and draw
                    the gimp till the hook at the bottom comes just behind the back fin of the bait,
                    and the point and barb are made to pierce slightly through its skin, which keeps
                    the whole steady: now pass the ring of a drop-bead lead over the loop of the
                    gimp, fix the lead inside the bait’s mouth, and sew the mouth up. (See Plate
                    XLV. fig. 22.) Thiswill suffice for the snap with a couple of hooks. If the
                    four-hooked snap is desired (and it is very killing), take a piece of stout gimp
                    about four inches long, and making a loop at one end, tie a couple of hooks of
                    the same size, and in the same manner as those before described. After the first
                    two and the lead are in their places, and previous to the sewing up of the
                    mouth, pass the loop of the shorter gimp through the opposite gill, and out at
                    the mouth of the bait; then draw up the hooks till they occupy a position
                    corresponding to those of the other side: next pass the loop of the longer piece
                    of gimp through that of the shorter, and pull all straight: finally, tie the two
                    pieces of gimp together close to the fish’s mouth, and sew the latter up.</p>
                <p>Some anglers prefer fishing for pike with a floated line and a live bait. When a
                    single hook is used for this purpose, it is baited in one or other of the two
                    following ways: Either pass the point and barb of the hook through the lips of
                    the bait, towards the side of the mouth, or through beneath the base of the
                    anterior portion of the dorsal fin. (See Plate XLV. fig. 25.) When a double hook
                    is used take a baiting needle, hook its curved end into the loop of the gimp,
                    and pass its point beneath the skin of the bait from behind the gills upwards in
                    a sloping direction, bringing it out behind the extremity of the dorsal fin;
                    then draw the gimp till the bend of the hooks are brought to the place where the
                    needle entered, and attach the loop to the trolling line. (See Plate XLV. fig.
                    23.) Unless a kind of snap-fishing is intended, the hooks for the above purpose
                    should be of such a size as that neither the points nor the barbs project beyond
                    either the shoulder or the belly of the bait.</p>
                <p>Snap-fishing is certainly a less scientific method of angling for pike than that
                    with the gorge or live bait; for when the hooks are baited the angler casts in
                    search, draws, raises, and sinks his bait, until he feels abite. He then strikes
                    with violence, and drags or throws his victim on shore; for there is little fear
                    of his tackle giving way, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193097459"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-7459-0146"/>as that used in snap-fishing is of the largest and
                    strongest kind. “This hurried and unsportsman-like way of taking fish,” it is
                    observed in the <hi rend="italic">Trailers Guide,</hi> “can only please those
                    who value the game more than the sport afforded by killing a jack or pike with
                    tackle which gives the fish a chance of escaping, and excites the angler’s skill
                    and patience, mixed with a certain pleasing anxiety, and the reward of his
                    hopes. Neither has the snap-fisher so good a chance of success, unless he angles
                    in a pond or piece of water where the jack or pike are very numerous or half
                    starved, and will hazard their lives for almost any thing that comes in their
                    way. But in rivers where they are well fed, worth killing, and rather scarce,
                    the coarse snap-tackle, large hooks, &amp;c. generally alarm them. On the whole,
                    I think it is two to one against the snap in most rivers; and if there are many
                    weeds in the water, the large hooks of the snap, by standing rank, are
                    continually getting foul, damaging the bait, and causing much trouble and loss
                    of time.”</p>
                <p>Pike sometimes rise at an artificial fly, especially in dark, windy days. The fly
                    ought to be dressed upon a double hook, and composed of very gaudy materials.
                    The head is formed of a little fur, some gold twist, and (if the angler’s taste
                    inclines that way, for it is probably a matter of indifference to the fish) two
                    small black or blue beads for eyes. The body is framed rough, full, and round,
                    the wings not parted, but made to stand upright on the back, with some small
                    feathers continued down the back to the end of the tail, so that when finished
                    they may exceed the length of the hook. The whole should be about the bulk of a
                    wren. The largest pike ever killed in Britain was taken with a peacock-feather
                    fly in Loch Ken, near New Galloway. It weighed 72 pounds.<note anchored="true"

                <p>During clear and calm weather in summer and autumn, pike take most freely about
                    three in the afternoon: in winter they may be angled for with equal chances of
                    success during the whole day: early in the morning and late in the evening are
                    the periods best adapted for the spring.</p>

                <p>This fish, like the preceding, is asserted to have been introduced into England
                    by Leonard Mascal, a gentleman of Sussex, early in the 16th century; and in good
                    company, if there is truth in the old distich,</p>

                <p>The carp is, however, mentioned as a <hi rend="italic">dayntous fysshe,</hi>
                    though scarce, by Juliana Barnes, in the year 1496. It attains to a prodigious
                    size in the waters of the south of Europe, and in the Lake of Como is said
                    sometimes to weigh 200 pounds. It breeds more freely in ponds than in rivers,
                    although those of the latter are more esteemed. Angling for carp requires,
                    according to Walton, “a very large measure of patience.” The haunts of this fish
                    in the winter months are the broadest and least disturbed parts of rivers, where
                    the bottom is soft and muddy; but in summer it usually lies in deep holes, near
                    some <hi rend="italic">scour,</hi> under roots of trees, and beneath hollow
                    banks, or in the neighbourhood of beds of aquatic weeds. In ponds they thrive
                    best in a rich marl or clayey soil, where they have the benefit of shade from an
                    overhanging grove of trees.</p>
                <p>Small carp bite eagerly, but the larger and more experienced fish are deceived
                    with difficulty. The rod should be of good length, the line strong, furnished
                    with a quill float, and ending in a few lengths of the best silk-worm gut. The
                    hook is proportioned to the size of the bait, and a single shot is fixed about
                    12 inches above it. “Three rods,” says Daniel, “may be employed; one with the
                    bait at mid-water, another a foot or less from the bottom, and the third to lie
                    upon it when the line and lead are not discovered, as in the two former; the

                    as to soften, but not to break the skin, and throwing some in now and then. When
                    this bait is used (which should be with one on the hook to swim a foot from the
                    ground), in case of a bite, strike immediately; a large carp, upon taking the
                    bait, directly steers for the opposite side of the river or pond.”<note

                    whilst lying among the weeds near the surface, they may be angled for with a
                    fine line, without either sink or float. The hook may be baited with a red worm,
                    a pair of gentles, a caterpillar, or a cad bait, and thrown lightly as in
                    fly-fishing, and then drawn towards the angler. If it can be made to fall first
                    upon the leaf of some water plant, and then dropped upon the surface, the chance
                    of success will be increased. The best months arc May, June, and July, and the
                    most advisable times of the day are from sunrise to eight in the morning, and
                    from sunset during the continuance of twilight, and onwards through the night.
                    It is the opinion of many, though we cannot trace the origin of the idea, no
                    doubt an erroneous one, that the 10th of April is a fatal day for carp.</p>

                    rend="italic">Brama.)</hi></p>
                <p>This fish breeds both in deep, slow-running rivers, and in ponds. It prefers the
                    latter. The most enticing bait is a well-conditioned earthworm, although the
                    angler also uses paste made of bread and honey, wasp grubs, grasshoppers,
                    &amp;c. Boiled wheat serves well for ground-baiting the spot on the preceding
                    nights, and some fasten a number of worms to a piece of turf, and sink it to the
                    bottom. When the ground has been thus prepared, and the tackle put in order, the
                    angler should commence his labours by three or four in the morning. Let him
                    approach the place with caution, so as not to be perceived by the fish, and cast
                    his hook neatly baited with a live and moving worm, in such manner that the lead
                    may lie about the centre of the prepared ground. The bream is a strong fish, and
                    runs smartly when first struck; but after a few turns he falls over on his side,
                    and allows the angler to land him without much trouble. He is by no means so
                    lively as the carp. The best hours for bream are from four till eight in the
                    morning, and from four in the afternoon till eight in the evening. In the river
                    Trent, near Newark, there are two kinds of bream. The common species is that
                    called the carp bream, from its yellow colour; and it sometimes attains the
                    weight of eight pounds. The other species or variety, regarded by Mr Revett
                    Shepherd as a nondescript, never exceeds a pound in weight. It is of a silvery
                    hue, and is known by the name of white bream.<note anchored="true"

                <p>This species is a lover of still waters, and his haunts in rivers are among
                    weeds, or pools well screened by bushes. Tench are found spawning from June till
                    September, and they are in the best condition from the latter month till the end
                    of May. The tackle should be strong, with a swan or goose-quill float for ponds,
                    and a piece of cork for rivers. The hook (in size from No. 4 to 6) should <pb

                    silk-worm gut, with two or three shot Aexed to it at the distance of a foot. The
                    bait should float about a couple of feet from the surface, and should be drawn
                    occasionally gently upwards, and allowed slowly to sink again. Small marsh
                    worms, middle-sized lobs, or the red species found in rotten tan, are to be
                    recommended. « He will bite,” says Walton, “at a paste made of brown bread and
                    honey, or at a marsh-worm, or a lob-worm: he inclines very much to any paste
                    with which tan is mixed, and he will bite also at a smaller worm with his head
                    nipped off, and a sod-worm put on the hook before that worm; and I doubt not but
                    that he will also in the three hot months, for in the nine colder he stirs not
                    much, bite at a flag-worm, or at a green gentle: but can positively say no more
                    of the tench, he being a fish that I have not often angled for; but I wish my
                    honest scholar may, and be ever fortunate when he fishes.”</p>

                    rend="italic">Barbus.)</hi></p>
                <p>In a c <hi rend="underline">ulina</hi> ry point of view this is one of the worst
                    of the fresh-water fishes. It is gregarious, and roots among the soft banks with
                    its nose, like a sow. The angling <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> season commences
                    in May, and continues till September. The most approved hours are from daylight
                    till ten in the 'morning, and from four in the afternoon till about sunset. The
                    line should be strong and rather heavily leaded, so that the bait may float
                    about half an inch from the ground. Considerable caution is required in playing
                    this fish, as he is apt to run off when struck, with great violence, towards
                    some stronghold, and in so doing sometimes breaks both rod and line. He is
                    rather nice in his baits, which must be kept clean and sweet, and untainted by
                    musty moss. “One caution,” says Mr Daniel, “in angling for barbel, will bear
                    repetition: never throw in the bait farther than enabled by a gentle cast of the
                    rod, letting the plumb fall into the water with the least possible noise. It is
                    an error to think that large fish are in the middle of the river: experience
                    teaches the fallacy of this opinion: they naturally seek their food near the
                    banks, and agitating the waters by an injudicious management of the plumb will
                    certainly drive them away. It is incredible the quantities of barbel sometimes
                    caught by this method. Persons of great veracity have asserted that upwards of
                    one hundredweight have been taken in one morning.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Chub.</hi><hi rend="italic">(Cyprinus Cephalus.)</hi></p>
                <p>The rivers of England are stored with a much finer variety of fresh-water fish
                    than those of Scotland. The chub occurs in the Annan. It is however a fish but
                    lightly esteemed, either for sport or the table. He is a dull fish on the hook,
                    bites eagerly, and is soon tired. Caution is requisite on the part of the
                    angler, as the chub is naturally fearful, and sinks towards the bottom of the
                    stream on the slightest alarm. The baits used are maggots, beetles,
                    grasshoppers, salmon-roe, &amp;c. Black and dun flies gaudily dressed, and
                    ribbed with gold or silver twist, are well adapted to take them in streams. They
                    likewise rise at the red-spinner. But perhaps the best way to secure this fish
                    is by <hi rend="italic">dibbing</hi> with a grasshopper. As chub are often seen
                    in some favourite haunt lying near the surface of the pool, the angler,
                    concealing himself as much as possible, ought to move his rod cautiously over
                    the spot, and drop his bait gently upon the water, a few inches in advance of
                    the fish’s head. The landing net is particularly necessary in angling for chub,
                    as the best spots are generally encumbered by trees or bushes, which prevent the
                    fish from being drawn to hand, or pulled ashore.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Bace. (</hi><hi rend="italic">Cyprinus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Leuciscus.)</hi></p>
                <p>This fish is of gregarious habits, and haunts the deeper waters near the piles of
                    bridges, shady pools, and beneath the masses of collected foam caused by eddies.
                    In the warmer months of the year they also congregate in the shallows. They rise
                    at a variety of flies, and are likewise angled for with red worms, brandlings,
                    &amp;c. Above Richmond, as soon as the weeds begin to rot, a grasshopper used as
                    an artificial fly is found very successful in hot weather among the shallows.
                    This mode can only be practised in a boat, with a heavy stone to serve as an
                    anchor, fastened to a few yards of rope. The boat drifts gently down the stream,
                    and the stone is dropped whenever the angler considers himself in the
                    neighbourhood of a likely place. Standing in the stern, he first throws directly
                    down the stream, and then to the right and left; and after trying for about a
                    quarter of an hour in one spot, he again weighs anchor, and proceeds to another
                    station.</p>

                <p>The carp has been named the “water-fox” on account of his subtlety, and the roach
                    the “water-sheep,” by reason of his silliness. This fish makes good soup, though
                    very bony, and otherwise not much esteemed. The season for roach fishing in the
                    Thames, where it attains to a larger size than elsewhere, commences about the
                    end of August. “Next let me tell you,” says Walton, “you shall fish for this
                    roach in winter with paste or gentles, in April with worms or caddis, in the
                    very hot months with little white snails, or with flies under water; for he
                    seldom takes them at the top, though the dace will. In many of the hot months
                    roaches may be also caught thus :—Take a May-fly or ant-fly; sink him with a
                    little lead to the bottom, near the piles or posts of a bridge, or near to any
                    posts of a wear—I mean any deep place where roaches lie quietly—and then pull
                    your fly up very leisurely, and usually a roach will follow your bait to the
                    very top of the water, and gaze on it there, and run at it, and take it, lest
                    the fly should fly away from him.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    When a shoal is met with, great sport is frequently obtained. A small cork float
                    is used, and the bait is hung at various depths, according to circumstances, a

                    the bait should be frequently raised nearly to the surface, and then allowed
                    gently to sink again. When the weather is cool and cloudy, with a ruffling
                    breeze from the south, perch will bite during the whole day. The best hours
