                <p><label type="entry">APOLLONIUS</label> of Perga, in Pamphylia, is one of the most
                    illustrious of the ancient Greek geometricians. The date of his birth has not
                    been precisely ascertained; but as he flourished under Ptolemy Philopater, who
                    died in the year 205 <hi rend="smallcaps">b c.,</hi> after a reign of 16 years,
                    it is conjectured that he was born about the middle of the third century before
                    our era, and that he was about 40 years posterior to Archimedes. He studied at
                    Alexandria under the successors of Euclid, and is pre-eminently distinguished
                    among the disciples of that illustrious school, in which the mathematical
                    sciences were at all times held in the highest estimation.</p>
                <p>Few of the numerous compositions of Apollonius have escaped the ravages of time;
                    but the description which has been given of them by Pappus, in the preface to
                    the seventh book of the <hi rend="italic">Mathematical Collections,</hi>
                    explains their nature and value, and gives the admirers of the ancient analysis
                    great reason to regret the loss of those which have perished. The most
                    celebrated of his productions was the treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Conic
                    Sections</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a work∙which, according to the testimony
                    of Geminius Rhodius, was regarded with so much admiration by the contemporaries
                    of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193099305" xml:id="kp-eb0703-9305-0288"/>.its
                    author, that they bestowed on him the title of the <hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> z</hi><hi rend="italic">Great Geometrician.</hi> This title is
                    justified by the excellence of the work, which is unquestionably far superior to
                    any treatise on the subject which we know to have existed among the ancients,
                    and which has not indeed, in some respects, been surpassed in modern times. But
                    while we bestow this praise on the treatise of Apollonius, we are not to suppose
                    that he was the inventor of all, or even the greater part, of the properties
                    which are demonstrated in it. Several treatises on the conic sections are known
                    to have existed previously, in which the theory or these curves seems to have
                    been prosecuted to a very considerable length. Pappus mentions, in particular,
                    in terms of the highest eulogy, the five books on Solid Loci, or the conic
                    sections, which were composed by Aristaeus <hi rend="italic">the ancient,</hi>
                    who lived about 350 years <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c.; and the construction
                    given by Menechmus, of the problem to find two mean proportionals between two
                    given straight lines, which leads to the duplication of the cube, shows that the
                    disciples of Plato had advanced far in the same department of geometry. In fact,
                    as it was the object of Apollonius to give a complete treatise of the conic
                    sections, he did not scruple to avail himself of the discoveries of his
                    predecessors, and, accordingly, embodied in his own work what had previously
                    been done by Aristaeus, Kudoxus of Cnidus, Mcnechmus, Euclid, Conon,
                    Thrasidaeus, Nicoeles, and others. It is now impossible to distinguish the
                    propositions which were borrowed from his predecessors from those which were
                    invented by himself; but it is certain that he both made great additions to the
                    theory of the conic sections, and improvements in the manner of treating it.
                    Eutocius informs us that Apollonius was the first who showed that all the three
                    sections may be cut from the same cone, by varying the position of the
                    intersecting plane; for previous authors had always supposed the plane of the
                    section perpendicular to the side of the cone,—an hypothesis which requires that
                    the three sections be cut from three cones of different species, namely, the
                    parabola from a right-angled cone, the ellipse from an obtuse, and the hyperbola
                    from an acute. It has, however, been established by Guido Ubaldus, in his
                    commentary on the second book of the <hi rend="italic">Aequiponderantes</hi> of
                    Archimedes, that the Syracusan geometer was acquainted with the fact, that the
                    three sections may be derived from the same cone. The generalization is indeed
                    so very obvious, that we can scarcely persuade ourselves that it was not
                    previously made by the more ancient writers; and it is probable, that if they
                    usually assumed the cutting plane to have a particular position with reference
                    to the cone, it was only on account of some facilities which that hypothesis
                    afforded them in establishing the fundamental properties of the sections. Pappus
                    ascribes to Apollonius the names by which the three sections are now
                    distinguished and characterized: the term <hi rend="italic">Parabola,</hi>
                    however, occurs in the writings of Archimedes.</p>
                <p>Of the eight books which Apollonius composed on the conic sections, the first
                    four only have reached us in the original Greek. Three more have been preserved
                    through the medium of an Arabic version; the last is unfortunately lost. A Latin
                    translation of the first four was published by Memmius, at Venice, in 1537; and
                    another, much more accurate, by Commandine, in 1568, with the addition of the
                    commentary of Eutocius, and the lemmas of Pappus to all the eight books.
                    Hitherto the last four books had not been discovered; but as the nature of their
                    contents was sufficiently known from the indications of Pappus, several attempts
                    were made to supply their loss by a restoration. Maurolycus, a Sicilian geometer
                    of the 16th century, successfully commenced the theory of the fifth and sixth
                    books; and Vivianĩ, the last and favourite disciple of the illustrious Galileo,
                    was employed on the, same subject, when two different manuscript versions' of
                    the work of Apollonius were accidentally brought to light. Among a number of
                    Arabic manuscripts brought from the East by Golius, one was found which
                    contained seven books of the conics. Golius was sufficiently i∏. structed in
                    geometry to be aware of the value of his discovery; he hastened to communicate
                    it to the mathematicians of that time, and proposed to publish a translation of
                    the work. This project, however, failed from some cause which has not been
                    explained; and, notwithstanding the intimation which had been given, the last
                    four books still continued to be regarded as lost, till the year 1658, when
                    Alphonso Borelli, the celebrated author of the treatise <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Motu Animalium,</hi> happened to discover, in the
                    library of the Medici at Florence, an Arabic manuscript with the following
                    inscription: <hi rend="italic">Apollonii</hi><hi rend="italic">Pergoei</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Conicoum Libri</hi><hi rend="italic">Octo.</hi> Borelli obtained
                    permission to carry this manuscript to Rome, where, with the assistance of
                    Abraham Ecchellensis, he translated the fifth, sixth, and seventh books.
                    Notwithstanding the inscription, the eighth book was wanting; and as this was
                    also the case with regard to the manuscript of Golius, it seems probable that it
                    had not been translated into Arabic.</p>
                <p>The last four books of the conics of Apollonius formed a considerable part of
                    what may be termed the transcendental geometry of the ancients; and they exhibit
                    some of the most elegant and successful applications of the geometrical
                    analysis. The fifth book, for example, which treats of the greatest and least
                    lines that can be drawn from given points to the peripheries of the curves,
                    contains nearly all the properties of normals and radii of curvature which are
                    now generally investigated by the aid of the differential calculus, and almost
                    anticipates the admirable theory of involutes and evolutes which confers so
                    brilliant a lustre on the name of Huygens. The seventh book also contains some
                    theorems which, although they have now passed into the elements, are
                    sufficiently difficult and remote to afford scope for the exercise of address
                    and ingenuity, even when their investigation is attempted by the modern
                    analysis. Dr Halley, guided by the description of Pappus, divined the contents
                    of the eighth book, and published a magnificent edition of the whole at Oxford
                    in 1710.</p>
                <p>The other treatises of Apollonius which are mentioned by Pappus are the following
                    :—Is/, The Section of Ratio, or Proportional Sections; 2<hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi>, the Section of Space; 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, the Determinate
                    Sections; <hi rend="italic">⅛th,</hi> the Tangencies; 5⅛ the Inclinations; <hi
                    rend="italic">6th,</hi> the Plane Loci. Each of these was divided into two
                    books, and, with the <hi rend="italic">data</hi> of Euclid and the <hi
                    rend="italic">porisms,</hi> they formed the eight treatises which, according tø
                    Pappus, constituted the body of the ancient analysis. Of the above treatises of
                    Apollonius, the first only has reached us through an Arabic translation. It was
                    discovered in Arabic among the Selden manuscripts in the Bodleian Library at
                    Oxford, by Dr Edward Bernard, who commenced a translation of it, from which,
                    however, he was deterred by the difficulties occasioned by the extreme
                    inaccuracy of the manuscript before he had finished a tenth part. This small
                    portion of the translation was revised by Dr David Gregory; the rest was
                    translated, or more properly speaking, divined, by Dr Halley, who published it
                    in 1706, together with the analogous treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Section
                    of Space,</hi> which he had restored after the indication of its contents given
                    by Pappus. The general problem resolved in the first treatise, although it is
                    branched out into a great variety of cases, may be comprehended in the following
                    enunciation: “Two straight lines being given by position, together with a point
                    in each, it is required to draw through a third given point a straight <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193099318" xml:id="kp-eb0703-9318-0289"/> line intersecting
                    the two former straight lines, so that the 'segments intercepted between the
                    given points and the points of intersection with the third line may be to each
                    other in a given ratio.” The problem which forms the subject of the second
                    treatise differs from the above only in requiring that the intercepted segments
                    on the two straight lines given by position shall contain a given rectangle.</p>
                <p>The object of the treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Determinate Sections</hi>.was
                    “to find a point in a straight line given by position, the rectangles or squares
                    of whose distances from given points in the given straight line shall have a
                    given ratio.” A restoration of this and the two preceding treatises was
                    attempted by Snellius; but although he certainly resolved the problems which had
                    been proposed by Apollonius, his solutions were far inferior in point of
                    elegance to those of the Greek geometer. The discovery of the treatise on the
                    Section of Ratio enabled a comparison to be made of the restored with the
                    original work. Some cases of the <hi rend="italic">Determinate Section</hi> were
                    also resolved by Alexander Anderson of Aberdeen, in his supplement to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Apollonius</hi><hi rend="italic">Redivivus,</hi> published at
                    Paris in 1612. But by far the most complete and <hi rend="superscript">;</hi>
                    elegant restoration of the problem was given by Dr Simson of Glasgow, with two
                    additional books on the same subject. It has been published among his posthumous
                    works.</p>
                <p>. The treatise on <hi rend="italic">Inclinations,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    the object of which was to insert a straight line of a given length, and tending
                    to a given point, between two lines (straight lines or circles) given by
                    position,—was first investigated by Marinus Ghetaldus, a patrician of Ragusa,
                    afterwards by Hugo de Omerique in his ingenious treatise on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Geometrical Analysis,</hi> published at Cadiz in 1698. The
                    different cases ,of the problem have been resolved in a very elegant manner by
                    Dr Horsley, who published his restoration in</p>
                <p>• 1770.</p>
                <p>The treatise <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Tactionibus,</hi> which
                    relates to the contact of circles and straight lines, has afforded exercise for
                    the ingenuity of many modern mathematicians. The general problem which it
                    embraces may be enunciated as follows: Three things (points, straight lines, or
                    circles) being given by position, it is required to describe a circle which may
                    pass through the given points and touch the given straight lines and circles.
                    The most difficult case of the problem is that in which the three things given
                    are circles; the question' being then to determine the centre and radius of a
                    circle, which shall touch these circles given in magnitude and position. This
                    problem, which is now considered as quite elementary, possesses an historical
                    interest on account of the great names connected with its solution. It was
                    proposed by Vieta, the most skilful geometrician of the 16th century, to
                    Adrianus Romanus, who, in constructing it, employed the very obvious
                    consideration of the intersection of two hyperbolas. Such a • solution of a
                    plane problem,.which ought to be constructed by means of straight lines and
                    circles only, was very far from being satisfactory to Vieta: he therefore
                    himself proposed a more geometrical construction, and restored the whole
                    treatise of Apollonius, in a small work which he published at Paris in 1660
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Apollonius Gallus.</hi> The∙treatise of
                    Vieta is entitled to the praise of great ingenuity, but it falls far short of
                    the geometrical elegance of the known productions of Apollonius; and simpler
                    solutions have since been found of the more dif- ∙∙ficult cases of the general
                    problem. An algebraic solution of the same question was attempted by Descartes;
                    -but the equations at which he arrived were so exceedingly complicated, that he
                    himself ingenuously confessed that he should not be able to construct one of
                    them in a shorter time than three months. The Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia, who
                    carried on an epistolary correspondence with Descartes, gave a solution of the
                    same kind. Newton himself, in his <hi rend="italic">Universal Arithmetic,</hi>
                    condescended to consider this problem; but he succeeded little better than
                    Vieta, whose method he followed. In the 16th lemma of the first book of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Principia,</hi> he has, however, given a different and simpler
                    investigation, and reduced with great skill the two hyperbolic loci of Adrianus
                    Romanus to the intersection of two straight lines. Simple geometrical solutions,
                    since that of Dr Simson was published, are to be found in every elementary work.
                    In speaking of this problem, Montucla observes, that it is one of those to which
                    the algebraic analysis applies with difficulty. His opinion, however, would have
                    been different had he lived to see the extremely simple and elegant algebraic
                    investigation given by Gergonne in the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Mathématiques,</hi> not only of this, but of the analogous
                    problem in space which was proposed by Descartes to Fermat, viz. to describe a
                    sphere touching four spheres given by position. In fact, it would be difficult
                    to select a problem in elementary geometry better calculated to display the
                    resources and pliability of the algebraic calculus, than this very one which had
                    been considered as belonging so exclusively to the analysis of the ancients. A
                    very full and interesting historical account of this problem is given in the

                <p>The last of the treatises mentioned by Pappus,— <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Locis Planis,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> is only a collection of
                    properties of the straight line and circle, and corresponds to the construction
                    of equations of the first and second degree. It has been restored in the true
                    spirit of the ancient geometry by Dr Simson, whose treatise well deserves the
                    attention of the student.</p>
                <p>Besides the works which we have now enumerated, we are informed, by the fragment
                    of the second book of Pappus, published among the works of Dr Wallis, that
                    Apollonius occupied himself with arithmetical researches, and composed a
                    treatise on the multiplication of large numbers. Astronomy is also indebted to
                    him for the discovery, or at least for the demonstration, of the method of
                    representing, by means of epicycles and deferents, the phenomena of the stations
                    and retrogradations of the planets. He appears also to have been the inventor of
                    the method of projections, and has the distinguished meritof having been the
                    first who attempted to found astronomy on the principles of geometry, and
                    establish an alliance between these two sciences which has been productive of
                    the greatest benefit to both.</p>
                <p>Of the personal character of this most assiduous and inventive geometrician,
                    nothing is known excepting what may be gathered from a few unfavourable hints
                    thrown out by Pappus. Pappus describes him as vain, arrogant, envious of the
                    reputation of others,, and inclined to depreciate their merit; and contrasts him
                    with the amiable and disinterested Euclid, who was always ready to allow to
                    every one his just share of praise, and who manifested on every occasion the
                    most benevolent feelings towards all men, especially towards those who laboured
                    to improve or extend the science of geometry. The charge of (appropriating to
                    himself the discoveries of Archimedes, which was brought against-Apollonius by
                    Heraclius, had probably no other foundation than the boastful manner in which he
                    spoke of his own discoveries, and affected to despise those of other
                    mathematicians; for, as has been well remarked, pretensions pushed too far
                    excite in the rest of mankind a sort of re-action of self-love, which leads them
                    to contest the most legitimate titles. But whatever may have been the case with
                    regard to the per <pb break="no" facs="nls:193099331"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-9331-0290"/>sonal qualities of Apollonius, the powers of his
                    mind and his unwearied industry command universal admiration. The great value
                    attached to his productions by the ancients is manifest from the number and
                    celebrity of the commentators who undertook to explain them. Among these we find
                    the names of Pappus, the learned and unfortunate Hypatia, Serenus, Eutocius,
                    &amp;c.</p>

                    >Argonautics,</hi> and surnamed the Rhodian, from the place of his residence, is
                    supposed to have been a native of Alexandria, where he is said to have recited
                    some portion of his poem while he was yet a youth. Finding it ill received by
                    his countrymen, he retired to Rhodes, where he is conjectured to have polished
                    and completed his work, supporting himself by the profession of rhetoric, and
                    receiving from the Rhodians the freedom of their city. He at length returned
                    with considerable honour to the place of his birth, succeeding Eratosthenes in
                    the care of the Alexandrian library in the reign of Ptolemy Euergetes, who
                    ascended the throne of Egypt in the year before Christ 246. That prince had been
                    educated by the famous Aristarchus, and rivalled the preceding sovereigns of his
                    liberal family in the munificent encouragement of learning. Apollonius was a
                    disciple of the poet Callimachus; but their connection ended in the most violent
                    enmity, which was probably owing to some degree of contempt expressed by
                    Apollonius for the light compositions of his master. The learned have vainly
                    endeavoured to discover the particulars of their quarrel. The only work of
                    Apollonius which has descended to modern times is his poem above mentioned, in
                    four books, on the Argonautic expedition. Both Longinus and Quintilian have
                    assigned to this work the mortifying character of mediocrity. It was published
                    for the first time at Florence in 1496, with the ancient Greek Scholia, in a 4to
                    volume, now exceedingly rare. There is an excellent edition by Brunck, published
                    in 1780, and another by Beck, published in 1797; but the best is that of
                    Professor Schafer, printed at Leipsic in 2 vols. 8vo, in 1810-13.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Apollonius,</hi> a Pythagorean philosopher, born at Tyana in
                    Cappadocia about the beginning of the first century. At 16 years of age he
                    became a strict observer of Pythagoras’s rules, renouncing wine and all sorts of
                    flesh; not wearing shoes, letting his hair grow, and wearing nothing but linen.
                    He soon after set up for a reformer of mankind, and chose his habitation in a
                    temple of Aesculapius, where he is said to have performed many wonderful cures.
                    Philostratus has written the life of Apollonius, in which there are numberless
                    fabulous stories recounted of him. We are told that he went five years without
                    speaking, and yet during that time stopped many seditions in Cilicia and
                    Pamphylia; that he travelled, and set up for a legislator; that he gave out he
                    understood all languages without having ever learned them; and that he could
                    tell the thoughts of men and understood the oracles which birds gave by their
                    singing. The heathens were fond of opposing the pretended miracles of this man
                    to those of our Saviour; and by a treatise which Eusebius wrote against one
                    Hierocles, we find that the object of the latter, in the treatise which Eusebius
                    refutes, seems to have been to draw a parallel between Jesus Christ and
                    Apollonius, in which he gives the preference to this philosopher. Μ. Dupin wrote
                    a confutation of Philostratus’s life of Apollonius.</p>
                <p>Apollonius wrote four books of Judicial Astrology; a Treatise upon the
                    Sacrifices, showing what was proper to be offered to each deity; and a great
                    number of Letters; all of which are now lost.</p>
