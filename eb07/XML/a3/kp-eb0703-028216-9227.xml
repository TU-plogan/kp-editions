                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    >Bee,</hi> in this work, directions will be given at considerable length as to
                    the management of an apiary, and various methods detailed of procuring honey and
                    wax from the hive without destroying the bees themselves. The most economic mode
                    of attaining these ends deserves more attention as a national object than it has
                    in general received in this country. It appears, from the returns of the
                    custom-líouse, that England pays annually to the north of Germany from L.40,000
                    to L.50,000 sterling for the wax and honey which are imported from thence, and
                    which might very easily be raised by a more extended and judicious cultivation
                    of bees at home. Greater attention to this useful appendage to the cottage would
                    not only be productive of commercial advantage, but would tend to improve the
                    condition of the lower order of peasantry. It is not generally known, indeed,
                    what profitable returns may be obtained, at a trifling expense of time and
                    labour, by very simple processes. Mr Huish, the author of a valuable practical
                    treatise on the management of bees, has made a calculation, from which he
                    infers, that even supposing the first cost of a swarm to be one guinea, which is
                    the price in the places where they are sold the dearest, the cottager is almost
                    certain, by proper care and management, of clearing, in five years, a net
                    produce of nearly L.60, and of having besides, at the end of that period, ten
                    good stocks of bees in liife garden.</p>
                <p>The principal objects to be attained in the construction and management of an
                    apiary, are to secure the prosperity and multiplication of the colonies; to
                    increase the amount of theii∙ productive labour; and to obtain their products
                    with facility, and with the least possible detriment to the stock. The apiary
                    should afford to the bees the best shelter against moisture and the extremes of
                    heat and of cold, and especially against sudden vicissitudes of temperature; it
                    should protect them against their numerous enemies; it' should afford them every
                    facility of constructing their combs, and of rearing their young; it should
                    allow of every part of the combs being occasionally inspected, and being capable
                    of removal when requisite; and, while due attention is paid to economy, it
                    should be made of materials that will insure its durability. Much ingenuity has
                    been displayed by different apiarians in the construction of hives which should
                    unite in the greatest possible degree all these advantages. Although it be in
                    vain to hope that every one of these objects can at once be perfectly attained,
                    yet there is still great room for improvement on the hives that are at present
                    in common use; and we shall here point out a few of the more reCent modes of
                    construction.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193099240" xml:id="kp-eb0703-9240-0283"/>
                <p>While some cultivators of bees have been chiefly anxi- 'ous to promote their
                    multiplication, and to prevent the escape of the swarms in the natural way, by
                    procuring what they have termed <hi rend="italic">artificial swarms,</hi> —which
                    they effected by separating a populous hive, previous to its swarming, into two
                    parts, and allowing to each greater room for the extension of their works;
                    others have contemplated only the abundance of the products which they yielded,
                    and the facility of extracting them from the hive, without showing any
                    particular solicitude as to the preservation of the bees themselves. Another
                    class of apiarians have, on the other hand, had it more particularly in view to
                    facilitate the prosecution of researches in the natural history and economy of
                    bees. The hive invented by Mr Huber is peculiarly calculated for the last of
                    these objects, and its construction is founded on an accurate knowledge of the
                    habits of these insects. He has given it the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >niche</hi><hi rend="italic">en livre ou en feuillets,</hi> from its opening and
                    shutting somewhat in the manner of the leaves of a book. This <hi rend="italic"
                    >booh</hi> or <hi rend="italic">leaf hive</hi> is composed of from eight to
                    twelve square wooden frames, placed vertically, and joined together sidewise
                    like the hoops of a cask. Each frame consists of two uprights, one inch in
                    thickness, a foot in height, and an inch and a third in width, connected by an
                    upper and lower cross bar, ten inches long, and of the same breadth and
                    thickness as the former; so that all the frames may be joined together, without
                    leaving any interval. The two external frames are closed each by a pane of
                    glass, which is covered by a shutter on the outside; and the whole is properly
                    .secured in its place, and further protected by an external cover. An aperture
                    must of course be left in the lower part of one of the frames to serve as a
                    door. In order to determine the bees to construct their combs in the plane of
                    each leaf, a small piece of honeycomb is fixed, by means of pegs, to the top of
                    each in the proper position, as it is well known that bees always complete their
                    work in the direction in which they find it begun, unless they meet with some
                    insurmountable obstacle. 4 proper distance is thus preserved between the lateral
                    surfaces of the perpendicular combs; and the external ones, being only three or
                    four lines distant from the glass panes, may be easily inspected by opening the
                    shutters; and also by opening in succession the different divisions of the hive,
                    both surfaces of every comb may at pleasure be fully brought into view. No
                    difficulty is experienced in introducing swarms into hives of this construction;
                    and after the lapse of a few days, when the’ colony is fully established, the
                    bees will very patiently submit to be daily inspected.</p>
                <p>Mr Huber’s hive is exceedingly well calculated for producing artificial swarms on
                    the principle of Schirach’s discovery, of which a full account will be given in
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Bee.</hi> It allows us to judge by inspection
                    whether the population is sufficient to admit of division,—if the brood is of
                    the proper age,—and if males exist, or are ready to be produced, for
                    impregnating the young queen; all which circumstances are of material
                    consequence to the success of the operation. It is essential that some of the
                    larvae should not have been hatched above three days before this attempt is
                    made. The frames must then be gently separated at the middle of the hive, and
                    two empty frames be introduced in the interval between the former; each of these
                    new frames having a partition which closes them completely, so as to enable the
                    two portions to be entirely separated without leaving any opening. The door of
                    that portion in which the queen happens to be. at .this time may remain open,
                    but the one belonging to the other part must be closed, so as to retain the bees
                    that have no queen prisoners for 24 hours, allowing still, however, sufficient
                    circulation of air. After this interval of time they appear to have forgotten
                    their queen, at least they are no longer anxious to seek for her, but bestow all
                    their solicitude in the education of the larvae, so as to convert a certain
                    number of them into queens to supply the loss they have sustained. This they
                    accomplish in ten days or a fortnight after the operation. The two colonies are
                    now perfectly distinct, and are never found afterwards to intermix.</p>
                <p>Another advantage attending a hive of this construction consists in its enabling
                    us to force the bees to produce a much greater quantity of wax than they would
                    naturally do. The interval which separates the combs when the bees have not been
                    disturbed in their operations is constantly the same, namely, about four lines.
                    Were they too distant, it is evident that the bees would be much dispersed, and
                    finable to communicate their heat reciprocally, and the brood would not be.
                    preserved in a sufficient degree of warmth. Were the combs too close, on the
                    contrary, the bees could not freely traverse the intervals, and the work of the
                    hive would suffer. It is evident that we may avail ourselves of this instinct,
                    and, by separating farther asunder the combs that are already built, induce the
                    bees either to extend the breadth of those they had begun, or to build others in
                    the interval, if sufficient space be allowed them for this purpose. Thus, by
                    interposing three empty frames, one between every alternate interval of the
                    combs in a hive containing six combs, three additional combs, if the proper
                    season be chosen, will be obtained at the end of a week; and if the weather
                    continue favourable, the operation may be repeated, and the same number of
                    additional combs procured the week after.</p>
                <p>The principal obstacles to the general employment of Mr Huber’s hives are the
                    expense of constructing them, and the greater degree of attention which they
                    perhaps require from the cultivator. It has also been objected that the flatness
                    of the roof was prejudicial, by allowing the njoisture which exhales from the
                    bees to collect at the top, and to fall in drops at different parts, to the
                    great injury of the subjacent contents of the hive. Feburier proposes therefore
                    the employment of frames in the form of a trapezium, so that the roof shall be
                    considerably inclined to the horizon. He borrows this shape from Bose, whose
                    hive consists, however, only of two boxes joined together sidewise, and
                    separable in order to form artificial swarms. This was.an improvement upon
                    Gelieu’s hive, which was formed of two square boxes united laterally. Delator
                    had recommended a still more simple form than that of Bose, though less
                    convenient; namely, that of a triangle resting on its base. Mr Ravenel’s hive
                    consists of three square boxes instead of two; Mr Scrain’s is also made up of
                    three boxes, but they are low and of great length, and are joined endwise,—a
                    communication being established between them by apertures made in the divisions
                    which separate the boxes. It is now, however, well established, that partitions
                    of any kind are detrimental to the prosperity of the colony. The same objection
                    applies, though perhaps.in an inferior degree, to the system of storied hives,
                    or those which are divided into stories one above another. A great variety of
                    the latter description, however, have been recommended by different cultivators.
                    In France they are known by the name of <hi rend="italic">ruches</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">en hausses.</hi> Mr Thorley’s improved hive is of this class, and
                    Mr Lombard’s <hi rend="italic">xν.che</hi><hi rend="italic">villageoise</hi> may
                    also be referred to the same head, although it be of much simpler construction
                    than any other compound hive. Mr Lombard’s hive is composed of two parts, a body
                    and a cover, forming together an elevation of from seventeen to twenty inches,
                    on a uniform diameter of one foot, excepting the upper part, which ought to be
                    convex. The body is formed of bands of straw, similar to that of the cottages in
                    this country.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193099253" xml:id="kp-eb0703-9253-0284"/>
                <p>At the top and bottom of the body is placed an exterior band, which forms a
                    projecting border on each end, the lower one giving the hive a firm station on
                    its pedestal, the upper one contributing to secure the attachment of the cover,
                    or allowing of another similar body being placed above the first, if such an
                    addition should be deemed necessary. At the top of the body, and even with the
                    upper band, is placed a flooring board, made of a light plank, ten inches in
                    breadth in all directions, and the four corners of which are sawed off in such a
                    manner that the breadth along the diagonal measures one foot. This board is
                    fixed by nails inserted in the upper double band, and entering a little into the
                    front. The four openings that are left on the sides are necessary for the
                    passage of the bees, and for the escape of the vapours which are exhaled from
                    them.in winter. A flat rod traverses the hive immediately under the board, and
                    projecting from the two sides about an inch and a half, affords handles for
                    lifting the hive, and facilitates the fastening of the cover, which has also a
                    projecting rod corresponding with that of the hive. At the bottom is an opening
                    two inches broad and nine lines in height for the ingress and egress of the
                    bees. The cover is formed in the shape of a dome, with a vertical handle at the
                    top, and a cross bar at the lower part, by the projecting ends of which it may
                    be tied to the ends of the bar in the body, and which serves also as a support
                    to the combs that are constructed in the cover. For the latter purpose, also,
                    two other bars are placed crosswise, one above the other. All the hives and all
                    the basés of the covers are to be made of one uniform diameter, in order that
                    the hives may, if occasion require it, be placed upon each other, and the covers
                    be adapted to any of the hives that may happen to be at the top.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">pyramidal hive</hi> of Μ. Dueouédie, which the inventor
                    extols in his book entitled <hi rend="italic">La Ruche Pyramidale, avec l’art
                    d’établir et d’utiliser les ruches,</hi> &amp;c. as leaving nothing more to be
                    wished for as to the cultivation of bees, differs but little from that of Mr
                    Thorley. A common straw hive is taken, containing a swarm, which is allowed to
                    remain till the spring of the following year; it is then placed on the top of a
                    square box, with which it is made to communicate by a round aperture at the top
                    of the box. In this state it is termed by the French <hi rend="italic">la ruche
                    Ecossaise,</hi> or, <hi rend="italic">ruche de Μ. de la Bourdonnaye.</hi> In the
                    following spring a second box is placed under the first, and the whole now
                    assumes the name of <hi rend="italic">la ruche pyramidale.</hi> The bees are
                    still allowed no other ingress or egress but by a single hole made in the lowest
                    story. The upper stories may then be removed in succession, while further room
                    is allowed below by the addition of fresh boxes. It is stated by Μ. Dueouédie,
                    that the bees in his pyramidal hive never perish by hunger or by cold; for they
                    always abound in provisions, and are too numerous to be afleeted by the most
                    rigorous winter. When the bees are in groups, they maintain the necessary warmth
                    in the hive, and the brood, on the return of spring, is hatched one month sooner
                    than in any other hive. Mr Huish has, however, made it clearly appear that these
                    pretended advantages are much exaggerated, while its inconveniences are passed
                    over in silence. It is difficult, if not impossible, to proportion the hives in
                    all cases to the magnitude of the swarms, or to the energy with which they
                    labour. The honey being taken from the oldest cells, is deteriorated by an
                    admixture of pollen, communicating to it a degree of bitterness, of which it is
                    difficult to deprive it; and it is less abundant, in consequence of the
                    diminished capacity of the cells, in which the coceoons of successive bees in
                    their state of nympha have accumulated. From their being divided into different
                    stories, the beeS are obliged to live, as it were, in different families; while
                    their own preservation and that of the brood requires them to live in the
                    strictest union. The heat is also lessened by the division of the bees into
                    different groups. The upper part of these hives being all necessarily flat
                    (except the first or straw hive), occasions a serious inconvenience, by allowing
                    moisture to collect and drop down into the middle of the hive, instead of
                    trickling down the sides. The injury which this does to the combs, and to the
                    bees themselves, who are constantly exposed to its influence, is, according to
                    Mr FIuish, the most common cause of the loss of the hives during the winter. The
                    bees, he observes, always begin their work in the most elevated point of the
                    hive, and seek for that purpose the central part of the roof. If the top be
                    flat, and especially if it be as spacious as in the hives called pyramidal, the
                    bees will not find this centre; they will work one year in one part, and the
                    following year in another. This is without doubt one of the causes which oblige
                    a proprietor to wait three or four years before any honey can be gathered from
                    these hives.</p>
                <p>The hive recommended by Mr Huish as affording sufficient facility for examining
                    any of the combs, and performing on them any operation at pleasure, is very
                    similar in form to that described as being used in Greece. The body of the hive
                    is a straw basket in the shape of a flower-pot, that is, of a broader diameter
                    above than below. Eight pieces of well-seasoned wood, about eight inches broad
                    and half an inch thick, are laid parallel to one another, at equal distances,
                    over the top of the basket, and fastened to an outer projecting band: they are
                    then covered with network, over which is placed a circular board, or what is
                    better, a convex cover of straw extending over the whole of the top of the hive.
                    This network obliges the bees to fasten their combs to the transverse boards, by
                    means of which each comb can easily be lifted up without interfering with any
                    other part of the hive, or occasioning the loss of a single bee; and the whole
                    of the interior of the hive is thus open to inspection, and we are enabled to
                    trace the devastations of the moth, or to ascertain the presence of any other
                    enemy.—See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Bee. (y.)</hi></p>
