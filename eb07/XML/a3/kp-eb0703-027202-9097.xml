                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    in 1617, beinθ ’ the son of a gentleman whom King Philip IV. made president of
                    the admiralty established in that city in 1626. After having gone through a
                    course of philosophy and divinity in his own country, he went to study law at
                    Salamanca, where he closely attended the lectures of Francisco Ramos del
                    Manzano, afterwards counsellor to the king and preceptor to Charles II. Upon his
                    return to Seville, after he had finished his law studies at Salamanca, he shut
                    himself up in the royal monastery of Benedictines, where he employed himself
                    several years in writing his <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hispanica,</hi> having the use of the books of Bennet de la Sana, abbot of that
                    monastery, and dean of the faculty of divinity at Salamanca. In the year 1659 he
                    was sent to Rome by King Philip IV. in the character of agent-general from the
                    prince: he had also particular commissions from the inquisition of Spain, the
                    viceroys of Naples and Sicily, and the governor of Milan, to negotiate their
                    affairs at Rome. The cardinal of Arragon procured him, from Pope Alexander VII.,
                    a canonry in the church of Seville, the income whereof he employedin charity and
                    the purchasing of books: he had above 30,000 volumes in his library. By this
                    help, joined to continual labour and indefatigable application, he was at last
                    enabled to finish his <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hispanica,</hi> in four volumes folio, two of which he published at Rome in the
                    year 1672. The work consists of two parts; the one containing the Spanish
                    writers who flourished before the 15th century, and the other those since the
                    end of that century. After the publication of these two volumes, he was recalled
                    to Madrid by King Charles II. He left nothing at his death, which took place in
                    1684, but his vast library; and his two brothers and nephews being unable to
                    publish the remaining volumes of his <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca,</hi> sent
                    them to Cardinal d’Aguisnc, who paid the expence of the impression, and
                    committed the superintendence of it to Μ. Martin, his librarian, who added notes
                    in the name of the cardinal. These two volumes were published in 1696. Improved
                    editions of both these works, by F. P. Bayer, were published at Madrid in 4
                    vols. folio, in 1783-8. A work by Antonio was published for the first time at
                    Valencia in 1742, entitled <hi rend="italic">Censura</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">Historias Fabulas,</hi><hi rend="italic">obra</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">postuma,</hi> folio.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Antonio,</hi><hi rend="italic">St,</hi> one of the Cape de
                    Verd Islands, about 40 miles in length and 20 in breadth. It is separated from
                    St Vincent by a clear navigable channel two leagues in breadth. On the north
                    coast there is a good road for shipping, with a supply of fresh water. The
                    island stretches from north-cast to south-west, and is filled with mountains,
                    one of which is of so extraordinary a height as to be compared with the Peak of
                    Teneriffe. Its top is constantly covered with snow, and, notwithstanding the
                    clearness of the sky, generally hid in clouds. The island produces a variety of
                    fruits, among which are oranges, lemons, melons, and some sugar-canes. The
                    potatoes and melons are particularly excellent. Long. 25. W.Lat. 17. N.</p>
