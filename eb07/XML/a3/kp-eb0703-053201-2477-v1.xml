                <p>IS a science which explains the properties of numbers, and shows the method or
                    art of computing by them.</p>
                <p>L—HISTORY OF ARITHMETIC.</p>
                <p>The various attempts of men in every state of society at representing numbers all
                    spring from the same feeling, so stronglý implanted in their breasts, which
                    unceasingly prompts them to seek the applause of their fellows. It is the love
                    of distinction that elevates the human character, infuses life and action
                    through the mass, and impels it to undertake and achieve mighty projects. The
                    daring and restless spirit of improvement often produces much transient misery
                    by its failures; yet amidst all the vicissitudes which chequer and darken the
                    tide of human affairs, it opens cheering prospects of the permanent amelioration
                    of our species. The aspiring leader of a successful band, or the petty
                    legislator of a rising community, is anxious to preserve the memory of the
                    exploits he performed, or the benefits he conferred. But he is not content with
                    obtaining the applause of his contemporaries: this fleeting existence is
                    insufficient to fill his imagination: he looks anxiously beyond the grave, and
                    sighs for the admiration of generations yet unborn. Hence the anxiety among all
                    people to erect monuments of high achievements or illustrious characters. In the
                    early periods of society a vast mound of earth, or a huge block of stone, was
                    the only memorial of any great event; but after the simpler arts came to be
                    known, efforts were made to transmit to posterity the representations of the
                    objects themselves. Sculptures of the humblest kind occur on monumental stones
                    in all parts of the world, sufficient to convey tolerably distinct images of the
                    usual occupation and employments of the personages so commemorated. The next
                    step in the progress of society was to reduce and abridge those rude sculptures,
                    and thence form combinations of figures approaching to the hieroglyphical
                    characters. At this epoch of improvement the first attempts to represent
                    numerals would be made. Instead of repeating the same objects, it was an obvious
                    contrivance to annex to the mere individual the simpler marks of such
                    repetition. Those marks would of necessity be suited to the nature of the
                    materials on which they were inscribed, and the quality of the instruments
                    employed to trace them. In the historical representations, for instance, which
                    the Mexicans and certain Tartar hordes painted on skins, a small coloured
                    circle, as exhibiting the original counter, shell, or pebble, was repeated to
                    denote numbers. But on the Egyptian obelisks the lower numbers, at least, are
                    expressed by combined strokes. Curve lines were not admitted in the earliest
                    rudiments of writing. Even after the use of hieroglyphics had been laid aside,
                    and the artificial system of alphabetic characters adopted, the rectilineal
                    forms were still preferred, as evidently appears in the Greek and Roman
                    capitals, which, being originally of the lapidary sort, are much older than the
                    small or current letters. One of the most ancient sets of characters, the Runic,
                    in which the northern languages were engraved, combines almost exclusively
                    simple strokes at different angles.</p>
                <p>The primary numeral traces may, therefore, be regarded as the commencement of a
                    philosophical and universal character, drawn from nature itself, and alike
                    intelligible to all ages and nations. They are still preserved, with very little
                    change, in the Roman notation. Those forms, prior to the adoption of the
                    alphabet itself, were no doubt imported by the Grecian colonies that settled in
                    ' Italy, and gave rise to the Latin name and commonwealth. Assuming a
                    perpendicular stroke 1 to signify <hi rend="italic">one,</hi> another such I i
                    would express <hi rend="italic">two,</hi> the junction of a third 1 ĭ I <hi
                    rend="italic">three,</hi> and so repeatedly till the reckoner had reached <hi
                    rend="italic">ten.</hi> See Plate LXXVI. The first class was now completed, and
                    to intimate this the carver threw a dash across the stroke or common unit; that
                    is, he employed two decussating strokes to denote <hi rend="italic">ten.</hi> He
                    next repeated this mark to express <hi rend="italic">twenty, thirty,</hi> and so
                    forth, till he finished the second class of numbers. Arrived at <hi
                    rend="italic">an hundred,</hi> he would signify it by joining another dash to
                    the mark for ten, or by merely connecting three strokes thus £2 ∙ Again, the
                    same spirit of invention might lead him to repeat this character in denoting <hi
                    rend="italic">two hundred, three hundred,</hi> and so forth, till the <hi
                    rend="italic">third</hi> class was completed. <hi rend="italic">A thousand,</hi>
                    which begins the fourth class on the <hi rend="italic">Denary Scale,</hi> was
                    therefore expressed by four combined strokes</p>
                <p>, and this was the utmost length to which the Romans first proceeded by direct
                    notation.</p>
                <p>But the division of these marks afterwards furnished characters for the
                    intermediate numbers, and hence greatly shortened the repetition of the lower
                    ones. Thus, having parted in the middle the two decussating strokes denoting <hi
                    rend="italic">ten,</hi> either the under half ∕∖ , or the upper half ∖∕ , was
                    employed to signify <hi rend="italic">five.</hi> Next, the mark (2 for an
                    hundred, consisting of a triple stroke, was largely divided into J"^ and <hi
                    rend="underline">Į</hi>, either of which represented <hi rend="italic"
                    >fifty.</hi> Again, the four combined strokes 1V∣, which originally formed the
                    character for <hi rend="italic">a thousand,</hi> came afterwards, in the
                    progress of the arts, to assume'a rounded shape QQ, frequently expressed thus
                    CIO. by two disparted semicircles divided by a diameter. This last form, by
                    abbreviation on either side, gave two portions cI and I□ to represent <hi
                    rend="italic">five hundred.</hi></p>
                <p>It was an easy process, therefore, to devise a universal character for expressing
                    numbers. But the task was very different to reduce the exhibition of language in
                    general to such concise philosophical principles. This attempt seems accordingly
                    to have been early abandoned by all nations except the Chinese. The inestimable
                    advantage of uniting again the whole human race, in spite of the diversity of
                    tongues, by the same permanent system of communication, was sacrificed for the
                    easier attainment of representing by artificial signs those elementary and
                    fugitive sounds into which the words of each particular dialect could be
                    resolved. Hence the <hi rend="smallcaps">Alphabet</hi> was invented, which had
                    very nearly attained its present form at the period when the Roman commonwealth
                    was extending its usurpation over Italy. About that epoch a sort of reaction
                    seems to have arisen between the artificial and the natural systems; and the
                    numeral strokes were finally displaced by such alphabetic characters as then
                    most resembled them. (See Plate LXXVI.) The ancient Romans employed the letter I
                    to represent the single stroke or mark for <hi rend="italic">one;</hi> they
                    selected the letter V, since it resembles the upper half of the two decussating
                    strokes or symbol, for <hi rend="italic">five</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the
                    letter X exactly depicted the double mark for <hi rend="italic">ten</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> again, the letter L was adopted as resem <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193102490?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-2490-0533"/> bling the
                    divided symbol for <hi rend="italic">fifty</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> while
                    the entire symbol, or the tripled stroke, denoting <hi rend="italic">an
                    hundred,</hi> was exhibited by the hollow square £, the original form of the
                    letter C before it became rounded over. The quadrupled stroke for a <hi
                    rend="italic">thousand</hi> was distinctly represented by the letter Μ, and its
                    variety by the compound character cl□, consisting of the letter I inclosed on
                    both sides by C, and bv the same letter reversed; a portion of this, again, or
                    I□, being condensed into the letter D, expressed <hi rend="italic">five
                    hundred.</hi> The letters C and Μ, beginning the words <hi rend="italic"
                    >Centum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hille,</hi> might have a farther claim to
                    represent an <hi rend="italic">hundred</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a
                    thousand</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but the coincidence was merely accidental,
                    since these terms migrated probably from the Greek words <hi rend="italic"
                    >'εxαrον</hi> and <hi rend="italic">χιλιa.</hi></p>
                <p>This was the limit of numeration among the early Romans; but, in the progress of
                    refinement, they repeated the symbols of a thousand to denote the higher terms
                    of the Denary Scale. Thus, ccI□□ was employed to represent <hi rend="italic">ten
                    thousand,</hi> and cccI□□□ to signify <hi rend="italic">an hundred
                    thousand,</hi> the letter I, inclosed between the c □, being, for the sake of
                    greater distinctness, elongated. Again, each of these being divided, gives I□□
                    for <hi rend="italic">five thousand,</hi> and ĩooo for <hi rend="italic">fifty
                    thousand.</hi> These characters, however, were often modified and abbreviated in
                    monumental inscriptions. By drawing a horizontal line over the letters, their
                    value was augmented <hi rend="italic">one thousand times.</hi> In the plate so
                    often referred to, we have endeavoured, from the best authorities, to exhibit,
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Lapidary Numerals,</hi> a complete specimen
                    of the various contractions used by stone-cutters among the Romans. It was
                    customary with them, for the sake of abbreviation, to reckon, as rude tribes are
                    apt to do, partly backwards. Thus, instead of <hi rend="italic">οetοdxcern</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">novemdecem,</hi> the words for <hi rend="italic"
                    >eighteen</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nineteen,</hi> they frequently used <hi
                    rend="italic">duodeviginti</hi> and <hi rend="italic">undeviginti,</hi> as more
                    elegant and expressive. This practice led to the application of <hi
                    rend="italic">deficient</hi> numbers, an improvement scarcely to be expected
                    from a people so little noted for invention. Instead of writing <hi
                    rend="italic">nine</hi> thus, VHII, by joiningybwτ∙ to <hi rend="italic"
                    >five,</hi> they counted <hi rend="italic">one</hi> back from <hi rend="italic"
                    >ten,</hi> or placed I before X. In the same way they represented <hi
                    rend="italic">forty,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">four hundred, ninety,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">nine hundred,</hi> by XL, and CD, XC, and CM.</p>
                <p>Such, we have no doubt, is the real account of the rise and progress of the Roman
                    numerals. It perfectly agrees with the few hints left us by Aulus Gellius, who
                    expressly says that I and X were anciently represented by one and two strokes;
                    though philologers, misled by partial glimpses, have indeed given a very
                    different statement. Priscian the grammarian, who flourished in the reign of the
                    emperor Justinian, asserts that the mark I was only borrowed from the Athenians,
                    being adopted by them as the prinċipal letter of the word MIA, or <hi
                    rend="italic">one,</hi> the Μ of which is considered as mute; that V or U was
                    employed by the Romans to denote <hi rend="italic">five,</hi> because it is the
                    fifth vowel m the∙common order; that X was assumed to represent <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> en</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∙&gt;</hi> as being the tenth consonant, and likewise following the V; that L
                    was taken to signify <hi rend="italic">fifty,</hi> being sometimes interchanged
                    with N, which, aş a small letter, expressed that number among the Greeks; that C
                    was adopted to mark <hi rend="italic">an hundred,</hi> because it is the first
                    letter of the word <hi rend="italic">centum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that D,
                    being the next letter of the alphabet, was employed to signify <hi rend="italic"
                    >five hundred</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and that Μ was borrowed from the
                    Greek letter X for ΧΙΛΙΑ, or <hi rend="italic">a thousand;</hi> only that it was
                    rounded at the ends to distinguish it from the symbol for ten.</p>
                <p>After the system of Roman numerals, however, had acquired its full extent, the
                    solicitude of superstition long preserved some traces of the rudest and most
                    primitive mode of chronicling events. At the close of each revolving year,
                    generally on the ides of September, the Praetor Maximus was accustomed, with
                    great ceremony, to drive a <hi rend="italic">noil</hi> in the door on the right
                    side of the temple of Jupiter, next that of Minerva, the patron of learning and
                    the inventor of numbers. On such occasions they elected a dictator for the sole
                    purpose of driving the sacred nail, and beginning a more propitious year. Hence
                    the expression of Cicero— <hi rend="italic">Ex hoe die,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >clavum anni movebis.</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi></p>
                <p>As the Chinese constructed the Swan-pan on the principles of the Roman Abacus
                    (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Abacus),</hi> so they likewise, at the remotest epoch
                    of the empire, framed a system of numerals in many respects similar to those
                    which the Romans probably derived from their Pelasgic ancestors. This will
                    appear from the inspection of the characters engraved on Plate LXXVI. It is only
                    to be observed that the Chinese mode of writing is the reverse of ours; and
                    that, beginning at the top of the leaf, they descend in parallel columns to the
                    bottom, proceeding, however, from right to left, as practised by most of the
                    Oriental nations.</p>
                <p>Instead of the vertical lines used by the Romans, we therefore meet with
                    horizontal ones in the Chinese notation. Thus, <hi rend="italic">one</hi> is
                    represented by a horizontal stroke, with a sort of barbed termination; <hi
                    rend="italic">two</hi> by a pair of such strokes; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >three</hi> by as many parallel strokes; .the mark for <hi rend="italic"
                    >four</hi> has four strokes, with a sort of flourish; three horizontal strokes,
                    with two vertical ones, form the mark for <hi rend="italic">five;</hi> and the
                    other symbols exhibit the successive strokes abbreviated, as far as <hi
                    rend="italic">nine. Ten</hi> is figured by a horizontal stroke, crossed with a
                    vertical score, to show that the first rank of the Denary Scale was completed;
                    <hi rend="italic">an hundred</hi> is signified by two vertical scores, connected
                    by three short horizontal lines; <hi rend="italic">a thousand</hi> is
                    represented by a sort of double cross; and the other ranks, ascending to <hi
                    rend="italic">an hundred millions,</hi> have the same marks successively
                    compounded. In addition to the figures in the Plate, we shall here give <hi
                    rend="subscript"> t</hi> ∕hc <hi rend="italic">similes</hi> of a complete set of
                    numerals, printed with metallic types in 1814, at Serampore, in the Elements of
                    Chinese Grammar, by the Reverend Dr Marshman. .In these characters, it will be
                    perceived that each symbol has, for the sake of distinction, a small zero or <hi

                    language at present, it is equivalent to <hi rend="italic">all.</hi> But the
                    Greeks themselves had not advanced farther. In China, <hi rend="italic">wan
                    wan</hi> signifies <hi rend="italic">ten thousand times ten thousand,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">an hundred millions',</hi> though there is also a distinct
                    character for this high number. In the eastern strain of hyperbole, the
                    phrase.wàw <hi rend="italic">wan</hi> far outdoing <hi rend="italic">a thousand
                    years,</hi> the measure of Spanish loyalty, is the usual shout of long live the
                    emperor I The Chinese character <hi rend="italic">chaò</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">a million,</hi> though not of the greatest antiquity, is yet as
                    old as the time of Confucius. The characters for <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> and
                    for <hi rend="italic">an hundred millions</hi> are not found in their oldest
                    books, but occur in the imperial dictionary.</p>
                <p>Such is the very complete but intricate system of Chinese numerals. It has been
                    constantly used, from the remotest times, in all the historical, moral, and
                    philosophical compositions of that singular people-The ordinary symbols for
                    words, or rather things, are, in their writings, generally blended with skill
                    among those characters. But the Chinese merchants and traders have transformed
                    this system of notation into another, which is more concise, and better adapted
                    for the details of business. The changes made on the elementary characters, it
                    will be seen, are not very material. The <hi rend="italic">one, two,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">three,</hi> are represented by perpendicular strokes; the
                    symbols for <hi rend="italic">four</hi> and <hi rend="italic">five</hi> are
                    altered; <hi rend="italic">six</hi> is denoted by a short score above an
                    horizontal stroke, as if to signify that <hi rend="italic">five,</hi> the half
                    of the index of the scale, had been counted over; <hi rend="italic">seven</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">eight</hi> are expressed by the addition of one and two
                    horizontal lines; and the mark for <hi rend="italic">nine</hi> is composed of
                    that for <hi rend="italic">six,</hi> or perhaps at first a variety of <hi
                    rend="italic">five,</hi> joined to that of <hi rend="italic">four.</hi></p>
                <p>To represent <hi rend="italic">eleven, twelve,</hi> &amp;c. in this mode, a
                    single stroke is placed on the left of the cross for ten, and the several
                    additions of <hi rend="italic">one, two,</hi> &amp;c. annexed on the right.</p>

                <p>The same method is pursued through the hundreds, the marks of the several
                    multiples being always placed on the left hand before the contracted symbol of
                    <hi rend="italic">pŭh,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">an hundred.</hi> The additions
                    are made on the right, with a small cipher or circle (o), called <hi
                    rend="italic">ling,</hi> when necessary, to separate the place of units. The
                    distinction between <hi rend="italic">two</hi><hi rend="italic">hundred and
                    three</hi> and <hi rend="italic">five hundred and thirty</hi> deserves to be
                    particularly remarked.</p>

                <p>A similar process extends to the notation of thousands, but for ten thousand the
                    character <hi rend="italic">wan</hi> is abbreviated. As a specimen of their
                    combination, we select the following complex expression,</p>

                <p>which denotes <hi rend="italic">Jive hundred and forty-three millions, four
                    hundred and seventy-five thousand, and three.</hi> The same number would be thus

                <p>S <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> W⅛</p>
                <p>Here the first column on the right hand presents the marks for <hi rend="italic"
                    >fifty</hi> and <hi rend="italic">four,</hi> with the interjacent character <hi
                    rend="italic">wàn,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ten thousand</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> the next column to the left has the several marks for <hi rend="italic"
                    >a thousand, three,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">an hundred</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> the middle column exhibits the symbols of <hi rend="italic">forty</hi>
                    and of <hi rend="italic">seven;</hi> the adjacent column repeats the character
                    <hi rend="italic">wan,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ten thousand,</hi> and then
                    presents those for <hi rend="italic">five</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a
                    thousand;</hi> and the last column has the symbol <hi rend="italic">ling,</hi>
                    or the <hi rend="italic">rest,</hi> which fills up the blank, with the mark for
                    <hi rend="italic">three.</hi></p>
                <p>The last expression seems abundantly complicated, and yet it is unquestionably
                    simpler and clearer than the corresponding notation with Roman numerals, as
                    represented below.</p>
                <p>I□□□O□□□ ∙ CCCCCI□□O□□ *</p>
                <p>CCCCCI□□3□□ ’ CCCCCI□□3□□ ∙</p>

                <p>I□□□ ∙ CCI□□ ∙ CCI□□ ∙ I□□ ∙ III.</p>
                <p>From such an intricate example, the imperfection of the Roman system will appear
                    the more striking.</p>
                <p>The abbreviated process of the Chinese traders was probably suggested by the
                    communication with India, where the admirable system of denary notation has,
                    from the earliest ages, been understood. and practised. The adoption of a small
                    cipher to fill the void spaces was a most material improvement on the very
                    complex character <hi rend="italic">Ung,</hi> used formerly for the same
                    purpose.</p>
                <p>About the close of the 17th rcentury, the Jesuit missionaries Bouvet, Gerbilion,
                    and, others, then residing at the court of Pekin, and able mathematicians,
                    appear tθ <pb break="no" facs="nls:193102516?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-2516-0535"/> have still farther improved the numeral symbols
                    of the <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> Chinese traders, and reduced the whole
                    system to a degree of simplicity and elegance of form scarcely inferior to that
                    of our modern ciphers. With these abbreviated characters they printed, at the
                    imperial press, Vlacq’s <hi rend="italic">Tables of Logarithms,</hi> extending
                    to ten places of decimals, in a beautiful volume, of which a copy was presented
                    by Father Gaubil, on his return to Europe, about the year 1750, to the Royal
                    Society of London. From this very curious work, the marks in Plate LXXVI.
                    entitled Improved Chinese Numerals, were carefully copied. No more than nine
                    characters, it will be seen, are wanted; the upright cross + for <hi
                    rend="italic">ten</hi> being a mere redundancy. The marks for <hi rend="italic"
                    >one, two,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">three,</hi> consist of parallel strokes as
                    before; an oblique cross X denotes <hi rend="italic">four</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and a sort of bisected ten signifies <hi rend="italic">five.</hi> This
                    symbol again, being contracted into the angular mark and combined with <hi
                    rend="italic">one, two,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tlιree</hi> strokes drawn
                    below it, represents <hi rend="italic">six, seven,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >eight</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and still more abridged and annexed to the
                    sign of four, it denotes <hi rend="italic">nine.</hi> The distinction of units,
                    tens, hundreds, &amp;c. is indicated by giving the strokes alternately an
                    horizontal and vertical position, while the blanks or vacant bars are expressed
                    by placing small zeros. The very important collection of logarithmic tables just
                    mentioned was printed by the command of the emperor Kang-hi, a man of enlarged
                    views, who governed China with dignity and wisdom during a long course of years.
                    This enlightened prince was much devoted to the learning of Europe, and is
                    reported to have been so fond of calculation as to have those tables abridged
                    and printed in a smaller character, which precious volume he carried constantly
                    fastened to his girdle. The emperor Kien-long, who, after a beneficent reign of
                    60 years, in the decline of a protracted life spontaneously resigned the
                    imperial office to his son, discovered a similar taste for the mathematical
                    sciences.</p>
                <p>The Greeks, after having communicated to the founders of Rome the elements of the
                    numeral characters which are still preserved, again exercised their inventive
                    genius in framing new systems of notation. Discarding the simple original
                    strokes, they sought to draw.materials of construction from their extended
                    alphabet. They had no fewer than three different modes of proceeding. Isí, The
                    letters of the alphabet, in their natural succession, were employed to signify
                    the smaller ordinal numbers. In this way, for instance, the books of Homer’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> are usually marked.
                    But the practice could scarcely be older than the time of Aristotle, who, it is
                    well known, first collected and arranged those immortal poems, in the edition of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Cashet,</hi> for the use of his illustrious pupil
                    Alexander the Great. <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> The first letters of the words
                    for numerals were adopted as abbreviated symbols. Thus, employing capitals only,
                    I, being retained as before, to denote <hi rend="italic">one,</hi> the letter ∏
                    of ΠΕΝΤΕ' marked <hi rend="italic">five,</hi> the ∆of ΔΕΚΑ denoted <hi
                    rend="italic">ten,</hi> the Hof'ΕΚΑΤΟΝ, anciently written HEKATON, expressed <hi
                    rend="italic">an hundred,</hi> the X of ΧΙΛΙΑ <hi rend="italic">a thousand,</hi>
                    and the letter Μ of the word MTPIA represented <hi rend="italic">ten
                    thousand.</hi> A simple and ingenious device was used for augmenting the powers
                    of those symbols; a large ∏ placed over any letter made it signify <hi
                    rend="italic">five thousand</hi> times more. Thus, ∣ Δ ∣ denoted <hi
                    rend="italic">fifty thousand,</hi> and ∖ <hi rend="italic">H</hi> ∖ <hi
                    rend="italic">five hundred thousand.</hi> See Plate LXXVI. 3&lt;Z, But a mighty
                    stride was afterwards made in numerical notation by the Greeks, when they
                    distributed the twenty-four letters of their alphabet into three classes,
                    corresponding to <hi rend="italic">units, leļts,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >hundreds.</hi> To complete the symbols for the nine digits, an additional
                    character wàs ^introduced in' each class. The mark' j,' ’called <hi
                    rend="italic">ep'isĉmon,</hi> was’ inserted among die units, immediately after
                    s, the letter denoting five; <hi rend="subscript"> qn</hi> j . , ∙S 91tfL ìĵflJí
                    ⅜ <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> * <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> 43 -y 10 ⅛¼9 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> *</p>
                <p>ana the <hi rend="italic">kοppa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sanpi,</hi>
                    represented by , 4 , or ⅛5 terminated respectively the range of <hi
                    rend="italic">tens</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">hundreds,</hi> or expressed
                    ninety and nine hundred. This arrangement' of the symbols, it is obvious, could
                    extend only to the expression of nine hundred and ninety-nine; but, by
                    subscribing an <hi rend="italic">iota</hi> under any character, the value was
                    augmented a thousand fold, or by writing the letter Μ, or the mark for a <hi
                    rend="italic">myriad,</hi> or ten thousand, under it, the effect was increased
                    ten times more. This last modification was sometimes more simply accomplished by
                    placing two dots over the character.</p>
                <p>Such is the beautiful system of Greek numerals, so vastly superior in clearness
                    and simplicity to the Roman combination of strokes. It was even tolerably fitted
                    as an instrument of calculation. Hence the Greeks early laid aside the use of
                    the <hi rend="italic">abacus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> while the Romans, who
                    never showed any taste for science, were confined, by the total inaptitude of
                    their numerical symbols, to the practice of the same laborious manipulation.</p>
                <p>It should, however, be remarked, that the Greeks distinguished the theory from
                    the practice of arithmetic, by separate names. The term <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arithmetic</hi> itself was restricted by them to the science which treats of
                    the nature and general properties of numbers; while the appellation <hi
                    rend="italic">Logistic</hi> was appropriated to the collection of rules framed
                    to direct and facilitate the common operations of calculation. The ancient
                    systems of arithmetic, accordingly; from the books of Euclid to the treatise of
                    Boethius and the verses or commentaries of Capella, are merely speculative, and
                    often abound with fanciful analogies. Pythagoras had brought from the East a
                    passion for the mystical properties of numbers, under the veil of which he
                    probably concealed some of his secret or esoteric doctrines. He regarded <hi
                    rend="italic">Numbers</hi> as of divine origin, the fountain of existence, and
                    the model and archetype of all things. He divided them into a variety of
                    different classes, to each of which were assigned distinct properties. They were
                    prime or composite, perfect or imperfect, redundant or deficient, plane or
                    solid; they were triangular, square, cubic, or pyramidal. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Even</hi> numbers were held by that visionary philosopher as feminine, and
                    allied to earth; but the <hi rend="italic">odd</hi> numbers were considered by
                    him as endued with masculine virtue, and partaking of the celestial nature. He
                    esteemed the <hi rend="italic">unit,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">monad,</hi> as
                    the most eminently sacred, and as the parent of all scientific numbers; he
                    viewed <hi rend="italic">two,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">duad,</hi> as the
                    associate of the <hi rend="italic">monad,</hi> and the mother of the elements;
                    and he regarded <hi rend="italic">three,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >triad,</hi> as perfect, being the first of the masculine numbers, comprehending
                    the beginning, middle, and end, and hence fitted to regulate by its combinations
                    the repetition of prayers and libations. As the <hi rend="italic">monad</hi>
                    represented the Divinity, or the Creative Power, so the <hi rend="italic"
                    >duad</hi> was the image of Matter; and the <hi rend="italic">triad,</hi>
                    resulting from their mutual conjunction, became the emblem of Ideal Forms.</p>
                <p>But the <hi rend="italic">tetrad,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">four,</hi> was the
                    number which Pythagoras affected to venerate the most. It is a square, and
                    contains within itself all the musical proportions, and exhibits by summation
                    all the digits as far as ten, the root of the universal scale of numeration; it
                    marks the seasons, the elements, and the successive ages of man; and it likewise
                    represents the cardinal virtues, and the opposite vices. The ancient division of
                    mathematical science into Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy, and Music, was
                    fourfold, and the course was therefore termed a <hi rend="italic">tetractys</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">quaternion.</hi> Hence, Dr Barrow would explain the oath
                    familiar to the disciples of Pythagoras, “I swear by him who communicated the
                    <hi rend="italic">TetractysT</hi><hi rend="italic">Five,</hi> or the <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Six,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">hextad,</hi> being composed
                    of its several factors, was reckoned perfect and analogical. It was likewise
                    valued as indicating the sides of the cube, and as entering into the composition
                    of other important numbers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Seven,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">heptad,</hi> formed from
                    the junction of the <hi rend="italic">triad</hi> with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tetrad,</hi> has been celebrated in every age. Being unproductive, it was
                    dedicated to the virgin Minerva, though possessed of a masculine character. It
                    marked the series oťthe lunar phases, the number of the planets, and seemed to
                    modify and pervade all nature.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Eight,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">octad,</hi> being the
                    first cube that occurred, was dedicated to Cybele, the mother of the gods, whose
                    image in the remotest times was only a cubical block of stone.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nine,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">ennead,</hi> was esteemed
                    as the square of the <hi rend="italic">triad.</hi> It denotes the number of the
                    Muses, and, being the last of the series of digits, and terminating the tones of
                    music, it was inscribed to Mars.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ten,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">deead,</hi> from the
                    important office which it performs in numeration, was, however, the most
                    celebrated for its properties. Having completed the cycle and begun a new series
                    of numbers, it was aptly styled <hi rend="italic">apoeatastasic</hi> or
                    periodic, and therefore dedicated to the double-faced Janus.</p>
                <p>The cube of the <hi rend="italic">triad,</hi> or the number <hi rend="italic"
                    >twenty-seven,</hi> expressing the time of the moon’s periodic revolution, was
                    supposed to signify the power of the lunar circle. The quaternion of celestial
                    numbers, <hi rend="italic">one, three, five,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >seven,</hi> joined to that of the terrestrial numbers <hi rend="italic">two,
                    four, six,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">eight,</hi> compose the number <hi
                    rend="italic">thirty-six,</hi> the square of the first perfect number <hi
                    rend="italic">six,</hi> and the symbol of the universe, distinguished by
                    wonderful properties.</p>
                <p>But it would be endless to recount all the visions of the Pythagorean school; nor
                    should we descend to notice such fancies, if, by a perpetual descent, the dreams
                    of ancient philosophers had not, in the actual state of society, still tinctured
                    our language, and mingled with the various institutions of civil life. Not to
                    wander in search of illustration, we see the predilection for the number <hi
                    rend="italic">seven</hi> strongly marked in the customary term of
                    apprenticeships, in the period required for obtaining academical degrees, and in
                    the legal age of majority.</p>
                <p>The Chinese appear, from the remotest epochs of their empire, to have entertained
                    the same admiration of the mystical properties of numbers that Pythagoras
                    imported from the East. Distinguishing numbers into even and odd, they
                    considered the former as terrestrial, and partaking of the feminine principle
                    <hi rend="italic">Yang</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> while they regarded the
                    latter as of celestial extraction, and endued with the masculine principle <hi
                    rend="italic">Yn.</hi> The even numbers were represented by small black circles,
                    and the odd ones by similar white circles, variously disposed, and connected by
                    straight lines. See Plate LXXVI. The sum of the five <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> even numbers <hi rend="italic">two, four, six, eight,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ten,</hi> being <hi rend="italic">thirty,</hi> was called the
                    number of the <hi rend="italic">Earth</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but the sum
                    of the five odd numbers <hi rend="italic">one, three, five, seven,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">nine,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">twenty-five,</hi> being the square
                    of∕⅛e, was styled the number of <hi rend="italic">Heaven.</hi> The nine digits
                    were likewise grouped in two different ways, termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lo-chou</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Ho-tou.</hi> The former expression
                    signifies the <hi rend="italic">Book of the River Lo,</hi> or what the great A u
                    saw delineated on the back of the mysterious tortoise which rose out of that
                    river: it may be conceived from this arrangement.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nine</hi><hi rend="italic">Four Two</hi><hi rend="italic">Three

                    rend="italic">Nine</hi> was reckoned the head, and <hi rend="italic">one</hi>
                    the tail, of the tortoise; <hi rend="italic">three</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >seven</hi> were considered as its left and' right shoulders; and <hi
                    rend="italic">four</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tιvo, eight</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">six,</hi> were viewed as the fore and the hind feet. The number
                    <hi rend="italic">five,</hi> which represented the heart, was also the emblem of
                    Heaven. We need scarcely observe, that this group of numbers is nothing but the
                    common <hi rend="italic">magic-square,</hi> each row of which makes up <hi
                    rend="italic">fifteen.</hi></p>
                <p>As the <hi rend="italic">Lo-chou</hi> had the figure of a square, so the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hο-tou</hi> had that of a cross. It is what the emperor Fou-hi
                    observed on the body of the horse-dragon which he saw spring out of the river
                    Ho. The central number was <hi rend="italic">ten,</hi> which, it is remarked by
                    the commentators, terminates all the operations on numbers.</p>

                <p>The Greek system of notation proceeded directly as far as <hi rend="italic">ten
                    thousand,</hi> comprising four terms of the <hi rend="italic">Denary
                    Scale</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but by subscribing Μ, the initial letter of
                    <hi rend="italic">μοpu,</hi> it was carried over another similar period to
                    signify <hi rend="italic">hundreds of millions.</hi> But the penetrating genius
                    of Archimedes quickly discerned the powers and unfolded the properties of such
                    progressions. In a curious tract, entitled <hi rend="italic">'i'αμμιτr</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">' or</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Arenarius,</hi> this philosopher amused himself with showing that it was
                    possible, assuming the estimation of Aristarchus of Samos, and other astronomers
                    of that age, to represent the number of particles of sand which would be
                    required to fill the sphere of the universe. He took the limit of the ordinary
                    numeral system, or <hi rend="italic">ten thousand times ten thousand,</hi> that
                    is, <hi rend="italic">an hundred millions,</hi> as the root of a new scale of
                    progression, which therefore advanced eight times faster than the simple denary
                    notation. Archimedes proposed to carry this comprehensive system as far as eight
                    periods, which would therefore correspond to a number expressed in our mode by
                    sixty-four digits. From the nature of a geometrical progression, he demonstrated
                    that proportional numbers would range at equal distances, and consequently that
                    the product of any two numbers must have its place determined by the sum of the
                    separate ranks,—a principle which involves the theory of logarithms.</p>
                <p>The fine speculation of the Sicilian philosopher does not, however, appear to
                    have been carried into effect; and without actually performing those
                    calculations, he contents himself by pointing out the process, and∙stating the»
                    approximate results. But Apollonius, the most ingenious and inventive, next to
                    Archimedes, of all the ancient mathematicians, resumed that scheme of
                    numeration, simplified the construction of the scale, and reduced it to a
                    commodious practice. For greater convenience, he preferred the simple myriad as
                    the root of the system, which, therefore, proceeded by successive periods,
                    corresponding to four of our digits. The periods were distinguished by breaks or
                    blanks. That most important office which, in the modern system of notation, the
                    cipher performs, by marking the rank of the digits, was indeed unknown to the
                    earlier Greeks. They were hence obliged, when the lower periods failed, to
                    repeat the letters Mu. or the contraction for <hi rend="italic">μνpa, ten
                    thousand.</hi> Thus, to express <hi rend="italic">thirty-four trillions,</hi>
                    they wrote λδ Mu. Mu. Mu. To signify wwito separately, it was customary with
                    them to prefix the mark M <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>. or the abbreviation
                    for <hi rend="italic">monad.</hi></p>
                <p>The procedure of the Greek arithmetician was necessarily slower and more timid
                    than our simple yet refined mode of calculation. Each step in the multiplication
                    of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193102542?mode=fullsize"

                    without any concentration which the moderns obtain, by carry-ĩ ıg forward the
                    multiples of ten, and blending together the different members of the product. In
                    ancient Greece, the operations of arithmetic, like writing, advanced from left
                    to right; each part of the multiplier was in succession combined with every part
                    of the multiplicand; and the several products were distinctly noted, or, for the
                    sake of compactness, grouped and conveniently dispersed till afterwards
                    collected into one general amount.</p>
                <p>Pappus of Alexandria, in his valuable <hi rend="italic">Mathematical
                    Collections,</hi> has preserved a set of rules which Apollonius had formed, for
                    facilitating arithmetical operations. These are, in the cautious spirit of the
                    ancient geometry, branched out into no fewer than twenty-seven propositions,
                    though all comprised in the principle formerly stated by Archimedes, That the
                    product of two integers of different ranks will occupy a rank corresponding to
                    the sum of the component orders. Suppose <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> were to be

                <p>. But the Greek notation was not adapted for the descending scale. To express
                    fractions, two distinct methods were followed. 1. If the numerator happened to
                    be unit, the denominator was indicated by an accent. Thus δ' signified <hi
                    rend="italic">one fourth,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">×ο</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">orn twenty-fifth</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but <hi rend="italic">one half</hi> being of most frequent recurrence,
                    was signified by a particular character, varying in its form, <hi rend="italic"
                    >C&gt;, A, C</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> f</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi>
                    or K. 2. In other cases it was the practice of the Greeks to write the
                    denominator as we do an exponent, a little above the denominator, and towards
                    the right hand. Thus, <hi rend="italic">β</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    ,α</hi><hi rend="italic">∙</hi> intimated <hi rend="italic">two-elevenths,</hi>

                    complicated, from the commentary which Eutocius of Ascalon wrote about the third

                <p>It is to be observed, that, to multiply the several integers by the fraction
                    nine-elevenths, amounts to their multiplication by .nine, and the subsequent
                    division by eleven. The excesses being <hi rend="italic">two</hi> and <hi

                <p>But the laborious operations that such complex fractions required were afterwards
                    superseded by the use of <hi rend="italic">sexagesimals,</hi> which, we have
                    already observed, the astronomers, and especially Ptolemy, had introduced. “The
                    division of the circumference of the circle into three hundred and sixty equal
                    parts or degrees was no doubt originally founded on the supposed length σf the
                    year, which, expressed in round numbers, consists of twelve months, each
                    composed of thirty days. The radius approaching to the sixth part of the
                    circumference would contain nearly sixty of those degrees; and after its ratio
                    to the circumference was more accurately determined, the radius still continued
                    to be distinguished into the same number of divisions, which likewise bore the
                    same name. As calcu-latĩon<pb break="no" facs="nls:193102555?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-2555-0538"/> now aimed at greater accuracy, each of these
                    sixty divisions of the radius was, following the uniform progression, again
                    subdivided into sixty equal portions called minutes; and, repeating the process
                    of sexagesimal subdivision, seconds and thirds were successively formed. The
                    operations with sexagesimal fractions were performed in the descending scale, on
                    a principle quite similar to that which Archimedes had before laid down. Each
                    period of the multiplier, still proceeding from the lefthand, was multiplied
                    into a period of the multiplicand; and this product was then thrown to a rank
                    depressed as much as the descents of both its factors. Thus, minutes multiplied
                    into seconds produced thirds; and seconds multiplied into thirds produced
                    fifths.” <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> vol. xviii. P∙ <hi

                <p>As an exemplification of this process, we shall take the question proposed by
                    Theon to find the square of the side of a regular decagon inscribed in a circle,
                    or the chord of <hi rend="italic">thirty-six</hi> degrees, which, according to
                    Ptolemy’s computation, measured, in sexagesimal parts of the radius, <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">fifty-five</hi> seconds. The multiplication is thus
                    effected:</p>

                    or <hi rend="italic">thirteen hundred and sixty-nine</hi> degrees; λζ into δ on
                    the next bar, gives <hi rend="italic">pμτ</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">

                    δ multiplied into δ, both of them oħ the bar of minutes, gives ∕≈r or <hi

                    or <hi rend="italic">two hundred and twenty</hi> thirds. Lastly, in the third
                    line the vs on the bar of seconds, multiplied successively into λζ. and <hi

                    the bars of seconds and thirds; and vs multiplied by itself gives yzε, or <hi
                    rend="italic">three thousand and twenty-five</hi> fourths. These several
                    products being reduced and collected together, formed the total amount of <hi
                    rend="italic">aτοε</hi> δ ∕δ <hi rend="italic">ι</hi> %s, or <hi rend="italic"

                    seconds were omitted in practice as insignificant.</p>
                <p>This calculation is laborious and intricate, yet with a very few terms it
                    approaches to a considerable degree of accuracy. One of the most elegant
                    theorems in elementary geometry demonstrates that the side of a regular decagon,
                    inscribed in a circle, is equal to the segment of the radius, divided in extreme
                    and mean ratio. Wherefore the square now computed should be equal to the product
                    of <hi rend="italic">sixty,</hi> or the radius, into <hi rend="italic"
                    >twenty-two</hi> degrees, <hi rend="italic">fifty-five</hi> minutes, and <hi
                    rend="italic">five</hi> seconds, the smaller segment; that is, equal to <hi
                    rend="italic">thirteen hundred</hi> and <hi rend="italic">seventy-five</hi>
                    degrees and <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> ∕‰e minutes, from which it differs only
                    by the defect of less than one minute.</p>
                <p>The Sexagesimal Arithmetic was, therefore, a most valuable improvement éngrafted
                    on the notation of the Greeks. The astronomers of Alexandria and Constanti nople
                    continued to employ it in all their calculations, and were afterwards imitated
                    by succeeding observers among the Arabians and Persians. The mode of working
                    sexagesimals had thus become generally known and reduced to practice; but we owe
                    the first distinct treatise on those fractions to a very extraordinary
                    character,—Barlaam, a Calabrian monk, the friend and Greek preceptor of the
                    famous Petrarch, and a man of learning and vigorous intellect, who laboured by
                    his writings and his missions to re-unite the Eastern to the Western church.
                    This adventurous personage, whose wayward conduct and dark features betrayed a
                    lurking ferocity, met with a most singular fate. Being overtaken by a tremendous
                    thunder-storm, while crossing the Adriatic Sea, he lashed himself to the mast of
                    the bark, and was, in this situation, struck dead by a flash of lightning. The
                    event happened in 1348; but Barlaam’s tract on sexagesimals, neatly composed in
                    six books, after the strict manner of the ancients, and entitled generally
                    Λ0y∕&lt;rm23, or <hi rend="italic">Computation,</hi> first appeared in a Latin
                    version at Strasburg in 1572, though not published complete with the Greek text
                    until the year 1600, when it was edited at Paris by Chambers of Eton, from a
                    manuscript procured from the Continent by the zeal of Sir Henry Savile. '</p>
                <p>To facilitate the operations with sexagesimals, it seemed indispensable to have a
                    more extensive multiplication table, that should include the mutual products of
                    all the numbers from one to sixty. This was actually constructed about the
                    middle of the sixteenth century by Philip Lansberg, a Dutch clergyman, and has
                    been exhibited since in various forms by Dr Wallis and others. In the mean time
                    a material change had been effected in the subdivision of the radius of the
                    circle, from which the sexagesimal system had taken its rise. Purbach, the great
                    restorer of mathematical science, instead of making the radius to consist of
                    216,000 seconds, as Ptolemy and succeeding astronomers had done, stopt short at
                    sixty degrees, and distinguished each of these by <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>
                    a repeated centesimal division, into ten thousand equal parts. Regiomontanus
                    advanced a step farther, and, rejecting the sexagesimal admixture, divided the
                    radius at once into a million of parts, thus following out an arrangement purely
                    decimal. The subdivision into degrees, minutes, and seconds, was henceforth
                    confined to the circumference itself; and when logarithms came afterwards to be
                    adapted to those fractions, they received the appellation, once general, though
                    now restricted, of <hi rend="italic">Logistic.</hi> But the sexagesimal
                    subdivision had nearly been rejected altogether. Our very meritorious countryman
                    Mr Briggs, in computing his canon of logarithms, followed in another branch the
                    example of Purbach, by distinguishing each degree of the circumference into <hi
                    rend="italic">an hundred</hi> minutes, and each of these again into <hi
                    rend="italic">an hundred</hi> seconds; and we cannot help regretting that this
                    easy and obvious improvement had not been generally embraced at the time it was
                    proposed. The French mathematicians have lately gone farther, and endeavoured to
                    pursue to its utmost extent the decimal subdivision first introduced by
                    Regiomontanus. They begin with dividing the quadrant into <hi rend="italic">an
                    hundred</hi> instead of ninety degrees; and then following the plan of Briggs,
                    they successively divide each degree into <hi rend="italic">an hundred</hi>
                    minutes, and each minute into <hi rend="italic">an hundred</hi> seconds. But the
                    advantages which might arise from the adoption of this plan are not sufficient
                    perhaps to outweigh the manifest inconvenience that must attend it in the
                    present advanced state of the science; and notwithstanding the sanguine dreams
                    of some of its projectors, we cannot indulge the expectation of ever seeing it
                    obtain a general and durable currency.</p>

                <p>ed by the ingenuity of Archimedes, Of Apollonius, and Ptolemy, had attained, on
                    the whole, to a singular degree of perfection, and was capable, notwithstanding
                    its cumbrous structure, of performing operations of very considerable difficulty
                    and magnitude. The great and radical defect of the system consisted in the want
                    of a general mark analogous to our cipher; and which, without having any value
                    itself, should serve to ascertain the rank or power of the other characters, by
                    filling up the vacant places in the scale of numeration. Yet were the Greeks not
                    altogether unacquainted with the use of such a sign; for Ptolemy, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Almagest,</hi> employs the small o to occupy the accidental blanks
                    which occurred in the notation of sexagesimals. This letter was perhaps chosen
                    by him, because immediately succeeding to <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> which
                    denotes 60, it could not, in the sexagesimal arrangement, occasion any sort of
                    ambiguity. But the advantage thence resulting was entirely confined to that
                    particular case. The letters, being ahead} significant, were generally
                    disqualified for the purpose of a mere supplementary notation; and the selection
                    of an alphabetic character to supply the place of the cipher may be considered
                    as an unfortunate circumstance, which appears to have arrested the progress
                    towards a better and more complete system. Had Apollonius classed the numerals
                    by denary triads instead of tetrads, he would have greatly simplified the
                    arrangement, and avoided the confusion arising from the admixture of the
                    punctuated letters expressing thousands. It is by this method of proceeding with
                    periods of three figures, or advancing at once by thousands instead of tens,
                    that we are enabled most expeditiously to read off the largest numbers. The
                    extent of the alphabet was favourable to the first attempts at enumeration;
                    since, with the help of three intercalations, it furnished characters for the
                    whole range below a thousand; but that very circumstance in the end proved a bar
                    to future improvements. It would have been a most important stride to have next
                    exchanged those triads into monads, by discarding the letters expressive of tens
                    and hundreds, and retaining only the first class, which, with its inserted <hi
                    rend="italic">episemon,</hi> should denote the nine digits. The <hi
                    rend="italic">icta,</hi> which signified ten, now losing its force, might have
                    been employed as a convenient substitute for the cypher. By such progressive
                    changes the arithmetical notation of the Greeks would at last have reached its
                    utmost perfection, and have exactly resembled our own. A wide interval no doubt
                    did still remain; yet the genius of that acute people, had it continued
                    unfettered, would in time, we may presume, have triumphantly passed the
                    intervening boundaries. But the death of Ptolemy was succeeded by ages of
                    languor and decline; and the spirit of discovery insensibly evaporated in
                    miserable polemical disputes, till the fair establishment of Alexandria was
                    finally overwhelmed under the irresistible arms of the Arabs, lately roused to
                    victory and conquest by the enthusiasm of a <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> new

                    xviii. p. 203.)</p>
                <p>The ingenuity and varied resources of the ancient Greeks were the main causes
                    which diverted them from discovering our simple denary system. Having attained a
                    distinct conception oι the powers of the geometrical progression, and even
                    advanced so far as to employ their small o to fill the breaks of a period,
                    nothing seemed wanting but to dismiss the punctuated letters, and those for tens
                    and for hundreds, and to retain merely the direct symbols for units, that is,
                    the first third part of their alphabet. Here, however, those masters of science
                    were stopt in their career; and the Eastern Empire presents a melancholy picture
                    of the decline and corruption of human nature. Ingenuity had degenerated into
                    polemical subtlety, and the manly virtues which freedom inspires " <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> ere exchanged for meanness and self-abasement.</p>
                <p>'Some writers, misled by wery superficial views of the subject, have yet ascribed
                    the invention of the modern numeral characters to the Greeks, or even to the
                    Romans. Both these people, for the sake of expedition, occasionally used
                    contractions, especially in representing the numbers and fractions of weights or
                    measures, which, to a credulous peruser of mutilated inscriptions, or ancient
                    blurred manuscripts, might appear to resemble the forms of our ciphers. But this
                    resemblance is merely casual, and very far indeed from indicating the adoption
                    of a regular denary notation. The most contracted of the Roman writings was
                    formed by the marks attributed to Tiro or Seneca, while that of the Greeks was
                    mixed with the symbols called <hi rend="italic">Siglae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> both of which have exercised the patience and skill of antiquaries and
                    diplomatists. In the latter species of characters were kept the accounts of the
                    revenues of the empress Irene at Constantinople. But the modern Greeks appear
                    likewise to have sometimes used a simpler kind of marks, at least for the low
                    numbers. The continuator of Matthew Paris’s <hi rend="italic">History</hi>
                    relates, that “in the year 1251 died John Basingstoke, archdeacon of Leicester,
                    who brought into England the numeral figures of the Greeks, and explained them
                    to his friends.” It is subjoined that they consisted of a perpendicular stroke,
                    with a short line inserted at different heights and at different angles,
                    signifying units on the left and tens on the right side. The figures themselves
                    are scrawled on the margin of the text; but they are evidently so different in
                    their form, and so distinct in their nature, from the modern ciphers, that one
                    cannot help feeling surprise to see an author of any discernment refer the
                    introduction of the latter to Basingstoke.</p>
                <p>It cannot be doubted that we derived our knowledge of the numeral digits from the
                    Arabians, who had themselves obtained this invaluable acquisition from their
                    extended communication with the East. Those deserving people who, under the name
                    of Moors or Saracens, had for many centuries cultivated Spain, were most ready
                    to acknowledge their obligation to the natives of India, who, according to
                    Alsephadi, a learned Arabian doctor, boasted of three very different
                    inventions—the composition of the <hi rend="italic">.Golaila Wadamna,</hi> or
                    Pilpa∕s Fables—the game of chess—and the nine digital characters. Still much
                    obscurity hangs over the whole subject. Two distinct inquiries naturally present
                    themselves :—1, At what period did the Arabians first become acquainted with
                    those characters; and, 2, What is the precise epoch when the knowledge of them
                    was imparted to the Christian nations of Europe. We shall take a short review of
                    both these questions.</p>
                <p>1. Gatterer, the late ingenious and very learned Professor of History at
                    Göttingen, in his <hi rend="italic">Elements of Universal Diplomacy,</hi>
                    maintains that our ciphers were only primordial letters, invented by Taaut or
                    Theut, and known to the ancient Egyptians and Phoenicians, being still
                    distinctly observed, as he asserts, in the inscriptions painted on the coverings
                    of the oldest mummies; and that afterwards, along with other branches of
                    science, they passed to the Oriental nations, among whom they were preserved,
                    till the victorious arms of the Mussulmen penetrated to India, and brought back
                    those precious monuments of genius. But we cannot believe that a contrivance so
                    very simple, and so eminently useful, as that of the nine digits, if once
                    communicated, could ever again be lost or neglected. Pythagoras and Boethius
                    merely contemplated the properties of numbers, and seem not, in their
                    calculations, to have gone beyond the use of the <hi rend="italic">Abacus.</hi>
                    An early intercourse had no doubt subsisted between the people of Egypt and of
                    India, and a striking resemblance may be traced in their customs, their
                    buildings, and their <pb break="no" facs="nls:193102581?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-2581-0540"/> religious rites. But the characters exhibited on
                    the Egyptian monuments bear no indication of the <hi rend="italic">Denary
                    System,</hi> and are, like the Roman and Chinese numerals, abridged
                    representations of objects, rather than arbitrary signs.</p>
                <p>That the occupiers of Hindostan, and the nations communicating with them, have
                    for ages been acquainted with the use of the denary notation, cannot be
                    disputed. But was this an original discovery, or at what distant epoch was it
                    first introduced among them? The easy credulity of European visitors encouraged
                    the Brahmins to set up very lofty pretensions respecting the antiquity of their
                    science. Among other treasures, they boasted the possession, from time
                    immemorial, of an elementary treatise on arithmetic and mensuration, composed in
                    Sanscrit, and called <hi rend="italic">Lilawati,</hi> of such inestimable value
                    as to be ascribed to the immediate inspiration of heaven. But the researches of
                    our ingenious countrymen in exploring that sacred language of India have
                    dispelled some illusions, and greatly abated the admiration of the public for
                    such eastern learning. From what we have been able to gather, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lilawati</hi> is a very short and meagre performance, loaded with
                    a silly preamble and colloquy of the gods. It begins with the numeration by nine
                    digits, and the supplementary cipher or small o, in what are called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Devanagari</hi> characters; and it contains the common rules of
                    arithmetic, and even the extraction of the square root, as far as two places of
                    figures; but the examples are generally very easy, scarcely forming any part of
                    the text, and only written on the margin with red ink. Of fractions, whether
                    decimal or vulgar, it treats not at all.</p>
                <p>The Hindoos pretend that this arithmetical treatise was composed about the year
                    1185 of the Christian era. The date of a manuscript, however, is always very
                    uncertain. We know, besides, that the oriental transcriber is accustomed to
                    incorporate without scruple such additions in the text aś he thinks fit. Nor
                    will any of the criteria which might ascertain the age of a manuscript apply to
                    the eastern writings, where the composition of the paper, the colour of the ink,
                    and the form of the characters, have for ages continued unchanged.</p>
                <p>If the exuberant fancy of the Greeks led them far beyond the denary notation, it
                    seems probable that the feebler genius of the Hindoos might just reach that
                    desirable point, without diverging into an excursive flight. Though now familiar
                    with that system, they are still unacquainted with the use of its descending
                    decimal scale; and their management of fractions, accordingly, is said by
                    intelligent judges to be tedious and embarrassed. In Plate LXXVI. (on the left
                    hand, and near the bottom), we have given the Sanscrit digits, and have placed
                    over them the numeral elements from which they might be formed. These consist of
                    a succession of simple strokes, variously combined as far as nine. The
                    resemblance to the <hi rend="italic">Devanagari</hi> characters appears very
                    striking. From these, again, the common Hindoo and the vulgar Bengalee digits
                    are evidently moulded, with only slight alterations of figure. The Birman
                    numerals, which we have copied from Symes s <hi rend="italic">Embassy to tlιe
                    Kingdom of Ava,</hi> are manifestly of the same origin; only they have a thin,
                    wirey body, being generally written on the palmyra-leaf with the point of a
                    needle.</p>
                <p>It appears, from a careful inspection of the manuscripts preserved in the
                    different public libraries of Europe, that the Arabians were not acquainted with
                    the denary numerals before the middle oí the thirteenth century of the Christian
                    era. They cultivated the mathematical sciences with ardour, but seldom aspired
                    at original efforts, and generally contented themselves with copying their
                    Grecian masters. -The alphabet of the Arabians had been -employed for expressing
                    numbers exactly in the same way as that of the Greeks. The letters, in their
                    succession,' were sometimes applied to signify the lower of the ordinal numbers;
                    but more generally they were distinguished into three classes, each composed of
                    nine characters, corresponding to units, tens, and hundreds. Though, like most
                    of the Oriental nations, the Arabians write from right to left, yet they
                    followed implicitly the Greek mode of ranging the numerals and performing their
                    calculations. With the same deference they received the other lessons of their
                    great masters, and very seldom hazarded any improvement, unless where industry
                    and patient observation led them incidentally to extend mensuration, and to
                    rectify and enlarge the basis of astronomy.</p>
                <p>It seems highly probable, therefore, that the Arabians did not adopt the Indian
                    numerals until a late period, and after the torrent of victory had opened an
                    easy communication with Hindostan. They might derive their information through
                    the medium of the Persians, who spoke a dialect of their language, had embraced
                    the same religion, and were, like them, inflamed by the love of science and the
                    spirit of conquest. The Arabic numerals, accordingly, resemble exceedingly the
                    Persic, which are now current over India, and there esteemed the fashionable
                    characters. But the Persians themselves, though no longer the sovereigns of
                    Hindostan, yet display their superiority over the feeble Gentoos, since they
                    generally fill the offices of the revenue, and have the reputation of being the
                    most expert calculators in the East. It should be observed, however, that,
                    according to Gladwin, these accountants have introduced a peculiar contracted
                    mode of registering very large sums, partly by the numeral characters, and
                    partly by means of symbols formed of abbreviated words. Yet Sir John Chardin
                    relates that the Persians have no proper terms to express numbers beyond a
                    thousand, which they merely repeat, as our young arithmeticians often do, to
                    signify a million or a billion.</p>
                <p>The Indian origin of the denary numerals is farther confirmed by the testimony of
                    Maximus Planudes, a monk of Constantinople, who wrote, about the middle of the
                    fourteenth century,·a book on practical arithmetic, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Αογιΰτικη</hi><hi rend="italic">Ivδ∕xη,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Υηpopοpa xaτ
                    Xvδaς,</hi><hi rend="italic">η λίγομινη μίγαλη,</hi> that is, “the great Indian
                    mode of calculating.” In his introduction he explains concisely the use of the
                    characters in notation. But Planudes appears neither to have received his
                    information directly from India, nor through the medium of the Persians, the
                    nearest neighbours on the eastern confines of the Greek empire. It is most
                    probable that he was made acquainted with those numerals by his intercourse with
                    Europe, having twice visited, on a sort of embassy, the Republic of Venice; for,
                    of two manuscripts preserved in the library of St Mark, the one has the
                    characters of the Arabians, and the other has that variety which was first
                    current in Europe, while neither of them shows the original characters used in
                    Hindostan.</p>
                <p>2. But the most important inquiry is to ascertain the ' period at which the
                    knowledge pf our present numeralsţ was first spread over Europe. As it certainly
                    had pre- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ceded the invention of the art of
                    printing, the difficulty of resolving the question is much increased by the
                    necessity of ιearching and examining old and often doubtful manuscripts. Some
                    authors would date the introduction of those ciphers as early as the beginning
                    of the eleventh century, while others, with far greater appearance of reason,
                    are disposed to place it 250 years later. <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi></p>
                <p>While the thickest darkness brooded over the Christian world, the Arabians,
                    reposing after their brilliant conquests, cultivated with assiduity the learning
                    and science of Greece. If they contributed little from their own <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193102594?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-2594-0541"/> store of
                    genius, they yet preserved and fanned the holy fire. Nor did they affect any
                    eoneealment, but would freely communicate to their pupils and visitors that
                    precious knowledge whieh they had so zealously drawn from different quarters.
                    Some of the more aspiring youth in England and Franee, disgusted with the
                    wretehed trifling of the schools, resorted for information to Spain; and having
                    the eourage to subdue the rooted abhorrenee entertained in that age against
                    infidels, took lessons in philosophy from the accomplished Moors. Among those
                    pilgrims of seienee, the most celebrated was Gerbert, a monk, born of obscure
                    parents, at Aurillae, in Auvergne, but promoted by his talents successively to
                    the bishopries of Rheims and of Ravenna, and finally raised to the papal chair,
                    which he filled during the last four years of the tenth century, under the name
                    of Sylvester II. This ardent genius studied arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy
                    among the Saraeens; and, on his return to France, charged with various
                    knowledge, he was esteemed a prodigy of learning by his contemporaries. Nor did
                    the maliee of rivals fail to represent him as a magieian, leagued with the
                    infernal powers. Gerbert wrote largely on arithmetic and geometry, and gave
                    rules for shortening the operations of the <hi rend="italic">Abacus,</hi> which
                    hë likewise termed <hi rend="italic">Algorismus.</hi> In some manuscripts the
                    numbers are expressed in ciphers; but we are not thenee entitled to infer, as
                    many writers have done, that he had actually the merit of introducing those
                    characters into Europe. The context of his discourse will not support such a
                    conclusion. The figures were not, we have seen, still known to the Arabians
                    themselves; and must have long afterwards been inserted in those copies for the
                    convenience of transcribers.</p>
                <p>Nor can we safely refer the introduction of Arabic figures to our famous Roger
                    Bacon, whose various attainments and unwearied research after genuine knowledge
                    raised him far above the level of his contemporaries, but who, to the disgrace
                    of his age and country, suffered a sharp persecution and a tedious imprisonment,
                    on the ridiculous charge of practising the redoubted acts of magie. But the
                    writings of Bacon really discover no proofs of his acquaintance with the denary
                    notation; and the faet commonly stated as an irresistible evidenee in his favour
                    bears a very different interpretation. An almanaek, now preserved in the
                    Bodleian Library at Oxford, and containing numerals in their earliest forms,
                    has, by the credulity of after-times, been, with all other feats and inventions,
                    ascribed of course to the great neeromancer. But unluckily this production is
                    marked with the date 1292, the very year on which Bacon, after a lingering
                    illness, expired; and it besides professes to have been calculated for the
                    meridian of Toulouse, and had consequently been imported without doubt from
                    France.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Nothing appears
                    to be worse founded than the attempts to represent the elder Bacon in the light
                    of an original inventor. Notwithstanding the obscurity of his writings, it needs
                    but a little criticism to dispel the conceits fomented by national partiality.
                    Friar Bacon advances no claim even to the discovery of gunpowder, which has been
                    so gratuitously ascribed to him. On the contrary, he admits that the boys in his
                    time were acquainted with the use of this substance in fire-works; and he merely
                    pretends, in a sort of anagram, to give a receipt for making it stronger and
                    better than ordinary.</p><p>After the chief ingredient in the composition of
                    gunpowder, under the mistaken names of <hi rend="italic">ηαtrοη</hi> or <hi

                    the intervention of the Crusaders, its disposition to explode in the contact of
                    inflammable matters, if not communicated along with it, could not remain for any
                    time a secret. The explosive force was a very-different and a far more important
                    property, which is perhaps rightly attributed to Schwartz, a German monk, who,
                    in the course of his experiments, stumbled on it about the middle of the
                    fourteenth century.</p></note></p>
                <p>About the same period John of Halifax, named, in the quaint Latinity then used,
                    <hi rend="italic">Sacro-Eosco,</hi> who had likewise travelled, wrote his
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">De Sphoera,</hi> in some eopies of which the numbers
                    are given in ciphers. But it appears from examination that sueh abbreviations
                    were introduced by the license of transcribers.</p>
                <p>There is little doubt that the Arabie figures were first used by astronomers, and
                    afterwards circulated in the almanacks over Europe. The learned Gerard Vossius'
                    places this epoeh about the year 1250; but the judicious and most laborious Du
                    Cange thinks that ciphers were unknown before the fourteenth eentury; and Father
                    Mabillon, whose diplomatic researches are immense, assures us that he very
                    rarely found them in the dates of any writings prior to the year 1400. Kircher,
                    with some air of probability, seeks to refer the introduction of our numerals to
                    the astronomical tables whieh, after vast labour and expense, were published by
                    the famous Alphonse, king of Castile, in 1252, and again more correctly four
                    years afterwards. But it is suspected that, in the original work, the numbers
                    were expressed in Roman or Saxon characters. Two letters from that enlightened
                    but ill-requited prinee, to our Edward I., which are preserved in the Tower of
                    London, have the dates 1272 and 1278 still denoted by those aneient
                    characters.</p>
                <p>In the tenth volume of the <hi rend="italic">Archoeologia,</hi> the Rev. Mr North
                    has given a short account of an almanack preserved in the library of Bennet
                    College, Cambridge, and containing a table of eelipses for the eycle between
                    1330 and 1348. There is prefixed to it a very brief explication of the use of
                    numerals, and the principles of the denary notation; from whieh we may see how
                    imperfectly the praetiee of those ciphers was then understood. The figures are
                    of the oldest form, but differ not materially from the present, except that the
                    four has a looped shape, and the five and seven are turned about to the left and
                    to the right. The one, two, three, and four, are likewise, perhaps for
                    elucidation, represented by so many dots thus, . .. .’. .’ I; while five, six,
                    seven, and eight, are signified by a semicircle or inverted ø with the addition
                    of corresponding dots—ø. ø: 0 Nine is denoted by o; ten by the same character
                    with a dash drawn across it; and twenty, thirty, or forty, by this last symbol
                    repeated.</p>
                <p>As a farther evidence of the inaccurate conceptions whieh prevailed respecting
                    the use of the digits in the fourteenth century, we may refer to the mixture of
                    Saxon and Arabic numerals whieh was eopied from some Freneh manuscripts by
                    Mabillon, as exhibited in Plate LXXVI. The Saxon χ, signifying ten, is
                    repeatedly combined with the ordinary figures; and χχχ, XXXJ, are immediately
                    followed by 302, and 303, whieh must have been therefore intended to signify <hi
                    rend="italic">thirty-two</hi> and <hi rend="italic">thirty-three,</hi> the force
                    of the eipher not being still rightly understood. It should be observed, that
                    the Greek <hi rend="italic">episêmon</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Fau,</hi> for the
                    number <hi rend="italic">six,</hi> had eome to be represented by a character
                    similar to G. The Saxon dates are taken from the Danish and Norwegian registers,
                    preserved in Suhm’s <hi rend="italic">Northern Collections.</hi></p>
                <p>One of the oldest authentic dates in the numeral characters is that of the year
                    1375, which appears written by the hand of the famous Petrareh on a eopy of St
                    Augustine that had belonged to that distinguished poet and philosopher. The use
                    of those characters had now begun to spread in Europe, but was still confined to
                    men of learning. We have seen a short tract in the German language, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">De Algorismo,</hi> and bearing the date 1390, which explained with
                    great brevity the digital notation <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193102607?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-2607-0542"/> and the ' ei
                    erben tary'rules óf arithmetic. What is very remarkable, the characters in their
                    earliest form are ranged thus, 0, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, from right to left,
                    the order which the Arabians would naturally follow. But it was not very easy to
                    comprehend at first the precise force of the <hi rend="italic">cipher,</hi>
                    which, insignificant by itself, only serves to determine the rank and value of
                    the other digits. The name, derived from an Arabic word signifying <hi
                    rend="italic">vacuity,</hi> is sufficiently expressive; yet a sort of mystery,
                    which has imprinted its trace on language, seemed to hang over the practice, for
                    we still speak of <hi rend="italic">deciphering,</hi> and of <hi rend="italic"
                    >writing in cipher,</hi> in allusion to some dark or concealed art. After the
                    digits had come to supply the place of the Roman numerals, a very considerable
                    time probably elapsed before they were generally adopted in calculation. The
                    modern practice of arithmetic was unknown in England till about the middle of
                    the sixteenth century. But the lower orders, imitating the clerks of a former
                    age, were still accustomed to reckon with their <hi rend="italic">counters</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">awgrym stones.</hi> In Shakspeare’s comedy of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Winter s Tale,'</hi> written at the commencement of the
                    seventeenth century, the clown, staggered with a very simple multiplication,
                    exclaims, that he will try it with counters. .</p>
                <p>Arithmetic was long considered in England as a higher branch of science, and
                    therefore left, like Geometry, to be studied at the university. Most of the
                    public or grammar schools of the south were, on the suppression of the
                    monasteries, erected a little after the Reformation, during the short but
                    auspicious reign of Edward VI. They were accordingly destined by their founders
                    merely for teaching the dead languages; and the too exclusive pursuit of the
                    same system is now one of the greatest defects in the English plan of liberal
                    education.</p>
                <p>It cannot be doubted that the calendars composed in France or Germany, and sent
                    to the different religious houses, were the means of dispersing the knowledge of
                    Arabic numerals over Europe. The library of the University of Edinburgh has a
                    very curious almanack, presented to it, with a number of other valuable tracts,
                    by the celebrated Drummond of Hawthornden, beautifully written on vellum, with
                    most of the figures in vermillion. It is calculated especially for the year
                    1482, but contains the succession of lunar phases for three cycles, 1475, 1494,
                    and 1513, with the visible eclipses of the sun and moon from 1482 to 1530
                    inclusive. The date of this precious manuscript, which had once belonged to St
                    Mary’s Abbey at Cupar in Angus, is easily determined, and we have copied from it
                    the oldest numerals exhibited in Plate LXXVI. To these we have subjoined <hi
                    rend="italic">fac-similés</hi> from Caxton’s <hi rend="italic">Mirrour of the

                <p>The college accounts in the English universities were generally kept in the Roman
                    numerals till the early part of the sixteenth century; nor in the parish
                    registers were the Arabic characters adopted before the year 1600. The oldest
                    date which we have met with in Scotland is that of 1490, which occurs in the
                    rent-roll of the diocese of St Andrews; the change from Roman to Arabic numerals
                    occurring, with a corresponding alteration in the form of the writing, near the
                    end of the volume. The old characters in Plate LXXVI. are copied from a
                    manuscript his tory of the Scotish Bishoprics, apparently written about the year
                    1550, and now in the possession of Thomas Thomson, Esq. advocate.<note

                    have often suffered themselves to be grossly misled. Thus, Mr Be Carαonnel, a
                    respectable author, who has given views and short descriptions of the ancient
                    edifices in Scotland, mentions, without marking the smallest doubt or surprise,
                    that the date 1155 appears over the gateway of the ruins of the Castle of St
                    Andrews. But this Iront was built subsequent to the murder of the detested
                    Cardinal Beaton, by Archibald Hamilton, who likewise there affixed į <hi
                    rend="superscript"> s</hi> arms, but who Jong afterwards, on the capture of
                    Dumbarton Castle, suffered an ignominious death, for his adherence to Queen <hi

                <p>The first elements of arithmetic are acquired during our infancy. The idea of <hi
                    rend="italic">one</hi> is the simplest of any, and is suggested by every single
                    object. <hi rend="italic">Two</hi> is formed by placing one object near another;
                    <hi rend="italic">three, four,</hi> and every higher number, by adding one
                    continually to the former collection. As we thus advance from lower numbers to
                    higher, we soon perceive that there is no limit to this increasing operation;
                    and that, whatever number of objects be collected together, more may be added,
                    at least in imagination; so that we can never reach the highest possible number,
                    nor approach near it. The idea of numbers, which is first acquired by the
                    observation of sensible objects, is afterwards extended to measures of space and
                    time, affections of the mind, and other immaterial qualities.</p>
                <p>Small numbers are most easily apprehended: a child soon knows what <hi
                    rend="italic">two</hi> and what <hi rend="italic">three</hi> is, but has not any
                    distinct notion of <hi rend="italic">seventeen.</hi> Experience removes this
                    difficulty in some degree: as we become accustomed to handle larger collections,
                    we apprehend clearly the number of a dozen or a score; but perhaps could hardly
                    advance to a hundred without the aid of systematic arrangement, which is the art
                    of forming so many units into a class, and so many of these classes into one of
                    a higher kind, and thus advancing through as many ranks of classes as occasion
                    requires. If a boy arrange an hundred stones in one row, he would be tired
                    before he could reckon them; but if he place them in ten rows of ten stones
                    each, he will reckon an hundred with ease; and if he collect ten such parcels,
                    he will reckon a thousand. In this case, ten is the lowest class, a hundred is a
                    class of the second rank, and a thousand is a class of the third rank.</p>
                <p>. There does not seem to be any number naturally adapted for constituting a class
                    of the lowest or any higher rank, to the exclusion of others. However, as ten
                    has been universally used for this purpose by the Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, and
                    Arabians, and by all nations who have cultivated this science, it is probably
                    the most convenient for general use; but other scales may be assumed, perhaps,
                    on some occasions with superior advantage; and the principles of arithmetic will
                    appear in their full extent, if the student can adapt them to any scale
                    whatever. Thus, if eight were the scale, 6 times 3 would be two classes and two
                    units, and the number 18 would then be represented by 22. If 12 were the scale,
                    5 times 9 would be three classes and nine units, and 45 would be represented by
                    39.</p>
                <p>Whatever number of units constitutes a class of the lower rank, the same number
                    of each class should make one of the next higher. This is observed in our
                    arithmetic, ten being the universal scale; but it is not regarded in the various
                    kinds of monies, weights, and the like, which do not advance by any universal
                    measure; and much of the difficulty in the practice of arithmetic arises from
                    that irregularity.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193102620?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-2620-0543"/>
                <p>As higher numbers are somewhat difficult to apprehend, we naturally fall on
                    contrivances to fix them in our minds, and render them familiar; but
                    notwithstanding all the ex- <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> pedients we can fall
                    upon, our ideas of high numbers are still imperfect, and generally far short of
                    the reality; and though we can perform any computation with exactness, the
                    answer we obtain is often incompletely apprehended.</p>
                <p>It may not be amiss to illustrate, by a few examples, the extent of numbers which
                    are frequently named without being attended to. If a person employed in telling
                    money reckon an hundred pieces in a minute, and continue at work ten hours each
                    day, he will take seventeen days to reckon a million; a thousand men would take
                    45 years to reckon a billion. If we supposed the whole earth to be as well
                    peopled as Britain, and to have been so from the creation, and that the whole
                    race of mankind had constantly spent their time in telling from a heap
                    consisting of a quadrillion of pieces, they would hardly have yet reckoned the
                    thousandth part of that quantity.</p>
                <p>Ail numbers are represented by the ten following characters.</p>
                <p>123 4567 8 9 0</p>
                <p>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, cipher.</p>
                <p>The nine first are called <hi rend="italic">significant figures,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">digits</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and sometimes represent units,
                    sometimes tens, hundreds, or higher classes. When placed singly, they denote the
                    simple numbers subjoined to the characters; when several are placed together,
                    the first or right-hand figure only is to be taken for its simple value; the
                    second signifies so many tens, the third so many hundreds, and the others so
                    many higher classes, according to the order they stand in. And as it may
                    sometimes be required to express a number consisting of tens, hundreds, or
                    higher classes, without any units or classes of a lower rank annexed, and as
                    this can only be done by figures standing in the second, third, or higher
                    places, while there are none to fill up the lower ones; therefore an additional
                    character or cipher (0) is necessary, which has no signification when placed by
                    itself, but serves to supply the vacant places, and bring the figures to their
                    proper station.</p>

                    left hand, and read the figures in their order, with the names of their places,
                    from the table. In writing any number, we must be careful to mark the figures in
                    their proper places, and supply the vacant places with ciphers.</p>
                <p>As there are no possible ways of changing numbers, except by enlarging or
                    diminishing them according to some given rule, it follows that the whole art of
                    arithmetic is comprehended in two operations, <hi rend="italic">Addition</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Subtraction.</hi> However, as it is frequently required to
                    add several equal numbers together, or to subtract several equal ones from a
                    greater, till it be exhausted, proper methods have been invented for
                    facilitating the operation in these cases, and distinguished by the names of <hi
                    rend="italic">Multiplication ĩenà Division</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    these four rules are the foundation of all arithmetical operations
                    whatever.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>To abbreviate,
                    it is sometimes convenient to indicate the four operations of arithmetic by the
                    signs+,—, ×, ÷∙ The first, +,denotes addition; the second, —, indicates
                    subtraction; the third, ×, multiplication; and the fourth, -÷- division. The
                    sign = put between twö quantities indicates that they are equal. Accordingly we
                    may write 2 + 3 = 5; 7 — 3 = 4; 5×3=15; 14 +-2 = 7∙</p></note></p>
                <p>As the idea of number is acquired by observing several objects collected, so is
                    that of fractions by observing an object divided into several parts. As we
                    sometimes meet with objects broken into two, three, or more parts, we may
                    consider any or all of these divisions promiscuously, which is done in the
                    doctrine of vulgar fractions. However, since the practice of collecting units
                    into parcels of tens has prevailed universally, it has been found convenient to
                    follow a like method in the consideration of fractions, by dividing each unit
                    into ten equal parts, and each of these into ten smaller parts; and so on.
                    Numbers divided in this manner are called <hi rend="italic">Decimal
                    Fractions.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> II.— <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Addition.</hi></p>
                <p>Addition is that operation by which we find the amount of two or more numbers.
                    The method of doing this in simple cases is obvious, as soon as the meaning of
                    number is known, and admits of no illustration. A young learner will begin at
                    one of the numbers, and reckon up as many units separately as there are in the
                    other, and practice will enable him to do it at once. It is impossible, strictly
                    speaking, to add more than two numbers at a time. We must first find the sum of
                    the first and second, then we add the third to that number, and so on. However,
                    as the several sums obtained are easily retained in the memory, it is neither
                    necessary nor usual to mark them down. When the numbers consist of more figures
                    than one, we add the units together, the tens together, and so on. But if the
                    sum of the units exceed ten, or contain ten several times, we add the number of
                    tens it contains to the next column, and only set down the number of units that
                    are over. In like manner we carry the tens of every column to the next higher.
                    And the reason of this is obvious from the value of the places; since an unit,
                    in any higher place, signifies the same thing as ten in the place' immediately
                    lower.</p>

                    Then reckon the amount of the right-hand column. If</hi> 123467 <hi
                    rend="italic">it be under ten, marh it down. If it exceed ten,</hi> 314213 <hi

                    rend="italic">down the full</hi> 279654 <hi rend="italic">sum of the left-hand

                <p>24433</p>
                <p>As it is of great consequence in business to perform addition readily and
                    exactly, the learner ought to practise it till it become quite familiar. If the
                    learner can readily add any two digits, he will soon add a digit to a higher
                    number with equal ease. It is only to add the unit‘place <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193102633?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-2633-0544"/> of that number
                    to the digit; and if it exceed ten, it raises 'the amount accordingly. Thus,
                    because 8 and 6 are 14, 48 and 6 are 54. It will be proper to mark down under
                    the sums of each column, in a small hand, the figure that is carried to the
                    nextcolumn. This prevents the trouble of going over the whole operation again,
                    in case of interruption or mistake. If you wish to keep the account clean, mark
                    down the sum and figure you carry on a separate paper, and after revising them,
                    transcribe the sum only. After some practice, we ought to acquire the habit of
                    adding two or more figures at one glance. This is particularly useful when two
                    figures which amount to 10, as 6 and 4, or 7 and 3, stand together in the
                    column.</p>
                <p>Every operation in arithmetic ought to be revised, to prevent mistakes; and as
                    one is apt to fall into the same mistake, if he revise it in the same manner he
                    performed it, it is proper either to alter the order, or else to trace back the
                    steps by which the operation advanced, which will lead us at last to the number
                    we began with. Every method of proving accounts may be referred to one or other
                    of these heads.</p>
                <p>1st, Addition may be proved by any of the following methods: Repeat the
                    operation, beginning at the top of the column, if you began at the foot when you
                    wrought it.</p>
                <p>2d Divide the account into several parts; add these separately, and then add the
                    sums together. If their amount correspond with the sum of the account when added
                    at once, it may be presumed right. This method is particularly proper when you
                    want to know the sums of the parts as well as that of the whole.</p>
                <p>3d Subtract the numbers successively from the sum; if the account be right, you
                    will exhaust it exactly, and find no remainder.</p>
                <p>When the given number consists of articles of different value, as pounds,
                    shillings, and pence, or the like, which are called <hi rend="italic">different
                    denominations,</hi> the operations in arithmetic must be regulated by the value
                    of the articles. We shall give here a few of the most useful tables.</p>

                    carry to the higher denomination, by the number of tens that it contains of the
                    lower. For example, in adding shillings, carry by 10 from the units to the tens,

                    the higher that sum contains, and carry accordingly, and mark the remainder, if
                    any, under the column. For example, if the sum of a column of pence be 43, which
                    is three shillings and sevenpence, mark 7 under the pence column, and carry 3 to

                    excess of the number reckoned above the value of the denomination. The number of
                    dots shows how many are carried, and the last reckoned number is placed under

                    subtraction. Thus, in subtracting pence, we add 12 pence when necessary to the

                <p><hi rend="italic">Note</hi> 2. When there are two places in the same
                    denomination, if the next higher contain exactly so many tens, it is best to
                    subtract the units first, borrowing ten when necessary; and then subtract the
                    tens, borrowing, if there is occasion, according to the number of tens in the
                    higher denomination.</p>

                    order of proceeding, and gives the same answer.</p>

                    and the learner should be able to work it either Way with equal readiness, as
                    this last is sometimes more convenient, of which instances will occur
                    afterwards.</p>

                    two numbers are marked down, of placing such a number under the lesser, that,
                    when added together, the sum may be equal to the greater. The operation is the
                    same as subtraction, though conceived in a different manner, and is useful in
                    balancing accounts and on other occasions.</p>

                    >Multiplication.</hi></p>
                <p>In multiplication two numbers are given, and it is required to find how much the
                    first amounts to when reckoned as many times as there are units in the second.
                    Thus, 8 multiplied by 5, or 5 times 8, is 40. The given numbers (8 and 5) are
                    called <hi rend="italic">factors,</hi> the first (8) the <hi rend="italic"
                    >multiplicand,</hi> the second (5) the <hi rend="italic">multiplier,</hi> and
                    the amount (40) the <hi rend="italic">product.</hi></p>
                <p>This operation is nothing else than addition of the same number several times
                    repeated. If we mark 8 five times under each other, and add them, the sum is 40.
                    But as this kind of addition is of frequent and extensive use, in order to
                    shorten the operation, we mark down the number only once, and conceive it to be
                    repeated as often as there are units in the multiplier.</p>
                <p>For this purpose the learner must be thoroughly acquainted with the following
                    multiplication table, which is composed by adding each digit twelve times.</p>

                <p>If the multiplier be 10, we annex a. cipher to the multiplicand; if the
                    multiplier be 100, we a&lt;mex two ciphers, and so on. The reason is obvious,
                    from the use of ciphers in notation.</p>
                <p>If the multiplier be any digit, with one or more ciphers on the right hand, we
                    multiply by the figure, and annex an equal number of ciphers to the product.
                    Thus, if it be required to multiply by 50, we first multiply by 5, and then
                    annex a cipher. It is the same thing as to add the multiplicand 50 times; and
                    this might be done by writing the account at large, dividing the column into 10
                    parts of 5 lines, finding the sum of each part, and adding these ten sums
                    together.</p>
                <p>If the multiplier consists of several significant figures, we multiply separately
                    by each, and add the products. It is the same as if we divided a long account of
                    addition into parts corresponding to the figures of the multiplier.</p>

                    by 8 and 4; lastly, because twice 48 is 96, we multiply the’second line of the

                    consideration. The multiplicand expresses how much is to be reckoned for each
                    article, and the multiplier expresses how many times that is to be reckoned. As
                    the multiplier points out the number of articles to be added, it is always an
                    abstract number, and has no reference to any value or measure whatever. It is
                    therefore quite improper to attempt the multiplication of shillings by

                <p>In division two numbers are given, and it is required to find how often the
                    former contains the latter. Thus, it may be asked how often 21 contains 7, and
                    the answer is exactly 3 times. The former given number (21) is called the <hi

                    and the number required (3) the <hi rend="italic">quotient.</hi> It frequently
                    happens that the division cannot be completed exactly without fractions. Thus it

                <p>As this operation, performed at large, would be very tedious when the quotient is
                    a high number, it is proper to shorten it by every convenient method; and for
                    this purpose we may multiply the divisor by any number whose product is not
                    greater than the dividend, and so subtract it twice or thrice, or oftener, at
                    the same time. The best way is to multiply it by the greatest number that does
                    not raise the product too high, and that number is also the quotient. For
                    example, to divide 45 by 7, we inquire what is the greatest multiplier for 7
                    that does not give a product above 45, and we shall find that it is 6; and 6
                    times 7 is 42, which, subtracted from 45, leaves a remainder of 3. Therefore 7
                    may be subtracted 6 times from 45; or, which is the same thing, 45 divided by 7,
                    gives a quotient of 6 and a remainder of three.</p>
                <p>If the divisor do not exceed 12, we readily find the highest multiplier that can
                    be used from the multiplication table. If it exceed 12, we may try any
                    multiplier that we think will answer. If the product be greater than the
                    dividend, the multiplier is too great; and if the remainder, after the product
                    is subtracted from the dividend, be greater than the divisor, the multiplier is
                    too small. In either of these cases we must try another. But the attentive
                    learner, after some practice, will generally hit on the right multiplier at
                    first.</p>

                    if the quotient be greater than 100, but less than 1000, it e-quires 3 steps. We
                    first inquire how many hundred times the divisor is contained in the dividend,
                    and subtract the amount of these hundreds. Then we inquire how often it is
                    contained ten times in the remainder, and subtract the amount of these tens.
                    Lastly, we inquire how many single times it is contained in the remainder. The
                    method of proceeding will appear from the following example:</p>

                <p>It is obvious, that as often as 8 is contained in 59, so many hundred times it
                    will be contained in 5900, or in 5936; and as often as it is contained in 33, so
                    many ten times it will be contained in 330, or in 336; and thus the higher
                    places of the quotient will be obtained with equal ease as the lower. The
                    operation might be performed by subtracting 8 continually from the dividend,
                    which will lead to the same conclusion by a very tedious process. After 700
                    subtractions, the remainder would be 336; after 40 more it would be 16; and
                    after 2 more the dividend would be entirely exhausted. In practice we omit the

                <p>To explain the reason of this, we must recollect, that whatever number of
                    hundreds any dividend contains, it contains an equal number of 99’s, together
                    with an equal number of units. In Ex. 1, the dividend contains 3241 hundreds,
                    and a remainder of 23. It therefore contains 3241 times 99, and also 3241,
                    besides the remainder already mentioned.—Again, 3241 contains 32 hundreds and a
                    remainder of 4L It therefore contains 32 99’s, and also 32, besides the
                    remainder of 4L Consequently the dividend contains 99, altogether, 3241 times
                    and 32 times, that is, 3273 times, and the remainder consists of 23, 41, and 32,
                    added, which make 96.</p>
                <p>As multiplication supplies the place of frequent additions, and division of
                    frequent subtractions, they are only repetitions and contractions of the simple
                    rules; and, when compared together, their tendency is exactly opposite. As
                    numbers, increased by addition, are diminished and brought back to their
                    original quantity by subtraction; in like manner numbers compounded by
                    multiplication are reduced by division to the parts from which they were
                    compounded. The multiplier shows how many additions are necessary to produce the
                    number; and the quotient shows how many subtractions are necessary to exhaust
                    it. It follows that the product, divided by the multiplicand, will quote the
                    multiplier; and because either factor may be assumed for the multiplicand,
                    therefore the product divided by either factor quotes the other. It follows,
                    also, that the dividend is equal to the product of the divisor and quotient
                    multiplied together; and hence these operations mutually prove each other.</p>
                <p>To prove multiplication: Divide the product by either factor. If the operation be
                    right, the quotient is the other factor, and there is no remainder.</p>
                <p>To prove division: Multiply the divisor and quotient together; to the product add
                    the remainder, if any; and, if the operation be right, it makes up'the dividend.
                    Otherwise divide the dividend (after subtracting the remainder, if any) by the
                    quotient. If the operation be right, it will quote the divisor. The reason of
                    all those rules may be collected from the last paragraph.</p>

                <p>It is best not to reduce the terms lower than is necessary to render them equal.
                    For instance, if each of them consists of an even number of sixpences,
                    fourpences, or the like, we reduce them to sixpences or fourpences, but not to

                <p>The use of division is to find either of the factors by whose multiplication a
                    given number is produced when the other factor is given, and therefore is of two
                    kinds, since either the multiplier or the multiplicand may be <pb break="no"

                    former be given, it discovers what that number is which is contained so many
                    times in another. If the latter be given, it discovers how many times one number
                    is contained in another. Thus, it answers the questions of an opposite kind to
                    those mentioned under Rule IV. p. 547, as, to find the quantity of a single
                    parcel or share; to find the value, weight, or measure, ot a single article; to
                    find how much work is done, provisions consumed, interest incurred, or the like,

                <p>Many other instances might be adduced where the operation and the reasons of it
                    are equally obvious. These are generally, though unnecessarily, referred to the
                    rule of proportion.</p>
                <p>We shall now offer a general observation on all the operations in arithmetic.
                    When a computation requires several steps, we obtain a just answer, whatever
                    order we follow. Some arrangements may be preferable to others in point of ease,
                    but all of them lead to the same conclusion. In addition or subtraction we may
                    take the articles in any order, as is evident from the idea of number; or we may
                    collect them into several sums, and add or subtract these either separately or
                    together. When both the simple operations are required to be repeated, we may
                    either complete one of them first, or may introduce them promiscuously; and the
                    compound operations admit of the same variety. When several numbers are to be
                    multiplied together, we may take the factors in any order, or we may arrange
                    them into several classes, find the product of each class, and then multiply the
                    products together. When a number is to be divided by several others we may take
                    the divisors in any order, or we may multiply them into each other, and divide
                    by the product; or we may multiply them into several parcels, and divide by the
                    products successively. Lastly, When multiplication and division are both
                    required, we may begin with either; and when both are repeatedly necessary, we
                    may collect the multipliers into one product and the divisors into another, or
                    we may collect them into parcels, or use them singly, and that in any order.
                    Still we shall obtain the proper answer if none of the terms be neglected.</p>
                <p>When both multiplication and division are necessary to obtain the answer of a
                    question, it is generally best to begin with the multiplication, as this order
                    keeps the account as clear as possible from fractions. The example last given

                <p>Some accountants prove the operations of arithmetic by a method which they call
                    casting out the 9’s, depending on the following principles:</p>
                <p>1st, If several numbers be divided by any divisor (the remainders being always
                    added to the next number), the sum of the quotients, and the last remainder,
                    will be the same as those obtained when the sum of the number is divided by the
                    same divisor. Thus, 19, 15, and 23, contain together as many 5’s, as many 7’s,
                    &amp;c. as their sum 57 does, and the remainders are the same; and, in this way,
                    addition may be proven by division. It is from the correspondence of the
                    remainders that the proof by casting out the 9’s is deduced.</p>
                <p>2 <hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> If any figure with ciphers annexed be divided by 9,
                    the quotient consists entirely of that figure; and the remainder is also the
                    same. Thus, 40 divided by θ quotes 4, remainder 4; and 400 divided by 9 quotes
                    44, remainder 4. The same holds with all the digits, and the reason will be
                    easily understood: every digit, with a cipher<pb break="no"

                    contains exactly so many tens; it must therefore contain an equal number of 9’s,
                    besides a remainder of an equal number of units.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">3dly,</hi> If any number be divided by 9, the remainder is
                    equal to the sum of the figures of the number, or to the remainder obtained,
                    when that sum is divided by 9. For instance, 3765 divided by 9 leaves a
                    remainder of 3; and the sum of 3, 7, 6, and 5, is 21, which divided by 9 leaves
                    a remainder of 3. The reason of this will appear from the following

                    for practice:</p>
                <p>To cast the 9’s out of any number, or to find what remainder will be left when
                    any number is divided by 9: add the figures; and when the sum exceeds 9, add the
                    figures which would express it. Pass by the 9's; and when the sum comes exactly
                    to 9, neglect it, and begin anew. For example, if it be required to east the 9’s
                    out of 3573294, we reckon thus; 3 and 5 arc 8, and 7 is 15; 1 and 5 are 6, and 3
                    is 9, which wc neglect; 2 and (passing by 9) 4 are 6; which is the remainder or
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Result.</hi> If the article out of which the 9’s are to bc
                    east contains more denominations than one, we east the 9’s out of the higher,
                    and multiply the result by the value of the lower, and carry on the product
                    (casting out the 9’s, if necessary) to the lower.</p>
                <p>To prove addition, cast the 9’s out of the several articles, carrying the results
                    to the following articles; cast them also out of the sum. If the operation be
                    right, the results will agree.</p>
                <p>To prove subtraction, east the 9’s out of the minuend; cast them also out of the
                    subtrahend and remainder together; and if you obtain the same result, the
                    operation is presumed right.</p>
                <p>To prove multiplication, cast the 9’s out of the multiplicand, and also out of
                    the multiplier if above 9. Multiply the results together, and east the 9’s, if
                    necessary, out of their product. Then east the 9’s out of the product, and
                    observe if this result correspond with the former.</p>

                <p>The reason of this will be evident, if we consider multiplication under the view
                    of ’repeated addition. In the first example it is obviously the same. In the
                    second, we may suppose the multiplicand repeated 48 times. If this be done, and
                    the 9’s east out, the result, at the end of the Sth line, will be 0; for any
                    number, repeated 9 times, and divided by 9, leaves no remainder. The same must
                    happen at the end of the 18th, 27th, 36th, and 45th lines; and the last result
                    will be the same as if the multiplicand had only been repeated 3 times. This is
                    the reason for casting out the 9’s from the multiplier as well as the
                    multiplicand.</p>
                <p>To prove division, cast the 9’s out of the diyisor, and also out of the quotient;
                    multiply the results, and east the 9’s out of the product. If there be any
                    remainder, add to it the result, easting out the 9’s if necessary. If the
                    account be right, the last result will agree with that obtained from the
                    dividend.</p>

                    disadvantages.</p>
                <p>Isí, If an error of 9, or any of its multiples, be committed, the results will
                    nevertheless agree; and so the error will remain undiscovered. And this will
                    always be the ease when a figure is placed or reckoned in a wrong column, which
                    is one of the most frequent causes of error.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">2dly,</hi> When it appears by the disagreement of the results
                    that an error has been committed, the particular figure or figures in which the
                    error lies are not pointed out, and consequently it is not easily corrected.</p>

                <p>SECT. I. SIMPLE PROPORTION.</p>
                <p>Quantities are reckoned proportional to each other when they are eonneeted in
                    sueh a manner, that if one of them be increased or diminished, the other
                    increases or diminishes at the same time, and the degree of the alteration on
                    each is a like part of its original measure. Thus, four numbers are in the same
                    proportion, the first to the second as the third to the fourth, when the first
                    contains the second, or any part of it, as often as the third contains the
                    fourth, or the like part of it. In either of these eases, the quotient of the
                    first divided by the second is equal to that of the third divided by the fourth;
                    and this quotient may be called the <hi rend="italic">measure of the
                    proportion.</hi></p>
                <p>Proportionals are marked down in the following manner:</p>
                <p>6: 3 :: 8: 4</p>

                <p>16: 24 :: 10: 15</p>
                <p>The rule of Proportion directs us, when three numbers are given, how to find a
                    fourth, to which the third may have the same proportion that the first has to

                <p>The accountant must consider the nature of every question, and observe the
                    circumstance which the proportion depends on; and common sense will direct him
                    to this if the terms of the question be understood. It is evident that the
                    value, weight, and measure of any commodity is proportioned to its quantity;
                    that the amount of work or consumption is proportioned to the time; that gain,
                    loss, or interest, when the rate and time are fixed, is proportioned to the
                    capital sum from which it arises; and that the effect produced by any cause is
                    proportioned to the extent of the cause. In these and many other cases the
                    proportion is direct, and the number sought increases or diminishes along with
                    the term from which it is derived.</p>
                <p>In some questions, the number sought becomes less when the circumstances from
                    which it is derived become greater. Thus, when the price of goods increases, the
                    quantity which may be bought for a given sum is smaller; when the number of men
                    employed at work is increased, the time in which they may complete it becomes
                    shorter; and when the activity of any cause is increased, the quantity necessary
                    to produce a given effect is diminished. In these and the like the proportion is
                    said to be inverse.</p>

                <p>The operations explained in the foregoing chapters comprehend the whole system of
                    arithmetic, and are sufficient for every computation. In many cases, however,
                    the work may be contracted by adverting to the particular circumstances of the
                    question. We shall explain in this chapter the most useful methods which
                    practice has suggested for rendering mercantile computations easy, in which the
                    four elementary rules of arithmetic are sometimes jointly, sometimes separately
                    employed.</p>
                <p>SECT. I. COMPUTATION OF PRICES.</p>
                <p>The value of any number of articles, at a pound, a shilling, or a penny, is an
                    equal number of pounds, shillings, or pence; and these two last are easily
                    reduced to pounds. The value at any other rate may be calculated by easy’
                    methods, depending on some contraction already explained, or on one or more of
                    the following principles.</p>
                <p>Isí, If the rate be an aliquot part of a pound, a shilling, or a penny, then an
                    exact number of articles may be bought for a pound, a shilling, or a penny <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi>; and the value is found by dividing the given number
                    accordingly. Thus, to find the price'of so many yards at 2s. 6d., which is the
                    eighth part of a pound, we divide the quantity by eight, because every eight
                    yards cost £1.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> If the rate be equal to the sum of two other rates
                    whiclι are easily calculated, the value may be found by <hi rend="superscript">
                    r</hi> computing these separately, and adding the sums obtained. Thus, the price
                    of so many yards at 9d. is found by adding their prices at 6d. and 3d.
                    together.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">3d,</hi> If the rate be equal to the difference of two easy <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> rates, they may be calculated separately, and the
                    lesser subtracted from the greater. Thus, the value of so many articles at I Id.
                    is found by subtracting their value at a penny from their value at a shilling.
                    We may suppose that a shilling was paid for each article, and then a penny
                    returned on each.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">4th,</hi> If the rate be a composite number, the value may be
                    found by calculating what it comes to at one of the component parts, and

                <p>In the first example we divide by 5 because 4s. is ļof a pound; the quotient 1492
                    shows how many pounds they amount to; besides which there remain three yards at
                    4s., and these come to 12s. In the second example we divide by 80, as directed,
                    and the quotient gives £22, and the remainder 13 yards, which at 3d. come to 3s.

                <p>It is easy to perceive that the method in which the second example is wrought
                    must give the same answer as if the quantity had been multiplied by 14 and
                    divided by 20; and as the division by 10 doubles the last figure for shillings,
                    and continues all the rest unchanged for pounds, we may obtain the answer at
                    once, by doubling the righthand figure of the product before we set it down.</p>
                <p>If the rate be the sum of two or more aliquot parts of a pound, we may calculate
                    these as directed in Case I. and add them. If it be any odd number of shillings,
                    we may calculate for the even number next lower, and add thereto the value of a
                    shilling. If it be 19s. we may subtract the value at a shilling from the value

                <p>We have hitherto explained the various methods of computation when the quantity
                    is a whole number and in one denomination. It remains to give the proper
                    directions when the quantity contains a fraction, or is expressed in several
                    denominations.</p>
                <p>When the quantity contains a fraction, work for the integers by the preceding
                    rules, and for the fraction take proportional parts.</p>
                <p>When the quantity is expressed by several denominations, and the rate given for
                    the higher, calculate the higher, consider the lower one as fractions, and work
                    by the last rule.</p>
                <p>When the rate is given for the lower denomination, reduce the higher denomination
                    to the lower, and calculate accordingly.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Note</hi> 1. 7 lb. 14 lb. and 21 lb. are aliquot parts of 1
                    qr.; and 16 lb. is <hi rend="italic">γ</hi> of 1 cwt.; and are therefore easily
                    calculated.</p>
                <p>2. If the price of a dozen be so many shillings, that of an article is as many
                    pence; and if the price of a gross be so many shillings, that of a dozen is as
                    many pence.</p>
                <p>3. If the price of a ton or score be so many pounds, that of 1 cwt., or a single
                    article, is as many shillings.</p>
                <p>4. Though a fraction less than a farthing is of no consequence, and may be
                    rejected, the learner must be careful lest he lose more than a farthing, by
                    rejecting several remainders in the same calculation.</p>
                <p>SECT. II. DEDUCTIONS ON WEIGHTS, &amp;C.</p>
                <p>The full weight of any merchandise, together with that of the cask, box, or other
                    package, in which it is contained, is called the <hi rend="italic">gross
                    weight.</hi> From this we must make proper deductions in order to discover the
                    quantity for which price or duty should be charged, which is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">nett weight.</hi></p>
                <p>Tare is the allowance for the weight of the package; and this should be
                    ascertained by weighing it before the goods are packed. Sometimes, however,
                    particularly in payment of duty, it is customary to allow so much per cwt. or so
                    much per 100 lb. in place of tare.</p>
                <p>Tret is an allowance of 4 lb. on 104 gι anted on currants and other goods on
                    which there is waste, in order that the weight may answer when the goods are
                    retailed.</p>
                <p>Cloff or Draught is a further allowance granted on some goods in London of 2 lb.
                    on every 3 cwt. to turn the scale in favour of the purchaser. The method of
                    calculating these, and the like, will appear from the following examples.</p>

                    equal number of pounds, and add a twentieth part to the answer.</p>
                <p>When the given sum is an exact number of 10 pounds the calculation may be done
                    without setting down any figures. Every £10 at 1 per cent, is a shilling, and at
                    other rates in proportion. Thus, £170 at -∣ per cent, is 17s., and at į per

                <p>SECT. IV. INTEREST.</p>
                <p>Interest is the allowance given for the use of money by the borrower to the
                    lender. This is computed at so many pounds for each hundred lent for a year, and
                    a like proportion for a greater or a less time. The highest rate is limited by
                    our laws to 5 per cent, which is called the <hi rend="italic">legal
                    interest,</hi> and is due on all debts constituted by bond or bill, which are
                    not paid at the proper term; and it is always understood when no other rate is
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>The interest of any sum for a year, at any rate, is found by the method explained
                    in the last section.</p>
                <p>The interest of any number of pounds for a year at 5 per cent, is one twentieth
                    part, or an equal number of shillings. Thus the interest of £34675 for a year is
                    34675 shillings.</p>
                <p>The interest for a day is obtained by dividing the interest for a year by the
                    number of days in a year. Thus the interest of £34675 for a day is found by
                    dividing 34675 shillings by 365, and comes to 95 shillings.</p>
                <p>The interest for any number of days is obtained by multiplying the daily interest
                    by the number of days. Thus the interest of £34675 for 17 days is 17 times 95
                    shillings, or 1615 shillings; and this divided by 20, in order to reduce it,
                    comes to £80. 15s.</p>
                <p>It would have served the same purpose, and been easier, to multiply at first by
                    17, the number of days; and instead of dividing separately by 365, and by 20, to
                    divide at once by 7300, the product of 365 multiplied by 20; and this division
                    may be facilitated by the table inserted p. 549, col. 1.</p>
                <p>The following practical rules may be inferred from the foregoing

                    Fractions.</hi></p>
                <p>In order to understand the nature of vulgar fractions, we must suppose unity (or
                    the number 1) divided into several equal parts. One or more of these parts is
                    called <hi rend="italic">a fraction,</hi> and is represented by placing one
                    number in a small character above a line, and another under it: For example, two
                    fifth parts is written thus, ∣∙. The number under the line (5) shows how many
                    parts unity is divided into, and is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >denominator.</hi> The number above the line (2) shows how many of these parts
                    are represented, and is called the <hi rend="italic">numerator.</hi></p>
                <p>It follows, from the manner of representing fractions, that when the numerator is
                    increased, the value of the fraction becomes greater; but when the denominator
                    is increased, the value becomes less. Hence we may infer, that if the numerator
                    and denominator be both increased, or both diminished, in the same proportion,
                    the value is not altered; and therefore, if we multiply both by any number
                    whatever, or divide them by any number which measures both, we shall obtain
                    other fractions of equal value. Thus, every fraction may be expressed in a
                    variety of forms, which have all the same signification.</p>
                <p>A fraction annexed to an integer or whole number makes a mixed number; for
                    example, five and two third parts, or 5⅛. A fraction whose numerator is greater
                    than its denominator is called an <hi rend="italic">improper fraction</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> for example, seventeen third parts, or <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ∕. Fractions of this kind are greater than unity.
                    Mixed numbers may be represented in the form of improper fractions, and improper
                    fractions may be reduced to mixed numbers, and sometimes to integers. As
                    fractions, whether proper or improper, may be represented in different forms, we
                    must explain the method of reducing them from one form to another before we

                <p>Because one is equal to two halves, or 3 third parts, or 4 quarters, and every

                <p>It is generally sufficient, in practice, to divide by such measures as are found
                    to answer on inspection, or by the rules given p. 547, col. 2. But if it be
                    required to reduce a fraction to the lowest possible terms, we must divide the
                    numerator and denominator by the greatest number which measures both. What
                    number this is may not be obvious, but will always be found by the following
                    rule.</p>
                <p>To find the greatest common measure of two numbers, divide the greater by the

                    </table></p>
                <p>Here we divide 589 by 475, and the remainder is 114; then we divide 475 by 114,
                    and the remainder is 19; then we divide 114 by 19, and there is no remainder;
                    from which we infer that 19, the last divisor, is the greatest common
                    measure.</p>
                <p>To explain the reason of this, we must observe, that any number which measures
                    two others will also measure their sum and their difference, and will measure
                    any multiple of either. In the foregoing example, any number which measures 589
                    and 475 will measure their difference, 114, and will measure 456, which is a
                    multiple of 114; and any number which measures 475 and 456 will also measure
                    their difference, 19. Consequently, no number greater than 19 can measure 589
                    and 475. Again, 19 will measure them both, for it measures 114, and therefore
                    measures 456, which is a multiple of 114 and 475, which is just 19 more than
                    456; and because it measures 475 and 114, it will measure their sum, 589. To
                    reduce ∣⅞∣ to the lowest possible terms, we divide both numbers by 19, and it
                    comes to -∣f.</p>
                <p>If there be no common measure greater than 1, the fraction is already in the
                    lowest terms.</p>
                <p>If the greatest common measure of 3 numbers be required, we find the greatest
                    measure of the two first, and then the greatest measure of that number and the
                    third. If there be more numbers, we proceed in the same manner. <hi

                    manner, and the common denominator, 360, is obtained by multiplying the given
                    denominators 5, 9, 8, into each other. In the course of the whole operation, the
                    numerators and denominators of each fraction are multiplied by the same number,

                    occur in each rank, we may dash them out and neglect them; and if numbers which
                    have a common measure occur in each, we may dash them out and use the quotients
                    in their stead; or any number which is a multiple of all the given denominators
                    may be used as a common denominator. Sometimes a number of this kind will occur
                    on inspection, and the new numerators are found by multiplying the given ones by
                    the common denominator, and dividing the products by the respective given

                    rend="subscript"> 7</hi> comes to. If one third part only had been required, it
                    would have been obtained by multiplying the denominator 7 by 3, because the
                    value of fractions is lessened when their denominators are increased: and this
                    comes to ∕ <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi>; and, because two thirds were required,
                    we must double that fraction, which is done by multiplying the numerator by 2,
                    and comes to ∣⅛. Hence we infer that fractions of fractions, or compound
                    fractions, such as of <hi rend="italic">j,</hi> are reduced to simple ones by
                    multiplication. The same method is followed when the compound fraction is
                    expressed in three parts or more.</p>
                <p>The foregoing rule extends to every case when there are fractions in either
                    factor. For mixed numbers may be reduced to improper fractions, as is done in
                    <hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 2; and integers may be written, or understood to be
                    written, in the form of fractions whose numerator is 1. It will be convenient,
                    however, to give some further directions for proceeding when one of the factors
                    is an integer, or when one or both are mixed numbers.</p>

                    by 7, or to take one seventh part of that fraction. This is obtained by
                    multiplying the denominator by 7; for the value of fractions is diminished by
                    increasing their denominators, and comes to <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> ¾-.

                <p>In the first example we multiply the numerator 17 by 20, the number of shillings
                    in a pound, and divide the product, 340, by 60, the denominator of the fraction,
                    and obtain a quotient of 5 shillings; then we multiply the remainder, 40, by 12,
                    the number of pence in a shilling, which produces 480, which, divided by 60,
                    quotes 8d. without a remainder. In the second example we proceed in the same
                    manner; but as there is a remainder, the quotient is completed by a
                    fraction.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the value of the fraction does not amount to an unit of the lowest
                    denomination; but it may be reduced to a fraction of that or any other
                    denomination by multiplying the numerator according to. the value of the places.
                    Thus -j⅛Γ) of a pound is equal to -j-Ļ^ŋ· of a shilling, or <hi rend="subscript"

                <p>SECT. I. NOTATION AND REDUCTION.</p>
                <p>Decimal fractions are such as have 10, or some power of 10 (that is 100, 1000,
                    &amp;c.), for a denominator: such are these,—</p>
                <p>'24. _ZAE_ 4Λ2_ .</p>
                <p>io’ ıōo’ jooo’ louooň’</p>
                <p>They are more simply written thus:</p>
                <p>•3, ∙24, ∙075, ∙00462; the number of figures after the point being always the
                    same as the number of ciphers in the denominators.</p>
                <p>In decimal fractions, as thus written, the figure next <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193102841?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-2841-0560"/> the point, to
                    the right, indicates so many tenths; the next so many hundredths, and so on.
                    Thus, in the fraction •346, the figure 3 expresses 3 tenths, 4 denotes 4
                    hundredths, and 6, 6 thousandths.</p>
                <p>The use of ciphers in decimals, as well as in integers, is to bring the
                    significant figures to their proper places, on which their value depends. As
                    ciphers, when placed on the left hand of an integer, have no signification, but,
                    when placed on the right hand, increase the value ten times each; so ciphers,
                    when placed on the right hand of a decimal, have no signification, but when
                    placed on the left hand, diminish the value ten times each.</p>

                <p>From the foregoing examples we may distinguish the several kinds of decimals.
                    Some vulgar fractions maybe reduced exactly to decimals, as Ex. lst and <hi
                    rend="italic">2d,</hi> and are called <hi rend="italic">terminate</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">finite decimals.</hi> Others cannot be exactly reduced, because
                    the division always leaves a remainder; but, by continuing the division, we will
                    perceive how the decimal may be extended to any length whatever. These are
                    called <hi rend="italic">infinite decimals.</hi> If the same figure continually
                    returns, as in Ex. <hi rend="italic">3d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mh,</hi> they
                    are called <hi rend="italic">repeaters.</hi> If two or more figures return in
                    then-order, they are called <hi rend="italic">circulates.</hi> If this regular
                    succession go on from the beginning, they are called <hi rend="italic">pure
                    repeaters,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">circulates,</hi> as Ex. <hi rend="italic"
                    >3d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">oth.</hi> If otherwise, as Ex. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mh</hi> and 6∕7z, they are mixed <hi rend="italic">repeaters</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">circulates,</hi> and the figures prefixed to those in regular
                    succession are called the <hi rend="italic">finite part.</hi> Repeating figures
                    are generally distinguished by a dash, and circulates by a comma or other mark,
                    at the beginning and end of the circle; and the beginning of a repeater or
                    circulate is pointed out in the division by an asterisk.</p>
                <p>Lower denominations may be considered as fractions of higher ones, and reduced to
                    decimals accordingly. We may proceed by the following rule, which is the same in

                <p>The value of decimal places decreases like that of integers, ten of the lower
                    place in either being equal to one of the next higher; and the same holds in
                    passing from decimals to integers. Therefore, all the operations are performed
                    in the same way with decimals, whether placed by themselves or annexed to
                    integers, as with pure integers. The only peculiarity lies in the arrangement

                <p>The reason of this rule may be explained, by observing, that the value of the
                    product depends on the value of the factors; and since each decimal place in
                    either factor diminishes its value ten times, it must equally diminish the value
                    of the product.</p>
                <p>To multiply decimals by 10, move the decimal point one place to the right; to
                    multiply by 100, 1000, or the like, move it as many places to the right as there
                    are ciphers in the multiplier.</p>
                <p>In division, <hi rend="italic">Point the quotient so that there may be an °,quαl
                    number of decimal places in the dividend as in the divisor and quotient
                    together.</hi></p>
                <p>Therefore, if there be the same number of decimal places in the divisor and
                    dividend, there will be none in the quotient.</p>
                <p>If there be more in the dividend, the quotient will have as many as the dividend
                    has more than the divisor.</p>
                <p>If there be more in the divisor, we must annex (or suppose annexed) as many
                    ciphers to the dividend as may complete the number in the divisor, and all the
                    figures of the quotient are integers.,</p>
                <p>If the division leave a remainder, the quotient may be extended to more decimal
                    places; but these are not regarded in fixing the decimal point.</p>
                <p>The reason for fixing the decimal noint as directed may be inferred from the rule
                    followed in multiplication. The quotient multiplied by the divisor produces the
                    dividend; and therefore the number of decimal places in the dividend is equal to
                    those in the divisor and quotient together.</p>
                <p>The first figure of the quotient is always at the same distance from the decimal
                    point, and on the same side, as the figure of the dividend which stands above
                    the unit place of the first product. This also takes place in integers; and the
                    reason is the same in both.</p>
                <p>Multiplication by fractions corresponds with division by integers, and division
                    by fractions with multiplication by integers; when we multiply by <hi

                    we</hi> obtain the same answer as when we divide by 2, and every integer has a
                    correspondent decimal, which may be called its <hi rend="italic"
                    >reciprocal.</hi> Multiplication by that decimal supplies the place of division
                    by the integer, and division supplies the place of multiplication.</p>

                <p>SECT. III. APPROXIMATE DECIMALS.</p>
                <p>It has been shown that some decimals, though extended to any length, are never
                    complete; and others, which terminate at last, sometimes consist of so many
                    places that it would be difficult in practice to extend them fully. In these
                    cases, we may extend the decimal to three, four, or more places, according to
                    the nature of the articles and the degree of accuracy required, and reject the
                    rest of it as inconsiderable. In this manner we may perform any operation with
                    ease by the common rules, and the answers we obtain are sufficiently exact for
                    any purpose in business. Decimals thus restricted are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >approximates.</hi></p>
                <p>Shillings, pence, and farthings, may be easily reduced to decimals of three
                    places by the following rule: Take half the shillings for the first decimal
                    place, and the number of farthings increased by one, if it amount to 24 or
                    upwards; by two, if it amount to 48 or upwards; and by three, if it amount to 72
                    or upwards, for the two next places.</p>
                <p>The reason of this is, that 20 shillings make a pound, two shillings is the tenth
                    part of a pound, and therefore half the number of shillings makes the first
                    decimal place. If there were 50 farthings in a shilling, or 1000 in a pound, the
                    units of the farthings in the remainder would be thousandth parts, and the tens
                    would be hundredth parts, and so would give the two next decimal places; but
                    because there are only 48 farthings in a shilling, or 960 in a pound, every
                    farthing is a little more than the thousandth part of a pound; and since 24
                    farthings make 25 thousandth parts, allowance is made for that excess by adding
                    1 for every 24 farthings, as directed.</p>
                <p>If the number of farthings be 24, 48, or 72, and consequently the second and
                    third decimal places 25, 50, and 75, they are exactly right; otherwise they are
                    not quite complete, since there should be an allowance of ⅛, not only for 24,
                    48, and 72 farthings, but for every other single farthing. They may be completed
                    by the following rule: multiply the second and third decimal places, or their
                    excess above 25, 50, 75, by 4. If the product amount to 24 or upwards, add 1; if
                    48, add 2; if 72, add 3. By this operation we obtain two decimal places more;
                    and by continuing the same operation, we may extend the decimal till it
                    terminate in 25, 50, 75, or in a repeater.</p>
                <p>Decimals of sterling money of three places may easily be reduced to shillings,
                    pence, and farthings, by the following rule: Double the first decimal place, and
                    if the second be 5 or upwards, add 1 thereto for shillings. Then divide the
                    second and third decimal places, or their excess above 50, by 4, first deducting
                    1, if it amount to 25 <pb break="no" facs="nls:193102867?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-2867-0562"/> or upwards; the quotient is pence, and the
                    remainder farthings.</p>
                <p>As this rule is the converse of the former one, the reason of the one may be
                    inferred from that of the other. The value obtained by it, unless the decimal
                    terminate in 25, 50, or 75, is a little more than the true value; for there
                    should be a deduction, not only of 1 for 25, but a little deduction of ⅛∙ on the
                    remaining figures of these places.</p>
                <p>We proceed to give some examples of the arithmetic of approximates, and subjoin
                    any necessary observations.</p>

                <p>If we value the sum of the approximates, it will fall a little short of the sum

                <p>Here the last four places are quite uncertain. The right-hand figure of each
                    particular product is obtained by multiplying 8 into the figures of the
                    multiplier; but if the multiplicand had been extended, the carriage from the
                    right-hand place would have been taken in; consequently the right-hand place of
                    each particular product, and the four places of the total product, which depend
                    on these, are quite uncertain. Since part of the operation therefore is useless,
                    we may omit it; and for this purpose it will be convenient to begin (as in p.
                    547, col. 1, <hi rend="italic">fifth</hi> variety) at the highest place of the
                    multiplier. We may perceive that all the figures on the right hand of the line
                    in Meth. 2 serve no purpose, and may be left out if we only multiply the figures
                    on the multiplicand, whose products are placed on the left hand of the line.
                    This is readily done by inverting the multiplier in Meth. 3, and beginning each
                    product with the multiplication of that figure which stands above the figure of
                    the multiplier that produces it, and including the carriage from the righthand
                    place.</p>
                <p>If both factors be approximates, there are at least as many uncertain places in
                    the produet as in the longest factor. If only one be an approximate, there are
                    as many uncertain places as there are figures in that factor, and sometimes a
                    place or two more, which might be affected by the carriage. Hcncc we may infer
                    how far it is necessary to extend the approximates in order to obtain the
                    requisite number of certain places in the product.</p>

                <p>We have seen that some vulgar fractions admit of being converted into exact
                    decimal fractions, while others have not that property, but proceed
                    interminably, the numerator being either the same figure, or else a combination
                    of figures always repeated. The fraction ∣∙ is of the first mentioned kind, its
                    decimal value being that is ∙375; again, A=∙333, &amp;c. and ^-=∙714285,714285,
                    &amp;c. are examples of the second kind. Let us suppose a fraction reduced to
                    its lowest terms, <hi rend="italic">į,</hi> for example. Now, to convert this
                    into a decimal, we annex ciphers to the numerator (that is, we multiply it by
                    some power of 10), and divide by the denominator, the decimal denominator being
                    always that power of ten by which the numerator was multiplied. In the case of
                    <hi rend="italic">į,</hi> the numerator is multiplied by 1000, which is exactly
                    divisible by 8; for when the numbers are expressed by the product of their
                    simple factors, we have 1000=2 × 2 × 2 × 5 X 5 × 5 and 8=2×2×2, and ∙ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> ⅛o9-g χ 5 × 5 = 125, therefore the decimal value of
                    <hi rend="italic">⅜</hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript">
                    ιs</hi><hi rend="italic">~/ooō’</hi> that <hi rend="superscript"> ís</hi> ’ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> ^75. Here it appears that the decimal fraction has a
                    finite form, because the divisors of the denominator of the vulgar fraction are
                    also divisors of a power of 10.</p>
                <p>A like remark may be made concerning the fraction = the two equal divisors 5
                    being divisors of 10, and therefore their product a divisor of 100, and the
                    fraction =∙28.</p>
                <p>In general, it appears that if the simple factors of the denominators of a vulgar
                    fraction be all either 2 or 5, its decimal value will be finite, otherwise
                    not.</p>
                <p>The fraction -į is therefore, from its nature, incapable of being converted into
                    a finite decimal; but this fraction, when converted into a decimal, being ∙1111,
                    &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">ad i</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> r</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">'fi' nitum,</hi> therefore ∙∣ will be ∙222, &amp;c. and <hi
                    rend="italic">į</hi> = -∣- = ∙333, &lt;⅛c. and so on to which will be ∙888,
                    &amp;c. Hence it is manifest that every repeating decimal is equivalent to a
                    vulgar fraction whose denominator is 9.</p>
                <p>Again, since <hi rend="italic">-fş</hi> = ∙010101, &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">ađ
                    infinitum,</hi> therefore = ∙0202, &amp;c.; and in like manner <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> = ∙1717, &amp;c. and so on, from <hi rend="italic"

                    &amp;c. Therefore every circulating decimal of two figures is convertible into a
                    vulgar fraction whose denominator is 99.</p>
                <p>And since = ∙001001001, &amp;c., therefore any fraction whose numerator consists
                    of three figures, and denominator<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193102880?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-2880-0563"/> 999, must
                    produce a circulate of three figures; for example, ⅜⅜⅜ = ∙365365365, &amp;c.;
                    and in like manner, since — ‘00010001, &amp;c., therefore every fraction whose
                    numerator consists of not more than four figures, aηd which has 9999 for a
                    denominator, must produce a circulate of four figures, and so on.</p>
                <p>It is now sufficiently manifest that all circulating decimals may be generated
                    from vulgar fractions whose denominators are formed by a repetition of the
                    figure 9; and hence it follows that every circulate may be converted into a
                    vulgar fraction of that form.</p>

                <p>It is evident, that if a repeating multiplier be extended to any length, the
                    product arising from each figure will be the same as the first, and each will
                    stand one place to the right hand of the former. In like manner, if a
                    circulating multiplier be extended, the product arising from each circle will be
                    alike, and will stand as many places to the right hand of the former as there
                    are figures in the circle. In the foregoing examples there are as many of these
                    products repeated as is necessary for finding the total product. If we place
                    down more, or extend them farther, it will only give a continuation of the
                    repeaters or circulates.</p>

                    left-hand figure of the dividual to the remaining figures of the same. Thus, 363
                    is the first dividual, and 3, the left hand figure, added to 63, the remaining
                    figures, gives 66 for the first remainder; and the second dividual, 666, is
                    completed by annexing the circulating figure 6, the reason of which may be
                    explained as follows. The highest place of each dividual shows, in this example,
                    how many hundreds it contains; and as it must contain an equal number of
                    ninety-nines, and also an equal number of units, it follows that these units,
                    added to the lower places, must show how far the dividual exceeds that number of
                    ninety-nines. The figure of the quotient is generally the same as the first
                    place of the dividual, sometimes one more. This happens in the last step of the
                    foregoing example, and is discovered when the remainder found, as here directed,
                    would amount to 99 or upwards; and the excess above 99 only must in that case be
                    taken to complete the next dividual.</p>

                <p>The number of places in the circle of the product is sometimes very great, though
                    there be few places in the factors; but it never exceeds the product of the
                    denominator of the multiplier, multiplied by the number of places in the circle
                    of the multiplicand. Therefore, if the multiplier be <hi rend="italic">į</hi> or
                    0, the product may circulate three times as many places as the multiplicand; if
                    the multiplier be any other repeater, nine times as many; if the multiplier be a
                    circulate of two places, ninety-nine times as many: thus, in the last example,
                    ∙01, a circulate of two places, multiplied by ∙01, a circulate of two places,
                    produces a circulate of twice 99, or 198 places. And the reason of this limit
                    may be inferred from the nature of the operation; for the greatest possible
                    number of remainders, including 0, is equal to the divisor 99; and each
                    remainder may afford two dividuals, if both the circulating figures, 3 and 6,
                    occur to be annexed to it. If the multiplier circulate three places, the circle
                    of the product, for a like reason, may extend 999 times as far as that of the
                    multiplicand. But the number of places is often much less.</p>

                    repeat; or, if the dividend circulate, it may circulate an equal number of
                    places, often more, and never fewer. The greatest possible extent of the circle
                    is found by multiplying the divisor into the number of places in the circle of
                    the dividend. Thus, a circulate of 3 places, divided by 3, quotes a circulate of
