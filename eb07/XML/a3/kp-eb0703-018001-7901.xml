                <p><label type="entry">ANIMALCULE</label>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Animalcule,</hi> a diminutive term (from the word animaD,
                    applied by naturalists to those minute beings which become apparent in various
                    fluids when subjected to the microscope. They were named infusory animals <hi
                    rend="italic">(Infusoria)</hi> by Müller, one of the most celebrated observers
                    in this department of zoology; and the appellation, however inapplicable, now
                    occurs in the majority of scientific publications. Of course it applies with
                    propriety only to such species as arc developed through the medium of infused
                    substances. Now we know, that of 400 species of Infusoria (commonly so called)
                    described by Müller himself, not a sixth part were observed in any kind of
                    infusions; whilst the remainder inhabited the most translucent waters, and
                    speedily died when placed in impure or corrupted liquids. Even the word
                    animalcule (or little animaD does not convey a positive or sufficiently
                    restricted idea in relation to this particular class; because mites and certain
                    polypi are extremely minute in their dimensions, and equally require the aid of
                    microscopical investigation; and thus the term microscopies <hi rend="italic"
                    >(microscopiques),</hi> recently proposed by Μ. Bory de St Vincent, is not less
                    faulty than its predecessors. The size of an animal, in fact, bears no essential
                    relation to the other conditions of its organization; and therefore we cannot
                    infer its nature with any certainty from a knowledge of its dimensions. At the
                    same time it must be admitted, that the most simply organized, both of plants
                    and animals, are also the most minute; and thus the Infusoria may be regarded as
                    possessed of certain characters in common. We here adopt the word Animalcule,
                    chiefly because it is the most familiar to the English reader.</p>
                <p>The subjects of our present observations may be thus defined :— <hi rend="italic"

                    smallest and most simple of living creatures, but not less perfect than the
                    other tribes; for though they possess the fewest faculties, their means are in
                    every way adequate to their wants, and their vital energies proportioned to
                    their sphere of enjoyment.</p>
                <p>Among microscopical animals we find many species which, in their aspect and
                    structure, present no analogy <pb break="no" facs="nls:193097914"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-7914-0181"/>to other forms of animal life: they are merely
                    moving molecules of the simplest organization, the exact nature of which it is
                    sometimes difficult to determine, and which involve in deeper obscurity the
                    mysterious line of demarcation by which we so often seek in vain to separate the
                    animal from the vegetable kingdom. If, however, the true distinction between
                    plants and animals consists chiefly in the irritability and power of contraction
                    possessed by the latter, then the Infusoria, which are strongly endowed with
                    these attributes, are indeed so far removed from the vegetable kingdom, that the
                    name of Zoophytes, or animal plants, is inapplicable to the class to which they
                    belong. In the extreme simplicity of their structure, they no doubt present some
                    analogy to the least complicated tribes of plants, such as the algae and others;
                    but it is a mere analogy, and not a connection of affinity,—for no alliance
                    beween these kingdoms has ever been demonstrated, although certain obscure
                    phenomena may have presented difficulties in the way of our investigations. “We
                    need not be surprised,” Mr Macleay observes in his <hi rend="italic">Horoe
                    Entomologicae,</hi> “that several of the Linnaean algae should be still hovering
                    in a state of uncertainty between the two kingdoms; but, on the contrary, be
                    prepared to expect additional proofs of the analogy which the two great
                    divisions of organized matter bear to each other. The Agastria, or Agastraires
                    of De Blainville, are indeed <hi rend="italic">animals,</hi> though they have
                    neither distinct organs of sense, alimentary canal, nor even mouth,—though they
                    have, in short, so far as our present knowledge of them would lead us to
                    believe, no internal digestion whatever to execute, but trust for nourishment,
                    like plants, to the absorption of their external pores. They must be esteemed
                    animals on account of their peculiar irritability; but are vegetables in almost
                    every other respect.”</p>
                <p>Our knowledge of the history of animalcules resulted from the improvement of the
                    microscope by Hartzocker and Lecuwenhoeck. The ancients were consequently
                    unacquainted with the mysteries of this “invisible world ;” and we are thus
                    saved the tedium of a lengthened bibliographical investigation. Notwithstanding
                    the observations of Hill, Baker, Ledermuller, Goeze, Gleichen, Roësel, Pallas,
                    Needham, Spallanzani, and several other minute and laborious inquirers, it may
                    be said that this branch of zoology only assumed a truly scientific form in
                    consequence of the labours of a distinguished Danish naturalist, Otho Frederic
                    Müller. His earlier works, such as the <hi rend="italic">Vermium Terrestrium, et
                    Fluviatilium, Historia,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Zoologiae Danicae
                    Prodromus,</hi> presented very decided improvements in the knowledge and
                    classification of animalcules. These emendations were transferred by Gmelin to
                    the 13th edition of the <hi rend="italic">Systema</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Natures</hi> of Linnaeus, in which animalcules form the fifth order of the
                    class of Vermes. But the work which, had the rest been wanting, would alone have
                    immortalized the name of Müller, appeared (posthumously) in 1786, under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Animalcula Infusoria, Fluviatilia et Marina.</hi> It
                    is illustrated by 50 plates, containing figures of 360 species variously
                    represented. A later and very useful compendium of knowledge regarding
                    microscopical animals forms a portion of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie
                    Méthodique</hi> (46th livraison), in which Bruguière has reproduced the plates
                    of Müller, with the addition of several others of equal accuracy from the third
                    volume of Roësel’s <hi rend="italic">lnsecten-belustigungen.</hi> The reader
                    will there find descriptions of 28 plates, containing nearly 1100 figures
                    representing 385 animalcular species.</p>
                <p>Before proceeding further, we shall present a brief view of the system of Müller,
                    as of high importance in itself, and the fondamental basis of the more recent
                    and improved arrangements. It includes, however, several genera which are not
                    now classed among the animalcular tribes. He divides the <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>In the year 1815 Lamarck published the first part of his <hi rend="italic"

                    inferior tribes. In this signal publication the author adopts a different course
                    from that usually followed by systematic writers; and pursuing an ascending

                    species, viz. the Infusoria. From this class, however, he rejects all those
                    species in which any kind of complication of organs is apparent. All the genera
                    so distinguished are referred by him to the first order of the second class of
                    the animal kingdom, called <hi rend="smallcaps">Polypi,</hi> under the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">Polypi</hi><hi rend="italic">ciliati;</hi> and the true and
                    restricted Infusoria are thus defined: <hi rend="italic">Microscopical animals,
                    gelatinous, transparent, polymorphous, contractile</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">having no distinct mouth, nor constant, determinable,
                    internal organs</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">generation
                    fissiparous or sub-gemmiparous.</hi> The genus Kerona, it may be further
                    remarked, is in this system united to the Himantopus of Müller, while the genus
                    Ccrearia of that author is divided into two. Thus the class Infusoria of
                    Lamarck, composed of two great sections, the naked and the appendiculated, may
                    be said to correspond to the first 14 genera of the Danish naturalists.</p>
                <p>Cuvier, in the <hi rend="italic">Pègne Animal</hi> (1817), places the Infusoria
                    as a part of his fourth great division, the zoophytical or radiated animals. The
                    term <hi rend="italic">radiated</hi> was originally bestowed on a numerous tribe
                    of animals, such as the Asterias and others, on account of their arms or
                    tentacula being extended in a radiated or star-like form; but it certainly
                    applies unfitly to the true Infusoria of Lamarck, which possess nothing
                    resembling a radiated structure. It cannot, however, be always expected that a
                    general term of wide import should apply with etymological accuracy to every
                    part of the extensive series which it is intended to embrace. Cuvier then
                    divides his Infusoria into two orders, <hi rend="italic">Les Rotifères,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Les Infusoires homogènes,</hi> the former of which correspond
                    to the ciliated polypi of La-march, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193097927"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-7927-0182"/>the latter to the Infusoria properly so called of
                    that author.</p>
                <p>' According to Μ. de Blainville, the class Infusoria can scarcely be regarded as
                    established upon a natural foundation. The organization of its component tribes
                    is so various , as to lead to the belief that a more precise knowledge would
                    show that several of those tribes belong to different types of the animal
                    kingdom. Some, as the genus Brachionus, are symmetrically formed both as regards
                    their bodies and appendages, and are protected by a homy or crustaceous
                    covering. Others, as Vibrio, Paramaecium, &amp;c. have the body elongated,
                    depressed, vermiform, and without appendages. A third division exhibit a
                    radiated structure, as for example the Vorticellae, which, however, we have
                    already stated, are now seldom classed among the Infusoria. Many genera, such as
                    Proteus, Volvox, Monas, are amorphous, or without determinate form, and cannot
                    be referred to any other known type of the animal kingdom. They are regarded by
                    many as the elementary molecules of all animal life, and in their structure no
                    other than the cellular tissue is observable. They may be said to be dependent
                    on external circumstances, instead of being able, like other animals, to modify
                    or control them; and their usually spherical form is the necessary result of an
                    equal pressure of water .on all sides of a frail and yielding texture. Μ. de
                    Blainville considers the genera <hi rend="italic">Brachionus, Urcelaria,
                    Cercaria, Fur-cularia, Kerona, Trichocerca,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Himantopus,</hi> as belonging to the type of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Enlomozoaires</hi> or articulated animals, and especially to the class
                    Heteropoda, order Entomostraca. Many species of <hi rend="italic">Vibrio</hi> he
                    regards as Apodes, as well as <hi rend="italic">Paramoecium</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Kolpoda.</hi> Other species of the genera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vibrio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cyclidium</hi> ought rather to be ranged with
                    the Planaria; and in the genus <hi rend="italic">Leucophra</hi> there is even a
                    species which Μ. de Blainville is inclined to look upon as an Ascidia! Finally,
                    the genera <hi rend="italic">Gonium, Proteus, Volvox,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monas,</hi> if they are really animals, appear to form a distinct type, which
                    may be called Amorphes or Agastraires; so named from the circumstance of their
                    having neither determinate form nor reduplication of the external envelope for
                    the formation of a stomach, as in all other true animals.</p>
                <p>Such is a brief exposition of the views of one of the most distinguished
                    physiological inquirers of the present day. It may serve, if for nothing more,
                    at least to show the unsettled state of opinion concerning these extraordinary
                    creatures. In regard to this, however, we may rest assured that, in the future
                    progress of science, the class Infusoria, as at present constituted, will suffer
                    an entire dismemberment, and its component parts will be referred to various
                    groups of the animal kingdom, some of them widely distant from each other.</p>
                <p>In the year 1826 a full and most elaborate classification of microscopical
                    animals was given to the world by Μ. Bory de St Vincent. As it is the singular
                    mode of existence of animalcular beings, their general economy in the field of
                    nature, the actual conditions of their organization, and the state of their
                    limited faculties so far as these can be ascertained, with which we are chiefly
                    interested—so, in our systematic view of this extraordinary class, we shall
                    merely present to our readers the characters of the principal genera, and of a
                    few of the most remarkable species which they contain. But, as some may be
                    desirous to possess at least a sketch of the full extent and condition of this
                    intricate subject, we have constructed the accompanying tabular scheme of the
                    orders, families, and genera of microscopical animals, according to the views of
                    Μ. Bory de St Vincent, the latest and most assiduous writer on this department
                    with whose labours we are acquainted. We have thought it advisable to retain the
                    terms of the original language,'lest, by inadvertence or misconception on the
                    part of the translator, any additional obscurity should rise around a subject
                    already sufficiently encumbered. <hi rend="italic">(See Tabular View on the
                    opposite page.)</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> J</hi></p>
                <p>The order Gymnodes of Bory de St Vincent nearly cor. responds to the entire class
                    Infusoria of Lamarck; and although the observations by which he illustrates his
                    arrangement partake of the accustomed defects of the French philosophy, the
                    facts which he details, if not the theore∙ tical views which he inculcates, are
                    worthy of an atte∏. tive consideration. These mysterious creatures are observed
                    to swim with astonishing rapidity; and although their bodies are usually
                    diaphanous, it has hitherto proved impossible, even by the aid of the most
                    powerful glasses, to ascertain by what natural mechanism these movements are
                    effected. They direct their courses by a discretionary power, in one direction
                    rather than another, avoiding and turning round opposing obstacles, according to
                    the necessities of the case—discerning, as the process of evaporation proceeds,
                    the points in which they may prolong their existence, and flocking in crowds to
                    those places where they are best screened from the overpowering bril· hancy of
                    the reflecting mirror. They thus appear to possess volition, which we are
                    accustomed to regard as a result dependent on the faculties of perception and
                    comparison.</p>
                <p>The principal obstacle to our understanding the essential nature of animalcules
                    results from their want of a nervous system, which, in ourselves, and in all the
                    intermediate classes of the nature of whose’ consciousness we have even a vague
                    idea, we regard as the <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> of sensation and
                    intelligence. Voluntary motion without muscular action is also a circumstance
                    which we cannot very clearly comprehend. But as there may be “more things in
                    heaven and earth than are dream’t of in our philosophy,” we must not reject
                    facts, that is to say appearances which present themselves under the same
                    determinate and uniform aspect to various unprejudiced observers, merely because
                    they do not coincide, or may possibly controvert or interfere, with a previous
                    hypothesis. On the other hand, the extreme softness of texture, and excessive
                    minuteness, of most of the animalcular species, render anatomical investigation
                    almost impossible; and naturalists may have erred in suppo⅞ing the absence of
                    what they are merely unable to perceive and demonstrate.</p>
                <p>It is in truth impossible to discover any traces of the nervous system, even
                    among several tribes of animals in other respects much more highly organized
                    than the subjects of our present inquiry. Trembley’s examination of the Polypus
                    threw no positive light upon the matter; nor did Gade’s dissections of the
                    larger Medusae enable him to discover either muscular or nervous fibres.
                    According to Μ. Bory de St Vincent, the nervous system is one of the last to be
                    developed. To the perfect simplicity of the Monads, the first perceptible
                    addition is that of a central cavity, or rudimentary intestinal sac, which we
                    find to occur even before the existence of a mouth. Next appears an opening to
                    this canal, which serves both for the reception of nourishment, and the
                    rejection of excrementitious parts where such exist. The hairs andcirrated
                    appendages which ensue in still more complicated species have been regarded as
                    the early rudiments of the respiratory system; and even a heart, or central
                    organ of a circulating fluid, is partly developed before the appearance of any
                    nervous chords. The earliest, most general, and perhaps the only indispensable
                    function of animal life, is that of nutrition· But the materials of nutrition
                    are so different, and their modes of reception so various, that the exercise of
                    this </p>

                <p>function by no means necessitates the existence of a mouth, a stomach, or an
                    alimentary' canal; for an increase of parts may be effected even through the
                    medium of imponderable or elastic fluids, and by imperceptible and superficial
                    pores.</p>
                <p>The exterior of an infusory animal may be compared to the interior of one of the
                    higher classes, in which nutrition is carried on by the reception of the chyle
                    by the absorbent pores. These pores are external among the Infusoria, and the
                    process of absorption is with them analogous to that of plants, in which there
                    is a direct reception and appropriation of fluids from the earth and air,
                    without any previous preparation in a central cavity or stomach. Zoophytes in
                    general have indeed been called the cryptogamia of the animal kingdom. According
                    to Carus, the Infusoria ought to be regarded merely as little cells, partially
                    filled with lymph, and possessed of the powers of nutrition and locomotion; and
                    thus the infinite changes and variations perceptible in their forms may be
                    supposed to be produced by the various degrees in which this fluid is collected
                    at one or other of the points of their bodies. In the opinion of that anatomist,
                    a more complete development of the organs of motion, and indeed of the whole
                    organization, is inseparably united with the appearance of a distinct nervous
                    system. This may be true as a general rule, but not as a universal principle;
                    for the Medusa has more apparent voluntary motion than the Asterias, though the
                    former is destitute of those nerves which in the latter make their first
                    appearance in the shape of a pale thread-like ring surrounding the oesophagus.
                    It is this ring around the upper extremity of the alimentary canal which, in the
                    molluscous and articulated classes, we shall afterwards find to constitute the
                    most uniform and most essential portion of the nervous system. The Medusae, just
                    referred to, being almost of the same specific gravity with water, are easily
                    carried by currents, and moved about from place to place by the action of the
                    waves, or even (as in the case of <hi rend="italic">Holothuria physalis)</hi> by
                    the winds; but Carus and other writers have assuredly erred in doubting that
                    they execute a voluntary locomotion; for that they do so in a very decided and
                    graceful manner must be obvious to all who have attended to these animals in
                    their native haunts along the shores, or among the land-locked waters of the
                    beautiful firths of Scotland.</p>
                <p>The mysteries revealed by the glasses of Lecuwenhoeck were at first regarded as
                    beyond belief. The uncertainty of microscopical investigations, in consequence
                    of which so much was supposed to depend on the imagination of the beholder, was
                    alleged against them; and even at an after-period, when men of sober judgment
                    and the most industrious application had confirmed the experience of the
                    indefatigable Dutchman, the wit of Voltaire did not disdain to throw its cutting
                    sarcasm over the disciples of the “anguilles de la pâte et du vinaigre.” We hope
                    it is now admitted, that however frequently those who endeavour to expound the
                    mysteries of nature may fail in their attempts at elucidation, yet that there is
                    nothing in the manifold works of Omnipotent Wisdom which, if duly studied and
                    rightly understood, would not conduce to our wellbeing and happiness; and that a
                    single square inch of water, with its many millions of animalcular atoms, is in
                    truth as wonderful a work of divine intelligence, and as interesting a field for
                    human investigation, as the starry galaxy of heaven.</p>

                    refuse to recognise, amid so many wonders, the “Good Supreme” from whom these
                    and other mightier wonders have proceeded? It is in the study of the subject
                    with which we are now engaged, and the analogous pursuits of physiology, where
                    the completion of the most perfect design and the happiest results of superhuman
                    forethought are so constantly manifested, that w <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi>
                    frequently meet, where we should least expect it, with the sneer of the sceptic,
                    or the impious ridicule of the unbeliever. ' How different are the sentiments ∙
                    of one who combines the piety of the Christian with the genius of the poet and
                    philosopher. “But about the time of its invention (the invention of the
                    telescope), another instrument was formed, which laid open a scene no less
                    wonderful, and rewarded the inquisitive spirit of man with a discovery which
                    serves to neutralize the whole of this argument. This was the microscope. The
                    one led me to see a system in every star; the other leads me to see a world in
                    every atom. The one taught me that this mighty globe, with the whole burden of
                    its people and of its countries, is but a grain of sand on the high field of
                    immensity; the other teaches me that every grain of sand may harbour within it
                    the tribes and the families of a busy population. The one told me of the
                    insignificance of the world I tread upon; the other redeems it from all its
                    insignificance; for it tells me, that in the leaves of every forest, and in the
                    flowers of every garden, and in the waters of every rivulet, there are worlds
                    teeming with life, and numberless as are the glories of the firmament. The one
                    has suggested to me, that beyond and above all that is visible to man, there may
                    lie fields of creation which sweep immeasurably along, and carry the impress of
                    the Almighty’s hand to the remotest scenes of the universe; the other suggests
                    to me, that within and beneath all that minuteness which the aided eye of man
                    has been able to explore, there may be a region of invisibles; and that, could
                    we draw aside the mysterious curtain which shrouds it from our senses, we might
                    then see a theatre of as many wonders as astronomy has unfolded, a universe
                    within the compass of a point so small as to elude all the powers of the
                    microscope, but where the wonder-working God finds room for the exercise of all
                    his attributes, where he can raise another mechanism of worlds, and fill and
                    animate them all with the evidence of his glory.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>Although we cannot hope to derive the same amusement or advantage from the study
                    of each of the animalcular species considered separately, as we do from the
                    consideration of the history of many of the higher animals, yet, in a
                    philosophical point of view, a knowledge of the general attributes of the class
                    presents several highly important objects; and their obscure origin, their
                    singular organization, and more singular mode of existence, cannot fail to
                    excite our unfeigned wonder and admiration. They can scarcely be described
                    otherwise than by a negation of all those characters which constitute the life,
                    power, and activity of other beings; they have no head, no eyes, no muscles, no
                    blood-vessels, no nerves, no determinate organs for respiration, generation, or
                    digestion—and yet they are endowed with life.</p>
                <p>The animal nature of the Infusoria has indeed been denied by many; but such is
                    the regular gradation from the most simply organized of the monadal forms to the

                    complicated structure of the Polypi, which present, under a remarkable aspect,
                    such unequivocal characters of animality, that it is impossible to draw the line
                    of demarcation; and if <hi rend="italic">we</hi> admit the life of the one we
                    can scarcely doubt that of the other. Yet many of the Infusoria appear to
                    present the very lowest conceivable point to which animal life can be
                    reduced.</p>
                <p>The structure of an animal, the individual existence of which is preserved by the
                    absorption of a circumambient fluid, and the continuance of whose species is
                    effected by the division or separation of a part of its own body, might, <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori,</hi> be supposed to be of the most simple kind. “We may
                    rest assured,” observes Lamarck, “that whenever an organic function is itself
                    unnecessary, the special organ by which it is usually performed will not be
                    found to exist.” It is indeed by considering the nature of the Infusoria that we
                    are enabled to form a proper idea of the simplest condition of animal life; and
                    the invention of the telescope was not of higher importance to the astronomer,
                    than that of the microscope to the physiological naturalist. There are few
                    subjects of reflection more interesting than the uses which philosophers of an
                    enlightened age have deduced and matured from the scanty knowledge of a
                    barbarous people. Glass, a material known it an early period to the Asiatic
                    nations, and once estimated at its weight in gold, has become in the hands of
                    Europeans of more value than the finest gold. Whoever polished the first lens
                    may be said to have laid the foundation of an instrument destined to discover
                    thousands of celestial worlds above and around us, and an unseen world of
                    wonders beneath our feet. “Indeed,” says Cuvier, “it could not be expected that
                    those Phoenician sailors vho saw the sand of the shores of Boetica transformed
                    by fire into a transparent glass, should have at once foreseen that this new
                    substance would prolong the pleasures of sight to the old; that it would one day
                    assist the astronomer in penetrating the depths of the heavens, and in numbering
                    the stars of the milky way; that it would lay open to the naturalist a miniature
                    world as populous, as rich in wonders, as that which alone seemed to have been
                    granted to his senses and his contemplation; in fine, that the most simple and
                    direct use of it would enable the inhabitants of the coast of the Baltic Sea to
                    build palaces more magnificent than those of Tyre and Memphis, and to cultivate,
                    almost under the frost of the polar circle, the most delicious fruits of the
                    torrid zone.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>The faculties of the most simple infusory animals, it has been observed, are
                    reduced to such as are common to all living beings, and to that <hi
                    rend="italic">irritability</hi> which results from their animal nature; and
                    their bodies are destitute of special organs, precisely because their extremely
                    limited faculties neither require nor admit of such organs being exercised. The
                    chief interest to be derived from the study of this class of beings results,
                    according to Lamarck, from the view with which such study presents us of the
                    ultimate point to which the organization of an animal is capable of being
                    reduced; and, among all the the wonders of the creation, he regards as the most
                    surprising the existence of animal life in such inconceivably frail and simple
                    bodies as the least complicated of the animalcular species. It is not, however,
                    to be said that “nature was incapable of forming special organs from the
                    naterials of these frail gelatinous bodies,” but rather that he all-wise Author
                    and Ruler of Nature has seen fit to form them in what to us may appear a
                    destitute and incomplete condition, merely because their structure does not
                    fulfil those other conditions which, erroneously, we have sought to establish as
                    the indispensable bases of animal life. They truly show how confined a knowledge
                    <hi rend="italic">our</hi> limited faculties enable us to gain of His unlimited
                    power; for they not only present no analogy to other more accustomed forms of
                    life, but almost seem to exist in direct opposition to those laws in accordance
                    with which we “live, move, and have our being.”</p>
                <p>Infusory animals, commonly so called, are found in the fresh and saline waters of
                    all countries. They occur both naturally, if we may use the term in a
                    contradistinctive sense, and as the apparent result of infused animal and
                    vegetable substances. According to Lecuwenhoeck, the milt of a eod-fish contains
                    more animalcules than there are individuals of the human race existing on the
                    face of the earth; and he calculated that 10,000 might be held within the bulk
                    of a grain of sand. The size of many bears the same relation to that of a mite
                    as the dimensions of a bee do to those of an elephant; and the most powerful
                    microscopes frequently discover nothing more than merely perceptible points in
                    motion. Flour and water made to the consistence of book-binders’ paste, exposed
                    in an open vessel, and frequently stirred to prevent the surface from growing
                    hard, will in a few days be found to contain millions of animalcules. The thin
                    pellicle which grows on the surface of an infusion of common black pepper also
                    produces an innumerable congregation of minute beings. Of these and others the
                    real origin is still exceedingly obseure; and both Müller and Spallanzani
                    maintained the improbable opinion that they fell from the air. Their subsequent
                    increase or multiplication is obviously effected in different and very singular
                    ways. Such as are spherical are usually propagated by minute portions, which,
                    though they burst from the anterior of the animalcule itself, cannot be called
                    eggs; and such as are of a depressed or flattened form continue their race by
                    <hi rend="italic">cuttings</hi> or divisions of their own bodies. We first
                    observe a line or groove, longitudinal or transverse, according to the species;
                    and ere long a notch or incision is perceptible at one or other or both of the
                    ends of that apparent line. This notch increases across or longitudinally, till
                    at last a portion is separated or cut off, or the original animal is divided
                    into two, and each assumes the form and nature of their mutual predecessor.
                    These new objects retain for some time their natural shape, and then in their
                    turn give rise to one or more individuals by a similar separation of parts.
                    Lamarek seems to be of opinion <hi rend="italic">(Philosophie Zoologique,</hi>
                    tome ii. p. 120 and 150) that this multiplication by division, and that by the
                    emission of gemmules or oviform portions, are modifications of one and the same
                    natural process ;—that substantially each is the result of an extension and
                    separation of parts, which take place when the parent individual has reached the
                    final term of its increase. It is in faet the same excess of nourishment’ and
                    growth of particular parts that, even in the higher classes, give rise to the
                    germ of separate life, physically considered, although in regard to these the
                    additional process of fecundation is required. It is the new light which may be
                    gathered from the observation of the minutest of the animalcular tribes that
                    renders their study both interesting and important to the physiologist; and it
                    is the belief of some, that a persevering study of the history of microscopical
                    animals will one day enable us to withdraw the mysterious veil which still
                    conceals from our view the most important secrets of nature.</p>
                <p>The systematic arrangement of animalcules which we propose to follow in this
                    place is nearly that of Lamarck, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193097979"

                    and Bruguičre. The French naturalist includes in his system only such species of
                    the same class described by Müller as are destitute of a mouth.</p>

                <p>The naked Infusoria are the smallest and simplest of those animals which are

                    indeed scarcely any proof of their animal life, except that they are moving
                    corpuscles, allied to the genus Volvox, the animality of which is undoubted.
                    They have neither mouth nor alimentary canal, nor any apparent organs. They live
                    by absorption, and arc found in tranquil, but rarely in limpid waters. They are

                    things as, they really are, that the species and genera of this class of beings
                    are frequently transposed and altered in their relative position and
                    arrangement, in consequence of the very dissimilar views which different

                <p>As it would be inconsistent with our present limits to describe more than a few

                    “How many kinds,” observes Mr Adams, “there may be of these invisibles, is yet
                    unknown, as they are discerned of all sizes, from those which are barely
                    invisible to the naked eye, to such as resist the force of the microscope, as
                    the fixed stars do that of the telescope, and, with the greatest powers hitherto

                    scope they assume the aspect of small gelatinous masses, which sometimes present
                    an oval form. In some the body seems composed of numerous smaller globules
                    united in one common mass. There is reason to suppose that these interior bodies
                    are afterwards propelled outwardly, and become separate individuals. The species
                    occur both in fresh and salt waters, and in vegetable infusions. They derive
                    their generic name from the manner in which they turn or revolve upon their
                    axis. Lecuwenhoeck describes an animalcule “a thousand times smaller than a

                    as it were upon a point, with the celerity of a spinning-top. The genus is

                    summer. The following is an account of it by Mr Baker. “There is no appearance
                    of either head, tail, or fins, and yet it moves in every direction, backwards,
                    forwards, up or down, rolling over and over like a bowl, spinning horizontally
                    like a top, or gliding along smoothly without turning itself at all; sometimes
                    its motions are very slow, sometimes very swift; and, when it pleases, it can
                    turn round as upon an axis very nimbly, without moving out of its place. The
                    body is transparent, except where the circular spots are placed, which are
                    probably its young.” Another authority states that this species is at first very
                    small, but increases to such a size that it may be discerned by the naked eye,
                    and that its interior is filled with small globules, which are smaller
                    animalcules, each of which contains within itself a still smaller generation,
                    all perceptible by means of powerful glasses. The lesser globules may be seen
                    escaping from the parent, and increasing ® size.</p>

                    animated seeds, which appear reciprocally to give rise to and proceed from
                    certain aquatic plants of the confervae kind. They are formed in a

                    for some time with a voluntary motion, throw out a root and a branch, become
                    genuine vegetables, poduce living seeds, and give birth to animals which, after
                    a similar change of form, speedily return again to the vegetable state. These

                    swam in the direction of that new organ, which, with the body itself, became

                    are nearly related to the following, but are less sinuous and irregular. Their

                    is pellucid, and appears as if filled with little bright vesicles, which differ
                    in size. Some have supposed them to be lesser animalcules which the Kolpoda has

                <p>The animalcules of this second principal order or divsion, though still
                    infinitely small, gelatinous, and transparent, are so far less simply organized
                    than their predecessors, inasmuch as they are furnished with salient parts, such
                    as hairs, horns, or tail-like appendages, or at least with such projecting
                    organs as, for want of more appropriate terms, we are obliged to designate by
                    those names. They multiply both by division and by the bursting forth of
                    internal germs. Though their essential fluids, and the living tissue which
                    contains them, are probably of a more compound nature than those of the naked
                    Infusoria, they have not yet reached that point of organization in which special
                    organs are developed for the performance of particular functions; and it is not
                    till we reach the higher class of Polypi that these are distinctly
                    perceptible.</p>
                <p>“Il parait,” observes Lamarck, “par les nombreuses espèces déjà connues et
                    publiées, que les Infusoires de cet ordre sont bien plus nombreux dans la nature
                    que les Infusoires nus. Cela doit être ainsi d’après les principes que je me
                    suis cru fondé à établir.</p>
                <p>“En effet, dans les Infusoires nus, l’origine encore trop récente des races qui
                    proviennent de celles, en petit nombre, qui furent générées spontanément, n’a
                    permis à la durée de la vie et aux circonstances qui ont influé sur ces races,
                    qu’une diversité peu considérable. Mais à mesure que la durée de la vie, que sa
                    transmission dans les individus qui se sont succédés en se multipliant, et que
                    les circonstances ont eu plμs de temps pour exercer leurs influences, les races
                    se sont diversifiées de plus en plus, et sont devenues plus nombreuses.</p>
                <p>“Cet ordre des choses, qu’il est facile de reconnoitre pour celui même de la
                    nature, nous fait sentir pourquoi les <hi rend="italic">Infusoires</hi> sont
                    bien moins diversifiés et moins nombreux que les <hi rend="italic">Polypes.</hi>
                    Effectivement, quoique nous ne connaissions pas probablement tous les
                    Infusoires, et que nous connaissions bien moins encore tous les Polypes, ce qui
                    est déjà connu de part et d’autre indique que la diversité des Polypes est
                    considérablement plus grande que des Infusoires. Aussi les Polypes sont plus

                <p>According to the views of Lamarck, this genus contains not only a great
                    proportion of the genus <hi rend="italic">Tricloda</hi> of Müller, but also the

                    in the slimy matter adhering to the sides of vessels in which either animal or
                    vegetable substances have been some time kept. That of which an account is given
                    by Mr Adams was found in the slime produced by water containing small fishes,
                    snails, &lt;⅛c. The body was something similar to that of a snail, but pointed
                    at one end, while from the other proceeded a long, slender, “and finely
                    proportioned neck, of a size suitable to the rest of the animal.” If we credit
                    Mr Baker, this animalcule, though its eyes are not discernible, plainly
                    demonstrates by its actions that it can see; for though multitudes swim about in
                    the same water, and its own progressive motion is <pb break="no"

                    against its neighbours, but directs its course with a dexterity “wholly
                    unaccountable should we suppose it destitute of sight. Its entire shape bears a
                    resemblance to that of a swan. See Plate XLVII. fig. 36 and 37. When alarmed, it
                    draws in its supposed neck, becomes more opaque, and moves about slowly with the
                    large end foremost. See fig. 38. After continuing for some time under this form,
                    it will put forth a kind of wheel machinery, the motions of which are alleged to
                    draw a current of water towards it from a considerable distance. After
                    frequently pushing out and pulling in this shorter head, sometimes with and
                    sometimes without the wheel-work, it will remain motionless, as if wearied or
                    worn out; and then its long head and neck or apex will be again slowly
                    protruded, after which it generally resumes its accustomed agility.</p>

                <p>This genus, as constituted by Müller, contains many species which bear no natural
                    relation to each other; but his characters are precise and definite, and
                    strictly applicable to those species which now form the genus as limited by
                    modern observers. They occur more rarely among annual and vegetable infusions
                    than in running streams and the waters of marshes. Their movements are for the
                    most part circular and very rapid. With the exception of a well-marked tail,
                    their organization is in every other respect extremely simple. If a mouth and
                    the rudiment of a stomach or alimentary canal exist in any of these animals,
                    such characters would remove them not only from the genus Cercaria, but from the
                    class Infusoria, as defined at the commencement of this treatise. <hi

                    report the observations of the venerable Lamarck (himself unfortunately now
                    deprived of sight) on this obscure subject "Ici, comme dans le genre suivant,
                    l’on est expose, d’après la petitesse extreme des individus, à rapporter à la

                <p>This genus forms the nucleus of the new family of Infusoria proposed by Μ. Bory
                    de St Vincent under the name of <hi rend="italic">Cercariées,</hi> and which
                    contains in all seven genera, the names and nature of which will be seen by
                    referring to the tabular view. Müller, who was not practically acquainted with
                    the spermatic animalcules, was attracted by the resemblance which some of the
                    Cercariae bore to the figures of those organic molecules in the works of his
                    predecessors. He did not, however, assert their identity; and probably perceived
                    that, although in their general aspect and mode of movement they resembled each
                    other, their peculiar and very different localities, and even the details of
                    their structure, rendered it advisable that they should be assigned to separate
                    genera.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The following

                    essential characters scarcely lie within the limits of human intelligence. The
                    observations and experiments of the English microscopical observers of last
                    century, thouugh they might amuse the general student, are too vague and
                    fanciful to be now regarded as parts of the assured history of animalcules. The
                    ultra-analogical reasoning on subjects of natural science with which we have
                    been lately favoured by such men as Oken and Geoffroy St Hilaire, are tame in
                    comparison with the inferences deduced by some of our older observers, who
                    describe with minuteness the head, eyes, mouth, jaws, throat, stomach,
                    intestines, and other parts of animalcules, which the improved glasses of modern
                    times do not reveal to the vision of not less patient inquirers. The recent
                    observations on the motions of the pollen of plants, which have puzzled the
                    modern philosophers, would have opposed but feeble barriers in the way of our
                    predecessors. “To discover,” says Buffon, “whether all the parts of animals, and
                    all the seeds of plants, contained moving organic particles, I made infusions of
                    the flesh of different animals, and of the seeds of more than twenty different
                    species of vegetables; and after remaining some days in close glasses, I had the
                    pleasure of seeing organic moving particles in all of them. In some they
                    appeared sooner, in others later; some preserved their motions for months, and
                    others soon lost it. Some at first produced large moving globules resembling
                    animals, which changed their figure, split, and became gradually smaller; others
                    produced only small globules, whose motions were extremely rapid; and others
                    produced filaments, which grew longer, seemed to vegetate, and then swelled and
                    poured forth torrents of moving globules.” It was from these and similar
                    observations that the theory arose proposed by Baron Munchausen (an ominous name
                    !). The Baron perceiving that these moving globules, after taking a little
                    exercise, began again to vegetate, drew the conclusion that they were first
                    animals and then plants; thus anticipating by more than half a century the
                    supposed discoveries of some modern physiologists. Which of them was first in
                    error it is perhaps of little consequence to inquire; and we allude to the
                    subject here rather in connection with some singular observations by Mr Ellis,
                    recorded in the 59th volume of the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions,</hi> than from its own intrinsic importance. His object was to
                    overturn Munchausen’s hypothesis, by showing that the supposed Zoo-carpes were
                    nothing more than “the seeds of that genus of fungi called <hi rend="italic"
                    >mucor</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mouldiness,</hi>” and that their motions were
                    caused by the attacks of myriads of animalcules! “Having at the request of Dr
                    Linnaeus made several experiments on the infusion of mushrooms in water, in
                    order to prove the theory of Baron Munchausen, that these seeds are first
                    animals and then plants, it appeared evidently that the seeds were put in motion
                    by very minute animalcules, which proceeded from the putrefaction of the
                    mushroom: for by pecking at these seeds, which are reddish, light, round bodies,
                    they moved them about with great agility in a variety of directions; while the
                    little .animals themselves were scarcely visible till the food they had eaten
                    had discovered them. The satisfaction I received from clearing up this point led
                    me into many other curious and interesting experiments. The ingenious Mr Needham
                    supposes these little transparent ramified filaments, and jointed or coralloid
                    bodies, which the microscope discovers to us on the surface of most animal and
                    vegetable infusions when they become putrid, to be zoophytes, or branched
                    animals; but to me they appear, after a careful scrutiny with the best glasses,
                    to be of that genus of fungi called <hi rend="italic">mucor</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">mouldiness,</hi> many of which Michellius has figured, and
                    Linnaeus has accurately described. Their vegetation is so amazingly quick, that
                    they may be perceived in the microscope even to grow and feed under the eye of
                    the observer. Mr Needham has pointed out to us a species that is very remarkable
                    for its parts of fructification (See <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans.</hi> vol.
                    xlv. tab. 5, fig. 3, <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> A). This, he says, proceeds from
                    an infusion of bruised wheat. I have seen the same species proceed from the body
                    of a dead fly, which was become putrid by lying floating for some time in a
                    glass of water where some flowers had been, in the month of August 1768. This
                    species of mucor sends forth a mass of transparent filamentous roots; from
                    whence arise hollow stems, that support little oblong oval seed-vessels, with a
                    hole on the top of each. From these I could plainly see minute globular seeds
                    issue forth in great abundance, with an elastic force, and turn about in the
                    water as if they were animated. Continuing to view them with some attention, I
                    could just discover that the putrid water which surrounded them was full of the
                    minutest animalcula; and that these little creatures began to attack the seeds
                    of the mucor for food, as I have observed before in the experiment on the seeds
                    of the larger kind of fungi or mushrooms. This new motion continued the
                    appearance of their being alive for some time longer; but soon after many of
                    them arose to the surface of the water, remaining there without <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193098057" xml:id="kp-eb0703-8057-0192"/>motion; and a succession of
                    them afterwards coming up, they united together in little thin masses, and
                    floated to 'the edge of the water, remaining there quite inactive during the
                    time of observation.” In like manner, the movements of the jointed coralloid
                    bodies which Mr Needham has named <hi rend="italic">chaplets</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">pearl necklaces</hi> are attributed to the attacks of their
                    animalcular enemies. “When a small portion of these branches and seeds are put
                    into a drop of the same putrid water upon which the scum floats, many of these
                    millions of little animalcula with which it abounds immediately seize them as
                    food, and turn them about with a variety of motions, as in the experiments on
                    the seeds of the common mushrooms, either singly, or two or three seeds
                    connected together; answering exactly to Mr Needham’s description, but evidently
                    without any motion of their own, and consequently not animated !”</p>
                <p>We shall conclude this subject with a short notice of another view of the matter,
                    which has resulted from some recent experiments and observations by our
                    celebrated botanist Robert Brown. While engaged in some inquiries regarding the
                    structure of the pollen of plants, and its mode of action on the pistillum of
                    phaenogamous tribes, that accurate observer had occasion to immerse in water
                    some particles taken from the full-grown anthers (previous to bursting) of <hi
                    rend="italic">Clarkia</hi><hi rend="italic">pulchella.</hi> Of these, he
                    perceived by the microscope that many were evidently in motion, and that their
                    motion consisted not only of a change of place in the fluid, but of a change of
                    form in themselves; that is to say, a contraction or curvature about the middle
                    of one side, accompanied by a corresponding enlargement or convexity on the
                    other, frequently occurred. The particles were seen, in a few instances, to turn
                    on their longer axis; and their general motions were of such a nature as to
                    produce the conviction in Mr Brown’s mind that they did not arise either from
                    currents or evaporation of the fluid, but were proper to the particles
                    themselves. Having ascertained that motion existed in the pollen of all the
                    living plants which he examined, he next inquired whether, and for what length
                    of time, this singular property was retained after the death of the plant.
                    Specimens were experimented on, which had been dried and preserved in an
                    herbarium for 100 years, and the moving molecules or small spherical bodies were
                    still perceived in considerable numbers. “The very unexpected fact,” says Mr
                    Brown, “of seeming vitality retained by those minute particles so long after the
                    death of the plant, would not perhaps have materially lessened my confidence in
                    the supposed peculiarity; but I at the same time observed, that on bruising the
                    ovula or seeds of Equisetum, which at first happened accidentally, I so greatly
                    increased the number of moving particles, that the source of the added quantity
                    could not be doubted. I found also, on bruising first the floral •leaves of
                    mosses, and then aU other parts of those plants, that I readily obtained similar
                    particles, not in equal quantity indeed, but equally in motion. My supposed test
                    of the male organ was therefore necessarily abandoned. Reflecting on all the
                    facts with which I had now become acquainted, I was disposed to believe that the
                    minute spherical particles or molecules of apparently uniform size, first seen
                    in the advanced state of the pollen of Onagrariae, and most other phaenogamous
                    plants,—then in the antherae of mosses, and on the surfaces of the bodies
                    regarded as the stamina of Equisetum,—and, lastly, in bruised portions of other
                    parts of the same plants,—were in reality the supposed constituent or elementary
                    molecules of organic bodies, first so considered by Buffon and Needham, then by
                    Wrisberg with greater precision, soon after and still more particularly by
                    Müller, and very recently by Dr Müne Edwards, who has revived the doctrine, and
                    supported it with much interesting detail. I now, therefore, expected to find
                    these molecules in all organic bodies; and accordingly, on examining the <hi
                    rend="subscript"> var</hi> i.∖ ous animal and vegetable tissues, whether living
                    or dead, they were always found to exist; and merely by bruis, ing these
                    substances in water, I never failed to disengage the molecules in sufficient
                    numbers to ascertain their apparent identity in size, form, and motion, with the
                    smaller particles of the grains of the pollen. I <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> χ.
                    amined also various products of organic bodies, particularly the gum raisins,
                    and substances of vegetable origin, extending my inquiry even to pit-coal; and
                    in all these bodies molecules were found in abundance. I remark here also,
                    partly as a caution to those who may hereafter engage in the same inquiry, that
                    the duct or soot deposited on all bodies in such quantity, especiallyiu London,
                    is entirely composed of these molecules. One of the substances examined was a
                    specimen of fossil wood, found in Wiltshire oolite, in a state to burn with
                    flame; and as I found these molecules abundantly and in motion in this specimen,
                    I supposed that their existence, though in smaller quantity, might be
                    ascertained in mineralized vegetable remains. With this view, a minute portion
                    of silicified wood, which exhibited the structure of coniferas, was bruised, and
                    spherical particles, or molecules in all respects like those so frequently
                    mentioned, were readily obtained from it; in such quantity, however, that the
                    whole substance of the petrifaction seemed to be formed of them. But hence I
                    inferred that these molecules were not limited to organic bodies, nor even to
                    their products. To establish the correctness of the inference, and to ascertain
                    to what extent the molecules existed in mineral bodies, became the next object
                    of inquiry. The first substance examined was a minute fragment of window-glass,
                    from which, when merely bruised on the stage of the microscope, I readily and
                    copiously obtained molecules, agreeing in size, form, and motion, with those
                    which I had already seen. I then proceeded to examine, and with similar results,
                    such minerals as I either had at hand or could readily obtain, including several
                    of the simple earths and metals, with many of their combinations. Rocks of all
                    ages, including those in which organic remains have never been found, yielded
                    the molecules in abundance. Their existence was ascertained in each of the
                    constituent minerals of granite, a fragment of the sphinx being one of the
                    specimens examined. To mention all the mineral substances in which I have found
                    these molecules would be tedious; and I shall confine myself, in this summary,
                    to an enumeration of a few of the most remarkable. These were both of aqueous
                    and igneous origin, as travertine, stalactites, lava, obsidian, pumice, volcanic
                    ashes, andme-teorites from various localities. Of metals I may mention
                    manganese, nickel, plumbago, bismuth, antimony, and arsenic. In a word, in every
                    mineral which I could reduce to powder sufficiently fine to be temporarily
                    suspended in water, I found these molecules more or less copiously; and in some
                    cases, more particularly in siliceous crystals, the whole body submitted to
                    examination appeared to be composed of them.”</p>
                <p>There were three points of importance which ΙVIr Brown was anxious to ascertain
                    regarding these molecules, viz. their form, whether they were of uniform size,
                    and their absolute magnitude. He seems, however, not to have been entirely
                    satisfied with his determination on any of these points. As to form, he states
                    the molecules to be spherical. ∙ His manner of estimating the absolute magnitude

                    inadmissible. The results can only be regarded as approximate, but Mr Brown is
                    disposed to believe that the molecule is of uniform size, though, as existing in
                    various substances, and examined in circumstances more or less favourable, he
                    regards it necessary to state that its diameter appeared to vary from ⅟ <hi

                    summary from the pen of Mr Brown contains the renewed expression of that
                    gentleman’s opinion, matured by some recent experiments on the subject of active
                    molecules. “That extremely minute particles of solid matter, whether obtained
                    from organic or inorganic substances, when suspended in pure water or in some
                    other aqueous fluids, exhibit motions for which I am unable to account, and
                    which, from their irregularity and seeming independence, resemble in a
                    remarkable degree the less rapid motions of some of the simplest animalcules of
                    infusions. That the smallest moving particles observed, and which I have termed

                    considerably greater and various size, and either of similar or of very
                    different figure, also present analogous motions in like circumstances. I have
                    formerly stated my belief that these motions of the particles neither arose from
                    currents in the fluid containing them, nor depended on that intestine motion
                    which may be supposed to accompany its evaporation. These causes of motion,
                    however, either singly or combined with others,—as the attractions and
                    repulsions among the particles themselves, their unstable equilibrium in the
                    fluid in which they are suspended, their hygrometrical or capillary action, and
                    in some cases the disengagement of volatile matter, or of minute
                    air-bubbles,—have been considered by several writers as sufficiently accounting
                    for the appearances. Some of the alleged causes here stated, with others which I
                    have considered it unnecessary to mention, are not likely to be overlooked, or
                    to deceive observers of any experience in microscopical researches; and the
                    insufficiency of those enumerated may, I think, be satisfactorily shown by means
                    of a very simple experiment. This experiment consists in reducing the drop of
                    water containing the particles to microscopic minuteness, and prolonging its
                    existence by immersing it in a transparent, fluid of inferior specific gravity,
                    with which it is not miscible, and in which evaporation is extremely slow. If to
                    almond oil, which is a fluid having these properties, a considerably smaller
                    proportion of water, duly impregnated with particles, be added, and the two
                    fluids shaken or triturated together, drops of water of various sizes, from ⅟th

                    immediately produced. Of these, the most minute necessarily contain but few
                    particles, and some may be occasionally observed with one particle only. In this
                    manner minute drops, which, if exposed to the air, would be dissipated in less
                    than a minute, may be retained for more than an hour. But in all the drops thus
                    formed and protected, the motion of the particles takes place with undiminished
                    activity, while the principal causes assigned for that motion, namely,
                    evaporation and their mutual attraction and repulsion, are either materially
                    reduced or absolutely null.”</p></note> (T.)</p>
