                <p><label type="entry">ARCH</label>.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Arch,</hi> in building, is an artful disposition and
                    adjustment of several stones or bricks, generally in a bow-like form, by which
                    their weight produces a mutual pressure and abutment; so that they not only
                    support each other, and perform the office of an entire lintel, but may be
                    extended to any width, and made to carry the most enormous weights.</p>
                <p>2. In those mild climates which seem to have been the first inhabited parts of
                    this globe, mankind stood more in need of shade from the sun than of shelter
                    from the inclemency of the weather. A very small addition to the shade of the
                    woods served them for a dwelling. Sticks laid across from tree to tree, and
                    covered with brushwood and leaves, formed the first houses in those delightful
                    regions. As population and the arts improved, these huts were gradually refined
                    into commodious dwellings. The materials were the same, but more artfully put
                    together. At last agriculture led the inhabitants out of the woods into the open
                    country. The connection between the inhabitant and the soil became now more
                    constant and more interesting. The wish to preserve this connection was natural,
                    and fixed establishments followed of course. Durable buildings were more
                    desirable than those temporary and perishable cottages—stone was substituted for
                    timber.</p>
                <p>But as these improved habitations were gradual refinements on the primitive hut,
                    traces of its construction remained, even when the choice of more durable
                    materials made it in some measure inconvenient. Thus it happened, that while a
                    plain building, intended for accommodation only, consisted of walls, pierced
                    with the necessary doors and windows, an ornamented building had, superadded to
                    these essentials, columns, with the whole apparatus of entablature borrowed from
                    the wooden building, of which they had been essential parts, gradually rendered
                    more suitable to the purposes of accommodation and elegance.</p>
                <p>3. This view of ornamental architecture will go far to account for some of the
                    more general differences of national style which may be observed in different
                    parts of the world. The Greeks borrowed many of their arts from their Asiatic
                    neighbours, who had cultivated them long before. It is highly probable that
                    architecture travelled from Persia into Greece. In the ruins of Shushan,
                    Persepolis, or Tchelminar, are to be seen the first models of every thing that
                    distinguishes the Grecian architectures. There is no doubt, we suppose, among
                    the learned, as to the great priority of these monuments to any thing that
                    remains in Greece; especially if we take into account the tombs on the
                    mountains, which have every appearance of greater antiquity than the remains of
                    Persepolis. In those tombs we see the whole <hi rend="italic">ordonnance</hi> of
                    column and entablature, just as they began to deviate from their first and
                    necessary forms in the wooden buildings. We have the architrave, frieze, and
                    cornice; the far-projccting mutules of the Tuscan and Doric orders; the
                    modillions no less distinct; the rudiments of the Ionic capital; the Corinthian
                    capital in perfection, pointing out the very origin of this ornament, viz. a
                    number of long, graceful leaves tied round the head of the column with a fillet
                    (a custom which we know to have been common in their temples and banqueting
                    rooms). Where the distance between the columns is great, so that each had to
                    support a weight too great for one tree, we see the columns clustered or fluted,
                    &amp;c. In short, we see every thing of the Grecian architecture but the sloped
                    roof or pediment—a thing not wanted in a country where it hardly ever rains.</p>
                <p>4. The ancient Egyptian architecture seems to be a refinement on the hut built of
                    clay, or unburnt bricks, mixed with straw—every thing is massive, clumsy, and
                    timid-small intercolumniations, and hardly any projections.</p>
                <p>5. The Arabian architecture seems a refinement on the tent. A mosque is like a
                    little camp, consisting of a number of little bell tents, stuck close together
                    round a great one. A caravansery is a court surrounded by a row oı such tents,
                    each having its own dome. The Greek churcn of St Sophia at Constantinople has
                    imitated this in some degree; and the copies from it, which have been multiplied
                    in Russia as the sacred form for a Christian fhurch, have added to the original
                    model of clustered tents in the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193100488"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-0488-0379"/>iciest manner. We are sometimes disposed to think
                    that the painted glass (a fashion brought from the East) was an imitation of the
                    painted hangings of the Arabs.</p>
                <p>6. The Chinese architecture is an evident imitation of a wooden building. Sir
                    George Staunton says, that the singular form of their roofs is a <hi
                    rend="italic">professed</hi> imitation of the cover of a square tent.</p>
                <p>In the stone buildings of the Greeks, the roofs were imitations of the wooden
                    ones; hence the lintels, flying cornices, ceilings in compartments, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>' 7. The pediment of the Greeks seems to have suggested the greatest improvement
                    in the art of building. In erecting their small houses, they could hardly fail
                    to observe occasionally, that when two rafters were laid together from the
                    opposite walls, they would, by leaning on each other, give mutual support, as in
                    Plate LII. fig. 1. Nor is it unlikely that such a situation of stones as is
                    represented in fig. 2 would not unfrequently occur by accident to masons. This
                    could hardly fail of exciting a little attention and reflection. It was a pretty
                    obvious reflection, that the stones A and C, by overhanging, leaned against the
                    intermediate stone B, and gave it some support, and that B cannot get down
                    without thrusting aside A and C, or the piers which support them. This was an
                    approach to the theory of an arch; and if this be combined with the observation
                    of fig. 1, we get the disposition represented in fig. 3, having a perpendicular
                    joint in the middle, and the <hi rend="italic">principle of the arch</hi> is
                    completed. Observe that this is quite different from the principle of the
                    arrangement in fig. 2. In that figure the stones act as wedges, and one cannot
                    get down without thrusting the rest aside. The same principle obtains in fig.
                    4∙, consisting of five archstones; but in fig. 3 the stones B and C support each
                    other by their mutual pressure (independent of their own weight), arising from
                    the tendency of each lateral pair to fall outwards from the pier. This is the
                    principle of the arch, and would support the key-stone of fig. 4*, although each
                    of its joints were perpendicular, by reason of the great friction arising from
                    the horizontal thrust exerted by the adjoining stones.</p>
                <p>This was a most important discovery in the art of building; for now a building of
                    any width may be roofed with stone.</p>
                <p>8. We are disposed to give the Greeks the merit of this discovery; for we observe
                    arches in the most ancient buildings of Greece, such as the temple of the sun at
                    Athens, and of Apollo at Didymos—not indeed as roofs to any apartment, nor as
                    parts of the ornamental design, but concealed in the walls, covering drains or
                    other necessary openings; and we have not found any <hi rend="italic">real</hi>
                    arches in any monuments of ancient Persia or Egypt. Sir John Chardin speaks of
                    numerous and extensive subterranean passages at Tchelminar, built of the most
                    exquisite masonry, the joints so exact, and the stones so beautifully dressed,
                    that they look like one continued piece of polished marble; but he nowhere says
                    that they are arched—a circumstance which we think he would not have omitted: no
                    arched door or window is to be seen. Indeed one of the tombs is said to be
                    arch-roofed, but it is all of one solid rock. No trace of an arch is to be seen
                    in the ruins of ancient Egypt; even a wide room is covered with a single block
                    of stone. In the pyramids, indeed, there are two galleries whose roofs consist
                    of many pieces; but their construction puts it beyond doubt that the builder did
                    not know what an arch was; for it is covered in the manner represented in fig.
                    5, where every projecting piece is more than balanced behind, so that the whole
                    awkward mass could have stood on two pillars. The Greeks, there- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0r</hi> e, seem entitled to the honour of the invention. The
                    arched dome, however, seems to have arisen in Etruria, and originated in all
                    probability from the employment of the augurs, whose business it was to observe
                    the flight of birds. Their stations for this purpose were <hi rend="italic"
                    >templa,</hi> so called <hi rend="italic">a ternplando,</hi> on the summits of
                    hills. To shelter such a person from the weather, and at the same time allow him
                    a full prospect of the country around him, no building was so proper as a dome
                    set on columns; which accordingly is the figure of a temple in the most ancient
                    monuments of that country. We do not recollect a building of this kind in Greece
                    except that called the <hi rend="italic">Lanthorn of Demosthenes,</hi> which is
                    of very late date; whereas they abounded in Italy. In the later monuments and
                    coins of Italy or of Rome we commonly find the Etruscan dome and the Grecian
                    temple combined; and the famous Pantheon was of this form, even in its most
                    ancient state.</p>
                <p>9. It does not appear that the arch was considered as a part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">ornamental</hi> architecture of the Greeks during the time of
                    their independency. It is even doubtful whether it was employed in roofing their
                    temples. In none of the <hi rend="italic">ancient</hi> buildings where the roof
                    is gone can there be seen any rubbish of the vault or mark of the spring of the
                    arch. It is not unfrequent, however, after the Roman conquests, and may be seen
                    in Athens, Delos, Palmyra, Balbeck, and other places. It is very frequent in the
                    magnificent buildings of Rome; such as the Coliseum, the baths of Diocletian,
                    and the triumphal arches, where its form is evidently made the object of
                    attention. But its chief employment was in bridges and aqueducts; and it is in
                    these works that its immense utility is the most conspicuous: for by this happy
                    contrivance a canal or a road may be carried across any stream, where it would
                    be almost impossible to erect piers sufficiently near to each other for carrying
                    lintels. Arches have been executed 130 feet wide, and their execution
                    demonstrates that they may be made four times as wide.</p>
                <p>10. As such stupendous arches are the greatest performances of the masonic art,
                    so they are the most difficult and delicate. "When we reflect on the immense
                    quanti y of materials thus suspended in the air, and compare this with the small
                    cohesion which the firmest cement can give to a building, we shall be convinced
                    that it is not by the force of the cement that they are kept together; they
                    stand fast only in consequence of the proper balance of all their parts.
                    Therefore, in order to erect them with a well-founded confidence of their
                    durability, this balance should be well understood and judiciously employed. We
                    doubt not but that this was understood in some degree by the engineers of
                    antiquity; but they have left us none of their knowledge. They must have had a
                    great deal of mechanical knowledge before they could erect the magnificent and
                    beautiful buildings whose ruins still enchant the world; but they kept it among
                    themselves. We know that the Dionysiacs of Ionia were a great corporation of
                    architects and engineers, who undertook and even monopolized the building of
                    temples, stadiums, and theatres, precisely as the fraternity of masons in the
                    middle ages monopolized the building of cathedrals and conventual churches.
                    .Indeed the Dionysiacs resembled the mystical fraternity now called free-masons
                    in many important particulars. They allowed no strangers to interfere in their
                    employment; they recognised each other by signs and tokens; they professed
                    certain mysterious doctrines, under the tuition and tutelage of Bacchus, to whom
                    they built a magnificent temple at Teos, where they celebrated his mysteries as
                    solemn festivals; and they called all other men profane because not admitted to
                    these mysteries. But their chief mysteries and most important secrets seem to be
                    their mechanical and mathematical sciences, or all that academical knowledge
                    which forms the regular education of a civil engineer.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193100501" xml:id="kp-eb0703-0501-0380"/>
                <p>We know that the temples of the gods and the theatres required an immense
                    apparatus of machinery for the celebration of some of their mysteries; and that
                    the Dionysiacs contracted for those jobs, even at far distant places, where they
                    had not the privilege of building the edifice which was to contain them. This is
                    the most likely way of explaining the very small quantity of mechanical
                    knowledge that is to be met with in the writings of the ancients. Even Vitruvius
                    does not appear to have been of the fraternity, and speaks of the Greek
                    architects in terms of respect next to veneration. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Collegium Murario-rum,</hi> or incorporation of masons at Rome, does not seem
                    to have shared the secrets of the Dionysiacs.</p>
                <p>11. The art of building arches has been most assiduously cultivated by the
                    associated builders of the middle ages of the Christian church, both Saracens
                    and Christians, and they seem to have indulged in it with fondness: they
                    multiplied and combined arches without end, placing them in every possible
                    situation. ∙</p>
                <p>12. Having studied this branch of the art of building with so much attention,
                    they were able to erect the most magnificent buildings with materials which a
                    Greek or Roman architect could have made little or no use of. There is
                    infinitely more scientific skill displayed in a Gothic cathedral than in all the
                    buildings of Greece and Rome. Indeed these last exhibit very little knowledge of
                    the mutual balance of arches, and are full of gross blunders in this respect;
                    nor could they have resisted the shock of time so long, had they not been almost
                    solid masses of stone, with no more cavity than was indispensably necessary.</p>
                <p>13. Anthemius and Isidorus, whom the Emperor Justinian had selected as the most
                    eminent architects of Greece, for building the celebrated church of St Sophia at
                    Constantinople, seem to have known very little of this matter. Anthemius had
                    boasted to Justinian that he would outdo the magnificence of the Roman Pantheon,
                    for he would hang a greater dome than it aloft in the air. Accordingly he
                    attempted to raise it on the heads of four piers, distant from each other about
                    115 feet, and about the same height. He had probably seen the magnificent
                    vaultings of the temple of Mars the Avenger, and the temple of Peace at Rome,
                    the thrusts of which are withstood by two masses of solid wall, which join the
                    side walls of the temple at right angles, and extend sidewise to a great
                    distance. It was evident that the walls of the temple could not yield to the
                    pressure of the vaulting without pushing these immense buttresses along their
                    foundations. He therefore placed four buttresses to aid his piers. They are
                    almost solid masses of stone, extending at least ninety feet from the piers to
                    the north and to the south, forming as it were the side walls of the cross. They
                    effectually secured them from the thrusts of the two great arches of the nave
                    which support the dome; but there was no such provision against the push of the
                    great north and south arches. Anthemius trusted for this to the half dome which
                    covered the semicircular east end of the church, and occupied the whole eastern
                    arch of the great dome. But when the dome was finished, and had stood a few
                    months, it pushed the two eastern piers with their buttresses from the
                    perpendicular, making them lean to the eastward, and the dome and half dome fell
                    in. Isidorus, who succeeded to the charge on the death of Anthemius,
                    strengthened the piers on the east side by filling up some hollows, and again
                    raised the dome. But things gave way before it was closed; and while they were
                    building in one part, it was falling in in another. The pillars and walls of the
                    eastern semicirc⅛lar end were much shattered by this time. - Isidorus seeing
                    that they could give no resistance to the push which was so evidently directed
                    that way, erected some elumsy buttresses on the east wall of the square which
                    surrounded the whole Greek cross, and was roofed in with it, forming a sort of
                    cloister round the whole. These buttresses, spanning over this cloister, leaned
                    against the piers of the dome, and thus opposed the thrusts of the great north
                    and south arches The dome was now turned for the third time, and many
                    contrivances were adopted for making it extremely light. It was made offensively
                    flat, and, except the ribs, was roofed with pumice stone; but, notwithstanding
                    these precautions, the arches settled so as to alarm the architects and they
                    made all sure by filling up the whole from top to bottom with areades in three
                    stories. The lowest arcade was very lofty, supported by four noble marble
                    columns and thus preserved in some measure the church in the form of a Greek
                    cross. The story above formed a gallery for the women, and had six columns in
                    front, so that they did not bear fair on those below. The third story was a dead
                    wall filling up the arch, and pierced with three rows of small, ill-shaped
                    windows. In this unworkmanlike shape it. has stood till now, and is the oldest
                    church in the world; but it is an ugly mis-shapen mass, more resembling an
                    overgrown potter’s kiln, surrounded with furnaces pierced and patched, than a
                    magnificent temple. We have been thus particular in our account of it, because
                    this history of the building shows that the ancient architects had acquired no
                    distinct notions of the action of arches. Almost any mason of our time would
                    know, that as the south arch would push the pier to the eastward, while the east
                    arch pushed it to the southward, the buttress which was to withstand these
                    thrusts must not be placed on the south side of the pier, but on the southeast
                    side, or that there must be an eastern as well as a southern buttress.</p>
                <p>14. No such blunders are to be seen in a Gothic cathedral. Some of them appear,
                    to a careless spectator, to be very massive and elumsy; but when judiciously
                    examined, they will be found very bold and light, being pierced in every
                    direction by arcades; and the walls are divided into cells like a honeycomb, so
                    that they are very stiff, while they are very light.</p>
                <p>15. About the middle, or rather towards the end, of last century, when the
                    Newtonian mathematics opened: the road to true mechanical science, the
                    construction of arches engrossed the attention of the first mathematicians. The
                    first hint of a principle that we have met with is Dr Hooke’s assertion, that
                    the figure into which a chain or rope, perfectly flexible, will arrange itself
                    when suspended from two hooks, is, when inverted, the proper form for an arch
                    composed of stones of uniform weight. This he affirmed on the principle, that
                    the figure which a flexible festoon of heavy bodies assumes, when suspended from
                    two points, is, when inverted, the proper form of an arch of the same bodies,
                    touching each other in the same points; because the force with which they
                    mutually press on each other in this last case are equal and opposite to the
                    forces with which they pull at each other in the case of suspension.</p>
                <p>This principle is strictly just, and may be extended to every case which can be
                    proposed. We recollect seeing it proposed in very general terms in 1759, when
                    plans were forming for Blackfriars Bridge in London; and since it is perhaps
                    equal in practical utility to the most elaborate investigations of the
                    mathematicians, our readers will not be displeased with a more particular
                    account of it in ^ <hi rend="superscript"> lis</hi> place.</p>
                <p>16. Let ABC (fig. 6) be a parcel of magnets of ally <hi rend="superscript">
                    e</hi> size and shape, and let us suppose that they adhere with great force by
                    any points of contact. They will compose such a flexible festoon as we have been
                    speaking of ∏</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193100514" xml:id="kp-eb0703-0514-0381"/>
                <p>suspended from the points A and C. If this figure be inverted, preserving the
                    same points of contact, they will remain in equilibrio. It will indeed be that
                    kind of equilibrium which will admit of no disturbance, and which may be called
                    a <hi rend="italic">tottering equilibrium.</hi> If the form be altered in the
                    smallest degree, by varying the points of contact (which indeed are points in
                    the <hi rend="italic">figure of equilibration),</hi> the magnets will no more
                    recover their former position than a needle, which we had made to stand on its
                    point, will regain its perpendicular position after it has been disturbed.</p>
                <p>But if we suppose planes <hi rend="italic">de, fg, hi,</hi> &amp;c. drawn through
                    the points of mutual contact <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,,</hi> each bisecting the
                    angle formed by the lines that unite the adjoining contacts <hi rend="italic"
                    >(f</hi><hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> for example, bisecting
                    the angle formed by <hi rend="italic">a b,</hi><hi rend="italic">b c),</hi> and
                    if we suppose that the pieces are changed for others of the same weights, but
                    having flat sides, which meet in the planes <hi rend="italic">de, fg,
                    hi∙&gt;</hi> &amp;c., it is evident that we shall have an arch of equilibration,
                    and that the arch will have some stability, or will bear a little change of form
                    without tumbling down: for it is plain that the equilibrium of the original
                    festoon obtained only in the points <hi rend="italic">a, b, e,</hi> of contact,
                    where the pressures were perpendicular to the touching surfaces; therefore, if
                    the curve <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi> still passes through the touching
                    surfaces perpendicularly, the conditions that are required for equilibrium still
                    obtain. The case is quite similar to that of the stability of a body resting on
                    a horizontal plane. If the perpendicular through the centre of gravity falls
                    within the base of the body, it will not only stand, but it will require some
                    force to push it over. In the original festoon, if a small weight be added in
                    any part, it will change the form of the curve of equilibration a little, by
                    changing the points of mutual contact This new curve will gradually separate
                    from the former curve as it recedes from A or C. In like manner, when the
                    festoon is set up as an arch, if a small weight be laid on any part of it, it
                    will bring the whole to the ground, because the shifting of the points of
                    contact will be just the contrary to what it should be to suit the new curve of
                    equilibration; but if the same weight be laid on the same part of the arch now
                    constructed with flat joints, it will be sustained if the new curve of
                    equilibration still passes through the touching surfaces.</p>
                <p>17. These conclusions, which are very obviously deducible from the principle of
                    the festoon, show ns, without any further discussion, that the longer the joints
                    are, the greater will be the stability of the arch, or that it will require a
                    greater force to break it down. Therefore it is of the greatest importance to
                    have the arch-stones as long as economy will permit; and this was the great use
                    of the ribs and other apparent ornaments in the Gothic architecture. The great
                    projections of those ribs augmented their stiffness, and enabled them to support
                    the unadorned compartments of the roof, composed of very small stones, seldom
                    above six inches thick. Many old bridges are still remaining, which are
                    strengthened in the same way by ribs.</p>
                <p>Having thus explained, in a very familiar manner, the stability of an arch, we
                    proceed to give the same popular account of the general application of the
                    principle.</p>
                <p>18. Suppose it be required to ascertain the form of an arch which shall have the
                    span AB (fig. 7), and the height 18, and which shall have a road-way of the
                    dimensions ' DE above it. Let the figuré ACDEB be inverted, so <hi
                    rend="superscript"> a</hi> ; <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi>. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t0</hi> form a figure AccřeB. Let a chain of uniform
                    thickness be suspended from the points A and B, and let it be of such a length
                    that its lower point will hang at, or rather a little below, <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> corresponding to F. Divide AB <hi rend="superscript"> lπt</hi> θ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3 n</hi> *miber of equal parts, in the points 1, 2, 3,
                    &amp;c. <hi rend="superscript"> an</hi> draw vertical lines, cutting the chain
                    in the corresponding points 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. Now take pieces of another chain,
                    and hang them on at the points 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. of the chain A∕B. This will
                    alter the form of the curve. Cut or trim these pieces of chain, till their lower
                    ends all coincide with the inverted road-way <hi rend="italic">cde.</hi> The
                    greater lengths that are hung on in the vicinity of A and B will pull down these
                    points of the chain, and cause the middle point <hi rend="italic">f</hi> (which
                    is less loaded) to rise a little, and will bring it near to its proper
                    height.</p>
                <p>It is plain that this process will produce an arch of perfect equilibration; but
                    some further considerations are necessary for making it exactly suit our
                    purpose. It is an arch of equilibration for a bridge that is so loaded that the
                    weight of the arch-stones is to the weight of the matter with which the haunches
                    and crown are loaded, as the weight of the chain A∕B is to the sum of the
                    weights of all the little bits of chain very nearly. But this proportion is not
                    known beforehand; we must therefore proceed in the following manner :—Adapt to
                    the curve produced in this way a thickness of the arch-stones as great as are
                    thought sufficient to insure stability; then compute the. weight of the
                    arch-stones, and the weight of the gravel or rubbish with which the haunches are
                    to be filled up to the road-way. If the proportion of these two weights be the
                    same with the proportion of the weights of chain, we may rest satisfied with the
                    curve now found; but if different, we can easily calculate how much must be
                    added equally to or taken from each appended bit of chain, in order to make the
                    two proportions equal. Having altered the appended pieces accordingly, we shall
                    get a new curve, which may perhaps require a very small trimming of the bits of
                    chain to make them fit the road-way. This curve will be very near to the curve
                    wanted.</p>
                <p>We have practised this method for an arch of 60 feet span and 21 feet high, the
                    arch-stones of which were only two feet nine inches long. It was to be loaded
                    with gravel and shivers. We made a previous computation, on the supposition that
                    the arch was to be nearly elliptical. The distance between the points 1, 2, 3,
                    &amp;c. were adjusted, so as to determine the proportion of the weights of chain
                    agreeable to the supposition. The curve differed considerably from an ellipse,
                    making a considerable angle with the verticals at the spring of the arch. The
                    real proportion of the weights of chain, when all was trimmed so as to suit the
                    road-way, was considerably different from what was expected. It was adjusted.
                    The adjustment made very little change in the curve. It would not have changed
                    it two inches in any part of the real arch. When the process was completed, we
                    constructed the curve mathematically. It did not differ sensibly from this
                    mechanical construction. This was very agreeable information; for it showed us
                    that the first curve, formed by about two hours’ labour, on a supposition
                    considerably different from the truth, would have been sufficiently exact for
                    the purpose, being in no place three inches from the accurate curve, and
                    therefore far within the joints of the intended arch-stones. Therefore this
                    process, which any intelligent mason, though ignorant of mathematical science,
                    may go through with little trouble, will give a very proper form for an arch
                    subject to any conditions.</p>
                <p>19. The chief defect of the curve found in this way is a want of elegance,
                    because it does not spring at right angles to the horizontal line; but this is
                    the case with all curves of equilibration, as we shall see by and by. It is not
                    material; for, in the very neighbourhood of the piers, we may give it any form
                    we please, because the masonry is solid in that place; nay, we apprehend that a
                    deviation from the curve of equilibration is proper. The construction of that
                    curve supposes that the pressure on every part of the arch is vertical; but
                    gravel, earth, and rub<pb break="no" facs="nls:193100527"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-0527-0382"/>bish, exert somewhat of a hydrostatical pressure
                    laterally 'in the act of settling, and retain it afterwards. This will require
                    some more curvature at the haunches of an arch to balance it; but what this
                    lateral pressure may be, cannot be deduced with confidence from any experiments
                    that we have seen. We are inclined to think, that if, instead of dividing the
                    horizontal line AB in the points I, 2, 3, &amp;c. we divide the chain itself
                    into equal parts, the curve will approach nearer to the proper form.</p>
                <p>20. After this familiar statement of the general principle, it is now time to
                    consider the theory founded on it more in detail. This theory aims at such an
                    adjustment of the position of the arch-stones to the load on every part of the
                    arch, that all shall remain in equilibrio, although the joints be perfectly
                    polished and without any cement. The whole may be reduced to two problems. The
                    first is to determine the vertical pressure or load on every point of a line of
                    a given form, which will put that line in equilibrio. The second is to determine
                    the form of a curve which shall be in equilibrio when loaded in its different
                    points, according to any given law.</p>
                <p>The whole theory is deducible from one principle, which will be found fully
                    developed in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Roof.</hi> It is this: when an
                    assemblage of beams or other pieces of solid matter AB, BC, CD, DE, fig. 8,
                    freely movable about its angles as so many joints, is retained in equilibrium by
                    the joint effect of the pressures produced by the weight of its parts, the
                    thrust at any angle, if estimated in a horizontal direction, is the same
                    throughout, and may be represented by any horizontal line BT; and that if a
                    vertical line QS be drawn through T, the thrust exerted at any angle D by the
                    piece CD, in its own direction, will then be represented by BR, drawn parallel
                    to CD; and in like manner, that the thrust in the direction ED is represented by
                    BS, &amp;c.; and, lastly, that the vertical thrust or loads at each angle B, C,
                    D, by which all these other pressures are excited, are represented by the
                    portions QC, CR, RS, of the vertical intercepted by those lines; that is, all
                    these pressures are to the uniform horizontal thrust as the lines which
                    represent them are toBT. The horizontal thrust, therefore, is a very proper
                    unit, with which we may compare all the others. Its magnitude is easily deduced
                    from the same proposition; for QS is the sum of all the vertical pressures of
                    the angles, and therefore represents the weight of the whole assemblage.
                    Therefore as QS is to BT, so is the weight of the whole to the horizontal
                    thrust.</p>
                <p>21. To accommodate this theory to the construction of a curvilinear arch vault,
                    let us first suppose the vault to be polygonal, composed of the chords of the
                    elementary arches. Let AVE (fig. 12) be a curvilinear arch, of which V is the
                    vertex, and VX the vertical axis, which we shall consider as the axis or
                    abscissa of the curve, while any horizontal line, such as HK, is an ordinate to
                    the curve. About any point C of the curve, as a centre, describe a circle BLD,
                    cutting the curve in B and D. Draw the equal chords CB, CD. Draw also the
                    horizontal line CF, cutting the circle in F. Describe a circle BCDQ passing
                    through B, C, D. Its centre 0 will be in a line COQ, which bisects the angle
                    BCD; and C <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> which touches this circle in C, will bisect
                    the angle <hi rend="italic">b</hi> C <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> formed by the
                    equal chords BC, CD. Draw CLP perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">cb,</hi> and DP
                    perpendicular to CD, meeting CL in P. Through L draw the tangent GLM, meeting CD
                    in G, and the vertical line CM in Μ. Draw the tangent F«, cutting the chords BC,
                    CD, in <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and the tangent to
                    the circle BCDQ in c. Lastly, draw <hi rend="italic">d</hi> N parallel to <hi
                    rend="italic">bc.</hi></p>
                <p>From what will be demonstrated in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Roof,</hi> it
                    appears that if BC, CD be two pieces of an equilibrated heavy polygon, and if CF
                    represent the horizontal thrust in every angle of the polygon, C <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> and C <hi rend="italic">b</hi> will severally represent the
                    thrusts exerted by the pieces DC BC, and that <hi rend="italic">bd,</hi> or CN,
                    will represent the weight lying on the angle BCD, by which those thrusts are
                    balanced. In the mean time the reader may, without that article understand the
                    nature of the equilibrium in the following manner. Produce <hi rend="italic"
                    >dC</hi> to o, so that Co may be equal to C <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> Draw <hi
                    rend="italic">bn</hi> to the vertical parallel to <hi rend="italic">d</hi> C,
                    and join <hi rend="italic">no.</hi> It is evident that <hi rend="italic"
                    >bnoC</hi> is a parallelogram, and that <hi rend="italic">n</hi> C (= <hi
                    rend="italic">bd)</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> CN. Now the thrust or support of
                    the piece BC is exerted in the direction C <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> while that
                    of DC is exerted in the direction C o. These two thrusts are equivalent to the
                    thrust in the diagonal <hi rend="italic">Cn;</hi> and it is with this compound
                    thrust that the load or vertical pressure CN is in <hi rend="italic"
                    >immediate</hi> equilibrium.</p>
                <p>22. Because <hi rend="italic">b</hi>CL, NCF are right angles, and FCL is common
                    to both, the angles óCF and MCI. are equal; therefore the right-angled triangles
                    6CF and MCI. are similar. And since CF is equal to CL, C6 is equal to CM. It is
                    evident that the triangles GCM and <hi rend="smallcaps">ćZCŃ</hi> are similar.
                    Therefore CG <hi rend="italic">'.,Cd</hi> = CM: CN = C <hi rend="italic">b</hi>:

                <p>CLG are right angles, and therefore equal, and the angle GCP is common to the two
                    triangles GCL, PCD, and CD is equal to CL, we have CG equal to CP; therefore

                    the diameter in Q, the opposite point of the circumference, and the angle DQC is
                    equal to DCc or <hi rend="italic">eCb</hi> (because <hi rend="italic">bCd</hi>
                    is bisected by the tangent), that is, to PCQ (because the right angles Z&gt;CP,
                    cCO are equal, and eDP is common). Therefore PQ is equal to PC; and if P0 be
                    drawn perpendicular to CQ, it will bisect it, and 0 is the centre of the circle
                    BCDQB.</p>
                <p>Now let the points B and D continually approach to C (by diminishing the radius
                    of the small circle), and ultimately coincide with it. It is evident that the
                    circle BCDQ is ultimately the equicurve circle, and that PC ultimately coincides
                    with OC, the radius of curvature. Also <hi rend="italic">Cb</hi><hi

                <p>It is further evident that CF is to <hi rend="italic">Cc</hi> as radius to the

                <p>This load on every elementary arch of the wall is commonly a quantity of solid
                    matter incumbent on that element of the curve, and pressing it vertically; and
                    it may be conceived as made up of a number of heavy lines standing vertically on
                    it. Thus, if the element Ee of the curve were lying horizontally, a little
                    parallelogram REer standing perpendicularly on it would represent its load. But
                    as this element Ee has a sloping position, it is plain that, in order to have
                    the same quantity of heavy matter pressing it vertically, the height of the

                    This may be illustrated by an example or two. For this purpose it will generally
                    be most convenient to assume the height above the vertex V for the unit of
                    computation. The thickness of the arch at the crown is commonly determined by
                    other circumstances. At the vertex the tangent to the arch is horizontal, and
                    therefore the cube of the secant is unity, or 1. Call the height of wall at the
                    crown H, and let the radius of curvature in that point be R, and its half-chord

                <p>It is very easy to see that if CV is an arch of 60°, and “c is ∙Ajth of λO, the

                    for the secant of CV is twice CO, and therefore Cc is eight times <hi

                <p>lhe dotted line <hi rend="italic">vger</hi> is drawn according to this calculus
                    or construction. It falls considerably below the horizontal line in the
                    neighbourhood of c; and then, passing <hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> ^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> y °bliquely through c, it rises rapidly to an
                    immeasurable height, because the vertical line through A is its asymptote. This
                    must evidently be the case with every curve which springs at right angles with a
                    horizontal line.</p>
                <p>• It is plain that if <hi rend="italic">vV</hi> be greater, all the other
                    ordinates of the curve <hi rend="italic">vger,</hi> resting on the circumference
                    AVE, will be greater in the same proportion, and the curve will cut the
                    horizontal line drawn through <hi rend="italic">v</hi> in some point nearer to
                    <hi rend="italic">v</hi> than c is. Hence it appears that a circular arch cannot
                    be put in equilibrio by building on it up to a horizontal line, whatever be its
                    span, or whatever be the thickness at the crown. We have seen that when this
                    thickness is only ⅛th of the radius, an arch of 120 degrees will be too much
                    loaded at the flanks. This thickness is much too small for a bridge, being only
                    ⅛th of the span CM, whereas it should have been almost double of this, to bear
                    the inequalities of weight that may occasionally be on it. When the crown is
                    made still thinner, the outline is still more depressed before it rises again.
                    There is therefore a certain span, with a corresponding thickness at the crown,
                    which will deviate least of all from a horizontal line. This is an arch of about
                    45 degrees, the thickness at the crown being about one fourth of the span, which
                    is extravagantly great. It appears in general, therefore, that the circle is not
                    a curve suited to the purposes of a bridge or an arcade, which requires an
                    outline nearly horizontal.</p>

                <p>It follows from this investigation, that the back or extrados of a parabolic arch
                    of equilibration must be parallel to the arch or soffit itself; or that the
                    thickness of the arch, estimated in a vertical direction, must be equal
                    throughout; or that the extrados is the "same parabola with the soffit or
                    intrados.</p>
                <p>We have selected these two examples merely for the simplicity and perspicuity of
                    the solutions, which have been effected by means of elementary geometry only,
                    instead of employing the analytical value of the radius of the osculatory
                    circle, viz. - <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi>-- <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">dxd-y</hi> have involved us at last in the doctrine of second
                    fluxions. We have also preferred simplicity to elegance in the investigation,
                    because we wish to instruct the practical engineer who may not be a proficient
                    in the higher mathematics.</p>
                <p>25. The converse of the problem, namely, to find the form of the arch when the
                    figure of the back of it is given, is the most usual question of the two, at
                    least in cases <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> which are most important and most
                    difficult. Of these, perhaps, bridges are the chief. Here the necessity of á'
                    road-way, of easy and regular ascent, confines us to an outline nearly
                    horizontal, to which the curve of the arch must be adapted. This is the most
                    difficult problem of the two; and we doubt whether it can be solved without
                    employing infinite approximating series instead of accurate values.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">ave</hi> (fig. 9) be the intended outline or extrados of
                    the arch AVE, and let <hi rend="italic">v</hi> Q, be the common axis of both

                <p>The figure for this proposition is exactly drawn according to these dimensions,
                    that the reader may judge of it as an object of sight. It is by no means
                    deficient in gracefulness, and is abundantly roomy for the passage of craft; so
                    that no objection can be offered against its being adapted on account of its
                    mechanical excellency.</p>
                <p>The reader will perhaps be surprised that we have made no mention of the
                    celebrated Catenarean curve, which is commonly said to be the best form for an
                    arch; but a little reflection will convince him, that although it is the only
                    form for an arch consisting of stones of equal weight, and touching each other
                    only in single points, it cannot suit an arch which must be filled up in the
                    haunches, in order to form a road-way. He will be more surprised to hear, after
                    this, that there is a certain thickness at the crown, which will put the
                    Catenarea in equilibrio, even with a horizontal road-way; but this thickness is
                    so great as to make it unfit for a bridge, being such that the pressure at the
                    vertex is equal to the horizontal thrust. This would have been about 37 feet in
                    the middle arch of Blackfriars Bridge. The only situation, therefore, in which
                    the Catenarean form would be proper, is an arcade carrying a height of dead
                    wall; but in this s .tuation it would be very ungraceful. Without troubling the
                    reader with the investigation, it is sufficient to inform him, that in a
                    Catenarean arch of equilibration the abscissa VH is to the abscissa <hi
                    rend="italic">v h,</hi> in the constant ratio of the horizontal thrust to its
                    excess above the pressure on the vertex</p>
                <p>27. Thus much will serve, we hope, to give the reader a clear notion of this
                    celebrated theory of the equilibrium of arches, one of the most delicate and
                    important applications of mathematical science. Volumes have been written on the
                    subject, and it still occupies the attention of mechanicians. But we beg leave
                    to say, with great deference to the eminent persons who have prosecuted this
                    theory, that their speculations have been of little service, and are little
                    attended to by the practitioner. Nay, we may add, that Sir Christopher Wren,
                    perhaps the most accomplished architect that Europe has seen, seems to have
                    thought it of little value; for, among the fragments which have been preserved
                    of his studies, there are to be seen some imperfect dissertations on this very
                    subject, m which he takes no notice of this theory, and considers the balance of
                    arches in quite another way. These are collected by the author of the account of
                    Sir Christopher Wren’s family. Th’s man’s great sagacity?</p>

                <p>and his great experience in building, and still more his experience in the
                    repairs of old and crazy fabrics, had shown him many things very inconsistent
                    with this theory, wbich appears so specious and safe. The general facts which
                    occur in the failure of old arches are highly instructive, and deserve the most
                    careful attention of the engineer; for it is in this state that their defects,
                    and the process of nature in their destruction, are most distinctly seen. We
                    venture to affirm, that a very great majority of these facts are irreconcilable
                    to the theory. The way in which circular arches commonly fail, is by the sinking
                    of the crown and the rising of the flanks. It will be found by calculation, that
                    in most of the eases it ought to have been just the contrary. But the clearest
                    proof is, that arches very rarely fail where their load differs most remarkably
                    from that which this theory allows. Semicircular arches have stood the power of
                    ages, as may be seen in the bridges of ancient Rome, and in the numerous arcades
                    which the ancient inhabitants have erected. Now,' all arches which spring
                    perpendicularly from the horizontal line require, by this theory, a load of
                    infinite height; and even to a considerable distance from the springing of the
                    arch, the load necessary for the theoretical equilibrium is many times greater
                    than what is ever laid on those parts; yet a failure in the immediate
                    neighbourhood of the spring of an arch is a most rare phenomenon, if it ever wns
                    observed. Here is a most remarkable deviation from the theory; for, as is
                    already observed, the load is frequently not the fourth part of what the theory
                    requires.</p>
                <p>28. Many other facts might be adduced which show great deviation from the
                    legitimate results of the theory. We hope to be excused, therefore, by the
                    mathematicians for doubting of the justness of this theory. We do not think it
                    erroneous, but defective, leaving out circumstances which we apprehend to be of
                    great importance; and we imagine that the defects of the theory have arisen from
                    the very anxiety of the mechanicians to make it perfect. The arch-stones are
                    supposed to be perfectly smooth or polished, and not to be connected by any
                    cement, and therefore to sustain each other merely by the equilibrium of their
                    vertical pressure. The theory insures this equilibrium, and this only, leaving
                    unnoticed any other causes of mutual action.</p>
                <p>The authors who have written on the subject say expressly that an arch which thus
                    sustains itself must be stronger than another which would not; because when, uı
                    imagination, we suppose both to acquire connection by cement, the first
                    preserves the influence of this connection unimpaired; whereas in the other,
                    part of the cohesion is wasted in counteracting the tendency of some parts to
                    break off from the rest by their want of equilibrium. This is a very specious
                    argument, and would be just, if the forces which are mutually exerted between
                    the parts of the arch in its settled state were merely vertical pressures, or,
                    where different, were inconsiderable in comparison with those which are really
                    attended to in the construction.</p>
                <p>But this is by no means the case. The forms which the uses for which arches are
                    erected oblige us to adopt, and the loads laid on the different points of the
                    arch, frequently deviate considerably from what are necessary for the
                    equilibrium of vertical pressures. The varying load <hi rend="superscript">

                    gravel, fat mould, and many substances in very general use for this purpose.
                    When this is the ease, the pressures sustained by the different parts of the
                    arch are often very inconsistent with the theory; a part of the arch is
                    overloaded and tends to fall in, but is prevented’ by the cement. This part of
                    the arch, therefore, acts on the remoter parts by the intervention of the parts
                    between, employing those intermediate parts as a kind of levers to break the
                    arch in a remote part, just as a lintel would be broken. We apprehend that a
                    mathematician would be puzzled how to explain the stability of an arch cut out
                    of a solid and uniform mass of rock. His theory considers the mutual thrusts of
                    the arch-stones as in the direction of the tangents to the arch. Why so? Because
                    he supposes that all his polished joints are perpendicular to those tangents.
                    But in the present case he has no existing joints; and there seems to be nothing
                    to direct his imagination in the assumption of joints, which, however, are
                    absolutely necessary for employing his theory, because, without a supposition of
                    this kind, there seems no conceiving any mutual abutment of the arch-stones. Ask
                    a common but intelligent mason, what notion he forms of such an arch? We
                    apprehend that he will consider it as no arch, but as a lintel, which may be
                    broken like a wooden lintel, and which resists entirely by its cohesion. He will
                    not readily conceive that, by cutting the under side of a stone lintel into an
                    arched form, and thus taking away more than half of its substance, he has
                    changed its nature of a lintel, or given it any additional strength. Nor would
                    there be any change made in the way in which such a mass of stone would resist
                    being broken down, if nothing were done but forming the under side into an arch.
                    If the lintel be so laid on the piers that it can be broken without its parts
                    pushing the piers aside (which will be the case if it lies on the piers with
                    horizontal joints), it will break like any other lintel; but if the joints are
                    directed downwards, and converging to a point within the arch, the broken stone
                    (suppose it broken at the crown by an overload in that part) cannot be pressed
                    down without forcing the piers outwards. Now, in this mode of acting, the mind
                    cannot trace any thing of' the statical equilibrium that we have proceeded on in
                    the foregoing theory. The two parts of the broken lintel seem to push the piers
                    aside in the same manner that two rafters push outwards the walls oŕLa house
                    when their feet arc not held together by a tie-beam. If the piers cannot be
                    pushed aside (as when the arch abuts on two solid rocks), nothing can press down
                    the crown which does not crush the stone.</p>
                <p>This conclusion will be strictly true if the arch is of such a form that a
                    straight line drawn from the crown to the pier lies wholly within the solid
                    masonry. Thus, if the vault consist of two straight stones, as in Plate LII.
                    fig. 1, or if it consist of several stones, as in Plate LIII. fig. 7, disposed
                    in two straight lines, no weight laid on the crown can destroy it in any other
                    way than by crushing it to powder.</p>
                <p>29. But when straight lines cannot be drawn from the overloaded part to the firm
                    abutments through the solid masonry, and when the cohesion of the parts is not
                    able to withstand the transverse strains, we must call the principles of
                    equilibrium to our aid; and, in order to employ them with safety, we must
                    consider how they are modified by the excitement of the cohering forces.</p>
                <p>The cohesion of the stones with each other by cement or otherwise has in almost
                    every situation a bad effect. It enables an overload at the crown, to break the
                    arch near the haunches, causing those parts to rise, and then to spread
                    outwards, just as a. Mansarde or Kirb roofwould do if the truss-beam which
                    connects the heads of the lower rafters were sawn through. This can be prevented
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193100579" xml:id="kp-eb0703-0579-0386"/> only by
                    loading that part more than is'requisite for equilibrium. It would be prudent to
                    do this to a certain degree, because it is by this cohesion that the crown
                    always becomes the weakest part of the arch, and suffers more by any occasional
                    load.</p>
                <p>We expect that it will be said in answer to all this, that the cohésion given by
                    the strongest cement that we can employ, nay the cohesion of the stone itself,
                    is a mere nothing in comparison with the enormous thrusts that are in a state of
                    continual exertion in the different parts of an arch. This is very true; but
                    there is another force which produces the same effect, and which increases
                    nearly in the proportion that those thrusts increase, because it arises from
                    them. This is the friction of the stones on each other. In dry freestone this
                    friction considerably exceeds one half of the mutual pressure. The reflecting
                    reader will see that this produces the same effect, in the case under
                    consideration, that cohesion would do; for while the arch is in the act of
                    failing, the mutual pressure of the arch-stones is acting with full force, and
                    thus produces a friction more than adequate to all the effects we have been
                    speaking of.</p>
                <p>30. When these circumstances are considered, we imagine that it will appear that
                    an arch, when exposed .to a great overload on the crown (or indeed on any part),
                    divides of itself into a number of parts, each of which contains as many
                    arch-stones as can be pierced (so to speak) by one straight line, and that it
                    may then be considered as nearly in the same situation with a polygonal arch of
                    long stones abutting on each other like so many beams in a Norman roof, but
                    without their braces and ties. It tends to break at all those angles; and it is
                    not sufficiently resisted there, because the materials with which the flanks are
                    filled up have so little cohesion, that the angle feels no load except what is
                    immediately above it; whereas it should be immediately loaded with all the
                    weight which is diffused over the adjoining side of the polygon. This will be
                    the case, even though the curvilinear arch be perfectly equilibrated. We
                    recollect some circumstances in the failure of a considerable arch, which may be
                    worth mentioning. It had been built of an exceedingly soft and friable stone,
                    and the arch-stones were too short. About a fortnight before it fell, chips were
                    observed to be dropping off from the joints of the arch-stones, about ten feet
                    on each side of the middle, and also from another place on one side of the arch,
                    about twenty feet from its middle. The masons in the neighbourhood
                    prognosticated its speedy downfall, and said that it would separate in those
                    places where the chips were breaking off. At length it fell; but it first split
                    in the middle, and about fifteen or sixteen feet on each side, and also at the
                    very springing of the arch. Immediately before the fall a shivering or crackling
                    noise was heard, and a great many chips dropped down from the middle, between
                    the two places from whence they had dropped a fortnight before. The joints
                    opened above at those new places above two inches, and in the middle of the arch
                    the joints opened below, and in about five minutes after this the whole came
                    down. Even this movement was plainly distinguishable into two parts. The crown
                    sunk a little, and the haunches rose very sensibly, and in this state it hung
                    for about half a minute. The arch-stones of the crown were hanging by their
                    upper corners: when these splintered off, the whole fell down.</p>
                <p>We apprehend that the procedure of nature was somewhat in this manner. Straight
                    lines can be drawn within the arch-stones from A (Plate LIII. fig. 8) to B and
                    D, and from these points to C and E. Each of the portions ED, DA, AB, BC, resist
                    as if they were of one stone, composing a polygonal vault EDABC. When this is
                    overloaded at A, A can descend in no other way than by pushing the angles B and
                    D outwards, causing the portions BC, DE, t <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> turn
                    round C and E. This motion must raise the points B and D, and cause the
                    arch-stones to press on each other at their <hi rend="italic">inner</hi> joints
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> This produced the copious
                    splintering at those joints immediately preceding the total downfall. The
                    splintering which happened a fortnight before arose from this circumstance, that
                    the lines AB and AD, along which the pressure of the overload was propagated,
                    were tangents to the soffit of the arch in the points F, H, and G, and therefore
                    the strain lay all on those corners of the arch-stones, and splintered a little
                    from off them till the whole took a firmer bed. The subsequent phenomena are
                    evident consequences of this distribution and modification of pressure, and can
                    hardly be explained in any other way, at least not on the theoretical principles
                    already set forth; for in this bridge the loads at B and D were very
                    considerably greater than what the equilibrium required; and we think that the
                    first observed splintering at H, F, and G, was most instructive, showing that
                    there was an extraordinary pressure at the inner joints in those places, which
                    cannot be explained by the usual theory.</p>
                <p>Not satisfied with this single observation after this way of explaining it
                    occurred to us, and not being able to find any similar fact on record, the
                    writer of this article got some small models of arches executed in chalk, and
                    subjected them to many trials, in hopes of collecting some general laws of the
                    internal workings of arches which finally produce their downfall. He had the
                    pleasure of observing the above-mentioned circumstances take place very
                    regularly and uniformly when he overloaded the models at A. The arch always
                    broke at some place B considerably beyond another point F, where the first
                    chipping had been observed. This is a method of trial that deserves the
                    attention both of the speculatist and the practitioner.</p>
                <p>If these reflections are any thing like a just account of the procedure of nature
                    in the failure of an arch, it is evident that the ingenious mathematical theory
                    of equilibrated arches is of little value to the engineer. We ventured to say as
                    much already, and we rested a good deal on the authority of Sir Christopher
                    Wren. He was a good mathematician, and delighted in the application of this
                    science to the arts. He was a celebrated architect, and his reports on the
                    various works committed to his charge show that he was in the continued habit of
                    making this application. Several specimens remain of his own methods of applying
                    them. The roof of the theatre of Oxford, the roof of the cupola of St Paul’s,
                    and in particular the mould on which he turned the inner dome of that cathedral,
                    are proofs of his having studied this theory most attentively. He flourished at
                    the very time that it occupied the attention of the greatest mechanicians of
                    Europe; but there is nothing to be found among his papers which shows that he
                    had paid much regard to it. On the contrary, when he has occasion to deliver his
                    opinion for the instruction of others, and to explain to the dean and chapter of
                    Westminster his operations in repairing that collegiate church, this great
                    architect considers an arch just as a sensible and sagacious mason would do, and
                    very much in the way that we have just now been treating it. (See <hi
                    rend="italic">Account of the Family of Wren,</hi> p∙ 356.) Supported therefore
                    by such authority, we would recommend this way of considering an arch to the
                    study or the mathematician; and we would desire the experienced mason to think
                    of the most efficacious methods for resisting this tendency of arches to rise in
                    the flanks. Unfortunately there seems to be no precise principle to point out
                    the place where this tendency is most remarkable·</p>
                <p>31. We are therefore highly pleased with the ingenious <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193100592" xml:id="kp-eb0703-0592-0387"/>contrivance of Mr Mylne, the
                    architect of Blackfriars Bridge in London, by which he determines this point
                    with precision, by making it impossible for the overloaded arch to spring in any
                    other place. Having thus confined the failure to a particular spot, he with
                    equal art opposes a resistance which he believes to be sufficient; and the
                    present condition of that noble bridge, which does not in any place show the
                    smallest change of shape, proves that he was not mistaken. Looking on this work
                    as the first, or at least the second, specimen of masonic ingenuity that is to
                    be seen in the world, we imagine that our readers will be pleased with a
                    particular account of its most remarkable circumstances.</p>
                <p>The span <hi rend="italic">k a</hi> (fig. 1) of the middle arch is 100 feet, and
                    its height OV is 40, and the thickness KV of the crown is six feet seven inches.
                    Its form is nearly elliptical; the part AVZ being an arch of a circle whose
                    centre is C, and radius 56 feet, and the two lateral portions A <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> B and Z <hi rend="italic">a</hi> E being arches described
                    with a radius of 35 feet nearly. The thickness of the pier at <hi rend="italic"
                    >a b</hi> is 19 feet. The thickness of the arch increases from the crown V to Y,
                    where it is eight or nine feet. All the arch-stones have their joints directed
                    to the centres of their curvature. The joints are all joggled, having a cubic
                    foot of hard stone let half-way into each. By this contrivance the joints cannot
                    slide, nor can any weight laid on the crown ever break the arch in that part if
                    the piers do not yield; for a straight line from the middle of KV to the middle
                    of the joint YI is contained within the solid masonry, and does not even come
                    near the inner joints of the arch-stones; therefore the whole resists like one
                    stone, and can be only broken by crushing it. The joint at Z is very nearly
                    perpendicular to a line ZF drawn to the outer edge of the foundation of the
                    pier. By this it was intended to take off all tendency of the pressure on the
                    joint <hi rend="italic">d</hi> Z to overset the pier; for if we suppose,
                    according to the theory of equilibration, that this pressure is necessarily
                    exerted perpendicularly to the joint, its direction passes through the fulcrum
                    at F, round which it is thought that the pier must turn in the act of
                    oversetting. This precaution was adopted in order to make the arch quite
                    independent of the adjoining arches; so that although any of them should fall,
                    this arch should run no risk.</p>
                <p>Still farther to secure the independence of the arch, the following construction
                    was practised to unite it into one mass, which should rise all together. All
                    below the line <hi rend="italic">α b</hi> is built of large blocks of Portland
                    stone, dovetailed with sound oak. Four places in each course are interrupted by
                    equal blocks of a hard stone called <hi rend="italic">Kentish rag,</hi> sunk
                    half-way in each course. These act as joggles, breaking the courses, and
                    preventing them from sliding laterally.</p>
                <p>The portion <hi rend="italic">a</hi> Y of the arch is joggled like' the upper
                    part. The interior part is filled up with large blocks of Kentish rag, forming a
                    kind of coursed rubble-work, the courses tending to the centres of the arch. The
                    under corner of each arch-stone projects over the one below it. By this form it
                    takes fast hold of the rubble-work behind it· Above this rubble there is
                    constructed the inverted arch I e G of Portland stone.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We know from good authority that the
                    counter-arch here spoken of, although originally intended, was never executed,
                    because it was not thought necessary. The notion was, however, excellent, and it
                    has, we believe, been actually executed in the Strand Bridge. We rather think
                    the joggling was also abandoned, and, as far as we can judge, was not likely to
                    be of any use.</p></note> This arch shares the pressure of the two adjoining
                    arches, along with the archstones in Y <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and in G <hi
                    rend="italic">b.</hi> Thus all tend together to compress and keep down the
                    rubble-work in the heart of this part of the pier. This is a very useful
                    precaution; for it often happens, that when the centres of the arches are struck
                    before the piers are built up to their intended heights, the thrust of the
                    arches squeezes the rubblework horizontally, after the mortar has set, but
                    before it has dried and acquired its utmost hardness. Its bond is broken by this
                    motion, and it is squeezed up, and never acquires its former firmness. This is
                    effectually prevented by the pressure exerted by the back of the inverted
                    arch.</p>
                <p>Above this counter-arch is another mass of coursed rubble, and all is covered by
                    a horizontal course of large blocks of Portland stone, abutting against the back
                    of the arch-stone ZI and its corresponding one in the adjoining arch. This
                    course connects the feet of the two arches, preserves the rubble-work from too
                    great compression, and protects it from soaking water. This last circumstance is
                    important; for if the water which falls on the road-way is not carried off in
                    pipes, it soaks through the gravel or other rubbish, rests on the mortar, and
                    keeps it continually wet and soft. It cannot escape through the joints of good
                    masonry, and therefore fills up this part like a funnel.</p>
                <p>Supposing the adjoining arch fallen, and all tumbled off that is not withheld by
                    its situation, there will still remain in the pier a mass of about 3500 tons.
                    The weight of the portion VY is about 2000 tons. The directions of the thrusts
                    VY and YF are such, that it would require a load of 4500 tons on VY to overturn
                    the pier round F. This exceeds VY by 2500 tons—a weight incomparably greater
                    than any that can ever be laid on it.</p>
                <p>Such is the ingenious construction of Mr Mylne. It evidently proceeds on the
                    principles recommended above— principles which had occurred to his experience
                    and sagacious mind during the course of his extensive practice. We have seen
                    attempts by other engineers to withstand the horizontal thrusts of the arch by
                    means of counterarches inserted in the same manner as here, but extending much
                    farther over the main arch; but they did not appear to be well calculated for
                    producing this effect. A counter-arch springing from any point between Y and V
                    has no tendency to hinder that point from rising by the sinking of the crown;
                    and such a counter-arch will not resist the precisely horizontal thrust so well
                    as the straight course of Mr Mylne.</p>
                <p>32. The great incorporation of architects who built the &lt; cathedrals of Europe
                    departed entirely from the styles of∣ ancient Greece and Rome, and introduced
                    another, in <hi rend="superscript"> £</hi> which arcades made the principal
                    part. Not finding in every place quarries from which blocks could be raised in
                    abundance of sufficient size for forming the far-projecting cornices of the
                    Greek orders, they relinquished those proportions, and adopted a style of
                    ornament which required no such projections; and having substituted arches for
                    the horizontal architrave or lintel, they were now able to erect buildings of
                    vast extent with spacious openings, and all this with very small pieces of
                    stone. The form which had been adopted for a Christian temple occasioned many
                    intersections of vaultings, and multiplied the arches exceedingly. Constant
                    practice gave opportunities of giving every possible variety of these
                    intersections, and taught the art of baíancing arch against arch in every
                    variety of situation. An art so multifarious, and so much out of the road of
                    ordinary thought, could not but become an object of fond study to the architects
                    most eminent for ingenuity and invention. Becoming thus the dupes of <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193100605" xml:id="kp-eb0703-0605-0388"/> their own
                    ingenuity, they were fond of displaying it even when not necessary. At last
                    arches became their principal ornament, and a wall or ceiling was not thought
                    dressed out as it should be till filled full of mock arches, crossing and
                    abutting on each other in every direction. In this process in their ecilings
                    they found that the projecting mouldings, which we now call the Gothic tracery,
                    formed the chief supports of the roofs. The plane surfaces included between
                    those ribs were commonly vaulted with very small stones, seldom exceeding six or
                    eight inches in thickness. This tracery, therefore, was not a random ornament.
                    Every rib had a position and direction that was not only proper, but even
                    necessary. Habituated to this scientific arrangement of the mouldings, they did
                    not deviate from it when they ornamented a smooth surface with mock arches; and
                    in none of the highly ornamented <hi rend="italic">ancient</hi> buildings will
                    we find any false positions.</p>
                <p>33. This is by no means the ease in many of the modern imitations of Gothic
                    architecture, even by our best architects. Ignorant of the directing principle,
                    or not attending to it, in their stucco-work they please the unskilled eye with
                    pretty radiated figures; but in these we frequently see such abutments of
                    mouldings as would infallibly break the arches, if these mouldings were really
                    performing their ancient office, and supporting a vaulting of considerable
                    extent. Nay, this began even before the Gothic style was finally abandoned.
                    Several instances are to be found in the highly enriched vaultings of New
                    College and Christ Church in Oxford, in St George’s Chapel at Windsor, and Henry
                    VH.’s Chapel in Westminster.</p>
                <p>We call the middle ages rude and barbarous; but there was surely much knowledge
                    in those who could execute such magnificent and difiicult works. The working
                    drafts which were necessary for such varieties of oblique intersections must
                    have required considerable skill, and would at present occupy many very
                    expensive volumes of <hi rend="italic">Masons' Jewels, Carpenters Manuals,</hi>
                    and the like. All this knowledge was kept a profound secret by the corporation,
                    and on its breaking up we had all to learn again.</p>
                <p>34. There is no appearance, however, that those architects had studied the theory
                    of equilibrated arches. They had adopted an arch which was very strong, and
                    permitted considerable irregularities of pressure—we mean the pointed arch. The
                    very deep mouldings with which it was ornamented made the arch-stones very long
                    in proportion to the span of the arch. But they had studied the mutual thrust of
                    arches on each other with great care; and they contrived to make every invention
                    for this purpose become an ornament, so that the eye <hi rend="italic"
                    >required</hi> it as a necessary part of the building. Thus we frequently see
                    small buildings having buttresses at the sides. These are necessary in a large
                    vaulted building, for withstanding the outward thrust of the vaulting; but they
                    are useless when we have a flat ceiling within. Pinnacles on the heads of the
                    buttresses are now considered as ornaments, but originally they were put there
                    to increase the weight of the buttress: even the great tower in the centre of a
                    cathedral, which now constitutes its greatest ornament, is a load almost
                    indispensably necessary, for enabling the four principal columns to withstand
                    the combined thrust of the aisles, of the nave, and transepts. In short, the
                    more closely we examine the ornaments of this architecture, the more shall we
                    perceive that they are rssential parts, or derived from them by imitation; and
                    the more we consider the whole style of it, the more clearly do we see that it
                    is all deduced from the relish for areades, indulged in the extreme, and pushed
                    to the ]iihif of possibility of execution. * -</p>
                <p>35. There is another species of arch which must not be overlooked, namely, the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Dome</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Cupola,</hi> with all ģ
                    <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> varieties, which include even the pyramidal steeple
                    or spire.</p>
                <p>It is evident that the erection of a dome is also a scientific art, proceeding on
                    the principles of equilibration and that these principles admit and require the
                    same or similar modifications, in consequence of' the cohesion and friction of
                    the materials. At first sight, too, a dome appears a more difficult piece of
                    work than a plain arch· but when we observe potters’ kilns, and glasshouse
                    domes, and cones of vast extent, erected by ordinary bricklayers, and with
                    materials vastly inferior in size to what can be employed in common arches of
                    equal extent, we must conclude that the circumstance of curvature in the
                    horizontal direction, or the abutment of a circular base gives some assistance
                    to the artist. Of this we have complete demonstration in, the ease of the cone.
                    We know that a vaulting in the form of a pent roof could not be executed to any
                    considerable extent, and would be extremely hazardous, even in the smallest
                    dimensions; while a cone of the greatest magnitude can be raised with very small
                    stones, provided only that we prevent the bottom from flying out, by a hoop, or
                    any similar contrivance.</p>
                <p>36. When we think a little of the matter, we see plainly, that if the horizontal
                    section be perfectly round, and the joints be all directed to the axis, they all
                    equally endeavour to slide inwards, while no reason can be offered why any
                    individual stone should prevail. They are all wedges, and operate only as
                    wedges. When we consider any single course, therefore, we see that it cannot
                    fall in, even though it may be part of a curve which cannot stand as a common
                    arch; nay, we see that a dome maybe constructed having the convexity of the
                    curve, by the revolution of which it is formed, turned towards the axis, so that
                    the outline is concave. We shall afterwards find that this is a stronger dome by
                    far than if the convexity were outwards, as in a common arch. We see also that a
                    cone may be loaded on the top with the greatest weight, without the smallest
                    danger of forcing it down, so long as the bottom course is firmly kept from
                    bursting outwards. The stone lanthorn on the top of St hauls cathedral in London
                    weighs several hundred tons, and is carried by a brick cone of 18 inches thick,
                    with perfect safety, as long as the bottom course is prevented from bursting
                    outwards. The reason is evident: The pressure on the top is propagated along the
                    cone in the direction of the slant side; and, so far from having any tendency to
                    break it in any part, it tends rather to prevent its being broken by any
                    irregular pressure from foreign causes.</p>
                <p>37. For the same reasons the octagonal pyramids, which form the spires of Gothic
                    architecture, arc abundantly firm, although very thin. The sides of the spire of
                    Salisbury cathedral are not eight inches thick after the octagon is fully
                    formed. It is proper, however, to direct the joints to the axis of the pyramid,
                    and to make the coursing joints perpendicular to the slant side, because the
                    projecting mouldings which run along the angles are the abutments on which the
                    whole panel depends. A considerable. art is necessary for supporting those
                    panels or sides of the octagon which spring from the angles of the square tower.
                    This is done by beginning a very narrow pointed arch on the square tower at a
                    great distance below the top; so that the legs of the arch being very long, a
                    straight line may be drawn from the top of the keystone of the arch through the
                    whole arch-stones of the legs· By this disposition the thrusts arising from the
                    weight of these four panels are made to meet on the massive masonry in the
                    middle of the sides of the tower, at a great <pb break="no" facs="nls:193100618"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-0618-0389"/>distance below the springing of the spire. This
                    part, Αεί in«· loaded with the great mass of perpendicular wall, is fuΓlyable to
                    withstand the horizontal thrust from the legs of those arches. In many spires
                    these thrusts are still farther resisted by iron bars which cross the tower, and
                    arc hooked into pieces of brass firmly bedded in the masonry of the sides.</p>
                <p>38. There is much nice balancing of this kind to be observed in the highly
                    ornamented open spires; such as those of Brussels, Mecklin, Antwerp, &amp;c. We
                    have not many of this sort in Britain. In those of great magnitude, the
                    judicious cye will discover, that parts, which a common spectator would consider
                    as mere ornaments, are necessary for completing the balance of the whole. Tall
                    pinnacles, nay even pillars carrying entablatures and pinnacles, are to be seen
                    standing on the middle of the slender leg of an arch. On examination we find
                    that this is necessary, to prevent the arch from springing upwards in that place
                    by the pressure at the crown. The steeple of the cathedral of Mecklin was the
                    most elaborate piece of architecture in this taste in the world, and was really
                    a wonder; but it was not calculated to withstand a bombardment, which destroyed
                    it in 1578.</p>
                <p>Such frequent examples of irregular and whimsical buildings of this kind show
                    that great liberties may be taken with the principle of equilibration without
                    risk, if we take care to secure the base from being thrust outwards. This may
                    always be done by hoops, which can be concealed in the masonry; whereas in
                    common arches these tics would be visible, and would offend the eye.</p>
                <p>39. It is now time to attend to the principle of equilibrium as it operates in a
                    simple circular dome, and to determine the thickness of the vaulting when the
                    curve is given, or the curve when the thickness is given. Therefore, let B6 A
                    (Plate LIII. fig. 2) be the curve which produces the dome by revolving round the
                    vertical axis AD. We shall suppose this curve to be drawn through the middle of
                    all the arch-stones, and that the coursing or horizontal joints are everywhere
                    perpendicular to the curve. We shall suppose (as is always the case) that the
                    thickness KL, HI, &amp;c. of the arch-stones is very small in comparison with
                    the dimensions of the arch. If we consider any portion ΠA∕z of the dome, it is
                    plain that it presses on the course, of which HL is an arch-stone, in a
                    direction <hi rend="italic">b</hi> C perpendicular to the joint HI, or in the
                    direction of the next superior clement <hi rend="italic">βb</hi> of the curve.
                    As we proceed downwards, course after course, we see plainly that this direction
                    must change, because the weight of each course is superadded to that of the
                    portion above it, to complete the pressure on the course below. Through B draw
                    the vertical line BCG, meeting <hi rend="italic">β b,</hi> produced in C. We may
                    take <hi rend="italic">b</hi> C to express the pressure of all that is above it,
                    propagated in this direction to the joint KL. We may also suppose the weight of
                    the course HL united in <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and acting on the vertical.
                    Let it be represented by <hi rend="italic">b</hi> F. If we form the
                    parallelogram <hi rend="italic">b</hi> FGC, the diagonal <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> G will represent the direction and intensity of the -whole pressure on
                    the joint KL. Thus it appears that this pressure is continually changing its
                    direction, and that the line, which will always coincide with it, must be a
                    curve concave downward. If this be precisely the curve of the dome, it will be
                    an equilibrated vaulting; but so far from being the strongest form, it is the
                    weakest, and it is the limit Ψ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> an 1</hi> f <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> n</hi> ity of others, which are all stronger than it. Hus
                    will appear evident, if we suppose that <hi rend="italic">bG</hi> does not
                    coincide with the curve A <hi rend="italic">b</hi> B, but passes without it. As
                    we suppose the arch-stones to be exceedingly thin from inside to outside, it is
                    plain that this dome cannot stand, <hi rend="superscript"> 8ilf</hi> that the
                    weight of the upper part will press it down, acid spring the vaulting outwards
                    at the joint KL. But let us suppose, on the other hand, that <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> G falls within the curvilinear element <hi rend="italic">b</hi> B. This
                    evidently tends to push the arch-stone inward towards the axis, and would cause
                    it to slide in, since the joints are supposed perfectly smooth and slipping. But
                    since this takes place equally in every stone of this course, they must all abut
                    on each other in the vertical joints, squeezing them firmly together. Therefore,
                    resolving the thrust <hi rend="italic">I</hi> G into two, one of which is
                    perpendicular to the joint KL, and the other parallel to it, we see that this
                    last thrust is withstood by the vertical joints all around, and there remains
                    only the thrust in the direction of the curve. Such a dome must therefore be
                    firmer than an equilibrated dome, and cannot be so easily broken by overloading
                    the upper part. M hen the curve is concave upwards, as in the lower part of the
                    figure, the line <hi rend="italic">b</hi> C always falls below <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> B, and the point C below B. When the curve is concave downwards, as in
                    the upper part of the figure, Z&gt;' C' passes above, or without <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> B. 'The curvature may be so abrupt, that even <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic">G'</hi> shall pass without <hi
                    rend="italic">b'</hi> B', and the point G' is above B'. It is also evident that
                    the force which thus binds the stones of a horizontal course together, by
                    pushing them towards the axis, will be greater in flat domes than in those that
                    are more convex; that it will be still greater in a cone, and greater still in a
                    curve whose convexity is turned inwards; for in this last case the line <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> G will deviate most remarkably from the curve. Such a dome
                    will stand (having polished joints) if the curve springs from the base with any
                    elevation, however small; nay, since the friction of two pieces of stone is not
                    less than half of their mutual pressure, such a dome will stand although the
                    tangent to the curve at the bottom should be horizontal, provided that the
                    horizontal thrust be double the weight of the dome, which may easily be the case
                    if it dp not rise high.</p>
                <p>40. Thus we see that the stability of a dome depends on very different principles
                    from that of a common arch, and is in general much greater. It differs also in
                    another very important circumstance, viz. that it may be open in the middle; for
                    the uppermost course, by tending equally in every part to slide in toward the
                    axis, presses all together in the vertical joints, and acts on the next course
                    like the keystone of a common arch. Therefore an arch of equilibration, which is
                    the weakest of all, may be open in the middle, and carry at top another
                    building, such as a lanthorn, if its weight do not exceed that of the circular
                    segment of the dome that is omitted. A greater load than this would indeed break
                    the dome, by causing it to spring up in some of the lower courses; but this load
                    may be increased if the curve is flatter than the curve of equilibration: and
                    any load whatever, which will not crush the Stones to powder, may be set on a
                    truncate cone, or on a dome formed by a curve that is convex toward the axis;
                    provided always that the foundation be effectually prevented from flying out,
                    either by a hoop, or by a sufficient mass of solid pier on which it is set.</p>
                <p>4L We have mentioned the many failures which happened to the dome of St Sophia in
                    Constantinople. We imagine that the thrust of the great dome, bending the
                    eastern arch outwards as soon as the pier began to yield, destroyed the
                    half-dome which was leaning on it, and thus almost in an instant took away the
                    eastern abutment. We think that this might have been prevented without any
                    change in the injudicious plan, if the dome had been hooped with iron, as was
                    practised by Michael Angelo in the vastly more ponderous dome of St Peter’s at
                    Home, and by Sir Christopher Wren in the cone and the inner dome of St Paul’s at
                    London. The weight of the latter considerably exceeds 3000 tons, and they
                    occasion a horizontal thrust which is nearly half this quantity, the elevation
                    of the cone being about 60°. This being distributed <pb break="no"

                    occasions a strain on the hoop 7</p>

                    238 tons. A square inch of the worst iron, if well forged, will carry 24∙ tons
                    with perfect safety; therefore a hoop of 7 inches broad and lį inch thick will
                    completely secure this circle from bursting outwards. It is, however, much more
                    completely secured; for, besides a hoop at the base of very nearly these
                    dimensions, there are hoops in different courses of the cone, which bind it into
                    one mass, and cause it to press on the piers in a direction exactly vertical.
                    The only thrusts which the piers sustain are those from the arches of the body
                    of the church and the transepts. These are most judiciously directed to the
                    entering angles of the building, and are there resisted with insuperable force
                    by the whole lengths of the walls, and by four solid masses of masonry in the
                    corners. Whoever considers with attention and judgment the plan of this
                    cathedral, will see that the thrusts of these arches, and of the dome, are
                    incomparably better balanced than in St Peter’s church at Rome. But to return
                    from this sort of digression.</p>
                <p>42. We have seen that if <hi rend="italic">b</hi> G, the thrust compounded of <hi

                    weight of that course, be everywhere coincident with <hi rend="italic">b</hi> B,
                    the element of the curve, we shall have an equilibrated dome: if it falls within
                    it, we have a dome which will bear a greater load; and if it falls without it,
                    the dome will break at the joint. We must endeavour to get analytical
                    expressions of these conditions. Therefore draw the ordinates <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> δ <hi rend="italic">b",</hi> BDB", C <hi rend="italic">d</hi> C". Let

                    or what portions of given curves may be employed with safety. Domes are
                    generally built for ornament, and we see that there is great room for indulging
                    our fancy in the choice. All curves which are concave outwards will give domes
                    of great firmness: they are also beautiful. The Gothic dome, whose outline is an
                    undulated curve, may be made abundantly firm, especially if the upper part be
                    convex and the lower concave outwards.</p>
                <p>The chief difficulty in the case of this analysis arises from the necessity of

                    sphere be 1, the half breadth of the dome must not exceed V ’ —⅛ + v ʹ ⅞&gt; or
                    0 ’ 78G, and the height will be *618. The arch from the vertex is about 51° 49'.
                    Much more of the hemisphere cannot stand, even though aided by the cement, and
                    by the friction of the coursing joints. This last circumstance, by giving
                    connection to the upper parts, causes the whole to press more vertically on the
                    course below, and thus diminishes the outward thrust; but it at the same time
                    diminishes the mutual abutment of the vertical joints, which is a great cause of
                    firmness in the vaulting. A Gothic dome, of which the upper part is a portion of
                    a sphere not exceeding 45° from the vertex, and the lower part is concave
                    outwards, will be very strong, and not ungraceful.</p>
                <p>43. But the public taste has long rejected this form, and <hi rend="subscript">
                    ιι</hi>,spems rather to select more elevated domes than this portion of a
                    sphere, because a dome, when seen from a small distance, always appears flatter
                    than it really is. The dome of St Peter’s is nearly an ellipsoid externally, of
                    which the longer axis is perpendicular to the horizon. It is very ingeniously
                    constructed. It springs from the base perpendicularly, and is very thick in this
                    part. After rising about 50 feet, the vaulting separates into two thin
                    'aultings, which gradually separate from each other.</p>
                <p>These two shells are connected together by thin partitions, which are very
                    artificially dovetailed in both, and thus form a covering which is extremely
                    stiff, while it is very light. Its great stiffness was necessary for enabling
                    the crown of the dome to carry the elegant stone lanthorn with safety. It is a
                    wonderful performance and has not its equal in the world; but it is an enormous
                    load in comparison with the dome of St Paul’s, and this even independent of the
                    difference of size. If they were of equal dimensions, it would be at least five
                    times as heavy, and is not so firm by its gravity; but as it is connected in
                    every part by iron bars (lodged in the solid masonry, and well secured from the
                    weather by having lead melted all around them), it bids fair to last for ages if
                    the foundations do not fail.</p>
                <p>If a circle be described round a centre, placed anywhere in the transverse axis
                    AC (Plate LII. fig. 11) of an ellipse, so as to touch the ellipse in the
                    extremities B, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> of an ordinate, it will touch it
                    internally, and the circular arch B <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> will be wholly
                    within the elliptical arch BAA Therefore, if an elliptical and a spherical
                    vaulting spring from the same base, at the same angle with the horizon, the
                    spherical vaulting will be within the elliptical, will be flatter and lighter,
                    and therefore the weight of the next course below will bear a greater proportion
                    to the thrust in the direction of the curve; therefore the spherical vaulting
                    will have more stability. On the contrary, and for similar reasons, an oblate
                    elliptical vaulting is preferable to a spherical vaulting springing with the
                    same inclination to the horizon. (Fig. 13.)</p>
                <p>44. Persuaded that what has been said on the subject convinces the reader that a
                    vaulting perfectly equilibrated throughout is by no means the best form,
                    provided that the base is secured from separating, we think it unnecessary to
                    give the investigation of that form, which has a considerable intricacy, and
                    shall content ourselves with merely giving its dimensions. The thickness is
                    supposed uniform. The numbers in the first' column of the table express the
                    portion of the axis counted from the vertex, and those of the second column are
                    the lengths of the ordinates.</p>

                <p>The curve delineated in fig. 15 is formed according to these dimensions, and
                    appears destitute of gracefulness, because its curvature changes abruptly at a
                    little distance from the vertex, so that it has some appearance of being made up
                    of different curves pieced together. But if the middle be occupied by a lanthorn
                    of equal or of smaller weight, this defect will cease, and the whole will be
                    elegant, nearly resembling the exterior dome of St Paul’s in London.</p>
                <p>45. It is not a small advantage of dome-vaulting, that it is lighter than any
                    that can cover the same area. If, moreover, it be spherical, it will admit
                    considerable varieties of figure by combining different spheres. Thus, a dome
                    may begin from its base as a portion of a large hemisphere, and may be broken
                    off at any horizontal <pb break="no" facs="nls:193100657"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-0657-0392"/>course, and then a similar or a greater portion of
                    a smaller sphere may spring from this course as a base. It also bears being
                    intersected by cylindrical vaultings in every direction, and the intersections
                    are exact circles, and always have a pleasing effect. It also springs most
                    gracefully from the heads of small piers, or from the corners of rooms of any
                    polygonal shape; and the arches formed by its intersections with the walls are
                    always circular and graceful, forming very handsome spandrels in every position.
                    For these reasons Sir Christopher Wren employed it in all his vaultings, and he
                    has exhibited many beautiful varieties in the transepts and the aisles of St
                    Paul’s, which are highly worthy of the observation of architects. Nothing can be
                    more graceful than the vaultings at the ends of the north and south transepts,
                    especially as furnished oft’ in the fine inside view published by Gwynn and
                    Wale.</p>
                <p>46. The connection of the parts arising from cement and from friction has a great
                    effect on dome-vaulting. In the same way as in common arches and cylindrical
                    vaulting, it enables an overload on one place to break the dome in a distant
                    place. But the resistance to this effect is much greater in dome-vaulting,
                    because it operates all round the overloaded part. Hence it happens that domes
                    are much less shattered by partial violence, such as the falling of a bomb or
                    the like. Large holes may be broken in them without much affecting the rest;
                    but, on the other hand, it greatly diminishes the strength which should be
                    derived from the mutual pressure in the vertical joints. Friction prevents the
                    sliding in of the arch-stones, which produces this mutual pressure in the
                    vertical joints, except in the very highest courses, and even there it greatly
                    diminishes it. These causes make a great change in the form which gives the
                    greatest strength; and as their laws of action are as yet but very imperfectly
                    understood, it is perhaps impossible, in the present state of our knowledge, to
                    determine this form with tolerable precision. We see plainly, however, that it
                    allows a greater deviation from the best form than the other kind of vaulting,
                    and domes may be made to rise perpendicular to the horizon at the base, although
                    of no great thickness; a thing which must not be attempted in a plain arch. The
                    immense addition of strength which may be derived from hooping largely
                    compensates for all defects; and there are hardly any bounds to the extent to
                    which a very thin dome-vaulting may be carried when it is hooped or framed in
                    the direction of the horizontal courses. The roof of the Halle du Bled at Paris
                    is but a foot thick, and its diameter is more than 200, yet it appears to have
                    abundant strength. It is, on the whole, a noble specimen of architecture.</p>
                <p>47. We must not conclude this article without taking notice of that magnificent
                    and elegant arch erected in cast iron at Wearmouth, near Sunderland, in the
                    county of Durham. The inventor and architect was Rowland Burdon, Esq.</p>
                <p>This arch (of which a view is given at the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Bridge)</hi> is a segment of a circle whose diameter is about 444 feet. The
                    span or chord of the arch is 236 feet, and its versed sme or spring is 34 feet.
                    It springs at the elevation of 60 feet from the surface of the river at low
                    water, so that vessels ol 200 or perhaps 300 tons burden may pass under it in
                    the middle of the stream, and even 50 feet on each side of it.</p>
                <p>The sweep of the arch consists of a series of frames of cast iron, which abut on
                    each other, in the same manner as the voussoirs of a stone arch. One of these
                    frames or blocks (as we shall call them in future) is represented in Plate
                    LIII.fig. 3, as seen in front. It is cast in one piece, and consists of three
                    pieces or arms BC, BC, BC, the middle one of which is two feet long, the upper
                    being somewnat more, and the lower somewhat less, because their extremi? ties
                    are bounded by the radius drawn from the centre of the arch. These arms are four
                    inches square, and are connected by other pieces KL, of such length that the
                    whole length of the block is five feet in the direction of the radius. Each arm
                    has a flat groove on each side, which is expressed by the darker shading, three
                    inches broad and three fourths of an inch deep. A section of this block, through
                    the middle of KL, is represented by the light-shaded part BBB, in which the
                    grooves are more distinctly perceived. These grooves are intended for receiving
                    flat bars of malleable iron, which are employed for connecting the different
                    blocks with each other. Fig. 4 represents two blocks united in this manner. For
                    this purpose each arm has two square bolt-holes. The ends of the arms being
                    nicely trimmed off, so that the three ends abut equally close on the ends of the
                    nextblock; and the bars of hammered iron being also nicely fitted to their
                    grooves, so as to fill them completely , and have their bolt· holes exactly
                    corresponding to those in the blocks; they are put together in such a manner
                    that the joints or meetings of the malleable bars may fall on the middle between
                    the bolt-holes in the arms. Fiat-headed bolts of wrought iron are then put
                    through, and keys or forelocks are driven through the bolt-tails, and thus all
                    is firmly wedged together, binding each arm between two bars of wrought iron.
                    These bars are of such length as to connect several blocks.</p>
                <p>In this manner a series of about 125 blocks are joined together, so as to form
                    the precise curve that is intended. This series may be called a rib, and it
                    stands in a vertical plane. The arch consists of six of these ribs, distant from
                    each ether five feet. These ribs are connected together so as to form an arch of
                    32 feet in breadth, in the following manner.</p>
                <p>Fig. 5 represents one of the bridles or cross pieces which connect the different
                    ribs, as it appears when viewed from below. It is a hollow pipe of cast iron
                    four inches in diameter, and has at each end two projecting shoulders, pierced
                    with a bolt-hole near their extremities, so that the distance between the
                    bolt-holes in the shoulders of one end is equal to the distance between the
                    holes in the arms of the blocks, or the holes in the wrought iron bars. In the
                    middle of the uppe r and of the under side of each end may be observed a square
                    prominence, more lightly shaded than the rest. These projections also advance a
                    little beyond the flat of the shoulders, formingbe∙ tween them a shallow notch
                    about an inch deep, which receives the iron of the arms, where they abut on each
                    other, and thus give an additional firmness to the joint. The manner in which
                    the arms are thus grasped by these notches in the bridles is more distinctly
                    seen in fig. 4, at the letter H, in the middle of the upper rail.</p>
                <p>The rib having been all trimmed and put together, so as to form the exact curve,
                    the bolts are all taken out, and the horizontal bridles are then set on in their
                    places, and the bolts are again put in and made fast by the forelocks. The bolts
                    new pass through the shoulders of the bridles, through the wrought iron bars,
                    and through the cast iron arm that is between them, and the forelocks bind all
                    fast together. The manner in which this connection is completed is distinctly
                    seen in fig. 4, which shows in perspective a double block in front, and a single
                    block behind it. The abutting joint: of the two front blocks are at the letters
                    E, E, E; the holes in the shoulders of th <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi>
                    horizontal cross pieces are at II.</p>
                <p>48. This construction is beautifully simple, and very judicious. A vast addition
                    of strength and of stiffness is procured by lodging the wrought iron bars in
                    grooves <pb break="no" facs="nls:193100670" xml:id="kp-eb0703-0670-0393"/>formed
                    in the cast iron rails; and for this purpose it is of great importance to make
                    the wrought iron bars fill the grooves completely, and even to be so tight as to
                    require the force of the forelocks to draw them home to the bottom of the
                    grooves. There can be no doubt but that this arch is able to withstand an
                    enormous pressure, as long is the abutments from which it springs do not yield.
                    Of this there is hardly any risk, because they are masses of rock faced with
                    about four or five yards (in some places only) of solid block masonry. The
                    mutual thrusts of the frames are all in the direction of the rails, so that no
                    part bears any transverse strain. We can hardly conceive any force that can
                    overcome the strength of those arms by pressure or crushing them. The manner in
                    which the frames are connected into one rib effectually secures the abutting
                    joints from slipping; and the accuracy with which the whole can be executed
                    secures us against any warping or deviation of a rib from the vertical
                    plane.</p>
                <p>But when we consider the prodigious span of this arch, and reflect that it is
                    only five feet thick, it should seem that the most perfect equilibration is
                    indispensably necessary. It is but like a film, and must be so supple, that an
                    overload on any part must have a great tendency to bend it, and to cause it to
                    rise in a distant part; and this effect is increased by the very firmness with
                    which the whole sticks together. The overloaded part acts on a distant part,
                    tending to break it with all the energy of a long lever. This can be prevented
                    only by means of the stiffness of the distant part. It is very true, the arch
                    cannot break in the extrados except by tearing asunder the wrought iron bars
                    which connect the blocks along the upper rail, and each of these requires more
                    than a hundred tons to tear it asunder; yet an overload of five tons on any rib
                    at its middle will produce this strain at twenty feet from the sides, supposing
                    the sides held firm in their position. It were desirable, therefore, that
                    something were done to stiffen the arch at the sides, by the manner of filling
                    up the spandrels or space between the arch and the road-way. This is filled up
                    in a manner that is extremely light and pleasing to the eye, namely, by large
                    cast iron circles, which touch the extrados of the arch and ouch the road-way.
                    The road-way rests on them as on so many hoops, while they rest on the back of
                    the arch, and also touch each other laterally. We cannot think that this
                    contributes to the strength of the arch; for these hoops will be easily
                    compressed at the points of contact, and, changing their shape, will oppose very
                    little resistance. We think that this part of the arch might have been greatly
                    stiffened and strengthened by connecting it with the road-way by trussed frames,
                    in the same way that a judicious carpenter would have framed a roof. If a strong
                    cast iron pillar had been made to rest on the arch at about 20 feet from the
                    impost, and been placed in the direction of a radius, the top of this pillar
                    might have been connected by a diagonal bar of wrought iron with the impost of
                    the arch, and with the crown of the arch by another string or bar of the same
                    materials. These two ties would cause the radial pillar to press strongly on the
                    back of the arch, and they must be torn asunder before it could bend in that
                    place in the smallest degree, Supposing them of the same dimensions as the bars
                    in the arms, their position would give them near ten times the force for
                    resisting the strain produced by an overload on the crown.</p>
                <p>This beautiful arch contains only 260 tons of iron, of which about 55 are wrought
                    iron. The superstructure is of wood, planked over a top. This floor is covered
                    with a coating of chalk and tar, on which are laid the materials for the
                    carriage road, consisting of marl, limestone, and gravel, with foot-ways of
                    flag-stones at the sides. The weight of the whole did not exceed 1000 tons,
                    whereas the lightest stone arch which could have been erected would have weighed
                    15,000. It was turned on a very light but stiff scaffolding, most judiciously
                    constructed for the preservation of its form, and for allowing an uninterrupted
                    passage for the numerous ships and small craft which frequent the busy harbour
                    of Sunderland. The mode of framing the arch was so simple and easy that it was
                    put up in ten days, without an accident; and when all was finished, and the
                    scaffolding removed, the arch did not sensibly change its form. The whole work
                    was executed in three years, and cost about L.26,000.</p>

                <p>49. The excellence of the preceding article, written by the late Dr John Robison,
                    Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh, for the
                    Supplement to the third edition of this work, may be inferred from the fact,
                    that almost every later writer on mechanics has spoken of it with approbation,
                    and borrowed more or less from it. (See Gregory’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mechanics,</hi> book i. chap. 6; Hutton’s <hi rend="italic">Tracts,</hi> vol.

                    is however one part of the article, viz. the purely mathematical part, which
                    must have been quite unintelligible as it originally appeared, because of its
                    numerous typographical errors. These are here corrected, we believe for the
                    first time. Even with this advantage, we fear it has rather a forbidding aspect
                    to the student of modern mathematics, because of the very complicated diagram
                    (sec Plate LII. fig. 12) from which the differential equation of the
                    equilibrated arch has been deduced. We shall therefore, as an appendix, treat of
                    the equilibrated polygon and equilibrated arch upon the general principles of
                    statics, and employ in this investigation only the most simple geometrical
                    figures. The theory of the equilibrated arch cannot be delivered without
                    employing the principles of the differential and integral calculus; but we shall
                    endeavour to pass from the finite equation of the equilibrated polygon to the
                    differential equation of the arch by the shortest and most direct road.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Equilibrated Polygon.</hi></p>
                <p>50. In Plate LIII. fig. 9, let ABCDED ’ C ʹ B ’ A' be a polygon formed by beams
                    or rods AB, BC, CD, DE, &amp;c. of any length, movable about the points B, C, D,
                    E, &amp;c. as joints, and forming an equilibrium in a vertical plane by the
                    mutual thrusts at the joints and by the weight of the beams, the extreme sides
                    of the polygon being supposed supported or attached to fixed points. Let AB, BC,
                    CD, be any three consecutive sides of the polygon: produce AB, DC, the extreme
                    sides, until they meet in H. The beam BC is kept in its position by the thrusts
                    of the adjoining beams AB, CD, in the directions BH, CH, and its own weight,
                    which is equivalent to pressures or loads on the joints B, C, acting in a
                    vertical direction. Let G be the point in BC, which is the centre of gravity of
                    weights proportional to loads at B and C. By the principles of statics, the
                    directions of these forces must pass through the same point; therefore G must be
                    in a vertical line passing through H.</p>

                <p>52. From this proposition we may infer, that if <hi rend="italic">&lt;ρ, φ'</hi>
                    denote the angles which any two adjoining sides of the polygon make with the
                    horizontal plane, and <hi rend="italic">w</hi> the load on the joint at their
                    intersection, then, <hi rend="italic">w</hi> = C (tan. <hi rend="italic"
                    >&lt;ρ</hi> — tan. <hi rend="italic">φ')</hi> (A); and in this formula, C
                    denotes some constant quantity, which is the same for all the angles of the
                    polygon. This is the general equation of the equilibrated polygon; and it shows
                    that the loads at the joints depend entirely on the angles which the beams make
                    with the horizontal plane, and are independent of the lengths of the beams
                    themselves.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Equilibrated Arch.</hi></p>
                <p>53. We shall next investigate the differential equation of an equilibrated arch,
                    deducing it from the finite equation of the equilibrated polygon.</p>
                <p>Let us suppose an equilibrated polygon of a very great number of sides (fig. 10),
                    and that a curve ABC passes through all the joints: the sides of the polygon
                    will then be chords in the curve; and as the number of these may be conceived to
                    be greater than any assigned number, and each shorter than any given line, they
                    may be regarded as elements of the curve, and as constituting it.</p>
                <p>54. Let us suppose the curve ABC formed in this manner to be the intrados of an
                    arch of a bridge, and that the extrados is the line MDN, which may be curved or
                    straight. Let AC be the <hi rend="italic">span,</hi> or greatest horizontal
                    width of the arch, and BH, which bisects AC at right angles, its <hi
                    rend="italic">rise</hi> or height; also let BD be the thickness of the arch of
                    the crown: draw a straight line EDF perpendicular to DH, and draw AE, CF
                    perpendicular to EF.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">Pp</hi> be any indefinitely small part of the intrados ABC.
                    Draw PRQ perpendicular to the horizontal line EF, meeting the extrados in R, and
                    <hi rend="italic">rp</hi> parallel to RP; also draw PK perpendicular to DH,
                    meeting <hi rend="italic">rp</hi> in <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> and PT touching
                    the intrados in <hi rend="italic">p;</hi> and, referring the two curves to the
                    same axes DE, let us put <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> DQ.
                    the common abscissa, <hi rend="italic">y</hi> = PQ the ordinate of the intrados,
                    <hi rend="italic">v</hi> = RQ the ordinate of the extrados, p = angle TPK made
                    by the tangent and horizontal line PK, c ’ = DB the given value of <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> at the crown, c"= AE the given value of <hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi> at either haunch.</p>
                <p>Then, because <hi rend="italic">Pp</hi> is a differential of the arc BP, we have
                    <hi rend="italic">Pq = dx,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pq = dy.</hi></p>
                <p>55. The load on the arc BP is the gravitating matter between it and DR, the arc
                    of the extrados immediately over it. This is expressed by the area BDRP;
                    therefore the load on Pjo, the differential of the arc, is (y— <hi
                    rend="subscript"> v</hi>)⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> the differential of that
                    area.</p>
                <p>We have put <hi rend="italic">&lt;p</hi> to denote the angle which a tangent at P
                    makes with any horizontal line; similarly, let <hi rend="italic">φ'</hi> denote
                    the angle which a line touching the curve at <hi rend="italic">p</hi> makes with
                    a horizontal line. If now the curve be considered as a polygon of an infinite
                    number of infinitely short sides, and the lines which touch the curve at P and
                    <hi rend="italic">p</hi> as the prolongations of two adjoining sides, then, by
                    formula (A), sect. 52, the vertical pressure at their intersection will be C
                    (tan. ç&gt;— tan. <hi rend="italic">&lt;ρ').</hi> But these infinitely short
                    touching lines may be regarded as forming <hi rend="italic">Pp,</hi> the
                    differential of' the curve, the load on which we have found to be <hi

                    let us, to make the members of the equation homogeneous, put (? instead of C,

                <p>This shows that the vertical line between the intrados and extrados is always
                    proportional to the cube of the secant of the angle which the radius OP makes
                    with the perpendicular; a conclusion which agrees with section of the preceding
                    article.</p>
                <p>57. The second problem, viz. having given the nature <pb break="no"

                    of the intrados, is the more important of the two, and more difficult. Its
                    solution requires the integral calculus; but the difficulty is no greater than
                    that of finding the area of a curve whose equation is given. This can always be
                    accomplished, if not in finite terms, at least by infinite series. We shall now
