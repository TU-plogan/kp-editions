                <p><label type="entry">ANDERSON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Alexander</hi></label>, a very
                    eminent mathematician, who flourished in the early part of the 17th century. He
                    was born at Aberdeen, but passed over to the Continent, and settled as a private
                    teacher or professor of mathematics at Paris, where he published or edited,
                    between the years 1612 and 1619, various geometrical and algebraical tracts,
                    which are conspicuous for their ingenuity and elegance. It is doubtful whether
                    he was ever acquainted with the famous Vieta, master of requests at Paris, who
                    died in 1603; but his pure taste and skill in mathematical investigation had
                    pointed him out to the executors of that illustrious man, who had found leisure,
                    in the intervals of a laborious profession, to cultivate and extend the ancient
                    geometry, and, by adopting a system of general symbols, to lay the foundation
                    and begin the superstructure of algebraical science, as the person most proper
                    for revising and publishing his valuable manuscripts. Anderson did not come
                    forward, however, as a mere editor; he enriched the texts with learned comments,
                    and gave neat demonstrations of those propositions which had been left
                    imperfect. He afterwards produced a specimen of the application of geometrical
                    analysis, which is distinguished by its clearness and classic elegance.</p>
                <p>Of this able geometer we are ignorant both of the time of his birth and of his
                    death. His brother David Anderson, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193097017"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-7017-0112"/>a small proprietor in Aberdeenshire, but engaged
                    in business, had likewise a strong turn for mathematics and mechanics, which,
                    joined to great versatility of talent, made him be regarded by his neighbours at
                    that period as a sort of oracle. The daughter of this clever and active burgess
                    was married to John Gregory, minister of Drumoak, in that county, father to the
                    celebrated James Gregory, inventor of the reflecting telescope; and is supposed
                    to have communicated to her children that taste for mathematical learning which
                    afterwards shone forth so remarkably in the family of the Gregorys.</p>
                <p>The works of Anderson amount to six thin quarto volumes, which are now very
                    scarce. These are,</p>

                    >Sir Edmund,</hi> a younger son of an ancient Scotish family settled in
                    Lincolnshire. He was some time a student of Lincoln College, Oxford, and removed
                    from thence to the Inner Temple, where he applied himself diligently to the
                    study of the law, and became a barrister. In 1582 he was made lord chief justice
                    of the common pleas, and in the year following was knighted. He held his office
                    to the end of his life in 1605. His works are, 1. Reports of many principal
                    Cases argued and adjudged in the time of Queen Elizabeth in the Common Bench,
                    Lond. 1644, fol.; 2. Resolutions and Judgments on the cases and matter agitated

                    >LL.</hi><hi rend="italic">D.</hi> The subject of this article, who has been
                    brought into notice principally from the more recent encouragement given to
                    agriculture, and the versatility of his own genius, was born at the village of
                    Hermiston, in the county of Edinburgh, in the year 1739. His parents were in
                    humble life, and had possessed a farm for some generations, which he was
                    destined to inherit and to cultivate. At that period improvement was in infancy,
                    and the husbandman had to contend with a climate whose uncertainty seemed to
                    keep pace with the progress of his skill, and which too often disappointed him
                    of the fruits of his industry. Anderson, while yet at an early age, lost his
                    parents: however, his education was uninterrupted; and conceiving that an
                    acquaintance with chemistry would promote his profession, he attended a course
                    of lectures on that science, then delivered by Dr Cullen. None of the other
                    pupils besides himself took notes of his lectures, which being afterwards
                    surreptitiously obtained from him, with the design of publication, he defeated
                    the intended purpose, apprehensive that his preceptor’s fame might be diminished
                    by these imperfect transcripts. His own active occupations had already
                    commenced, and, along with the practice of husbandry, he prosecuted his original
                    taste for literature.</p>
                <p>Enlarging the sphere of his employments, Anderson forsook his first possession,
                    for a farm of 1300 acres, which he rented in Aberdeenshire, though nearly in a
                    state of nature, and where agriculture is still behind the southern districts.
                    But previous to this he became known to men of letters, by some essays on
                    planting, which, under the signature Agricoa, he ventured to commit to the world
                    through the medium of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Weckly Magazine,</hi> in
                    1771. Soon embarking in a higher sphere of literature, he composed the article
                    <hi rend="italic">Monsoon</hi> for the first edition of this Encyclopaedia, in
                    1773, wherein he threw out some luminous ideas, and, among other observations,
                    predicted from physical facts, and the state of geographical knowledge, that no
                    polar continent would be found by the circumnavigators then employed by
                    government. In the year 1777 he published a considerable quarto volume, said to
                    have been composed two years preceding, on the means of exerting a spirit of
                    national industry with regard to agriculture, commerce, manufactures, and
                    fisheries; and in this he enters into detailed views of many subjects of
                    political economy. The interest of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland is in a
                    particular manner considered; and the author maintains, that the only effectual
                    means of increasing agriculture is by promoting manufactures; as also, that the
                    neglect∙which the agriculture of these parts of the kingdom experienced,
                    resulted from the neglect of manufactures. Scotland, he affirms, is better
                    adapted than England for the production of wool; and this, as well as other
                    products, he thought, would be best encouraged by premiums. The advantages which
                    might result from attending to the fisheries, he judged, would be very great,
                    and the shoals of herrings frequenting the coast could be converted into a
                    source of national wealth under suitable establishments. Anderson, who soon
                    after had die degree of doctor of laws conferred on him by the University of
                    Aberdeen, did not abandon these inquiries. He printed a tract regarding the
                    fisheries, which was circulated among his friends; and, in consequence of being
                    more widely diffused, he was appointed by the Lords of the Treasury to survey
                    the western coast of Scotland, for the purpose of obtaining satisfactory
                    information on the subject. This he did in 1784, and received the full
                    approbation of his employers; and he published a brief account of the Hebrides,
                    a chain of islands then as little within the general acquaintance of the
                    inhabitants of Great Britain as if they had been under the dominion of another
                    country. The principal obstacles to the fishery, Dr Anderson considered, were to
                    be found in a duty on salt and coals, and he recommended the repeal of both. It
                    is certain that, from thenceforward, this great branch of national industry has
                    received infinitely more patronage than before his report, and, while we only
                    shared the labours of the Dutch for centuries, the fisheries on our own coast
                    have since been monopolized by ourselves. Nothing<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193097030" xml:id="kp-eb0703-7030-0113"/> can be more impolitic than
                    to fetter the exertions of the industrious by exorbitant duties, or equally
                    oppressive with denying fuel to the poorer classes, where it is scarce, by
                    duties on its importation.</p>
                <p>Dr Anderson had now withdrawn from his northern farm, where he resided above 20
                    years, and settled in the vicinity of Edinburgh. His agricultural speculations
                    were still continued; and when a parliamentary grant was about to be proposed to
                    Mr Elkington for a particular mode of draining land, he reclaimed the practice
                    as having been observed by himself many years anterior. Repeated examples,
                    indeed, prove that the rewards granted by Parliament for improvement are
                    attended with such slight investigations, that the merits of real invention are
                    overlooked. Dr Anderson now projected a periodical publication called <hi
                    rend="italic">The Bee,</hi> consisting of miscellaneous original matter, which
                    attained the extent of 18 volumes in octavo. It was published weekly, and a
                    large proportion of it came from his own pen, which is seldom a prudent course
                    in an editor. The relation of Great Britain and her colonies, and the political
                    rights of mankind—subjects which had excited strong interests throughout
                    Europe—also received some commentaries from Dr Anderson. He wrote a tract called
                    <hi rend="italic">The Interest of Great Britain with respect to her
                    Colonies,</hi> and commenced a correspondence with General Washington, which was
                    afterwards published.</p>
                <p>Towards the year 1797 he again removed to Islesworth, in the neighbourhood of
                    London, where he undertook another periodical publication, appearing at more
                    distant intervals than the former, entitled <hi rend="italic">Recreations in
                    Agriculture, Natural History, Arts, and Miscellaneous Literature.</hi> This work
                    was prefaced by two copious dissertations, the one on agriculture, the other on
                    natural history; and opened with a discussion regarding a very curious and
                    important subject, namely, an inquiry into what are denominated varieties in
                    plants and animals. Many useful and interesting remarks appear in the course of
                    this publication, a portion of which was supplied by other contributors; and it
                    is embellished by beautiful vignettes from engravings on wood. Owing to some
                    difficulties attending the publication, it ceased in 1802. Though natural
                    history is rather predominant, the rest of his leading subjects are not
                    overlooked. Dr Anderson henceforward lived in a great measure in retirement,
                    though occasionally reminding the world of his wonted inquiries, by the
                    publication of tracts on unconnected subjects. He obtained a patent for an
                    improved hot-house, wherein no fuel was used; and employed himself in
                    experiments regarding the degree of temperature and humidity most beneficial to
                    plants. Likewise, having observed the uncommon depredations of wasps, he is
                    said, after satisfying himself of their manner of increase, to have devised a
                    plan for their absolute extermination. This was chiefly by the destruction of
                    the females before founding their respective colonies by the depositation of
                    innumerable eggs; and hand-bills were circulated under the auspices of an
                    association formed by him, offering a reward for every female brought in dead
                    within a specified time. It does not appear, however, that the breed was at all
                    diminished by the proposed expedient.</p>
                <p>Dr Anderson still remained in his retreat, enjoying the cultivation of his
                    garden; and nothing of importance is known to have proceeded from his pen. After
                    a gradual decline, partly occasioned by the over-exertion of the
                    mental.energies, he died in the year 1808, aged 69. He was twice married; first,
                    to Miss Seton of Mounie; secondly» to an English lady. By his first marriage he
                    had thirteen children, six of whom survived him. One of his sons made
                    distinguished progress in the art of engraving on wood; and, if the vignettes of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Recreations in Agriculture</hi> were executed by him, they
                    afford ample testimony of his abilities.</p>
                <p>Dr Anderson was endowed with a vigorous understanding, which he chiefly displayed
                    in treating of agricultural matters, and those connected with rural economy; but
                    he was at the same time of a versatile talent, which could readily be occupied
                    on transient facts and occurrences. Many of his works were of a fugitive nature,
                    consisting of small impressions, which were not renewed, and hence are difficult
                    to be obtained at present, if they have not totally disappeared. None of them
                    soars to the more lofty regions of science; they are directed to practical views
                    in useful projects, and for the most part relate to subjects of ordinary detail.
                    Of this the reader will be enabled to judge by the subjoined list, which we
                    believe is the most copious that has yet appeared. The industry of Dr Anderson
                    was indefatigable, whether in personal exertion or mental energy; and he
                    possessed elevated sentiments of independence. During a period of overstrained
                    political fervour, certain papers formed part of the periodical works already
                    referred to, which were thought libellous on the government. Although Dr
                    Anderson’s principles were noted for attachment to the existing administration,
                    he was called upon to give up the author of the obnoxious compositions, which he
                    steadily refused, and, even in the face of the civil magistrates, charged his
                    printers not to violate their fidelity to him and the author in betraying his
                    name. The business terminated here, until a factious individual insinuated to
                    the same magistrates that the compositions had proceeded from one of the supreme
                    judges, whose party politics were avowedly hostile to those of government. Dr
                    Anderson having learned the reproach, hastened to relieve the object of it by

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Anderson,</hi><hi rend="italic">Robert,</hi> the fourth son
                    of William Anderson, and of Margaret Melrose his wife, was born at Carnwath in
                    Lanarkshire on the 7th of January 1750. His father was a <hi rend="italic"
                    >feuar,</hi> that is, a person who possessed some small parcels of real property
                    by the tenure of a perpetual lease. Having received the earlier part of his
                    education in his native town and in the adjacent village of Libberton, he was
                    afterwards placed under the tuition of Robert Thomson, master of Lanark school,
                    who had married a sister of Thomson the poet, and who has been commended for his
                    uncommon proficiency in classical learning. Excellence however is always a
                    relative term; nor must it be forgotten that the grammar schools of Scotland had
                    about that period descended to their very lowest level. James Graeme, a native
                    of the same town, was his companion and friend at all these seminaries: he
                    appears to have been an amiable young man of promising talents, and to have been
                    imbued with the love of literature. One of their school-fellows at Lanark was
                    John Pinkerton, who afterwards became a conspicuous member of the republic of
                    letters.</p>
                <p>Anderson’s father had died in 1759, in the 40th year of his age, leaving his
                    widow with a very slender provision. Uniting considerable energy of character
                    with a large share of piety, she made a vigorous effort to educate her four
                    sons; and as she survived till the year 1796, she had the satisfaction of seeing
                    one of them arrive at independence and distinction. Having discovered an early
                    taste for reading, he soon made choice of one of the liberal professions. His
                    first destination was for the church: in the year 1767 he was sent to the
                    university of Edinburgh, and in due time was enrolled among the students of
                    divinity.. Graeme, who had entered the university at the same time and with the
                    same views, died of consumption in 1772, in the 23d year of his age; and, after
                    a short interval, his faithful friend published <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    collection of <hi rend="italic">Poems on several occasions, by James
                    Graeme.</hi> Edinb. 1773, 12mo. These poems he inserted in the 11th volume of
                    the. <hi rend="italic">British Poets,</hi> together with an account of the
                    author, in which his literary merits are estimated, not with the discrimination
                    of sober criticism, but with all the partiality of friendly zeal. About this
                    period he relinquished the study of divinity, and betook himself to the study of
                    medicine. He was for a short time employed' as surgeon to the dispensary at
                    Bamborough Castle in Northumberland; and in a neighbouring town he then formed
                    connections which had no small influence on his future destiny. On the 25th of
                    September 1777 he married Anne, the daughter of John Grey, Esq. of Alnwick, who
                    was related to the noble family of that name. Returning to Scotland, he took the
                    degree of Μ. D. at St Andrews on the 20th of May 1778, after having been duly
                    examined by the professor of physic. He now began to practise as a physician at
                    Alnwick; but his general habits were radier those of speculation than exertion,
                    and a moderate provision, acquired by his marriage, had emancipated him from the
                    necessity of professional labour. In 1784 he finally returned to Edinburgh,
                    where he continued to reside for the period of 46 years, in a condition of life
                    removed from affluence, but perfectly compatible with genuine independence and
                    comfort. He possessed the valuable secret of living within his income; and his
                    house was long distinguished by a hearty and unostentatious hospitality. His
                    amiable and affectionate wife died of consumption on the 25th of December 1785,
                    in the 39th year of her age, leaving three daughters, the youngest of whom
                    speedily followed her mother to the grave. He did not resume the practice of
                    physic, but being satisfied with his moderate acquisitions, he devoted much of
                    his time to the education of his two children, and to miscellaneous and
                    desultory reading, rather than to any systematical course of study. In 1793,
                    after having remained a widower for eight years, he married Margaret, the
                    daughter of Mr David Dall, master of Yester school in the county of
                    Haddington.</p>
                <p>For several years his attention was occupied with his edition of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Works of the British Poets, with Prefaces biographical and
                    critical,</hi> which was published at Edinburgh, and extends to 14 large octavo
                    volumes. The earliest volume, which is now the second in the series, was printed
                    in 1792-3; the 13th was printed in 1795, and another volume was added in 1807.
                    He was frequently solicited to revise his Lives of the Poets, and publish them
                    in a separate form; but after having collected some materials for such a work,
                    he finally abandoned the design. In the mean time he had published <hi
                    rend="italic">The Miscellaneous Works of Tobias Smollett, Μ. D. with Memoirs of
                    his Life and Writings.</hi> Edinb. 1796, 6 vols. 8vo. The sixth edition of this
                    collection was printed in the year 1820. Of his account of the ingenious author,
                    the eighth separate edition appeared under the title of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Life of Tobias Smollett, M.D. with critical Observations on his Works.</hi>
                    Edinb. 1818, 8vo. But the most able and elaborate of his productions is the
                    third edition of his <hi rend="italic">Life of Samuel Johnson,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">LL.</hi><hi rend="italic">D. with critical Observations on his
                    Works.</hi> Edinb. 1815, 8vo. The same service which he rendered to Dr Smollett
                    he afterwards extended to Dr Moore, having published <hi rend="italic">The Works
                    of John Moore, Μ. D. with Memoirs of his Life and Writings.</hi> Edinb. 1820, 7
                    vols. 8vo. At an earlier period he had published <hi rend="italic">The Poetical

                    Account of his Life, and Observations on his Writings.</hi> Edinb. 1826,

                <p>Dr Anderson contributed his ready aid to many different publications, and was
                    always influenced, not by the love of moneyļ'but by the love of literature. With
                    many emine∏t men in England, Ireland, and America, he maintained ∙ a literary
                    correspondence; and having survived most of his lettered contemporaries, he
                    enjoyed the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193097056" xml:id="kp-eb0703-7056-0115"
                    />esteem and consideration of a second and even of a third 'generation. In 1802,
                    1809, and 1810, he paid three long visits to Dr Percy, the late excellent Bishop
                    of Dromore; and he likewise enjoyed the friendship of Dr Ledwich, Dr Ryan, Mr
                    Boyd, Mr Cooper Walker, and many other literary men of the sister island. No
                    part of his character was more conspicuous than his uniform and unabating zeal
                    to promote the success of young men who discovered any promise, however
                    moderate, of literary talent; and some of the more distinguished writers of our
                    own age and nation were not without their obligations to his disinterested
                    friendship. Mr Campbell dedicated to him his earliest and most popular
                    publication, <hi rend="italic">The Pleasures of Hope.</hi> Miss Bannerman, a
                    very ingenious and accomplished lady, who died at Portobello on the 29th of
                    September 1829, dedicated to him her first collection of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poems.</hi> Edinb. 1800, 8vo. Thomas Brown, John Leyden, and Alexander Murray,
                    who all died at too early an age, were among the most eminent of his young
                    friends. For Dr Brown, who became professor of moral philosophy in the
                    university of Edinburgh, he entertained a very cordial esteem, which suffered no
                    abatement or interruption. Another prominent feature of his mind, was his ardent
                    regard for the civil and religious liberties of mankind. This characteristic he
                    displayed from the first years of manhood till the last day of his earthly
                    existence; and, on the very evening before his death, he gave a signal proof of
                    his unquenchable zeal, by sending for a map of Greece, in order, as he expressed
                    himself, to form some notion of the general elements of this new state. His
                    principles were those of a very decided Whig; and, during the extraordinary
                    excitement which attended the close of the last century, he was sometimes
                    misrepresented as little better than a republican. The honest alarm of one class
                    of individuals, and the hollow zeal of another, had a strong tendency to
                    confound all nice distinctions.</p>
                <p>His bodily frame had never been robust; but the uniform temperance and regularity
                    of his habits contributed to prolong a life which was marked by cheerfulness and
                    benevolence. His faculties, mental and corporeal, betrayed few or no symptoms of
                    old age. During the greater part of his last winter he was confined to his own
                    house by what was considered as a common cold, and was attended by his friend
                    and contemporary Dr Hamilton. His lungs however seemed to be affected in an
                    unusual manner; and, five days before his dissolution, his physician discovered
                    that dropsy in the chest had supervened. As he had now reached a very advanced
                    age, he indulged not even the faintest hope of recovery. Though his chief or
                    only suffering proceeded from difficulty of respiration, the progress of his
                    malady was swift and certain: but the native alacrity of his mind seemed
                    incapable of diminution; and maintaining much and varied conversation during the
                    last days, and indeed during the last hours of his life, he evinced more than
                    his usual continuity of thought and accuracy of expression. As the vital tide
                    was rapidly receding, his heart seemed to expand with new kindness towards all
                    those who approached his couch. Of the immediate prospect of death he spoke, not
                    merely with resignation, but even with cheerfulness; with the subdued but
                    confident hope of one who had long and habitually reposed on the assurances of
                    the Christian faith. He died on Saturday the 20th of February 1830, after having
                    completed the 80th year of his age; and, <hi rend="superscript">;</hi> according
                    to his own directions, lχjs remains were interred in Camwath churchyard. His
                    eldest daughter, Anne Margaret, was married in 1810 to David Irving, LL. D. and
                    died in 1812, leaving an only son. His second daughter, Margaret Susannah, lived
                    to deplore the loss of a parent, whose declining years she” had soothed by the
                    most exemplary attention to all his wants and wishes. (x.)</p>
