                <p>,ARREOYS. Among the more singular secret societies which mankind have formed, is
                    one in Otaheite and the neighbouring islands for the destruction of their own
                    species, <hi rend="italic">called^Arreoy, Arehoe,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Earowie</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and it is not a little remarkable that it
                    should subsist among tribes distinguished for courteousness and humanity. We
                    read in the older authors that there is an absolute prohibition against the
                    females of Formosa rearing children before the age of thirty-six, though it does
                    not appear that there is any limitation as to the age at which their espousals
                    may take place. But in the event of pregnancy, it is necessary that abortion
                    should follow, which is accomplished by the aid of the priestesses of the
                    island. Among the Arreoys, however, extirpation of the infant being constitutes
                    the leading feature of their ordinances.</p>
                <p>Whether Mendana, Quiros, and the earlier navigators of the South Pacific Ocean,
                    discovered this society, does not appear: it has, at any rate, been reserved for
                    those of later date to unfold its principles and peculiarities, though, indeed,
                    its constitution is still enveloped in much mystery, the members being bound to
                    the strictest secrecy.</p>
                <p>The society of Arreoys consists of hundreds or perhaps thousands of both sexes,
                    who engage to destroy their own offspring at the moment of birth. It is chiefly
                    composed of persons distinguished by valour and merit, and hence one or more
                    individuals of each family of the chiefs are of the number. It has been
                    remarked, that all the men profess themselves warriors, and are in general stout
                    and well made; that the greatest trust and confidence are reposed in them; and
                    it rather appears that the women consist of the higher ranks only. There are
                    different gradations in this community, which are to be recognised from the mode
                    of tattooing: the more profusely the men are tattooed, the higher is their rank
                    in society; the first are called <hi rend="italic">Ava bly αreema tutowe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> 2, <hi rend="italic">Arcerna bly;</hi> 3, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ahowhoa</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> 4, <hi rend="italic">Harrotxa; 5, Eote

                    rend="italic">;</hi> and youths training up are designed <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mο</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but the meaning of these names is not
                    explained. By the fundamental laws of the society, the offspring must be
                    destroyed, yet it is not known with certainty by whom or in what particular
                    manner; the murder is always perpetrated in secret, probably by strangulation;
                    all the attendants are excluded; for it is said, were they to witness it they
                    would be adjudged guilty of participation, and put to death. Sometimes the
                    mother, animated by natural affection, tries to preserve her infant, and resists
                    the persuasions of her husband and his brother Arreoys, who wish to consign it
                    to destruction. But in general the enormity of the crime does not appal the
                    females, though they are described to be affectionate and tender. We find a
                    dancing girl pregnant by an Arreoy expressing herself thus to the English
                    navigators: “Perhaps the <hi rend="italic">Etοοa</hi> or deity of England might
                    be offended with the practices of the Arreoys, but her own was not displeased
                    with them. However, she promised if we would come from England for her child,
                    she might perhaps keep it alive, provided we gave her a hatchet, a shirt, and
                    some red feathers.” That the rules of the community are very strict, may be
                    inferred from an instance given by Captain Bligh. A chief, a member of the
                    society, married a sister of the king of Otaheite, by whom he had eight
                    children, and the whole were destroyed at their birth! Nor did this enormity
                    seem to originate from any other source, as the parents afterwards adopted a
                    nephew as their heir.</p>
                <p>It may here be observed, that there are other practices among these people
                    regarding infanticide, which, though we want materials for positively affirming
                    the fact, may perhaps be connected with the institutions of the Arreoys. When an
                    Otaheitan chief has a child by a woman of the lower orders, it is never suffered
                    to live; and the like seems to take place reciprocally among the higher ranks of
                    females. The king and queen of Otaheite having ceased to cohabit, he had taken
                    another wife, and she associated with one of her atfendants of low rank. When
                    pregnant, the missionaries endeavoured to persuade her to spare her child, which
                    she said she would have done had it been her husband’s, but now it would be
                    base-born, and must perish; and she resisted all entreaties to the contrary.
                    Afterwards, having visited them, she excused herself for having put the infant
                    to death, stating that it was the custom of the country to murder all base-born
                    children, and hers being by a low man, she had only complied with the usual
                    practice. Indeed it is affirmed by the missionaries who visited that island in
                    1797 to be a common proceeding among all ranks to strangle infants the moment
                    they are born. “A perpetrator of this horrid act,” the narrator observes, “was
                    among those whom curiosity attracted to visit us. She was a good-looking woman,
                    and esteemed by the natives a great beauty, which I suppose to be the inducement
                    that tempted her to murder her child; for here the number of women bearing no
                    proportion to the men, those esteemed handsome were courted with great gifts,
                    and got so accustomed to change their husbands, to go with them from place to
                    place, and run after the diversions of the island, that rather than be debarred
                    those pleasures, they stifle a parent’s feelings, and murder their tender
                    children.” Thus many hundreddľ born into the world are never suffered to see the
                    light; and so little criminality in the opinion of the natives is attached to
                    the deed, that many women disclose the number they have put to death without
                    scruple. It has bear calculated that at least two thirds of the births on the
                    island perish in this manner.</p>
                <p>The Arreoys enjoy great privileges, and are everywhere united by the reciprocal
                    ties of friendship and hospitality. When they visit different islands, they
                    receive presents, and are entertained with feasting and dramatic exhibitions;
                    and all this they seem to expect rather as a matter of right than of courtesy.
                    Their clothes are of the finest materials. They pass their time in luxurious
                    idleness, perfuming their hair with fragrant oils, singing and playing on the
                    flute, and passing from one amusement to another. “Wherever they go,” says
                    Forster, “the train of sensual pleasure awaits them." They feast on the choicest
                    vegetables; and an abundance of dogs’ flesh and poultry are liberally provided
                    by the lower classes for their entertainment. They are copiously supplied with
                    <hi rend="italic">kava;</hi> and for them are performed nocturnal sports of
                    music and lascivious dances, to which no other spectators are admitted. Their
                    presence seems to enliven the whole country; and among the various
                    entertainments to which it gives birth, is one called <hi rend="italic"
                    >hopοwpah,</hi> of a dramatic nature, in which they themselves act a part. As
                    soon as one Arreoy visits another, though a stranger, he immediately has his
                    wants supplied and his wishes gratified; he is introduced' to other members, who
                    vie with each other in loading him with courtesies and presents. They are of all
                    others the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103738" xml:id="kp-eb0703-3738-0629"
                    />most luxurious and profuse, often consuming the whole provisions of a
                    district. When Captain Cook lay at Hua-heille, no less than 70 canoes were
                    observed crossing over to another island with 700 Arreoys on board; and thus
                    they keep great meetings at appointed times, and travel in companies from one
                    island to another. It has been affirmed, but perhaps without sufficient
                    foundation, that a promiscuous intercourse of the sexes prevails in their
                    society; however, they are permitted great latitude in their amours, except in
                    times of danger, as almost all are fighting men. Sufficient inducements are,
                    therefore, held out to be admitted into this mysterious community.</p>
                <p>Any one may withdraw at pleasure from the society; and an example is given of a
                    chief who had killed his firstborn child, but preserved the second, having
                    withdrawn in the interval. A woman who ceases to be an Arreoy incurs a
                    reproachful name, signifying “bearer of children.” Thus, while in most other
                    countries the name of parent confers honour, and respect, among the Arreoys of
                    Otaheite it is used as a term of contempt and reproach. A chief of some repute,
                    hearing that the king of Great Britain had a numerous offspring, declared that
                    “he thought himself a much greater man, because he belonged to the Arreoys.”</p>
                <p>With respect to the origin of this society, Forster was the first to offer any
                    conjectures, “In a country,” says he, “which has emerged so lately from
                    barbarism as Otaheite, we cannot suppose that such a community, which is
                    evidently injurious to the rest of the nation, would have maintained itself to
                    the present time, were not its advantages so considerable as to require its
                    continuance.” There are two causes, he adds, which favour the existence of the
                    Arreoys; first, the necessity for entertaining a body of warriors to defend.
                    their fellow-citizens from the invasions and depredations of enemies; secondly,
                    it was necessary, by such an association, to prevent the too rapid increase of
                    the number of their chiefs. “Perhaps,” he remarks, “some intelligent Otaheitan
                    lawgiver might foresee that the common people would at length groan űnder the
                    yoke of such petty tyrants, whose number was ever multiplying.” The ordinary
                    practice of infanticide is ascribed by Mr Wilson, who visited the South Seas in
                    1801, merely to the love of pleasure and avarice, which latter passion had
                    gained great ascendancy since the intercourse of the islanders with Europeans:
                    “being well aware,” says he, “that the beauty of females rearing families
                    experiences an earlier decay, it is anxiously preserved for their visitors, by
                    destruction of their offspring, or even by procuring abortion.” Before offering
                    any opinion on this point, we shall notice a custom in the northwest of India
                    somewhat analogous, which also is attended with mystery.</p>
                <p>Amongst certain tribes ca!led Jarejahs, which are more particularly disseminated
                    in the peninsula of Guzerat, the whole females are devoted to death at the
                    moment of their birth. But this is in consequence of general custom, not of any
                    special association. The immediate death of a daughter is viewed as the
                    inevitable consequence of its birth; and the innocent beings falling a sacrifice
                    to this barbarous ordinance yearly amount to many thousands. When a woman is
                    delivered of a daughter, the event is communicated by the female attendants to
                    the father, who desires them to do as is customary; an injunction said to be
                    followed by the mother applying a little opium on the nipple of her breast,
                    which is sucked in by the child. More usually it is strangled by herself, or
                    drowned in a basin of milk; but women of rank, who have attendants, never
                    perform the office themselves. However, from the mystery observed, it is, as
                    among the Arreoys, difficult to obtain correct information. In some districts,
                    any of the female attendants may put the infant to death; in others, a kind of
                    domestic priest becomes the executioner; and the infant being placed naked in a
                    small basket, it is carried out to be interred, for which he receives a trifling
                    fee. Among the Arreoys, those who preserve their children seem to suffer a
                    degree of degradation; and they plead as an apology for their destruction, that
                    it is necessary to preserve the privileges of their tribe. With the Jarejahs,
                    the father is obeyed on signifying his desire for preservation; but if he
                    continues silent on receiving the intelligence, the usual custom must be
                    complied with. The mother is generally averse to the sacrifice, but her scruples
                    to preserve her offspring are seldom attended to; should a short interval
                    elapse, however, before the bloody deed is done, it then becomes unlawful, and
                    the child must be spared.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the murderous practices of the Arreoys in the South Sea islands may have
                    originated in some religious principle. At the same time, it appears that, in
                    the ordinary destruction of infants by the islanders of the South Pacific Ocean,
                    there is nothing of a sacrificial nature; for though they do not suppose that
                    their displeasure is thereby incurred, they do not pretend that the practice is
                    acceptable to any of their divinities. Mr Malthus, we may add, ascribes the
                    origin of the Arreoy institutions to a superabundance of population, and the
                    necessity of adopting some forcible expedients to bring it within the limits of
                    subsistence. (See Forster’s <hi rend="italic">Voyage,</hi> vol. ii.; Cook’s <hi
