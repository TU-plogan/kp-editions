                <p><label type="entry">ANGLE</label>. This term is, owing to the poverty of
                    language, employed to signify very different tilings. In Plane Geometry, it
                    means the opening or separation of two straight lines which meet in a point; but
                    in Solid Geometry, it variously denotes the deviation of a straight line from a
                    plane, the divergence of one plane from another at their line of junction, or
                    even a cluster of plane angles terminating in a common summit. This diversified
                    application of the same word is not likely, however, among mathematicians, to
                    occasion any misconception. But it would be more perspicuous, and certainly more
                    philosophical, to imitate the practice of naturalists in framing a set of
                    cognate words to express the several transitions of meaning.</p>
                <p>The word <hi rend="italic">angle</hi> was drawn from common discourse into the
                    vocabulary of science. Its primitive sense, in all the languages in which it can
                    be traced, is merely a <hi rend="italic">nook</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >corner</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but it has acquired a more precise and
                    extensive application in its transfer to geometry. In its simplest form, it now
                    denotes generally the <hi rend="italic">divergence</hi> or difference of
                    direction between two concurring straight lines. Yet a learner still experiences
                    some difficulty in seizing the correct idea of its nature, which has always
                    baffled the attempts of authors to reduce to the terms of a strict definition.
                    Apollonius, at once the most elegant and inventive of the Greek geometers, was
                    satisfied with representing an angle as a <hi rend="italic">collection of space
                    about a point,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> a description which is not only
                    extremely loose, but which intimates quite a different conception. Euclid, the
                    great compiler of the <hi rend="italic">Elements,</hi> has defined an angle to
                    be the <hi rend="italic">×Kι&lt;nς,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mutual inclination
                    of two straight lines that meet.</hi> But, in strict language, this definition
                    should apply only to the acute angle, in which one of the sides leans towards
                    the other, and deflects from the perpendicular. Without an extension of the
                    meaning of the term <hi rend="italic">inclination,</hi> it will not include the
                    obtuse angle, and far less comprehend angles in general; which, since they are
                    capable of repeated additions, must evidently, as much as lines themselves, be
                    susceptible of all degrees of magnitude.</p>
                <p>It is indeed impossible, by any combination of words, to express completely and
                    accurately the primary notions which form the ground of geometrical science. The
                    more profitable task is to trace the process by which the mind, refining on
                    external observation, comes to acquire such abstract ideas. We seem to get the
                    idea of <hi rend="italic">length,</hi> or of <hi rend="italic">linear
                    extension,</hi> by viewing <hi rend="italic">progressive</hi> motion; and the
                    enlarged conception of <hi rend="italic">angles,</hi> or of <hi rend="italic"
                    >angular magnitude,</hi> is easily attained, from the contemplation of <hi
                    rend="italic">revolving</hi> motion. In opening, for instance, the legs of a
                    pair of compasses, we perceive that their difference in direction gradually
                    increases, keeping pace with the turning at the joint. The quantity of this
                    opening properly constitutes the measure of an angle; and an entire revolution,
                    which brings the moving side of the angle back to its first position, furnishes
                    a <hi rend="italic">standard</hi> of reference. The bisected revolution marks
                    the divergence of a directly opposite position, or that of two segments of a
                    straight line at their point of separation; and the half of this, again, or the
                    divergence of a line proceeding from the same point, and turned equally aside
                    from both segments, is the <hi rend="italic">right angle,</hi> which, therefore,
                    being constant, serves to measure all the rest</p>
                <p>Suppose an inflexible straight line AB to turn from right <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193097238" xml:id="kp-eb0703-7238-0129"/>I to left, about the point or
                    vertex A. It first comes to the [position AC, then to AD, next to AE, and now
                    returning it reaches AF, and lastly it gains its original site AB. The angles
                    thus formed at the point A arise from the combination of successive
                    openings.</p>
                <p>The angle BAD is composed of BAC and CAD; the angle BAE, or that of direct
                    opposition, is compounded of BAC, CAD, and DAE; and the entire circuit is made
                    of the accumulated angle BAC, CAD, DAE, EAF, and FAB. This circuit, being
                    quartered by the straight lines BE and DF, is divided at the vertex A into four
                    right angles. By comparison, therefore, the angle BAC is acute, and CAE
                    obtuse.</p>
                <p>But the side AB can attain the direction AC either by moving onwards, or by
                    turning backwards through the points F, E, and D. The angle compounded of the
                    openings BAF, FAE, EAD, and DAC, may hence be termed appropriately the <hi
                    rend="italic">reverse</hi> of BAC. The defect of an angle from a right angle is
                    called its <hi rend="italic">complement,</hi> the defect from two right angles
                    its <hi rend="italic">supplement,</hi> and the defect from four right angles, or
                    the entire circuit, might be conveniently named its <hi rend="italic"
                    >explernent.</hi> Thus, CAD is the <hi rend="italic">complement of</hi> the
                    angle BAC, CAE is its <hi rend="italic">supplement,</hi> and the reverse angle
                    BAC its <hi rend="italic">explement.</hi></p>
                <p>If we consider attentively the formation of angles about a point, we shall be
                    convinced that two concurring straight lines do not contain merely a single
                    angle, but involve an indefinite multitude of angles; in short, that they
                    comprehend all the revolutions and parts of a revolution by which the one line
                    would successively attain the direction of the other. Hence AB will, after
                    describing repeated revolutions, always return into the same position AC. Thus,
                    if A represent the measure of an angle, and C that of a whole circuit, or four
                    right angles; then the primary angle will include likewise A + C, A + 2C, A +
                    3C, A⅛4C, continued for ever. Of those successive angles, A, A + C, A + 2C, A +
                    3C, A + 4C, &amp;c. the sines, tangents, and secants are severally the same; and
                    so are the versed sines, the cosines, cotangents, and cosecants. This extension
                    of the doctrine of angles is of the greatest importance in the higher branches
                    of geometry, in the application of trigonometrical formulae, and in algebraical
                    analysis.</p>
                <p>Euclid, in the course of his reasoning, has frequent occasion to combine angles
                    together; and yet he never ventures beyond the consideration of those angles
                    which are less than two right angles. Had he composed his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elements</hi> after the science of trigonometry came to be cultivated, he could
                    not have failed to take more enlarged views of angular magnitude. In consequence
                    of his narrow conception of the constitution of angles, the Greek geometer is
                    not a little cramped sometimes, and obliged to adopt a circuitous mode of
                    demonstration. For instance, in the 20th prop, of his third book, that “the
                    angles at the circumference are the halves of those at the centre standing on
                    the same arc,” he quite overlooks the case of obtuse angles at the
                    circumference. But, in the annexed figure, the angle ABC is clearly the half of
                    the <hi rend="italic">reverse</hi> angle AOC at the centre, which is subtended
                    by the large arc AEC. It hence follows that the obtuse angles ABC and ADC
                    contained in the same segment must be equal, since they are both of them halves
                    of the same <hi rend="italic">reverse</hi> angle AOC. Yet, in demonstrating this
                    very obvious corollary, Euclid is constrained to divide the obtuse angles into
                    portions which are shown to be the halves of corresponding angles at the centre.
                    For the same reason he finds it necessary to give a distinct demonstration of
                    the celebrated proposition, that “the angle contained in a semicircle is a right
                    angle.” But this property ought likewise to be considered as a mere corollary;
                    for if the radii OA and OC were supposed to extend in one straight line, and
                    thus form the diameter of the circle, their angle AOC would become equal to two
                    right angles, and consequently ABC, its half, would be one right angle. See

                    attempts of the Greek mathematicians to <hi rend="italic">Double a Cube,</hi>
                    and to <hi rend="italic">Trisect an Angle,</hi> were their first steps beyond
                    the limits of elementary geometry. They soon perceived that such problems cannot
                    be solved by any combination of mere straight lines or circles. To this
                    conclusion they were led directly by the application of <hi rend="italic"
                    >geometrical analysis,</hi> a beautiful instrument of discovery which Plato had
                    recently invented or improved. Their investigations pointed at some curves of a
                    higher order than the circle, and opened to them a wide and interesting field of
                    research.</p>
                <p>The analysis of the trisection of an angle, conducted in two different ways,
                    terminates in the construction of the <hi rend="italic">conchoid,</hi> a complex
                    curve which was first proposed by Nicoedes. As the subject is very curious, and
                    throws great light on the theory of angular magnitude, we shall here not only
                    give both the ancient methods of investigation, but subjoin a third which is due
                    to the sagacity of Newton.</p>
                <p>1. Let it be required to trisect the angle BAC or the arc BC. Suppose the thing
                    already done, and the angle BAD to be the third part of the given angle. From
                    the point C draw CE parallel to AD, meeting the extended diameter in E, and
                    cutting the circumference of the circle in the point F; join FD and FA. It is
                    obvious that the angle BAD is the half of DAC, the remaining part of the whole
                    angle, and therefore equal to the angle DFC at the circumference. But AD and EC
                    being parallel, the angle BAD is equal to AEF, which is hence equal to DFC; and
                    consequently FD is parallel to EB. Wherefore the arc BD is equal to GF, and the
                    angle BAD equal to GAF. The angle AEF is thus equal to EAF, and hence the side
                    EF is equal to AF, the radius of the circle.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193097251" xml:id="kp-eb0703-7251-0130"/>
                <p>To solve the problem, therefore, it would be requisite ' to infleet from C a
                    straight line CFE, such, that the portion FE, intercepted between the
                    circumference and the diameter, or its extension, should be equal to the radius
                    of the circle. The radius AD, drawn parallel to this inflected line CE, would
                    cut off an angle BAD, which is the third part of the given angle BAC.</p>
                <p>But elementary geometry will not in general furnish the means of infleeting CE,
                    according to the required conditions. This must be done either tentatively, that
                    is, by repeated trials, or by the application of a curve, so constituted that
                    every straight line drawn from the <hi rend="italic">pole</hi> C to the <hi
                    rend="italic">directrix</hi> BG shall have the portion EF, intercepted by the
                    curve, equal to AB. This curve is, from its general shape or resemblance to a
                    <hi rend="italic">conch</hi> or shell, named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >conchoid:</hi> it consists of two branches, one above the directrix called the
                    <hi rend="italic">interior conchoid,</hi> and the other below it called the <hi
                    rend="italic">exterior conchoid.</hi> The conchoid being described, will, by its
                    intersection with the circumference of the circle, give the point F, and
                    consequently the position of the trisecting line AD'. But such a complex curve
                    must cut the circumference in more points than one, and consequently the problem
                    of angular trisection, viewed in its generality, admits of several answers. In
                    fact, there are always <hi rend="italic">three</hi> distinct positions of the
                    inflected line CE, which will fulfil the conditions of the problem.</p>
                <p>It is curious to examine these different positions of the inflected line. Draw
                    AD' parallel to the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> position CE', and join D'F,
                    AD', and AF'. Because AF' is equal to E'F', the angle E'AF' is equal to AE'F';
                    and, consequently, the exterior angle AF'C is the double of either of these. But
                    CAF' being an isosceles triangle, AF'C is equal to ACF', which again is equal to
                    the alternate angle CAD'; wherefore CAD' is the double of the angle AE'F'; and
                    being likewise the double of CF'D' at the circumference, the angles CF'D' and
                    AE'F' are equal, and, consequently, F'D' and E'A parallel. Now the angle CAD'
                    being double of E'AF' or D'AG, and the angle CAD double of DAB, the arc DCD' is
                    double of the arcs D'G and DB, which serve to complete the semicircumference;
                    wherefore this arc DCD' is two third parts of the semicircumference, or one
                    third of the whole circumference.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> position AD" of the trisecting line, draw CF"
                    parallel to it, and join AF" and D"F". The isosceles triangles D"AF'' and AF"E"
                    have equal vertical angles; and, consequently, the angles at their base are
                    likewise equal; wherefore AF"D" is equal to the alternate angle F"AE", and the
                    chord D"F" parallel to the diameter BG. But the reverse angle CAD" standing on
                    the are CD'D" is double of the angle CF"D" at the circumference, and therefore
                    double of BE"F" or of BAD"; and the angle CAD being by the first construction
                    likewise double of BAD, the reverse angle CAD", together with CAD, must be
                    double of BAD" and BAD, or the arc CD'GD" is double of DBD", which completes the
                    circumference. Hence the arc DD'D" is two thirds of the circumference.</p>
                <p>It thus appears that the construction of the problem assumes three different
                    aspects, and that the trisecting lines, to which a close analogy conducts us,
                    mutually divide the whole circuit into equal portions. These results are
                    perfectly conformable with the theory of angulaι magnitude. For if A denote the
                    arc BC, and C the whole circumference, this arc will be generally expressed by
                    A. A + C, A÷2C, &amp;c.; consequently, the third part will be expressed by ⅛∙A,
                    ⅛∙A + ^C, ¾A + ∣C, &amp;c., which evidently correspond to BD, BD' and BD". But
                    any farther extension of this progression only brings the trisecting line back
                    into its former positions.</p>
                <p>To solve completely, therefore, the problem of the trisection of an angle; from
                    the pole C, on either side of the directrix BG, with a measure equal to the
                    radius of the circle, describe the exterior and the interior or nodated
                    conchoid; draw CF, CF', and CF" to the three points of intersection with the
                    circumference, and the radii AD, AD', and AD" parallel to these will mark the
                    triple section of the angle BAC.</p>
                <p>It may be perceived that the exterior branch of the conchoid cuts the under
                    semicircle in another point besides F. This occurs in the extension of the
                    radius CA, or where the diameter passing through C, the extremity of the
                    original are, meets the opposite circumference; the portion of the infleeted
                    line, intercepted below BG by the conchoid, being evidently equal to the radius.
                    The fourth intersection, however, affords no real solution, but only exhibits
                    the amount of repeated division, as completing the arc itself.</p>
                <p>2. But another analysis leads to a similar result. Let the angle BAD, as before,
                    be the third part of BAC; draw BC perpendicular to AB, and CE parallel to it,
                    meeting AD produced in E. The right angle DCE would be contained in a semicircle
                    having DE for its diameter; join C with the centre H, and the triangle CHE being
                    isosceles, the exterior angle CHA is double of CEH, or of the alternate angle
                    BAD, and therefore equal to the remaining portion CAD of the divided angle BAC.
                    Whence the triangle ACH is isosceles, and the side CA equal to HC, or the
                    diameter DE must be double of AC.</p>
                <p>The construction of the problem is thus reduced to the drawing from the vertex of
                    the given angle a straight line ADE, such, that the part DE, intercepted between
                    the perpendiculars BC and CE, shall be equal to the double of AC. This can only
                    be done by describing a conchoid from the pole A to the directrix BC, and with
                    the double of AC as the measure; the intersection of the curve with the
                    perpendicular CE will determine the position of the trisecting line ADE. The
                    exterior branch of the conchoid will cut the perpendicular in the point E, and
                    the interior or nodated branch will meet and cross it at the two points E' and
                    E". The radiating lines AE, AE', and AE", or its extension AE", will indicate
                    the complete trisection of the angle BAC. These lines will be found, as in the
                    first construction, to make angles with each other that are equal to the thirds
                    of an entire circuit. It may be worth while to examine the several cases.</p>

                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> position D'AE' of the trisecting* line, draw
                    CH' to the middle point. Because the triangle E'H'C is isosceles, its exterior
                    angle CH'A is double of CE'H', or of the angle BAD'; but H'CA being also an
                    isosceles triangle, CH'A is equal to CAH', and consequently double of BAD. Add
                    CAD, which is double of BAD, and the compound angle DAE' is double of DAD',
                    which would complete two right angles; whence DAE' is two thirds of two right
                    angles, or one third of a whole circuit.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> position, AE"D" of the trisecting line, or
                    rather its extension AE", draw CH" to bisect E"D"∙ The triangles CH"D" and ACH"
                    are then isosceles, and consequently the angle CAD" or CH"A is double of CD"A;
                    but CAE is likewise double of CEA, and therefore the combined angle D"AE is
                    double of the angles CD"A and CEA. Now this angle D"AE, together with the two
                    angles CD"A and CEA, is evidently equal to the exterior angle DC"E or a right
                    angle. Whence D"AE is two thirds of a right angle, or one third of two right
                    angles, and therefore the adjacent angle DAE" is two thirds of <hi

                <p>3. The simplest and most elegant solution of the trisection of an arc was
                    indicated by Pappus, and is given in Castillon’s Commentary on Newton’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Universal Arithmetic.</hi> The problem is there reduced to the
                    combination of the circle with accrtainkind of hyperbola. Butthegeneral property
                    of the directrix, which belongs to all the conic sections, or the lines of the
                    second order, affords the readiest mode of investigation. Let the arc BD be the
                    third part of BDC. Complete the circle, and draw the chords BD, BC, and CD. The
                    arc CD is evidently double of BD, and therefore the angle CBD is double of BCD.
                    Bisect the angle CBD by the straight line BH, let fall the ex-l’ tended
                    perpendicular, and draw the parallel DK. The triangle CHB is evidently
                    isosceles, and HI bisects the base CB. But the triangle CBD having its vertical
                    angle at B bisected, the side CB is to BD as the segment CH of the base to HD;
                    that is, since the triangles CHI and DHK are similar, as CI to KD; wherefore, CB
                    being the double of CI, BD is likewise double of DK. The ratio of the distances
                    BD and DK is thus given, while the point B is given, and the straight line IH
                    given m position. Whence, from the theory of lines of the</p>
                <p>Second Order, the locus of the point of section D is an <hi rend="italic"
                    >hyperbola,</hi> of which B is a focus, and IH a directrix, with the determining
                    ratio of two to one. Let this construction be made, and the arc CDB is trisected
                    in D. For since BD is, from the property of the curve, double of DK, it is
                    evident that BC is to CI as BD to DK; and the triangles CIH and KDH being
                    similar, and CI to CH as DK to DH, it follows that BC is to CH as BD to DH, or
                    alternately BC is to BD as CH to DII. Wherefore the vertical angle CBD is
                    bisected by BH, or the angle CBD is double of CBH or of BCD, and consequently
                    the arc CD is double of of the whole arc CDB.</p>
                <p>But the opposite branch of the hyperbola, which passes through C, also comes into
                    play; and the intersection of these two branches with the circle assigns three
                    different positions of the point D, separated from each other by intervals equal
                    to the third of the whole circumference. Thus, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >second</hi> position D', produce the perpendicular D'K' to the opposite
                    circumference L; and since BD' is double of D'K, it must be equal to the chord
                    D'L, and consequently the arc BDCD' is equal to LD"MD'. Wherefore the double of
                    BDCD', together with the interval BL or CD', is equal to the whole
                    circumference; that is, the double of DCD', with the double of BD and CD', is
                    equal to the whole circumference; and since the double of BD is DC, the triple
                    of the arc DCD' must complete the circumference. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >third</hi> position D", produce the perpendicular D"K" as before: the double of
                    this, or the chord MD", is hence equal to D"B, and the arc BLD" equal to DM:
                    consequently the double of BLD", with the compound arc BDCM, completes the
                    circumference; but D"M being parallel to BC, the arc BLD" is equal to CD'M, and
                    therefore three times the arc BLD", with the arc BDC, or the triple of BD, will
                    fill up the circumference, or the arc DBD" is a third part of it.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For more illustration of this
                    subject, see Leslie’s <hi rend="italic">Geometry of Curve
                    Lines.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>The trisection of innumerable arcs described on the same chord is rendered very
                    conspicuous by combining the separate branches of two hyperbolas that have the
                    determining ratio of two to one, and their foci situate in the extremities of
                    the given line. Thus, let the chord BC be trisected at the points N and 0, and
                    from B and C, as distinct foci, and in the determining ratio of two to one,
                    describe branches of independent hyperbolas. All the arcs erected on BC are each
                    of them divided by those curves into three equal portions. These arcs, as they
                    flatten, approach to the trisected chord CNOB on the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193097277" xml:id="kp-eb0703-7277-0132"/>one hand; and as they become
                    enlarged, they constantly tend, on the other, to the complete circumference
                    which , the asymptotes of the hyperbola, making angles on each side of the axis
                    equal to two thirds of a right angle, would themselves trisect.</p>
                <p>It may be observed in general, that the section of an are or angle admits of as
                    many different answers as the number of divisions proposed. Thus, the
                    quadriseetion would give four distinct results, and a quinsection would involve
                    no fewer than five separate products. Nay, the bisection itself of an are,
                    though within the limits of the most elementary geometry, yet brings out a
                    double result. Thus, the are CDB is bisected by the perpendicular or diameter
                    DID', which not only gives BD for the half of that are, but also BDCD', or the
                    same half-arc augmented by a semicircumference.</p>
                <p>These conclusions agree with the results derived from the general theory of
                    equations. The expression for the sine of a multiple arc is always an equation
                    of corresponding dimensions, which therefore admits of as many distinct roots as
                    the index contains units.</p>
                <p>The ancient geometers were only acquainted with the original division of the
                    circumference into two, three, or five equal portions. The only subdivisions
                    were obtained from the differences of those arcs or their continued bisection.
                    But the very ingenious Professor Gauss has discovered a series of more complex
                    regular polygons, which may be inscribed in a circle by elementary geometry. The
                    expression 2” + 1, when a prime number, will represent the sides of the figure:
                    for the general equation of a cosine of the section can be decomposed into
                    quadratics of the simplest kind, which can be constructed by the repeated
                    application of circles and straight lines. A polygon of 17 sides is the first
                    that occurs after the pentagon; and then follow the polygons of 257, 65537,
                    &amp;c. <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Angles,</hi> an
                    ancient German nation, originally a branch of the Suevi; who, after various
                    migrations, settled in that part of Denmark, and duchy of Sleswick, of which the
                    city of Flensborg is the capital. Here they were known, even in the time of
                    Tacitus, by the name of <hi rend="italic">An-glì.</hi> The origin of this name
                    is variously accounted for. According to Saxo Grammatieus, they were called <hi
                    rend="italic">Angli,</hi> from one Angulus, son of Humblus king of Denmark.
                    Goropius derives their name from the Saxon word <hi rend="italic">Angel</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Engel,</hi> signifying a fish-hook; the Angles, like the other
                    Saxon nations, being greatly addicted to piracy, and on that account being so
                    named by the neighbouring nations; as if, like hooks, they caught all that was
                    in the sea. To this nation the British ambassadors are said to have applied when
                    soliciting succours against the Scots and Picts. The Angles, therefore, came
                    over in greater numbers than any other Saxon nation, and accordingly had the
                    honour of giving the name of <hi rend="italic">Anglia</hi> to England.</p>
