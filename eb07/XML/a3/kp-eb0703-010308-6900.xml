                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">ANCHOR</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Navigation,</hi> from
                    the Greek ayxuga, which Vossius thinks is from oyxrç, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >crook</hi> or <hi rend="italic">hook,</hi> an instrument of iron or other heavy
                    material used for holding ships in any situation in which they may be required
                    to lie, and preventing them from drifting by the winds or tides, by the currents
                    of rivers, or any other cause. This is done by the anchor, after it is let down
                    from the ship by means of the cable, fixing itself into the ground, and there
                    holding the vessel fast The anchor is thus obviously an implement of the first
                    importance in navigation, and one on which too much attention cannot be bestowed
                    in its manufacture and proper construction, seeing that on it depends entirely
                    the safety of the vessel in storms. The invention of so necessary an instrument
                    remounts, as may be supposed, to the remotest antiquity. The most ancient
                    anchors consisted merely of large stones, or baskets full of stones, or sacks
                    filled with sand, or logs of wood loaded with lead. Of this kind were the
                    anchors of the ancient Greeks, which, according to Apollonius Rhodius and
                    Stephen of Byzantium, were formed of stone; and Athenaeus states that they were
                    sometimes made of wood. These sorts of anchors retained the vessel merely by
                    their inertia, and by the friction along the bottom. Iron was afterwards
                    introduced for the construction of anchors, and also the grand improvement of
                    forming them with teeth or flukes to fasten themselves into the bottom; whence
                    the words <hi rend="italic">ooovrες</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dentes</hi> are
                    frequently taken for anchors in the Greek and Latin poets. The invention of the
                    teeth is ascribed by Pliny to the Tuscans; but Pausanias gives the merit to
                    Midas, king of Phrygiâ. Originally there was only one fluke or tooth, whence
                    anchors were called εrsξoo⅛∙o∕4o∕; but shortly afterwards the second was added,
                    according to Pliny, by Eupalamus, or, according to Strabo, by Anacharsis the
                    Scythian philosopher. The anchors with two teeth were called αμ,pzCoao∕ or <hi
                    rend="italic">α,μφιΰτομοι,</hi> and from ancient monuments appear to have been
                    much the same with those used in our days, only the stock is wanting in them
                    all. Every ship had several anchors, the largest of which, corresponding to our
                    bower or sheet anchor, was never used but in extreme danger, and was hence
                    peculiarly termed hga or <hi rend="italic">sacra</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    whence the proverb <hi rend="italic">sacram</hi><hi rend="italic">anchoram
                    solvere,</hi> as flying to the last refuge.</p>
                <p>Anchors are now universally made of wrought iron, excepting in Spain and some
                    parts of the South Sea, where they are made of copper. One essential quality in
                    every anchor is a sufficient weight to fix itself in the bottom; and this has
                    been determined by practice for different anchors, and for vessels of different
                    sizes.</p>
                <p>Large vessels have several anchors of different sizes, and stowed in different
                    parts of the vessel. These are distinguished by different names, viz. the <hi
                    rend="italic">sheet-anchor,</hi> the largest of all, and which is only let down
                    in cases of danger, or when the vessel is riding in heavy gales of wind. The <hi
                    rend="italic">bower-anchors,</hi> of which there are sometimes two or three, are
                    nearly of the same size with the sheet, and are distinguished into best bower,
                    small bower, and spare anchor. The <hi rend="italic">stream-anchor</hi> is of a
                    much smaller size than the above, used only for riding in rivers or moderate
                    streams. It is not generally above one fourth or one fifth of the weight of the
                    others. Lastly, the <hi rend="italic">kedge-anchor</hi> is still smaller, being
                    only about one half of the streamanchor, and is only used when kedging in a
                    river. In ships of war the sheet-anchor is stowed upon the after-part of the
                    fore-channel, on the larboard side, with the stock vertical, and one of the
                    flukes resting on the gang-way. The bower-anchor hangs to the cathead, with the
                    other extremity fixed up to the anchorboards; and the spare anchor is stowed
                    away on the starboard fore-channel. Ships of the largest class carry seven or
                    eight anchors, and the smallest class, as brigs, cutters, and schooners, three
                    or four.</p>
                <p>The weight of anchors for different vessels is allowed by the tonnage. A pretty
                    near rule for the principal anchor of ordinary-sized vessels is to allow for the
                    cwts. in the anchor one twentieth of the tonnage. Thus a vessel of 400 tons
                    would require her principal anchor to be 20 cwts., or according to the following
                    tables :—</p>

                <p>Next to the weight, the form of the anchor, and the proportions of the different
                    parts, are of great importance. The most general form, and that which has indeed
                    been almost universally adopted all over the world, is that represented at Plate
                    XLIII. fig. 1, and in section at Plate XLIV. fig. 1 and 3, consisting of the two
                    hooked arms tor penetrating and fixing themselves into the soil; the long bar or
                    shank for attaching the cable; and the stock, which is attached to the extremity
                    of the shank, and serves to direct one of the points downwards into the soil.
                    The weight of the anchor then causes the point to penetrate more or less
                    according to the softness or hardness of the bottom; and the action of the
                    vessel on the cable, instead of loosening the anchor, tends rather, by the
                    hooked shape of the arms, to fix these deeper and firmer into the soil; so that
                    the vessel is held quite fast, unless either the cable itself gives way, or any
                    part of the anchor, or the. anchor is dragged along owing to the looseness of
                    the soil. The <hi rend="italic">shank</hi> of the anchor is made long,, in order
                    that the stock may have the greater power in directing either the one or the
                    other of the arms downwards. It also serves, when the anchor is to be weighed,
                    as a lever for starting it out of its place; the cable drawing upwards by the
                    extremity, and turning the whole round the point of the fluke. The one end of
                    the shank is made square, to receive and hold the stock steadily in its place
                    without turning. To keep the stock also from shifting along the shank, there are
                    raised on it from the solid iron, or welded on it, two square tenon-like
                    projections, called nuts. The length of the square of the shank is about one
                    sixth of the whole length of the shaft, and the thickness about one twentieth.
                    From the end of this square the shank increases in thickness, tapering towards
                    the extremity, where the arms are attached: in all this part it is either made
                    wholly round, or with a flat on opposite sides, or polygonal. The end next the
                    stock is called the <hi rend="italic">small round.</hi> The other extremity,
                    where the arms and the shank unite, is called the <hi rend="italic">crown,</hi>
                    and the point of the angle between the arms and the shank the <hi rend="italic"
                    >throat.</hi> Here the thickness of the shank is from 11 inch in small anchors,
                    to 3 inches in large ones, greater than at the small round. A distance equal to
                    that between the throat of one arm and its bill is marked on the shank from the
                    place where it joins the arms, and is called the <hi rend="italic">trend.</hi>
                    Near the extremity of the square part of the shank is the hole for receiving the
                    ring for the cable, which is about half the thickness of the small round, and
                    the diameter nearly equal to the length of the square. The ring used to be
                    invariably lapped with cordage, to prevent the cable from chafing against the
                    iron; but since the introduction of iron cables, this has become no longer
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>• The <hi rend="italic">arms</hi> make an angle of about 56° with the shank. They
                    are made either round or polygonal like the shank, about half their length. The
                    remainder of the arm consists of three parts, the <hi rend="italic">blade, the
                    palm,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">bill,</hi> Plate XLIV. fig. 1, and in
                    another view at fig. 2. The blade is merely the continuation of the arm in a
                    square form. The palm or fluke is a broad, flat, triangular plate, fixed on the
                    inside of the blade, the use of which is, by exposing a broad surface, to take a
                    firmer hold of the ground. The bill is the extremity of the arm, where it is
                    tapered nearly to a point, for the purpose of penetrating more readily into the
                    soil. In some cases the arm is made quite straight from the crown to the bill;
                    in others, and particularly in small anchors, the interior half is made with the
                    arch of a circle, as at fig. 3. The whole length of the arm is nearly half the
                    length of the round part of the shank. It tapers slightly from the throat to the
                    blade, where it is about the same thickness with the small round of the
                    shank.</p>
                <p>The palm is about one third of this in thickness, and the breadth of its base is
                    nearly equal to its length.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">stoch</hi> of the anchor, represented at fig. 4, is made of
                    oak, consisting of two beams embracing the square, and firmly united by iron
                    bolts and hoops. The length of the stock is rather greater than that of the
                    shank, the thickness in the middle about one twelfth of its length, and tapering
                    to about the half of this at the extremities, the taper being all on the under
                    surface next the arms, and the other quite straight. The taper is not quite
                    regular. It commences at about half the breadth of the stock from the shank, and
                    continues in one straight line to the extremity. The beams of the stock are
                    hooped close together at the extremities, but gradually open towards the centre,
                    that, in case of the wood shrinking, the hoops may be driven farther in, fig. 5.
                    Of late years the stock has frequently been made of wrought iron, the same as
                    the anchor; and this plan is now very generally followed, particularly with
                    smaller anchors. It has this advantage, that the stock can be at any time taken
                    out and laid parallel with the anchor, which is very convenient for stowage. The
                    iron stock, fig. 6, consists merely of a long round bar, about half the diameter
                    of the anchor at the square. Instead of embracing the anchor, like the wood, it
                    goes through a hole in the square, which is swelled out to receive it. It has a
                    shoulder in the middle, which rests against the square, and a key driven through
                    a hole in the stock on the other side keeps it fast. When the stock is to be
                    taken out of its place, the key is driven out: the stock then slides through the
                    hole in the shank, and by means of a bend at its extremity, it is laid parallel
                    with the shank.</p>
                <p>The operation of the anchor is easily understood. Being let clown by means of the
                    cable,' the weight of the arms throws them downwards, and keeps the whole in a
                    vertical position until it reaches the ground, where it lights upon the crown;
                    and then falling over, the position of the stock at right angles to the arms,
                    and its length and height, together with the weight of the cable, are sure to
                    throw it with one of the arms pointed into the ground, if it does not take this
                    situation of itself. This effect is aided by the anchor descending quickly— and
                    hence it must be allowed to descend freely; for which purpose, in <hi
                    rend="italic">throwing</hi> or <hi rend="italic">casting</hi> the anchor, the
                    cable is arranged along the deck in long coils, called by the seamen a French
                    flake, one end being attached to the anchor and the other secured on deck. Every
                    thing being prepared, the lashing of the anchor is cast off, and the men stand
                    ready to let go; and when this word is given by the person in command, the
                    fastenings are all cast off, and the anchor, falling into the sea, descends with
                    rapidity, and draws the cable after it so violently, that it is often necessary
                    to throw water on the hause holes to prevent their taking fire. When the anchor,
                    again, is to be removed from its situation and drawn up into the vessel, the
                    operation is termed <hi rend="italic">weighing</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    which requires often a very heavy purchase, particularly at starting. This is
                    obtained by means of the windlass, round which the cable is wound, and a number
                    of hands applied to work it. With cables which are too large to be wound round a
                    windlass, a smaller rope is used, termed a messenger, which being attached to
                    the cable at different points, and wound round the windlass, serves to bring the
                    cable forward. But since the introduction of chain-cables this contrivance is
                    not so much required.</p>
                <p>λ∖ hen the anchor is brought above water, a tackle is got upon the shank, just
                    within the flukes, and the arms are hove up so as to lie upon the gunnel and
                    anchor-boards; the stock is then made vertical by heaving upon it with a <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193096926" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6926-0105"/> tackle, in which
                    position it is secured by the stock-lashing. The ring is fastened to the cathead
                    by the stopper, one end of which is fastened round the cathead, and the other is
                    brought through the ring, then over the stopper-cleat, and is belayed round a
                    timber head. To secure the shank at the arms, a chain called the shank
                    painter-chain is passed round it, and fastened to a timber head.</p>

                <p>Besides anchors of the common construction, there are various others of different
                    forms occasionally in use. Small vessels often employ what are termed <hi
                    rend="italic">grapnels,</hi> which are merely common anchors with four or more
                    arms instead of two, as shown in fig. 7. Following out the same principle, we
                    have the <hi rend="italic">mushroom</hi> anchor, fig. 8, much employed in the
                    East Indies, to secure the vessels which they term grabs. In this the arms arc
                    continued in one segment of a sphere all round; it hence requires no stock, as
                    it takes the ground in any direction. Attempts have frequently been made to
                    introduce anchors with only one arm, but hitherto without any decisive result. A
                    patent for an anchor of this kind, as represented at Plate XLIII. fig. 2, was
                    taken out by Mr Stuard, which has attracted some notice. “In order,” says he, in
                    the Specification of his patent, “that this anchor may be sure to fall the right
                    way with the fluke downwards, I would have the shank very short, whereby, when
                    suspended by the cable, it will cant the most, and when it has hold in the
                    ground, the ship will ride safer; as a long shank has more power to loosen and
                    break the ground, and is more likely to be bent or broken from its hold. Let the
                    form of the shank and arm of the anchor be as AA, fig. 2; and, that the parts
                    may be stronger than if made separately and shut together, I would have the bars
                    which compose them in one length, so that there be no weld or joining in the
                    whole length of the shank and arm. The hole B is to receive the ring for the
                    cable, and the hole C is for the stock, which is composed of a wrought-iron
                    bolt, as A, fig. 3, covered with cast-iron at its ends, BB. The palm to be in
                    shape as D, fig. 2, and shown detached in fig. 4, made either entirely of
                    cast-iron, or a cast-iron shell filled with lead, which is of much more specific
                    gravity than iron. The back of the palm to be formed either with concave
                    surfaces or flat surfaces, making angles at the centre. The anchor is also to
                    have a small shackle, fixed on the bend of the shank and arm, as at E, fig. 2,
                    for the buoy-rope to be made fast to. The shank may be made without the hole C,
                    and the hole B made octagonal; or if round, it should have a small fillet
                    projecting from the stock, and a small cavity on one side of the hole B to
                    receive it, thus to prevent the stock from turning round; and instead of a ring
                    for the cable, to have a shackle fitted on the stock, on each side of the shank;
                    and, that the shackle may not turn on the stock and fall too low, a stop is to
                    be fixed on each side at the upper end of the shank.” (See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Repertory of Arts,</hi> &amp;c. vol. v.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mooring Anchors</hi> are those which are fixed in certain
                    situations in harbours or roadsteads, and to which any of the vessels
                    frequenting the place may be secured. As these are no way limited as to weight
                    like portable anchors, they often consist merely of a large block of stone, such
                    as at fig. 9, with an inner ring fixed in the middle of the upper side; or
                    several such stones may be fastened together so as to act as one mass. Mooring
                    anchors are also often made by choosing one of the largest anchors used for
                    first-rate ships, weighing 80 cwt., and by bending one of the arms close down
                    upon the shank, to prevent it catching the cable or mooring chains whilst the
                    ships are riding. These anchors are lowered down into the water with a very
                    strong iron mooring chain fastened to the ring, to which the ships are fastened:
                    they are usually made from such as arc damaged in one of the flukes or arms. A
                    new kind of mooring anchor of cast-iron was described by Mr Hemman of Chatham,
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Society for the Encouragement of Arts, &amp;c.,</hi> in
                    1809, for which he obtained a silver medal from the society. AA, fig. 5, Plate
                    XLIII., represents the palm or heavy part of the anchor, made very massive of
                    cast-iron, and of considerable breadth, so that the edge B, or part which enters
                    the ground, may have a great hold; the shank C is made also of cast-iron, and
                    fixed firmly to the head by passing through it, and has a small ring at <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> where the buoy-rope is fixed; the other end of the shank
                    goes through the stock DD, which is formed of two large wooden beams hooped
                    together in the same manner as the stocks for common anchors; the end of the
                    shank projects through the stock, and has a strong wrought-iron shackle E fixed
                    to it by a bolt passing through both, and with this the mooring chain is
                    connected. The great advantage of this over the common mooring anchors arises
                    from its great weight and breadth of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096939"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6939-0106"/>edge to act against the ground; and, being made of
                    cast-iron, it is also more durable. A pair of these anchors, weighing 150 cwt.
                    each, will, with the mooring chains, cost about L.874 less than a pair of the
                    common anchors, which, with their chains, cost L.2472. (See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions of the Society far the Encouragement of Arts,</hi> ⅛c. vol.
                    xxviii.) Another form of this mooring anchor is shown at fig. 10.</p>
                <p>This is the name given to a sort of anchor which has often been proposed, but
                    never reduced to practice, for preventing a vessel from drifting, in cases where
                    the great depth of the sea precludes the use of the cable and ordinary anchor.
                    The plan suggested by Dr Franklin seems the most rational. This anchor consisted
                    of two cross bars, secured together in the middle, and having sailcloth fastened
                    to them in the shape of a parallelogram. To the centre of these bars the cable
                    was attached, and being thrown overboard, it was thought the resistance of so
                    large a surface would at least check the rapidity of the ship’s motion.</p>
                <p>In fabricating anchors the different parts are first forged 'separately, as the
                    square, the ring, the shank, the arms, and the palms. The square is then welded
                    on to the extremity of the shank, and the ring let through its hole, and then
                    the joining welded. The arms are then welded on to the shank, and the palms to
                    the arms. The forging of such heavy masses of iron as the larger anchors are
                    composed of, and the welding of the parts together, is one of the most difficult
                    operations in smithery, and one which it has required all the ingenuity of our
                    most skilful artists, and a long course of experience, to bring to its present
                    perfection. The shank forms the largest mass. It is formed of an assemblage of
                    smaller bars, united together by welding them into solid masses. This mode is
                    preferable to making a single bar of sufficient size by the forgehammer in the
                    original preparation of the iron, because the compounded bar is not liable to
                    have any internal flaws or cracks, or at least they will not be in a transverse
                    direction; for the bars are all examined separately before uniting them, and any
                    which are imperfect are rejected; if, therefore, after the welding, any cracks
                    are left between the bars, they must be in the length of the anchor, and will
                    not deduct so materially from the strength of the whole.</p>
                <p>Formerly the small bars were laid together, so as to form a square, as in fig.
                    11; and round these, smaller bars were piled to complete the circle; and then
                    this circle was surrounded by bars to the number of 30 or 40, all arranged round
                    the circle, and packed together like the staves of a cask; iron hoops were then
                    driven over all to keep them together, and the whole faggot thus united was
                    welded by repeated heats and elaborate hammering, applied successively from the
                    one end to the other of the bar. Great difficulty was always found in heating
                    and welding together the inside or central bars along with the external ring,
                    the latter becoming quite overheated before the former could be brought up to
                    the welding point. In these circumstances it became very difficult to weld the
                    bar equally, so as to give it all the strength of which the material was
                    susceptible; and it was often thought sufficient to weld merely the outside
                    ring, so as to form a perfect covering or case for the inside bars, which were
                    left in a raw or unwelded state. A more perfect method of welding the heavy bars
                    of the anchor together was introduced some years ago at Plymouth, by Mr Pcrring,
                    clerk of the cheque. This consists in using bars the whole breadth of the shank
                    laid on one another, as at fig. 12, and hooped. These are then welded together
                    in two heats, until the whole is one compact body, which is readily done in this
                    manner, without overworking any part of the iron. If the bars do not extend the
                    whole breadth, they are laid so as to break joint.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">arms</hi> are formed and welded together into a mass in the
                    same manner as the shank. They are then united' to the extremity of the shank,
                    by shutting or welding them all together at the crown, for which purpose the end
                    of the shank is formed with a flatted surface or scarf, having <hi
                    rend="subscript"> a</hi> shoulder on each side, and the ends of the arms with
                    similar scarfs, as at fig. 13. A more perfect method of uniting the arms and the
                    shank,by Mr Perring, is, to form the crown separately of bars similarly to the
                    shank, uniting them into one for half the length only, and the other half
                    remaining split in two, as at fig. 14; then opening this by means of two rods,
                    welded on the ends on purpose, bending them round two steady pins, as at fig.
                    15, so as to form part of the arms, as at fig. 16. The angular opening being
                    then filled up by a piece formed of bars properly welded, another piece half the
                    thickness of the arms is bent over and united with the others, so as together to
                    form the crown and part of the arms on each side. In this manner a much firmer
                    joint is formed than by mere scarfing. The crown piece being thus formed, the
                    shank is welded to one extremity, and the two arms and the blades to the two
                    others. The <hi rend="italic">blades</hi> of the arms are formed in a manner
                    similar to the shank. The palms are made by laying a number of plates one on
                    another, and welding them all properly together, after which the palms are shut
                    on upon the blades.</p>
                <p>After the different parts of the anchor are thus forged and welded together, they
                    are all smoothed and finished off by working with hammers till the metal becomes
                    quite cold. This process, besides improving greatly the appearance of the
                    anchor, is of real use in hardening the surface, and causing it to withstand
                    better the corrosion of the seawater.</p>
                <p>The following is a more particular account of the operations of the anchor-smith
                    on <hi rend="italic">a</hi> large scale. The hearth AA of the anchor-smith’s
                    forge, sec fig. 6, Plate XLIIL, is built of brick-work raised about 6 or 9
                    inches above the ground, and 6 or 7 feet square; in the centre is a large
                    cavity, to contain the fire; at the back of the hearth a vertical brick wall B
                    is erected, supporting and forming one side of the chimney, which is little more
                    than a dome placed over the hearth, and opening at the top with a low chimney to
                    carry off the smoke. Behind the wall the bellows CD are placed; the noses of the
                    pipes being about the level of the hearth, and coming through the wall, which at
                    that part is defended from the action of the fire by a facing of fire-stone. In
                    this fire-stone the tue-iron is fixed; it is a tube made of wrought iron, and
                    very thick in the substance, that it may not burn away in the fire: the pipes of
                    the bellows are inserted in the tue-iron, and thus convey the stream of air into
                    the centre of the fire.</p>
                <p>The bellows are not like those which ordinary smiths make use of; but two large
                    pairs of single bellows CD are placed horizontally by the side of each other,
                    the pipes of both being inserted into the same tue-iron, and directed to blow to
                    the same focus in the centre of the fire: these bellows are exactly like those
                    in use for domestic purposes, which only throw out air when the upper board is
                    pressed down. The two are worked alternately by means of chains <hi
                    rend="italic">c d</hi> attached to the ends of the upper boards, and united to
                    the end of the working levers HI, placed over each pair of bellows. From the
                    opposite extremities of these levers other chains <hi rend="italic">er</hi> are
                    extended to the opposite side of a long lever GG, which moves upon the pivots of
                    a vertical axis E, and is loaded at the ends by heavy weights, to give it <hi
                    rend="italic">momentum.</hi> Now, two or more men pushing in opposite directions
                    can give it a motion backwards and forwards, and by the communication of the
                    chains and upper levers HI, they will alternately lift up the upper boards CD of
                    the bellows, which being sufficiently loaded, will subside themselves, and force
                    their contents <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096952" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6952-0107"
                    />of air into the fire. The men who work the lever G are * aided by six or eight
                    more, who place themselves upon the board of one pair of bellows, and as soon as
                    it subsides, they step upon the other pair, which also sinks, and then they
                    return: they have ropes suspended from the roof to enable them to lift
                    themselves, and mount from one bellows upon the other with more ease. The common
                    tue-iron, which is simply a cone of wrought-iron, set with clay into fire-stone,
                    composing the back of the hearth, is very soon burnt by the great heat. The most
                    improved forges, therefore, are now furnished with what is called the water
                    tue-iron, which is made hollow, and water introduced into it to keep it cool.
                    For this purpose two cones are formed of thick iron plate, each with a small
                    aperture at the vertex; these, when put one into the other, are welded together
                    at their bases and their points, so as to form one cone, which is hollow, with a
                    small space all round; two pipes communicate with the hollow, one bringing a
                    continual supply of cold water, and the other conveying away that which is
                    heated by the fire. By this means the tue-iron is kept cool, and can never
                    acquire such a degree of heat as to be burned away: this tue-iron is set with
                    fireclay into a frame of cast-iron, built up in the brick-work of the wall
                    B.</p>
                <p>The anvil K is only a cubic block of cast-iron, placed on the ground much lower
                    than the ordinary smith’s anvil; because, as the anchor-smiths always strike by
                    swinging their hammers over their heads, at arms’ length, they have more force
                    when the work lies low on the ground than if raised up. At a distance of eight
                    or nine feet from the hearth AA a strong crane-gib LM is erected, so as to turn
                    freely upon the vertical post Μ. It has no tackle, but the upper beam L, which
                    must be horizontal, has a large iron loop <hi rend="italic">n</hi> hung upon it,
                    with a roller <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> which admits it to run freely backwards
                    and forwards upon the beam: the lower end of the loop suspends the anchor;
                    therefore, by moving the rollers along the beam of the gib, and by turning the
                    gib round on its pivots, the ’anchor can be placed in any position in the fire
                    or upon the anvil. To give motion to the roller <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> a rack
                    <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is connected with it; and this is moved by a pinion
                    upon the axis of the wheel <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> which has an endless rope
                    hanging down, so that a labourer can reach it, and thus remove the anchor nearer
                    or farther from the centre, however great its weight may be. The workmen employ
                    scarcely any other tools than their sledge-hammers, and a few large punches,
                    cutting chisels, and sets or prints, which, when urged by the hammers, will give
                    any particular figure to the work: the hammers are of the largest kind, and
                    weigh from 14 to 18 pounds, according to the strength of the workmen. In the
                    Royal dock-yard great use is made of a stamping machine, which the workmen call
                    <hi rend="italic">Hercules,</hi> and which is very similar to the machine for
                    driving piles. A heavy iron weight N, guided like the ram of the pile engine, is
                    drawn up by the strength of several men, and let fall upon the anchor, to weld
                    the bars, in the same manner as by a forge-hammer. The machine is erected on a
                    large block of stone, which supports the anvil 0: two square iron bars PP are
                    fixed on each side of the anvil, in a vertical position, the angles of the bars
                    being placed towards each other. These vertical bars are eight or nine feet
                    high, and are fixed at the top to a beam in the roof of the building in which
                    the machine is placed. The ram N, which weighs 4 <hi rend="subscript"> l’</hi>
                    ļ-cwt., is fitted to slide up and down between the bars P, having notches in its
                    sides, which receive the angles of the bars: it is drawn up by a rope passing
                    over an iron pulley Q, mounted upon pivots above the top of the vertical bars;
                    and the rope has eight or ten small ones R spliced into it, for as many men to
                    act together (which they do by a motion similar to that of ringing), to elevate
                    the ram, and let it fall upon the iron placed upon the anvil 0. The Hercules is
                    placed in the same sweep of the crane as the anvil K, so that the iron can be
                    conveyed to either with equal ease.</p>
                <p>The first step in making the different parts of the anchor is to assemble or
                    faggot the bars. For the centre of the mass which is to make the shank, four
                    large bars are first laid together; then upon the flat sides of the square so
                    formed smaller bars are arranged, to make it up to a circle. The number is
                    various, but in large anchors six or eight bars are laid on every side. This
                    circle is surrounded by a number of bars arranged like the staves of a cask: as
                    many as 36 are often used, and they form a complete case for the others. The
                    ends are made up by short bars to a square figure. The faggot is finished by
                    driving iron hoops upon it at sufficient distances; see W in the figure; and it
                    is suspended from the crane in such a manner that it can be moved and turned in
                    any direction, by only one or two men, even when it weighs three tons. For this
                    purpose an iron pulley <hi rend="italic">lι</hi> is hooked to the iron loop <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> of the crane; and a short endless chain <hi rend="italic"
                    >I</hi> passed over the pulley suspends the faggot in its loop. In this manner
                    the weight of the iron is in reality borne by the pivot of the pulley <hi
                    rend="italic">k,</hi> and the mass can be easily turned round upon its centre to
                    bring any side upwards. To give a power to the man who guides it, one of the
                    four central bars is double the length of the faggot, and projects, see <hi
                    rend="italic">g,</hi> to form a long lever, by which it is steered; and two
                    holes are made through the end of this bar to insert a cross lever <hi
                    rend="italic">k,</hi> by which the faggot is turned or rolled round upon its
                    centre. As the faggot hangs very nearly on a balance in the loop of the chain
                    <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> the man, by weighing on the end of the long bar <hi
                    rend="italic">g,</hi> can easily raise up its end from the anvil K, and,
                    swinging the crane on its pivots, move it into the fire, which is made up hollow
                    like an oven. To effect this form, the fireman first spreads the coals evenly
                    upon the hearth, and with his shovel or slice makes a flat surface about the
                    level of the tue-hole: he then arranges some large cinders or cakes round in a
                    circle upon this surface, and by other cinders builds it up like an oven or
                    dome, leaving a mouth to introduce the iron. The oven is adapted in size to the
                    magnitude of the mass of iron, and must be brought forwards upon the hearth, to
                    leave a space between its interior cavity and the orifice of the tue-iron; in
                    which space a passage is made from the tue-hole to the fire, and filled up with
                    large lighted coals, and then covered up by small coals. The blast from the
                    bellows passes through these hot coals, in order that the cold air may not enter
                    the fire at once and blow on the iron, but be first converted into flame, which
                    is urged forcibly into the oven, and reverberated from the roof and sides upon
                    the iron placed in the centre. As the floor of the oven is nearly upon a level
                    with the tue-hole, the flame from the coals between it and the fire also plays
                    upon the bottom, and thus heats the iron on all sides. The outside of the dome
                    is covered over with a considerable thickness of small coals, which cake
                    together, and, as the inside of the oven consumes, settle down into a dome
                    again, which the smith aids by striking the outside with the flat of his slice.
                    If the fire breaks out at any place in the roof, the smith immediately repairs
                    the breach with fresh coals, and damps them with water, that they may not burn
                    too fast; for if the inside of the oven burns very fiercely, the flames will not
                    be reverberated so forcibly as when it is in the state of burning cake. Care
                    must likewise be taken to prevent the fire from burning back to the tue-iron.
                    The mouth of the oven should be made no larger than to admit the work; and, that
                    as little heat as possible may escape by the iron, the mouth is filled round it
                    with coals. F is an iron screen hung on <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096965"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6965-0108"/>binges, to swing before the mouth of the fire when
                    the 'iron is withdrawn, that the workmen may not be scorched by the heat.</p>
                <p>All the men unite to assist in blowing the bellows, which they work in the manner
                    already described, from half an hour to an hour, according to the size of the
                    anchor, until they have raised the iron to a good welding heat. The mouth of the
                    fire is opened occasionally to inspect the process, and the faggot is turned in
                    the fire if it is not found to be heating equally in every part. Eight men, and
                    sometimes more, are employed to forge an anchor: six of them strike with the
                    hammers, one is stationed at the guide-bar, and the eighth, who is master or
                    foreman, directs the others, and occasionally assists to guide the anchor. When
                    the whole of that part which is in the fire comes to a good welding heat, the
                    workmen leave the bellows and take up their hammers; the coals are removed from
                    the iron, which is swung out of the fire by the man who guides it, assisted by
                    others, and the hot end placed on the anvil; during which time one or two
                    labourers with birch brooms sweep off the coals which adhere to it.</p>
                <p>The smiths now begin hammering, one half the number standing on one side, and the
                    other half on the other: they use large sledges weighing from sixteen to
                    eighteen pounds, and faced with steel, striking in regular order, one after the
                    other, swinging the hammers at arms’ length, and all striking nearly at the same
                    place. The foreman places himself near the man who guides, and with a long wand
                    points out the part he wishes them to strike, and at the same time directs and
                    sometimes assists the guide to turn the faggot round, so as to bring that side
                    uppermost which requires to be hammered. This is continued as long as the metal
                    retains sufficient heat for welding. This process is exceedingly laborious for
                    the workmen, and is much more effectually performed by means of the Hercules,
                    which strikes such powerful blows upon the iron as to consolidate the bars much
                    more than the strokes of small hammers can do, however long they may be
                    continued. When the iron has lost so much of the heat that it will no longer
                    weld, the foreman takes a number of pins, made like very thick nails without
                    heads: one of these he holds in the end of a cleft stick, places its point upon
                    the iron, and two smiths, with their sledges, strike on it with all their force,
                    to drive it through the bars; but this they must do quickly, or the pins will
                    become hot and soft, so as not to penetrate the bar. These pins are intended to
                    hold the whole together more firmly, and, by swelling out the sides, to fill up
                    any small spaces there may be between the bars. The iron is now returned to the
                    fire, another mouth being opened on the opposite side of the oven, to admit the
                    end or part which has been welded to come through, that a part farther up the
                    faggot may be heated; and when this is done the welding is performed in the same
                    manner as before. Thus, by repeated heatings, the faggot is made into one solid
                    bar of the size and length intended. It is then hammered over again at welding
                    heats to finish it, and make an even surface; and in this second operation the
                    workmen do not leave off hammering as soon as the iron loses its full welding
                    heat, but continue till it turns almost black. This renders the surface solid
                    and hard, and closes all small pores at which the sea-water might enter, and by
                    corroding the bars, expand them, and in time split open the mass of iron.</p>
                <p>The shank for an anchor is made larger at the lower end, where the arms are to be
                    welded to it, and is of a square figure. A sort of rebate or scarf s is here
                    formed on each side of the square, in order that the arms may apply more
                    properly for welding. This scarf is made in the original shape of the faggot,
                    and finished by cutting away some of the metal with chisels whilst it is hot,
                    and using sets or punches, properly formed,, to make a square angle' to the
                    shoulder of the scarf. The upper end of the shank is likewise square; and the
                    length between these square parts is worked either to an octagon or round,
                    tapering regularly from the lower to the upper end. The hole to receive the ring
                    of the anchor is pierced through the square part at the upper end, first by a
                    small punch, and then larger ones are used till it is sufficiently enlarged. The
                    punch is made of steel; and when it is observed to change colour by the heat, it
                    is struck on the opposite end to drive it out, and is instantly dipped in water
                    to cool it, and another driven in. The projecting pieces or nuts, which are to
                    keep the stock or wooden beam of the anchor, and its place on the shank, are
                    next welded on. To do this the shank is heated, and at the same time a thick bar
                    is heated in another forge: the end of this is laid across the shank, and the
                    men hammer it down to weld it to the shank; then the piece is cut off by the
                    chisel, and another piece welded on the opposite side.</p>
                <p>Whilst this process of forging the shank is going on, the smiths of another
                    forge, placed as near as convenient to the former, are employed in making the
                    arms, which are made from faggots in the same manner as the shank, but of less
                    size and shorter: they are made taper (seeX), one end of each being smaller than
                    the other: the larger ends are made square, and cut down with scarfs, r, to
                    correspond with those, <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> at the lower end of the shank.
                    The middle parts of the arms are rounded, and the outer extremities are cut away
                    as much as the thickness of the flukes or palms <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> that
                    the palms may be flush with the upper sides when they are welded on. The flukes
                    are generally made at the iron-forges in the country, by the forgehammer; but in
                    some yards they are made by faggoting small bars, leaving a long one for a
                    handle. When finished, they are welded to the arms, which have then the
                    appearance of X. The next business is to unite the arms to the end of the shank;
                    and in doing this particular care is necessary, as the goodness of the anchor is
                    entirely dependent upon its being effectually performed. In so large a weld, the
                    outside is very liable to be welded, and make a good appearance, while the
                    middle part is not united. To guard against this, both surfaces of the scarfs
                    should be rather convex, that they may be certain to touch in the middle first.
                    When the other arm is welded, the anchor is complete, except the ring, which is
                    made from several small bars welded together, and drawn out into a round rod,
                    then bent to a circle, put through the hole in the shank, and its ends welded
                    together. If the shank or other part is crooked, it is set straight by heating
                    it in the crooked part, and striking it over the anvil, or by the Hercules.
                    After all this the whole is heated, but not to a white heat, and the anchor
                    hammered in every part, to finish and make its surface even. This is done by
                    lighter hammers, worked by both hands, but not swung over the head. This
                    operation renders the surface of the metal hard and smooth; and if very
                    effectually performed, the anchor will not rust materially by the action of the
                    seawater. The hammering is continued till the iron is quite black and almost
                    cold. It is common with some manufacturers, after they have made up the shank,
                    to heat it again, and apply the end of a thin flat bar properly heated upon it;
                    then by turning the large shank round, the bar is wound spirally upon it, so as
                    to form a complete covering to the whole. This method admits of emploving a kind
                    of iron which is less liable to corrosion, but we fear it is sometimes resorted
                    to to conceal the bad qualities of the iron of which the anchor is composed.</p>
                <p>The iron from which anchors are made ought to be of the best quality: that kind
                    of it which is called red short <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096978"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6978-0109"/>will not bear sufficient hammering to weld the
                    bars; and cold short, from its brittleness, is not to be depended upon when the
                    anchor is in use. A good anchor should be formed of the toughest iron that can
                    be procured.</p>
                <p>A new and improved method of fabricating anchors, for which a patent has been
                    taken out by Lieutenant Rodgers, has been lately introduced. This consists in
                    making the shank hollow, and uniting it to a solid square at one end, and to a
                    solid piece at the other, which forms the crown and part of the arms. The hollow
                    part is bound at intervals by hoops, and the whole forms a much stronger anchor,
                    of the same weight, than those of the common construction. The stock also is let
                    on over the end of the square, and keyed up against a collar, by which means the
                    anchor can be unstocked with great facility. See Plate XLIII. fig. 7.</p>
                <p>The most extensive establishment for fabricating anchors, &amp;c. is that at
                    Woolwich dock-yard. There the blowing apparatus, the working of the lift and
                    tilt hammers, &amp;c. is all done by a steam-engine of from 14 to 16 horse
                    power. The improvements of Perring and Rodgers have been there introduced.
