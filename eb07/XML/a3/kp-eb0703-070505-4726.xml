                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">ASSAM</label>, a kingdom of Asia, situated on the north-west
                    of Bengal, between the 25th and 26th degrees of north latitude, and extending
                    from 94 to 99 degrees of east longitude. The exact limits, however, are not
                    precisely ascertained; for this country is very little known to Europeans, and
                    what respects its extent to the east is at present to be understood as partly
                    conjectural. Assam is an immense valley, about 700 miles in length by between 60
                    and 80 in breadth, surrounded by high hills on all sides, and interspersed with
                    numerous eminences in the interior, and universally susceptible of cultivation.
                    The whole superficies is calculated at 60,000 square miles, a large portion of
                    which is occupied by woods and rivers, and the remainder consists chiefly of
                    fertile soil; but this calculation is exclusive of any conquered countries, and
                    of the territories that extend in every line beyond the hills. Part of the
                    kingdom is mountainous, particularly what is called Higher or Upper Assam; and
                    part of it is low and level, containing extensive plains, subject to frequent
                    inundations in the rainy seasons. The general position of this great valley, as
                    well as of the mountains and rivers traversing it, is in a direction from north
                    to south. It is bounded on the north by the successive ranges of the mountains
                    of Bootan, Anka, Duffala, and Miree; and on the south by the Garrow Mountains,
                    which rise higher as they recede northward, and change their name to Naga at a
                    place called Coliabark. Probably the rivers intersecting Assam are more numerous
                    than those of any other country of equal extent in the universe, from its being
                    completely environed by hills. The rains are coIIected together, and, pouring
                    down in irresistible torrents, swell' the waters below, until the plains are
                    covered by the inundation. The valley is divided throughout by the Brahmaputra
                    into two parts nearly equal; and many islands, some of them very large, are
                    formed by it and by the confluence and mutual intersection of other rivers. They
                    contribute alike to fertilize the ground and to facilitate the intercourse of
                    the inhabitants, as they are navigable by flat-bottomed boats, capable of
                    transporting them and their property. Of these rivers, not Iess than sixty-one
                    are known and distinguished by particular names, of which thirty-four flow from
                    the northern, and twenty-four from the southern mountains; but the source of the
                    Brahmaputra is scarcely yet ascertained, nor were Europeans acquainted with its
                    course until it was traced by Major Rennell. However, it seems to rise beyond
                    the confines of Assam.. As the rivers change their names at different places, it
                    is sometimes difficult to discover which is meant in the description; and their
                    sizes may be estimated differently, according as they are examined in the time
                    of inundation, or otherwise. Many of them are remarkable for a long and winding
                    course. The Dhekow or Degoo, by the size of which geographers are accustomed to
                    compare the other rivers, rises very far to the eastward of the Naga Mountains,
                    which it traverses for a considerable distance, and then winds 200 miles through
                    the valley from its entrance, until it joins the Dehingh, a great branch of the
                    Brahmaputra. Another river, the Dekrungh, rises in the Duffala Mountains, and,
                    exhibiting a large stream, occupies 100 miles in its windings before falling
                    into the Brahmaputra, though the direct line does not exceed 25. Notwithstanding
                    its depth and rapidity, it is navigable by small boats. The river Pisola⅛ which
                    likewise rises in the Duffala Mountains, pursues a winding course of 60 miles,
                    and, during the rainy season, may be ascended to the base of the mountains; but
                    it is not navigable after the inundations subside. The rivers to the south are
                    never so rapid, as the inundations commence from the northern rivers. Both these
                    and the Brahmaputra are filled, so that the water has no considerable current
                    until May or June, when the current is rather stronger from the south in the
                    season of the rains, though the increase is not very material, as the large
                    river at this period is always pretty full, and checks the rapidity of all the
                    southern rivers.</p>
                <p>Among the numerous islands of different dimensions formed by the intersection and
                    confluence of the rivers, is Majuli, or the Great Island, as it is called by
                    pre-eminence, which appears to constitute one of the chief political divisions
                    of the kingdom. This island extends 100 miles in length by about 60 in breadth,
                    and is formed by the river Dehingh on the west and the Looichch on the north;
                    but, independently of these great aquatic boundaries, it is intersected by
                    numerous streams, so that it in fact consists of a cluster of lesser islands,
                    and some islets besides, near the banks, which in the principal rivers are dry
                    only while no inundations prevail. The other islands throughout Assam are of all
                    different dimensions, from the most inconsiderable size to six, ten, or twenty
                    miles and more in length. A correct picture of the country may thus be figured
                    as being an extensive valley, environed by mountains, and full of rivers and
                    level plains. While the rivers constitute its defence, promote the convenience
                    of its inhabitants, and contribute to fertilize the soil overflowed by their
                    inundations, they interrupt occasional intercourse from their magnitude and
                    rapidity; and it is to be observed that there is only one stone-bridge in the
                    kingdom, which was erected at Rungpore by workmen brought from Bengal. Besides
                    the Great Island, or <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104739"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-4739-0706"/>Majulĭ, Assam contains other two political
                    divisions, Ootrecole, Uttarcul, or Ootreparah; and Deccancole, Dac-shincul, or
                    Deccanparah; the former of which, Ootrecole, denotes the country lying north of
                    the Brahmaputra; the latter, Deccancole, that to the south. And it is farther to
                    be remarked, that Majuli is formed by great arms of the same river, though
                    passing by different names.</p>
                <p>The political subdivisions of Assam are apparently almost as numerous as the more
                    important natural ones; but the province of Camroop in Ootrecole is one of the
                    largest, and the best known by description, at least to Europeans. It formerly
                    gave name to an extensive kingdom, of which the capital seems to have been
                    Rangmattee, beyond the present western confines of Assam. It now stretches about
                    100 miles in length; and its breadth, from the banks of the Brahmaputra to the
                    foot of the mountains, is 40 miles. There are no strong places within its
                    limits, and its chief town is Cotta. The district of Sum-mooria occupies the
                    southern banks of the Brahmaputra; and the district of Nodooaria, which extends
                    to the eastward, is divided into nine shares or districts, held by so many
                    rajahs, though under the rule of only two.</p>
                <p>Valuable minerals are found in Assam: the whole country produces gold in
                    abundance, insomuch that from 12,000 to 20,000 of the inhabitants are said to
                    have been constantly employed in collecting it. This precious metal is found in
                    all the rivers flowing from the northern mountains, but it differs in purity and
                    colour, and also in malleability. That which is obtained in the Dekrungh is
                    particularly celebrated, and is distinguished by a higher colour than that found
                    in the Brahmaputra and other rivers. Gold is more abundant in the bed of the
                    Brahmaputra than in the channel of most of the others, but is considered
                    inferior in colour and quality. What is procured from the bed of the Burrowgown
                    is esteemed as much superior even to the gold of the Dekrungh; the colour is
                    deeper and more vivid, and is compared by the natives to fire; it is likewise
                    deemed of more intrinsic value, and always bears a greater price in Assam. The
                    greatest quantities of gold are found nearest the mountains, which probably
                    indicates that it is carried down from them by the torrents; but it is never
                    sought in the beds of the southern rivers. In the others, as those flowing from
                    the north, it is of a paler colour, less pure, and in smaller quantity,
                    according as it is recovered from the mines farther to the east. The persons
                    employed in collecting it pay a small tribute to the sovereign in proportion to
                    their success. Besides this precious metal, there are mines of silver, lead, and
                    iron, which all belong to the king, and are wrought for his advantage alone.
                    Rock-salt is dug out of the earth, but it is bitter, and of indifferent quality.
                    The vegetable products of Assam are abundant, and of excellent quality: thick
                    and extensive forests cover a large portion of the country; cultivated fields,
                    especially of rice, the staple grain for subsistence, and the finest fruits, are
                    generally to be seen. A Persian writer, Mahommed Cazim, in describing this
                    country, makes some observations on its general appearance, which, as he was
                    hostile to the inhabitants, may probably merit the greater confidence. He speaks
                    of Majuli as “an island well inhabited, and in an excellent state of
                    agriculture: it contains a spacious, clear, and pleasant country, extending to
                    the distance of about 100. miles. The cultivated part is bounded by a thick
                    forest, which harbours elephants, and where these animals may be caught, as well
                    as in four or five other forests of Assam. If there be occasion for them, five
                    or six hundred elephants may be procured in a year. Across the Dhonce, which is
                    the side of Ghergong, is a wide, agreeable, level country, that delights the
                    heart of the beholder. The whole face of it is marked with population and
                    tillage; and it presents on every side charming prospects of ploughed fields,
                    harvests gardens, and groves. From the village of Salagerah to the city of
                    Ghergong, a space of about 100 miles is filled with such an uninterrupted range
                    of gardens, plentifully stocked with fruit-trees, that it appears as one garden.
                    Within them are the houses of peasants, and a beautiful assemblage of coloured
                    and fragrant herbs, and of garden and wild flowers blowing together. As the
                    country is overflowed in the rainy season, a high and broad causeway has been
                    raised for the convenience of travellers, from Salagerah to Ghergong, which is
                    the only uncultivated ground that is to be seen. Each side of this road is
                    planted with shady bamboos, the tops of which meet and are entwined. Among the
                    fruits which this country produces are mangoes, plantains, jacks, oranges,
                    citrons, limes, and punialeh, a species of amleh, which has such an excellent
                    flavour that every person who tastes it prefers it to the plum. There are also
                    cocoa-nut trees, pepper, vines, areca-trees, and the sadi; (an aromatic leaf),
                    in great plenty. Sugar-cane excels in softness and sweetness, and is of three
                    colours, black, red, and white; there is ginger free from fibres, and
                    betel-vines. The strength of vegetation and fertility of the soil is such, that
                    whatever seed is sown, or slips planted, they always thrive. The environs of
                    Ghergong furnish small apricos, yams, and pomegranates; but as these are wild,
                    and not assisted by cultivation and engrafting, they are very indifferent. The
                    principal crop of this country consists in rice and mash. Ades, a kind of pea,
                    is very scarce, and wheat and barley are never sown.” This is a favourable
                    picture of the kingdom; and although the revolutions and convulsions which it
                    has since undergone may have affected the industry of the inhabitants, the means
                    of renewing it remain.</p>
                <p>Elephants, wild buffaloes, hogs, and tigers, haunt the banks of the rivers, which
                    are covered with grass and reeds so as to be impenetrable by men. It has been
                    affirmed that there are neither horses, asses, nor camels here, though two
                    species of the first are natives of a neighbouring territory. The other animals
                    are unknown, but the rivers abound so plentifully with fish as to afford a
                    copious supply to the inhabitants. A particular kind of animal, different from
                    the common silk-worm, according to Turpin, produces silk of another texture,
                    with which beautiful dresses, but of bad quality, are fabricated.</p>
                <p>It is not unlikely that some external physical distinctions prevail among the
                    natives, according as they inhabit the high or the low countries, and that their
                    moral qualities are influenced by the same cause. Mahommed Cazim remarks, that
                    the complexion of the mountaineers, like that of the inhabitants of all cold
                    climates, is red and white. They are an active, hardy race, well formed; but the
                    noses of the women are flattish. Both sexes go almost naked; formerly the
                    mountaineers were absolutely so; and, unlike the easterns in general, none of
                    the females, even those of the highest rank, are veiled. They wear a blue bonnet
                    or cap, from which hogs’ teeth are suspended; which is perhaps of more recent
                    use, as the Persian just referred to says they had neither turbans, robes,
                    drawers, nor shoes. Their most valuable ornaments at present are bracelets of
                    coral or yellow amber, and sometimes tortoise-shell or sea-shells. They dwell in
                    habitations constructed of wood, bamboos, and straw; and there is only an
                    inconsiderable difference between those of die more wealthy and the poorer
                    classes. With regard to their state of civilization, or their manners and
                    customs, we have very little certain information applicable to the present
                    times. Most probably the mountaineers are more barbarous than the inhabitants of
                    the low country and the plains; and as the kingdom is divided into a number of
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104752" xml:id="kp-eb0703-4752-0707"/> petty states,
                    those may be subordinate to some paramount authority; but the frequent broils of
                    the rajahs retard the civilization of their subjects. Mahommed Cazim, who
                    entertained a decided aversion to the Assamese, reproaches them with
                    indiscriminately feeding “on all kinds of food, human flesh excepted; they even
                    eat animals that have died a natural death.” He divides them into two tribes,
                    Assamians and Cultanians; the latter excelling the former in every thing but
                    warlike operations.</p>
                <p>It appears that the government of this kingdom is monarchical, and that a sultan
                    or rajah rules the whole; yet, owing to the incessant contest for power, the
                    course of succession, if it be hereditary, is disturbed, and the most potent
                    chief, gaining an ascendency, restores the country to peace. The government was
                    wont to be mildly administered: in the words of Turpin, the “king was attentive
                    to the happiness of his subjects, and employed none excepting slaves to labour
                    in the mines. It was the only country where humanity was not crushed under the
                    pressure of despotism.” Formerly the rajah kept a guard of six or seven thousand
                    warlike troops, whose courage was equal to any enterprise.</p>
                <p>The religion of these people is supposed by Mr Hamilton to be Brahminical. It is
                    certain that they have many temples erected to their divinities throughout their
                    territories, although the character and description of these divinities have
                    never been explained. In the time of Aurungzebe they are said to have had no
                    settled faith: They do not adopt any mode of worship practised either by
                    Heathens or Mahometans; nor do they concur with any of the known sects which
                    prevail amongst mankind. But it is by no means credible that all their temples
                    have been erected since that era. Rafts covered with human heads are sometimes
                    seen floating down the Brahmaputra through Bengal, which has excited conjectures
                    that they belonged to victims offered to their sanguinary deities. It is not
                    evident, however, that human sacrifices, unless the destruction of life at
                    funeral obsequies be called such, are publicly offered up in the neighbouring
                    Asiatic territories. This species of barbarity has been widely extended over the
                    world; captives were slaughtered at the pile of the ancients,—slaves were buried
                    alive to serve their masters in the world to come,—and even the chosen wife of
                    liter husband’s affections has been doomed to destruction at the same moment
                    that his earthly remains were consigned to oblivion. Such customs have been
                    familiar to mankind from the earliest records of time, and, among the rest, were
                    practised by the natives of Assam. On the decease of a rajah, or any
                    distinguished person, a capacious pit was prepared, where not only his own body,
                    but many of his women and attendants, were also buried. Of the latter was a
                    torch-bearer, together with a quantity of oil and lamps, as essential to his
                    comfort in a future state; some of his most elegant and useful furniture,
                    carpets and clothes, were, in like manner, included; and even elephants,
                    together with gold and silver, formed part of the promiscuous assemblage. A
                    strong roof, resting on thick timbers, was then constructed over the pit, and
                    the miserable victims not already slain were left to perish by a lingering
                    death.</p>
                <p>In regard to the state of the arts, it is to be inferred that the Assamese are
                    behind many nations in their vicinity. Formerly they manufactured excellent
                    silks, chiefly for home consumption; they likewise fabricated velvet, and
                    embroidered it beautifully with flowers. Perhaps the same is continued, as also
                    the extraction of salt from vegetable substances; and their gunpowder was
                    reputed of the best quality. Nay, the easterns hence ascribed the invention of
                    this destructive substance to their ingenuity, and affirm that it passed from
                    them to Pegu, and thence to China. Their chief exports to Bengal are gold,
                    elephants’ teeth, two kinds of lac, which was esteemed the finest in those
                    regions, a coarse raw silk, and coarse cotton cloths. Brandy is made from
                    grapes, afforded by the numerous vines in Assam. Agriculture is certainly well
                    understood: the populousness of several districts which have attracted the
                    attention of the traveller, proves that there is no scarcity of subsistence; and
                    well-frequented fairs are spoken of as being held in different places. Assam
                    contains some celebrated temples, probably of ancient date; and their military
                    causeways, constructed at an early period of their history, are of admirable
                    extent and magnitude. One of these, now in a state of decay, runs from Cooch
                    Bahar in Bengal, through Rangamatty, to the utmost extremity of the eastern
                    limits of the kingdom, serving as a boundary of the Bootan dominions. Another, a
                    work of immense labour, passes the capital; and the banks of the Dhekow are
                    connected with the southern mountains by a lofty rampart, traversing the space
                    of ten or fifteen miles. It is undoubted, that although most authors who have
                    treated of this subject describe these structures as military causeways only,
                    they have served both as the means of communication among the inhabitants during
                    the season of inundations, and as barriers to the overflowing rivers spreading
                    still farther on the plains. Thus the great causeway which approaches the
                    capital was raised to preserve the interior from the inundations of the Dehingh,
                    while in the dry season the river retires two miles from its base.</p>
                <p>A great many towns and villages are scattered over the banks of the rivers of
                    Assam, these having been peculiarly selected by the natives for their
                    habitations; and a certain number seems to be included in a circle under the
                    same administration. The capital, which is called Ghergong, Kirgana, or perhaps
                    more properly Gurgown, is situated in 25° 35' north latitude, 93° 10' east
                    longitude, at a considerable distance above Rungpore, which is sometimes called
                    the capital, but is only the military station of Ghergong. It stands on the high
                    banks of the river Dhekow or Degoo. This city Dr Wade, who resided ten years in
                    Assam, describes to have been ten miles long by five in breadth; and we learn
                    from other authors that it was fortified and encircled by a fence of bamboos,
                    inclosing villages and fields in its circuit. Like other cities of the East,
                    each house stood separate, amidst a cultivated spot or garden; each side of the
                    river was lined with dwellings, and the royal palace was situated on its banks.
                    It had four gates, constructed of earth and stone, from each of which the palace
                    was distant four miles and a half, by which means its position was nearly in the
                    centre, and close to the Dhekow. This palace was a spacious edifice, apparently
                    between two and three miles in circuit, surrounded by a causeway, planted on
                    each side by a close bamboo hedge, serving instead of a wall, and beyond them a
                    wet ditch, always full of water. The interior contained many apartments, both
                    for state and convenience, elegantly ornamented. Mahommed affirms it as an
                    undoubted fact, that 3000 carpenters and 12,000 labourers were constantly
                    occupied, during two years, in constructing the palace; but an insurrection,
                    which took place about the year 1790, proved almost totally destructive of it
                    and the rest of the city. Rungpore, situated in 25° 47' north latitude, and 89°
                    5' east longitude, stands on the opposite side of the Dhekow, with the river
                    Numdaugh flowing on the south; a rampart or causeway to resist the inundations
                    protects it on the east; and on the west it is secured by a bridge, the only
                    access whereby it can be approached. The circle including it contains several
                    towns, and is about twelve miles in length by ten in breadth. Goahautee is the
                    capital of Lower Assam, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104765"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-4765-0708"/>the residence of a viceroy. The surrounding
                    territory occupies a hilly country on both sides of the Brahmaputra, the hills
                    on each side forming a spacious amphitheatre, which has been fortified equally
                    by nature and art. The district Goahautee is divided into north and south,
                    including several strong passes among the fortified hills. A great number of
                    other towns might be mentioned by name; but, excepting their position, we are
                    unacquainted with any thing regarding them.</p>
                <p>The history of this kingdom is involved in great obscurity, arising both from its
                    remote situation, and from a jealousy of strangers, which has almost entirely
                    precluded the access of Europeans; and by a singular fatality, after this
                    difficulty had been conquered by the admission and residence of an intelligent
                    physician, Dr Wade, some of the most important materials collected by him were
                    lost on being transmitted to Europe. The present race of inhabitants is said to
                    have occupied the country during a thousand years, but not by any means in
                    tranquillity; at least we know that, since 1638, they have been involved in
                    frequent contests with their neighbours. In these, however, they have in general
                    been successful, for unconquerable obstacles are opposed to their enemies.
                    “Whenever an invading army has entered their territories, the Assamese have
                    sheltered themselves in strong posts, and have distressed the enemy by
                    stratagems, surprises, and alarms, and by cutting off their provisions. If these
                    means failed, they have declined a battle in the field, but have carried the
                    peasants into the mountains, burnt the grain, and left the country desert. But
                    when the rainy season has set in upon the advancing enemy, they have watched
                    their opportunity tq make excursions and vent their rage; the famished invaders
                    have either become their prisoners, or been put to death. In this manner
                    powerful and numerous armies have been sunk in that whirlpool of destruction,
                    and not a soul has escaped.” Such dangers were sufficient to intimidate the
                    boldest adventurers, and we have the testimony of eye-witnesses that they are
                    not exaggerated. About the close of the fifteenth century, Husein Shah, king of
                    Bengal, invaded Assam with a formidable force of cavalry, infantry, and also of
                    boats; and, in the outset, was successful. The rajah, unable to meet him in the
                    plains, retired to the mountains, whither Husein could not follow him; but
                    returning to Bengal, he left his son with a large army to keep possession of the
                    country; the rainy season commenced, and the roads were shut up by inundations;
                    then the rajah descended from the mountains, intercepted the supplies of the
                    invaders, harassed them with skirmishes, and cut off the whole in detail.
                    Another prince of Hindostan attempted the conquest of Assam, with an immense
                    force of cavalry; but, says the author who records the enterprise, they were all
                    devoted to oblivion in that country of enchantment, and no intelligence or
                    vestige of them remained. The Assamese, however, in 1638 met with a reverse of
                    fortune in leaving their own confines to sail down the Brahmaputra and assail
                    the inhabitants of Bengal, being repulsed by the troops of Shah Jchaun.</p>
                <p>The rajah of Assam had assumed or preserved the title of ⅛arjce or Swerg, which
                    signifies celestial, and lived in great pomp and splendour in the reign of
                    Aurungzebe, the Mogul emperor, who died in 1707. That great prince, desirous of
                    extending his conquests, sent an army, under an able general, to attempt the
                    subjugation of this kingdom; partly, it would appear, to humble the pride of the
                    rajah, who was so vain-glorious as to believe that his ancestors were of divine
                    origin, and that one of them, inclining to visit the earth, descended by a
                    golden ladder; and partly to disseminate the principles of the Mahometan faith.
                    The army advanced victoriously, conquering all opposition, and gained possession
                    of the capital. There the imperial general, considering himself firmly
                    established, made many regulations for internal administration, and also
                    proclaimed the Mahometan religion. Measures were taken for keeping the roads
                    open, and for supplying the army with provisions; and, as the season was now
                    changing, he resolved, when the inundations subsided, to put his troops in
                    motion to extirpate the rajah and those adherents who had escaped. The conquest
                    of Assam extended to a large portion of the country, for all the villages of
                    Decancole submitted to the invaders, and those of Ootrecole followed; yet it is
                    not to be inferred that this was accomplished without loss; for the panegyrist
                    of the general describes the country as spacious, populous, and hard to be
                    penetrated; that it abounded in dangers; that the paths and roads were beset
                    with difficulties; and that the obstacles to conquest were more than could be
                    expressed. The inhabitants, he says, were enterprising, well armed, and always
                    prepared for battle. They had lofty forts, numerously garrisoned and plentifully
                    provided wth warlike stores; and the approach to them was opposed by thick and
                    dangerous jungles and broad and boisterous rivers. Under these circumstances it
                    was wonderful that the army prevailed; “but the Mussulman hordes experienced the
                    comfort of fighting for their religion, and the blessings of it reverted to the
                    sovereignty of his just and pious Majesty.” But the Assamese were unsubdued: the
                    climate proved destructive to the Moguls, who were obliged to evacuate the city,
                    and, after being harassed by the natives, to retreat from the country with
                    diminished numbers.</p>
                <p>Towards the earlier part of the eighteenth century, it is said that some of the
                    Brahmins of Bengal reached Assam, desirous of introducing their religion there,
                    where the inhabitants still had no settled faith. Amidst their exertions for
                    this great object, they persuaded them that it would be gratifying to their
                    deity, Brahma, if they would use salt imported from Bengal in preference to
                    their own, which it greatly excelled. To this the sovereign consented, on
                    condition that it should be monopolized by himself, and that the vessels
                    conveying it should not penetrate beyond the frontier; and, in consequence,
                    forty vessels, each of from 500 to 600 tons burden, have annually been sent
                    thither.</p>
                <p>About the year 1790, the kingdom was in the most distracted state from a widely
                    extended insurrection, followed by the absolute destruction of many important
                    places; and, in the year 1793, a detachment of British troops was sent to aid
                    the restoration of the rajah, who seems to have been dethroned by the
                    insurgents. This detachment gained the capital, and completely effected their
                    object; and the rajah was so sensible of the assistance he had received, that he
                    immediately concluded a commercial treaty very favourable to the British
                    interests. It was probably on this occasion that Dr Wade visited Assam, and that
                    Mr Wood, of the engineers, constructed a map of a considerable portion of the
                    country. Either this or another was transmitted to Britain, we have understood,
                    to be deposited in the Advocates’ Library at Edinburgh; but, after its arrival,
                    it unfortunately never reached the place of its destination, which is much to be
                    regretted, since the geography and history of the country are both so little
                    known.</p>
