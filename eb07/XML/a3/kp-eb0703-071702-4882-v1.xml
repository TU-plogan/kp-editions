                    Assyria in the history of the judges and succeeding kings of Israel, though
                    during that period the latter kingdom was oppressed and enslaved by different
                    powers. According to Ptolemy, Assyria was bounded on the north by Armenia Major,
                    on the west by the Tigris, on the south by Susiana, and on the east by Media;
                    but the name is generally used in a more comprehensive sense, so as to include
                    Mesopotamia, and sometimes even Babylonia and Chaldea. The most common account
                    of the origin and revolutions of the Assyrian monarchy is the following:—The
                    founder of it was Ashur, the second son of Shem, who, removing out of Shinar,
                    either by the appointment of Nimrod or to elude the fury of a tyrant, conducted
                    a large body of adventurers into Assyria, and laid the foundation of Nineveh
                    (Gen. X. 11). These events happened not long after Nimrod had established the
                    Chaldean monarchy, and fixed his residence at Babylon. The Persian historians
                    suppose that the kings of Persia of the first dynasty were the same with the
                    kings of Assyria, of whom Zohah or Nimrod was the founder of Babel. It does not,
                    however, appear that Nimrod reigned in Assyria. The kingdoms of Babylon and
                    Assyria were originally distinct and separate (Micah V. 6); and in this state
                    they remained until Ninus conquered Babylon and made it tributary to the
                    Assyrian empire. Ninus, the successor of Ashur (Gen. x. 11. Diod. Sic. lib. 1),
                    seized on Chaldea after the death of Nimrod, and united the kingdoms of Assyria
                    and Babylon. This great prince is said to have subdued Asia, Persia, Media,
                    Egypt, and other countries. If he did so, the effects of his conquests were of
                    no duration; for in the days of Abraham wé do not find that any of the
                    neighbouring kingdoms were subject to Assyria. He was succeeded by Semiramis, a
                    princess of a heroic mind; bold, enterprising, fortunate; but of whom many
                    fabulous things have been recorded. It appears, however, that there were two
                    princesses of the same name, who flourished at very different periods. Whether
                    there was an uninterrupted series of kings from Ninus to Sardanapalus or not, is
                    still a question. Some suspicion has arisen that the list which Ctesias has
                    given of the Assyrian kings is not genuine; for many names in it are of Persian,
                    Egyptian, and Grecian, extraction. Nothing memorable has been recorded
                    concerning the successors of Ninus and Semiramis. Of that effeminate race of
                    princes it is barely said that they ascended the throne, lived in indolence, and
                    died in their palace at Nineveh. Diodorus (lib. ii.) relates, that, in the reign
                    of Teutames, the Assyrians, solicited by Priam their vassal, sent to the Trojans
                    a supply of 20,000 foot and 200 chariots, under the command of Memnon, son of
                    Tithonus president of Persia. But the truth of his relation is rendered more
                    than doubtful by the accounts of other writers. Sardanapalus was the last of the
                    ancient Assyrian kings. Contemning his indolent and voluptuous course, of life,
                    Arbaces, governor of Media, withdrew his allegiance, and rose up in rebellion
                    against him. He was encouraged in this revolt by the advice and assistance of
                    Belesis, a Chaldean priest, who engaged the Babylonians to follow the example of
                    the Medes. These powerful provinces, aided by the Persians and other allies, who
                    despised the effeminacy or dreaded the tyranny of their .Assyrian lords,
                    attacked the empire on all sides. Their most vigorous efforts were in the
                    beginning unsuccessful. Firm and determined, however, in their opposition, they
                    at length prevailed, defeated the Assyrian army, besieged Sardanapalus in his
                    capital, which they demolished, and became masters of the empire, <hi

                <p>After the death of Sardanapalus the Assyrian empire was divided into three
                    kingdoms, viz. the Median, Assyrian, and Babylonian. Arbaces retained the
                    supreme power and authority, and fixed his residence at Ecbatana, in Media. He
                    nominated governors in Assyria and Babylon, who were honoured with the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">kings,</hi> while they remained subject and tributary to the
                    Median monarchs. Belesis received the government of Babylon as the reward of his
                    services, and Pul was intrusted with that of As- <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    Syria. The Assyrian governor gradually enlarged the boundaries of his kingdom.
                    He invaded Israel, and compelled the usurper Menahem to relinquish the
                    independency of his kingdom, and pay 1000 talents of silver. It is probable that
                    other nations submitted to the power of his arms. The Syrians were either
                    propitiated by an alliance, or reduced by compulsion, to allow his army to cross
                    their country on his invasion of Israel, for through' it he must have marched.
                    On Nabonasser he bestowed the sovereignty of Babylon, and left his elder son
                    Tiglath-pileser heir of his Assyrian dominions. This prince also invaded Israel,
                    and carried more than one of the ten tribes captive to Assyria. The dominions of
                    Ahaz king of Judah being invaded by the confederate hosts of the kings of Israel
                    and Syria, that prince despoiled the ‘temple of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193104895?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-4895-0718"/> its gold and
                    silver, and, along with the treasure of his palace, purchased the support of
                    Tiglath-pilescr, who, entering the Syrian dominions, vanquished and slew their
                    monarch, and fulfilled the predictions of the prophets Isaiah and Amos, by
                    bringing that ancient kingdom to an end. Tiglath-pileser died in the midst of
                    his career of victory, and was succeeded by Shalmaneser, who carried the war
                    into the dominions of Hoshea king of Israel, whom he reduced to submission,
                    imposing an annual tribute upon the kingdom. Hoshea, in attempting to shake off
                    this yoke, again brought upon himself the vengeance of Shalmaneser, who once
                    more subjected the country, and laid siege to Samaria, which capitulated after a
                    defence of three years. Hoshea was put in chains and thrown into prison, and the
                    inhabitants were led into captivity. Hezekiah, king of Judah, also set at
                    defiance the power of Assyria by refusing tribute; but he chose the time for
                    this revolt with greater judgment than Hoshea. The Assyrians were at that period
                    engaged in an unsuccessful war with the Tyrians, during the prosecution of which
                    Shalmaneser died, and was succeeded by Sennacherib, who invaded Judah; upon
                    which Hezekiah, to purchase peace, sent him all the gold and silver with which
                    the temple, as well as his own house, was decorated. The treaty, however, was no
                    sooner concluded than it was trampled upon by Sennacherib, who sent an army to
                    besiege Jerusalem. But the leaders, while haranguing the people who were upon
                    the walls, blasphemed against God, for which, as the sacred historian informs
                    us, they were signally punished, 185,000 of the Assyrians being cut off in one
                    night by the angel of the Lord. This terrible destruction forced him back to his
                    own dominions, where he exercised such tyranny over his subjects that he was
                    assassinated by two of his own sons. Esarhaddon, his third son, ascended the
                    throne, and extended the Assyrian dominions by the conquest of Babylon, Israel,
                    and Syria, and the subjugation of Judah, Egypt and Ethiopia. After the death of
                    Esar-haddon only a few princes appear to have ascended the throne of Assyria,
                    and the kingdom at last was split, and annexed to those of Media and Babylon.
                    Several tributary princes afterwards reigned in Nineveh; but no particular
                    account of them is found in the annals of ancient nations. We hear no more of
                    the kings of Assyria, but of those of Babylon. Cyaxares king of Media assisted
                    Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the siege of Nineveh, which they took and
                    destroyed <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 606. The Chaldean or Babylonish
                    kingdom was transferred to the Medes after the reign of Nabonadius, son of
                    Evilme-rodach, and grandson of Nebuchadnezzar. He is styled Belshazzar in the
                    sacred records, and was conquered by Cyrus B. c. 538.</p>
