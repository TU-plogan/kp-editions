                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">ANIONTUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Marcus</hi></label>, a famous
                    Roman orator. While he filled the office of pretor, Sicily fell to his lot, and
                    he cleared the seas of the pirates which infested that coast. He was made consul
                    with A. Posthumius Albinus, in the year of Rome 653, when he opposed the
                    turbulent designs of Sextus Titus, tribune of the people, with great i esolution
                    and success. Some time after he was made governor of Cilicia, in quality of
                    proconsul, where he performed so many great exploits that he obtained the honour
                    of a triumph. We cannot omit observing, that in ouler to improve his great
                    talent for eloquence, he became a scholar to the greatest men at Rhodes and
                    Athens, m his way to Cilicia, and when on his return to Rome.</p>
                <p>oon after he was appointed censor, which office he dis charged with great
                    reputation, having carried his cause before the people, against Marcus Duronius,
                    who had preferred an accusation of bribery against him, in revenge for
                    Antonius’s having erased his name out of the list of senators, which this wise
                    censor had done because Duronius, when tribune of the people, had abrogated a
                    law which restrained immoderate expense in feasts. He was one of the greatest
                    orators ever known at Rome; and it was owing to him, according to the testimony
                    of Cicero, that Rome might boast herself a rival even to Greece itsel f in the
                    art of eloquence. He never would publish any of his pleadings, that he might not
                    as he said, be proved to say in one cause what might be contrary to what he
                    should advance in another. He was unfortunately killed during those bloody
                    confusions raised at Rome by Marius and Cinna. He was discovered in the place
                    where he had hid himself, and soldiers were sent to dispatch him; but his manner
                    of addressing them had such an effect, that none but he who commanded them, and
                    had not heard his discourse, had the cruelty to kill him. His head was exposed
                    before the rostra, a place which he had adorned with his triumphal spoils. This
                    happened 90 years before the Christian era. <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Antonius,</hi><hi rend="italic">Marcus,</hi> the triumvir, was
                    grandson to the former. When the civil war broke out, he took Caesar’s part, and
                    was made a tribune of the people, in which office he did Caesar great service.
                    Caesar, having made himself master of Rome, gave Antonius the government of
                    Italy. At the battle of Pharsalia Caesar confided so much in him, that he gave
                    him the command of the left wing of his army, while he himself led the right.
                    After Caesar was made dictator he made Antonius general of the horse, though he
                    had never been pretor; in which command he exerted his power with the utmost
                    violence. He was made consul when Caesar enjoyed that honour for the fifth time,
                    the last year of that usurper’s life. On Caesar’s death he harangued the
                    populace with great art, and raised their fury against his murderers, flattering
                    himself that he should easily get into the place which Caesar had filled; but
                    his haughty behaviour made him lose all the advantages his affected concern for
                    Caesar had gained him. His ill treatment of Octavius, and quarrel with him,
                    produced another civil war, which ended in an accommodation between him,
                    Octavius, and Lepidus, fatal to the peace of Rome. They agreed to share the
                    supreme power among them; and many of the most illustrious Romans were
                    sacrificed by proscription to cement this bloody league, which is known by the
                    name of the <hi rend="italic">Second Triumvirate.</hi> But the triumvirs were
                    too ambitious, and hated one another too much, to be long united. Antonius went
                    into Asia to raise money for his soldiers, and during his absence Fulvia, his
                    wife, quarrelled with Octavius. When Antonius was in Asia, indulging himself in
                    all manner of luxury, the famous Cleopatra inspired him with the most violent
                    passion. Hearing of the quarrel between Fulvia and Octavius, and finding
                    Octavius was become publicly his enemy, Antonius entered into a confederacy with
                    Sextus Pompeius, who was still master of Sicily. He then went into Italy, in
                    order to fight Octavius; but Fulvia, who had been the author and promoter of
                    this war, dying, Octavius and Antonius came to an agreement. One of the
                    conditions of this new peace was, that they should together attack Pompey,
                    though the former had lately made an alliance with him. Antonius then married
                    Octavia, sister of Octavius, as a pledge of their renewed friendship, but
                    returned soon after to his beloved Cleopatra, and again lived with her in
                    Alexandria., Octavius took hold of this pretence to inveigh against him, and
                    begin the war again. At last they engaged in a sea-fight at Actium, in which
                    Octavius gained a complete<pb break="no" facs="nls:193099123"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-9123-0274"/> victory, which was followed by the death both of
                    Antonins and Cleopatra. The infatuated Antonius fell upon his own sword; and
                    Cleopatra stung herself to death i with an asp, as was -supposed, to avoid
                    gracing the victor s triumph at Rome.</p>
