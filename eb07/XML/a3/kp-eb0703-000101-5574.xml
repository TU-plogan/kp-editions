                <p>RED-BLOODED ANIMALS only can be said to possess that assemblage of bones
                    denominated skeleton; and as in these the most constant part is the vertebral
                    column, it furnishes the general character of Vertebrated. The shells of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mollusea</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Crustacea</hi> have
                    been generally regarded as a species of internal skeleton; and in the
                    circumstance of affording mechanical support and external protection, they
                    indeed resemble the skeleton of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Vertebrata.</hi> But
                    neither in mode of developement nor in chemical constitution can they be
                    regarded as of the same nature. Hence it is only in the vertebrated classes that
                    it is requisite to study the peculiarities of the skeleton.</p>
                <p>In general characters the bones of the Mammalia resemble those of the human
                    subject. Like them, they are white, firm, elastic, and incompressible. They
                    consist also of compact and reticular or cancellated tissue. In the lower
                    animals the latter kind of structure is in general coarser and looser than in
                    man; and in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> especially the cavities are
                    large. In the carnivorous animals the compact structure is exceedingly dense,
                    and gives the bone much greater weight than in other animals. In the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> also the acoustic or lithoid portion of the
                    temporal bone is of a marble hardness.</p>
                <p>The bones of the Mammalia may, like those of man, be distinguished, according to
                    their mechanical form, into long, flat, and short bones. Though the first class
                    in general possess a medullary canal, this cavity is imperfect or wholly wanting
                    in the bones of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Amphibia.</hi></p>
                <p>The cavities denominated <hi rend="italic">sinuses</hi> are much more completely
                    developed in several of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> than in the human
                    skeleton. In the pig these cavities extend into the occipital bone; in the
                    elephant they not only give the frontal bone extraordinary protuberance, but
                    they extend into the parietal, temporal, and even the occipital bones, and
                    contribute much to augment the volume of the head. In the ox, deer, and sheep,
                    they communicate with the cavity of the horns.</p>
                <p>The bones of <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> are in general whiter, firmer, and
                    smoother than those of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi>; and they consist
                    of a firm, compact substance, which is elastic and hard in the bones of the
                    trunk, and extremely brittle in those of the extremities. With the exception
                    also of some of the thin, flat bones, as the sternum, they consist of thin,
                    compact walls, inclosing large capacious cavities, which contain not marrow, but
                    air, and which communicate by one or more minute holes with the windpipe and
                    lungs. While these cavities, which may be regarded as the most perfect and
                    advanced form of sinuses, diminish considerably the weight of the whole
                    skeleton, by the density and completely cylindrical shape, they rather augment
                    the strength. In the chick, and at birth, the bones are homogeneous and without
                    cavities; afterwards they contain marrow; and eventually this disappears and
                    gives place to air.</p>
                <p>The bones of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles</hi> are not remarkable in any
                    respect, unless in being void in general of medullary cavity. The absence of
                    this canal was originally observed by Caldesi, and afterwards by Cuvier, in the
                    tortoise; by Troja in the bones of the frog and toad; and by Carus in those of
                    the turtle. In the crocodile, however, and in several of the lizard family, they
                    are large and distinct. The bones of Reptiles also are less firm than those of
                    Birds and Mammals.</p>
                <p>The bones of <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> are remarkable for great softness,
                    flexibility, and elasticity. Those of the lamprey, shark, ray or skate, and
                    sturgeon family, are soft, flexible, sectile, of a bluish white colour,
                    translucent, and so elastic that a cutting instrument forced into them is
                    speedily re-truded by the resilient nature of the bony matter. From these
                    characters, the bones of these families have been regarded as cartilaginous, and
                    the fishes themselves have been distinguished by this character. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(Pisces</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">cartilainci, pisces</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">cnondropterygn.)</hi> In the other fishes, the bones, though
                    softer than those of Mammals, Birds, and Reptiles, present a greater degree of
                    firmness and solidity, are whiter and more opaque, and are much less sectile,
                    than those of the cartilaginous division. As in this respect, therefore, they
                    approach the genuine bone of the Mammals, these are distinguished as fishes with
                    osseous skeletons. <hi rend="smallcaps">(Pisces</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >ossei.)</hi></p>
                <p>The bones of both classes of fishes consist of a large quantity of gelatine, with
                    a small proportion of phosphate <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095587"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5587-0002"/>of lime. In the osseous fishes, however, the
                    latter substance is most abundant. .</p>
                <p>The colour of the bones of fishes, though in general whitish gray, is observed to
                    vary in certain genera. In the gar-pike <hi rend="italic">(esox belone),</hi>
                    for instance, they are green, and in the viviparous blenny <hi rend="italic"
                    >(biennius viviparus),</hi> the sand launce <hi rend="italic">(ammodytes
                    tobianus),</hi> and two species of <hi rend="italic">labrus</hi> (the <hi
                    rend="italic">l.</hi><hi rend="italic">lapina</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >aeruginosa),</hi> they assume a green colour after boiling. The causes of these
                    varieties in colour are unknown.</p>
                <p>SECT. 1. OSTEOLOGY OF THE MAMMIFEROUS ANIMALS.</p>
                <p>The skeleton of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> bears a general
                    rĉsem-blance to that of the human subject, in the construction, shape, and
                    disposition of its component pieces. Distinguished, like that, into head, trunk,
                    and extremities, we recognise the importance of the trunk, and especially of the
                    spine, in the different classes of mammiferous animals.</p>
                <p>The spine consists of separate vertebrae, which are conveniently distinguished,
                    as in man, into <hi rend="italic">cervical, dorsal</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >costal, lumbar, sacral,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">coccygeal</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">caudal.</hi></p>
                <p>The number of cervical vertebrae is the same in animals with the longest and
                    shortest necks,—in the horse, camel, and giraffe, and in the mole and ant-eater.
                    They are always seven. The only exception is observed in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ai</hi> or three-toed sloth <hi rend="italic">(bradypustridactyla),</hi> which
                    has 9 cervical vertebrae (Cuvier); and an apparent exception is presented in the
                    dolphin and porpoise, in which the first two are consolidated into one; and in
                    the cachalot or large-headed whale, in which the last six, sometimes the whole
                    seven, are united or ankylosed. The last six are also united in the ant-eater
                    and manis (Cuvier). Even in this state, however, the traces of the original
                    separation are distinct.</p>
                <p>In the ape the cervical vertebrae are distinguished from those of man chiefly by
                    the spinous processes being stronger and not biful, and in their bodies being
                    projected more over each other before, so as to support the head more perfectly.
                    In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga</hi> the transverse processes of the
                    cervical vertebrae are flattened from behind backwards, and those of the <hi
                    rend="italic">atlas</hi> are very large, both for supporting the head and giving
                    attachment to the strong muscles employed in defence, attacking prey, or bearing
                    it off. For the same purpose the spinous process of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >axis</hi> is very prominent, while the others are short and directed towards
                    the head. In the mole and shrew the cervical vertebrae, which are void of
                    spinous processes, are simple osseous rings, which move easily on each other,
                    probably to facilitate the frequent motions requisite in these animals in
                    burrowing. In the hog the cervical transverse processes are compressed and broad
                    before, so as to appear double. In the elephant the cervical vertebrae have
                    short single spinous processes, and the bodies projecting over each other as in
                    the ape. In the Ruminants the length of the spinous processes diminishes as the
                    neck is elongated. Thus they are almost wanting in the camel and giraffe, in
                    which the arched neck is much retro-flected; and the same peculiarity is
                    recognised in those of the’ horse.</p>
                <p>From these facts it results that the length of the neck depends not on the
                    number, but on the longitudinal extent, of the cervical vertebrae.</p>
                <p>The dorsal, thoracic, or costal vertebrae are distinguished by forming the
                    central fixed basis of the ribs; and their number depends on that of the latter
                    class of bones, which is very variable. The number of costal vertebrae varies
                    from 11, which is that of the Chinese monkey, commonbat, armadillo,
                    helmet-headed dolphin <hi rend="italic">(delphinus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >glo-bteeps),</hi> and Gangetic dolphin, to 23, which is that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Unau (Ι3radypus didactylus).</hi> The most common number is 12,
                    which is that not only of man, but of the ourang-outang, silky monkey <hi
                    rend="italic">(simia</hi><hi rend="italic">marikina),</hi> patas <hi

                    great and horse-shoe bat, colugo <hi rend="italic">(galeopithecus),</hi> shrew,
                    hare and rabbit, agouti, flying squirrel, mouse and field rat, and camel and
                    dromedary. The next most frequent number is 13, which is that of the mole, white
                    bear, civet, the cat tribe <hi rend="italic">(ſelis),</hi> the dog, wolf and
                    fox, the <hi rend="italic">didelphis</hi> tribe, the cavy, guinea pig and paca,
                    the mouse tribe, excluding the two exceptions already mentioned, the longtailed
                    <hi rend="italic">manis,</hi> the stag, the antelope genus, the goat, sheep, and
                    ox, and the dolphin and porpoise. The number is 14 in the gibbon, coaïta, and
                    weeping monkey, in the howling ape <hi rend="italic">(simia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">beelzebuľ),</hi> the <hi rend="italic">tarsius,</hi> the brown
                    bear, raccoon and coati, the weazel <hi rend="italic">genus,</hi> the porcupine,
                    hog, and giraffe. It is 15 in the lori, hedgehog and tenrec, in the badger,
                    pangolin, and seal. The number is 16 in the glutton, hyena, ant-eater, American
                    lamantin, and <hi rend="italic">megatherium.</hi> In the horse, quagga, and
                    dugong, they are 18; in the rhinoceros 19; in the Indian elephant and tapir 20;
                    and in the <hi rend="italic">Unau</hi> or two-toed sloth 23, which, as already
                    stated, is the greatest number yet known.</p>
                <p>In the ape family the dorsal vertebrae resemble those of the human subject, but
                    their spinous processes are long, and erect in the macaca and magot. In the
                    bats, instead of spinous processes, which are wanting, there are minute
                    tubercles. The want of these, however, in sundry species, leaves the column
                    comparatively smooth behind. In the proper quadrupeds these processes arc
                    larger, straighter, and stronger, as the head is weighty or supported on a long
                    neck, in order to give attachment to the strong yellow cervical ligament. This
                    peculiarity is very distinct in the giraffe, camel, ox, rhinoceros, and
                    elephant. In the dolphin they are straight, and smaller than those of the
                    loins.</p>
                <p>The lumbar vertebrae vary in number still more, perhaps, than the cervical and
                    dorsal; and this variety may occasionally be traced to the greater or less
                    distinctness with which the sacral and coccygeal are distinguished. The smallest
                    number is 2, which is that of the two-toed anteater, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ornithorhyncus,</hi> and American lamantin; and the greatest 9, which is that
                    of the lori. The most frequent number is 7, which is that of the greater part of
                    the monkeys, the macauco, the great bat <hi rend="italic">(noctula),</hi> the
                    hedgehog, shrew, raccoon; the tiger, panther, puma, and cat, in the feline <hi
                    rend="italic">genus;</hi> the wolf and fox in the dog; the hare and rabbit; the
                    whole murine <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> except the hamster; and in the camel
                    and dromedary. The next number in frequency is 6, which is that of the
                    horse-shoe bat, the colugo <hi rend="italic">(galeopithecus),</hi> the white and
                    brown bear, the coati, the weasel genus, the civet, the lion, among the feline,

                <p>In theQüADRUMANA and <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga</hi> generally the outer Side
                    of each posterior articular process presents an apex turned backward, so that
                    the anterior articular process of the next vertebra is locked between two
                    eminences, which confine its movement much. Though this apex is found <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193095600" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5600-0003"/> in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> it is there shorter; and the arrangement is
                    wanting in the other tribes. The size of the transverse processes indicates the
                    strength of the loins,—a fact which is evinced especially in the instance of the
                    horse, porpoise, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The number of sacral vertebrae is still more various, even in the species of the
                    same genus. Thus, while in several of the ape <hi rend="italic">genus.,</hi> in
                    the lori, in the vampyre bat, the colugo <hi rend="italic">(galcopitaccus),</hi>
                    the coati, and two of the didelphis, there is one sacral vertebra only, most of
                    the apes have <hi rend="italic">sacra</hi> consisting of 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6
                    pieces; the majority of other animals have 3 sacral vertebrae; the hedgehog,
                    porcupine, guinea pig, paca, hare, tiger, several of the murine genus, the
                    ant-eater, rhinoceros, camel, dromedary, chamois, goat, sheep, and ox, have 4;
                    the elephant has 5; the <hi rend="italic">Ai</hi> 6; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Unau</hi><hi rend="italic">Ί</hi>; and in the mole, white bear, and quagga,
                    they also amount to 7. The frequency of the three sacral vertebrae in the lower
                    animals shows that Galen, who ascribes only 3 to the human subject, must have
                    derived this inference from the former.</p>
                <p>These vertebrae are in the mammalia narrower than in man, and their direction
                    forms with the spine, instead of receding backwards, a straight line; an
                    arrangement evidently connected with the horizontal position of the former. The
                    shape of the sacrum in the lower mammals is that of an elongated triangle; and
                    it is further remarkable, that in those species which occasionally assume the
                    erect attitude on the hind leg, as apes, bears, and sloths, the width of the
                    sacrum is proportionally greater. The sacral spines, which are short in man and
                    the ape, become longer in the Zoom <hi rend="smallcaps">aga,</hi> and form a
                    continuous ridge in the rhinoceros, most ruminants, and especially in the mole.
                    In the vampyre bat the sacrum forms a long compressed cone, the extremity of
                    which is united to the ischial tuberosities, without sustaining a coccyx. The
                    seal has two sacral bones; but the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">e. g.</hi> the dolphin and porpoise, are void both of sacrum and

                <p>The coccygeal bones constitute the tail of the lower animals, and in many
                    instances they are extremely numerous. The smallest number is 3, which is that

                    determinate order, descending so low as to 9, 8,7, 6, and 4. The quilled
                    duckbill <hi rend="italic">(echidna, ornithorhyncus</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">(ornithorhyncus paradoxus)</hi> has at least 20. The gibbon and
                    vampyre bat are the only mammiferous animals, excepting the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cetacea,</hi> in which there are no coccygeal bones. It sometimes happens that
                    a monkey or opossum loses a portion of its tail, when the truncated end is
                    converted into a knotty excrescence, sometimes carious, always different from
                    the taper point of the last coccygeal vertebra; and in this case it is difficult
                    to determine the exact species.</p>

                <p>In general, however, if we reckon the first 2, 3, or 5 vertebrae after the costal
                    as lumbar, it may be said that the caudal vertebrae of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cetacea</hi> vary from 22 or 25, which are the numbers respectively in the
                    lamantin and dugong, to 34, 38, and 42, at which they may be estimated in the
                    dolphin. We shall see that, in the dugong at least, we arc guided in this
                    estimate by the rudimental bones of the pelvis.</p>
                <p>The coccygeal or caudal vertebrae of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> may
                    be distinguished into two kinds; those which contain a canal in continuity with
                    that of the vertebral column and sacrum, and those in which the pieces are
                    solid. The first, which are next the sacrum, have articular, transverse, and
                    spinous processes, distinct in proportion as the animals move their tails. The
                    latter are generally prismatic in shape, diminish in size towards the extremity,
                    and have only slight tubercles for muscular attachments. Animals with prehensile
                    tails, as the American ape <hi rend="italic">(sapajous),</hi> have above, at the
                    base of the body of each vertebra, two small tubercles, between which pass the
                    tendons of the flexor muscles. By means of this mechanism these animals can
                    twine the tail round the branch of a tree with sufficient force to support the
                    weight of the body.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> with long mobile tails have often two or
                    three small supernumerary bones placed on the lower surface of the junctions of
                    several of the coccygeal vertebrae, from the 3d or 4th to the 7th or 8th. These
                    sesamoid bones give attachment to muscles. In the beaver, which employs its tail
                    as a trowel, the transverse processes are remarkable for size, while the lower
                    spinous processes are larger than the upper ones,—an arrangement which enables
                    it to depress the tail forcibly when it beats the ground.</p>
                <p>The shape of the chest in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> varies in
                    general as the clavicles are present or wanting. In animals provided with
                    clavicles, as the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana,</hi> bats, the squirrel,
                    beaver, mole, ant-eater, hedgehog, and sloth, the shape of the chest approaches
                    to the human, or is conoidal, and flattened before and behind. In those void of
                    clavicles it is compressed laterally, from the smaller incurvation of the ribs;
                    and the sternum makes a remarkable prominence, so that the transverse or
                    intercostal diameter is less proportionally, and the sterno-vertebral· is
                    greater proportionally, than in man and the claviculated animals. In the
                    long-legged animals, as the giraffe and those of the stag kind, this prominence
                    of the sternum is sufficient to give it a keel-like appearance <hi rend="italic"
                    >(thorax</hi><hi rend="italic">carinatus).</hi> In the carnivorous animals the
                    chest presents its greatest longitudinal extent.</p>
                <p>The number and shape of the ribs varies in the different tribes. In number,
                    indeed, the ribs always correspond with that of the costal vertebrae. Thus, in
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadruma-na,Zoopnaga,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"

                    the common duckbill <hi rend="italic">(ornithorhyncus paradoxus)</hi> has 17;
                    the horse and quagga have 18, the rhinoceros 19, the elephant and tapir 20, and

                    the greatest known number. On the whole, the most prevalent number is 13. In the
                    carnivorous animals they are narrow and dense in structure. In the herbivorous
                    they are large, broad, and thick. In the armadillo the two first ribs are large
                    compared with the others. In the two-toed ant-eater, which has 16 pairs, they
                    are so broad that they are imbricated over each other like the plates of a
                    corslet, and render the parietes of this animal’s chest exceedingly solid. In
                    the two species of duckbill <hi rend="italic">(ornithorhyncus paradoxus</hi> and

                    long or vertebral joined to the spine, and a short or sternal attached to the
                    sternum. These portions are united by cartilage, so as to resemble the ribs of
                    birds. The 9 or 10 false ribs terminate before in broad, flat, oval plates of
                    bone, which are mutually connected by elastic ligaments.</p>
                <p>The sternum, which is broad in the ourang and pongo, is narrow in the other
                    species of ape, and consists of seven or eight pieces. In the vampyre and all
                    the bat family it is narrow, but presents before or below rather a prominent
                    azygous ridge or keel <hi rend="italic">(carina),</hi> and an anterior
                    extremity, broad on the sides, like a T, for receiving the clavicles. In the
                    mole the clavicular extremity of the <hi rend="italic">sternum</hi> is continued
                    before the ribs, and is flat on the sides for receiving the two short clavicles.
                    In the hog the sternum is broad behind and narrow before. In the rhinoceros,
                    horse, and elephant, it is prolonged before and flat on the sides. In the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> it is broad and thin, especially before.</p>
                <p>Though the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana</hi> have 8 cranial bones, the
                    sphenoid often consists of two portions, one forming the orbitar wings and the
                    anterior clinoid processes, the other the temporal or large wings, the posterior
                    clinoid processes, and the basilar fossa. The two parietal bones are early
                    united into one in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Chiroptera</hi> and the other Zoo-
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">phaga,</hi> in which, however, the frontal remains biparted
                    by a middle suture. The temporal tympanum is separated from the rest of the bone
                    by a suture, which is seldom obliterated in the feline, canine, and <hi
                    rend="italic">viverra</hi> genera. The temporal tympanum is also separate in the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> and the frontal ununited. The parietal is
                    united in some, as the hare, the porcupine, <hi rend="italic">cabia,</hi>
                    marmot, rat, and squirrel; separate in the mouse, fat dormouse, and rabbit. The
                    frontal and parietal bones of the elephant are early united with the other
                    cranial bones, find form a vault without trace of suture. In the hog, tapir, and
                    ’ <hi rend="italic">hippopotamus,</hi> the two parietal bones form one piece,
                    while the frontal bone is biparted; and though in the rhinoceros both are
                    biparted, the frontal is early united into one portion. The sphenoid bone of the
                    animals of this tribe long consists of two pieces, one forming the orbitar wing;
                    the other the temporal wings, which, it is to be further observed, are the
                    smallest, in opposition to their proportional dimensions in man. In the
                    Ruminantsand <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula</hi> the frontal remains long
                    parted by its middle suture; but the two parictals are represented by a single
                    bony vault. The tympanum is always distinct from the temporal bone. In the seal
                    and walrus the parietal and the frontal consist of two pieces. The lamantin has
                    only one bony arch, representing the two parietal and the squamous part of the
                    temporal bones, while the temporal tympanum is detached from the rest of the
                    bone. In the other <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> the. parietal bones are at
                    an early period united to the occipital and temporal bones, so that the five
                    form one solid portion. The auditory or pyramidal bone is always detached from
                    the temporal, and adheres to the cranium by soft parts only. The sphenoid is not
                    only long separate, but consists of several portions.</p>
                <p>Though, among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana,</hi> the cranium oţ the
                    ourang-outang approaches that of man in shape, it differs nevertheless in the
                    connections of the constituent bones. The temporal wing of the sphenoid bone is
                    very narrow, does not reach the parietal, and touches the frontal only by its
                    upper extremity, so that the temporal bone is partly articulated with the
                    frontal. The temporal suture is not imbricated, but serrated. The same mode of
                    connection is observed in the mandrill, macaca (s. <hi rend="italic"
                    >cynocephalus),</hi> magot, and guenon <hi rend="italic">( Cercopithecus),</hi>
                    or tailed monkey tribe. In the American monkey the temporal wing of the sphenoid
                    touches neither the frontal nor the parietal bones; but the temporal bone is
                    articulated directly with the malar by its flat portion. In the American monkeys
                    the frontal bone does not touch the temporal wing of the sphenoid, and the
                    parietal is articulated to the malar. In the howling ape <hi rend="italic"
                    >(simia</hi><hi rend="italic">beelzebuι)</hi> the connections are as in man.</p>
                <p>The connections of the cranial bones are in the Zoo-PHAGA the same as in man. In
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> the sphenoid is joined to the frontal and
                    temporal, without touching the parietal; and the orbitar and temporal <hi
                    rend="italic">fossae</hi> are very small. In the armadillo, pangolin, and sloth,
                    the connections are as in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi>; but in the
                    ant-eater the parietal bone, continued below the cranium, is united to the
                    sphenoid at the posterior part of the orbito-temporal <hi rend="italic"
                    >fossae.</hi></p>
                <p>In the elephant, though the cranial bones are at an early period consolidated
                    into one, the auditory is always distinct from the temporal bone. In the hog,
                    tapir, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus, the sphenoid is united to the parietal
                    bone, and its temporal wings occupy a small space only of the orbitar and
                    temporal fossae. The orbitar wings, though larger, appear small externally. The
                    auditory bone, though distinct, is, however, united by its base to the margin of
                    the auditory canal of the temporal bone. The sphenoid of the ruminants is
                    articulated, as in man, with all the cranial bones; but its orbitar wing, which
                    is extensive, is principally concealed within the cerebral cavity, and covered
                    by the orbital part of the frontal bone. In the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cetacea</hi> generally, all the sutures which remain after early life are
                    squamous or imbricated.</p>
                <p>The outline of the frontal bone in the ourang-outang is more irregular than in
                    man, and the orbitar arches are less surbased. In the American monkeys its
                    outline is triangular, and terminates in a point towards the vertex. In the
                    others of this family <hi rend="italic">(Simia),</hi> this bone is almost
                    elliptical, and the orbitar arches arc nearly straight; and in the whole family
                    these arches form, as in man, the anterior border of the frontal bone, in
                    consequence of the narrowness of the root of the nose. In the makis it begins to
                    widen, and the eyes become oblique,—a circumstance which gives their frontal
                    bone a rhomboidal shape.</p>
                <p>The frontal bone in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga,</hi> and in all the
                    subsequent <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> except the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cetacea,</hi> forms an irregular prismatic or cylindrical surface with three
                    faces—a superior, bounded before by the muzzle, behind by the cranial convexity
                    and two lateral, descending into the or-bitar and temporal <hi rend="italic"
                    >fossae</hi> on each side. The hedgehog, mole, shrew, ant-eater, some of the <hi
                    rend="italic">phocae,</hi> the morse or walrus, and the rhinoceros, have no
                    proper orbitar arches; and the frontal bone, though broad behind, is contracted
                    and nearly cylindrical between the orbits. In the hippopotamus, the ruminants,
                    and the one-hoofed animals, it enlarges, and forms a vault over each orbit.
                    Lastly, in t ιe <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> it is narrow from before
                    backward, resembling a fillet stretched across the cranium, but descends beneath
                    the maxillary bones to form the floor of the orbit.</p>

                <p>The parietal bones of the ourang-outang differ from those of man only in their
                    temporal margin being nearly straight. Those of the ape are narrower, and become
                    more oblique-angled as the cranium is flattened. Tn the Zoo-PHAGA and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Edentata</hi> they are almost rectangular. The single parietal
                    of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> is nearly quadrilateral; but it is
                    sometimes flat, sometimes rounded, sometimes surmounted by a crest. Of the
                    single parietal bone of the ruminants, that of the stag, most of the antelope
                    <hi rend="italic">genus·,</hi> the sheep and the goat, is broad, and sends on
                    each side a narrow process into the temporal <hi rend="italic">fossa</hi> before
                    the occipital arch; in the camel it is narrower, and bears a longitudinal crest;
                    and in the ox and <hi rend="italic">antilope</hi><hi rend="italic">bubalus</hi>
                    it is placed behind the occipital crest, and resembles a fillet surrounding the
                    back of the head transversely. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula</hi> the
                    single parietal is nearly quadrilateral, and placed before the occipital
                    crest.</p>
                <p>The occipital bone in the lower mammalia is remarkable for five characters. 1.
                    The proper occipital surface, instead of being oblique or horizontal, and
                    inferior or basilar, becomes vertical and posterior. 2. The plane of the
                    occipital hole forms with that of the orbits an angle constantly diminishing,
                    becomes parallel to the orbitar plane, and at length crosses it above the head.
                    3. The plane of the occipital condyles, instead of being transverse and
                    horizontal, becomes oblique, and at length vertical. 4. The basilar or cuneiform
                    process is not only horizontal, but forms with the occipital a right angle. And,
                    5. The mastoid process, which in man and the ape forms part of the temporal,
                    belongs in the other mammalia to the occipital. In the polar bear, however, the
                    mastoid process constitutes part of the temporal bone.</p>
                <p>From the 1st, 2d, and 3d characters, it results that the head of quadrupeds is
                    not balanced on the spine, but is suspended by muscles, tendons, and ligaments,
                    especially the strong cervical, which connects the occipital spine to the
                    spinous processes of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae. This ligament,
                    therefore, though feeble and indistinct in man, is strong, particularly in
                    quadrupeds with heavy head or long neck, in order to counteract the disadvantage
                    of the long lever. It is strongest in the elephant, and is almost wholly
                    ossified in the mole—a condition requisite for the burrowing faculty exercised
                    by that animal.</p>
                <p>The temporal bone is naturally distinguished in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >•Mammalia</hi> into two parts; a flat or proper temporal, corresponding to the
                    squamous part of the human temporal bone, and the pyramidal, acoustic, or
                    auditory, corresponding to the pyramidal or lithoid portion of the human
                    subject. The first only, which is proper to the scull, claims attention here. In
                    the ourang-outang and most of the genus <hi rend="italic">simia</hi> it forms a
                    trapezium with the longest side above, and the height of which varies with that
                    of the scull. In the American apes it is smallest in this direction. In the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga</hi> the proper temporal bone is as in the ape. Being
                    narrow in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> behind, it is a little rounded
                    in the short-muzzled <hi rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ruminantia,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Paciiydermata.</hi></p>
                <p>The ethmoid is, strictly speaking, the olfactory bone, and shall be mentioned
                    under the organs of sense. The sphenoid, among other offices, may be regarded as
                    the essential ophthalmic bone.</p>
                <p>The facial bones of the lower <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> differ from
                    those of man; first, in the number of separate pieces; and, secondly, in the
                    form and proportional horizontal extent.</p>
                <p>The difference in number consists in each superior maxillary bone being divided
                    into a maxillary bone proper, and an anterior or labial portion; which being
                    interposed between the proper maxillary, are commonly denominated the
                    intermaxillary <hi rend="italic">(ossa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >intermaxillaria).</hi> As it bears also the superior incisors, it is named by
                    Haller the incisive bone <hi rend="italic">(os</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >incisivum)</hi>; but since it is found not only in the ruminants, which,
                    excepting the camel, are void of incisors, but in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Edentata</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> this denomination is less
                    applicable than the former. It may be doubted whether these should be regarded
                    as additional bones, as they are generally represented by zootomists; for they
                    are in truth merely the incisive or anterior portion of the superior maxillary
                    bones. In other respects, the difference between the human and the animal
                    superior maxillary bone is, that in the former each bone is in one piece, in the
                    latter it is in two. Even in the human foetus the trace of the separation may be
                    recognised; and we have seen it in the human scull some years after birth.
                    Conversely, it is early obliterated in some quadrupeds. Thus, though distinct in
                    the ourang-outang seen by Cuvier, it was not found by Tyson or Daubenton, and is
                    wanting in one preserved in the Hunterian museum. In a young specimen of the
                    jocko also, noticed by Cuvier, no trace of the intermaxillary suture was
                    observed. It appears also to be wanting in the perforated bat, the horse-shoe
                    bat, and the three-toed sloth.</p>
                <p>Mutually united on the mesial plane, the intermaxillary bones are united to the
                    maxillary by sutures, which pass from the outer angles of the latter, near the
                    incisive holes, towards the palate, where they intersect. In form and size it
                    varies in the different orders and genera. Small in many of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga</hi> and the walrus, it is large in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> in the hippopotamus, porpoise, and cachalot, and
                    prominent in the wombat. In the duckbill’ it consists of two unciform portions,
                    united by a broad intermediate cartilage.</p>
                <p>The peculiarity of the animal face consists in the horizontal elongation of the
                    two jaw-bones. In the monkey tribe this elongation is trifling; and all that is
                    remarked is, that the palate and maxillary bones are more elongated in
                    proportion to their height, and that their anterior part, instead of being
                    vertical, is more or less inclined forwards. The degree of this elongation,
                    which differs in different <hi rend="italic">genera,</hi> may be estimated by
                    the acuteness of the facial angle.</p>
                <p>The narrowness of the interorbital space is another character of the animal
                    countenance. In the <hi rend="italic">guenon</hi> and American ape it is a mere
                    <hi rend="italic">septum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but in the ourang-outang,
                    magot, and howler, it is larger, by reason of the nasal <hi rend="italic"
                    >fossae</hi> ascending to this height. From these the face of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga</hi> is distinguished by the following circumstances.
                    1. The breadth of the ascending maxillary processes throws the orbits to the
                    sides; 2. these orbitar surfaces form the anterior wall instead of the floor of
                    the orbit; 3. the malar bone is united neither to the frontal nor to the
                    sphenoid bone, and forms only the zygomatic arch and the lower margin of the
                    orbit; 4. the orbit, closed neither behind nor below, communicates freely with
                    the temporal <hi rend="italic">fossa</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, 5. the
                    palate bones are much elongated and form a considerable space of the internal
                    wall, to which the ethmoid bone does not contribute. In the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Rodentia</hi> the interorbital space is still larger, by reason of the size of
                    the intermaxillary bones throwing the maxillary backwards and to the sides,
                    where they form the inner orbitar wall, in which the palate bones occupy only a
                    small space. The anterior wall is formed by a process of the maxillary, which
                    contributes to form the zygomatic arch, while the malar is suspended in the
                    middle between the process and that of the temporal bone. Very similar is the
                    face of the elephant, except that the height of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >alveoli</hi> from the tusks, thrusting the nose upwards, and shortening its
                    bones, alters entirely the expression of the head of this animal.</p>
                <p>In the sloth, in which the face is short in proportion to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193095639" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5639-0006"/>the scull, the malar bone
                    attached to the maxillary only, is not united to the zygomatic process of the
                    temporal. In the long-muzzled <hi rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi> in which the
                    face is conoulal, the maxillary bones extend to the orbits, and are scpaiat-ed
                    by a broad lacrymal bone, while a long palate bone forms the inner wall of these
                    <hi rend="italic">fossae.</hi> The zygomatic arch, which is interrupted in the
                    ant-eater and pangolin, is completed in the Cape ant-eater and the armadillo. In
                    the tapir and rhinoceros the maxillary bone passes beneath the orbit; and the
                    nasal bones form a sort of vault, which supports in the first animal the trunk,
                    and in the second the horn. . <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>,</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> the maxillary and intermaxillary bones
                    form a sort of flattened beak, distinguished into four parallel bands, of which
                    the maxillary, which are external, alone bear teeth in three genera, provided
                    with the latter organs. The nasal <hi rend="italic">fossa</hi> is a vertical
                    opening before the cranium, surrounded before and laterally by the
                    intermaxillary bones. The maxillary ascend in the same manner, and cover that
                    part of the frontal bone which forms the orbitar vault, but do not themselves
                    contribute to the formation of this cavity. The nasal bones are two minute
                    tubercles implanted on the frontal bone above the narrow aperture. The malar is
                    in the shape of a style, suspended by cartilages beneath the orbit; and the
                    latter cavity is completed behind by a process of the frontal, which joins the
                    zygomatic of the temporal bone, and below which the orbitar and temporal <hi
                    rend="italic">fossae</hi> communicate.</p>
                <p>The direction of the orbits, the shape of their base or facial border, and their
                    relation to the temporal <hi rend="italic">fossa,</hi> are important
                    circumstances in the animal face and cranium. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >simiae</hi> the angle of the orbitar axes is rather smaller; and the shape of
                    the margin, which is quadrilateral in the jocko, becomes oval in the
                    ourang-outang and American monkeys. The angle of the axes enlarges in the other
                    Mammalia; and the base or anterior margin becomes nearly circular in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Zoopiiaga,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata</hi>; but
                    the arch is incomplete behind. In the <hi rend="italic">Ruminants</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Solidipeda,</hi> however, in which it is also circular, the
                    border is complete. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> the orbitar vault
                    is semicircular, their axes are rectilineal, and there is no floor.</p>
                <p>In the human scull the junction of the malar bone with the frontal and.sphenoid
                    completes the orbit externally, and prevents it from communicating with the
                    temporal <hi rend="italic">fossa</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the same
                    arrangement is observed in the <hi rend="italic">simiae.</hi> In the <hi

                    rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata,</hi>
                    however, in which the malar bone is united neither to the frontal nor the
                    sphenoid, the orbit is not only incomplete on the external posterior border, but
                    communicates freely with the temporal <hi rend="italic">fossa.</hi> In the
                    Ruminants is observed an arrangement intermediate between that of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana</hi> and that of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Carnivora.</hi> The malar bone, united to the frontal, completes the orbitar
                    ring; but as it is not united to the sphenoid, it allows the orbits and
                    temporal/ossAE to communicate. The orbit of the mole is so superficial, that it
                    can scarcely be said to exist.</p>
                <p>The lower jaw of the mammiferous quadruped differs from that of man chiefly by
                    the following circumstances. The triangular flat surface which constitutes the
                    chin,.and which is most distinct in the Caucasan race, begins to become faint in
                    the negro, and is altogether lost in the monkey tribe. In the ourang-outang,
                    indeed, the animal character of the lower jaw appears distinct in the vertical
                    convexity of the anterior arch of the jaw, and the retreating of its lower
                    margin. In the lower <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana</hi> the anterior maxillary
                    arch is still more retreating, and the maxillary <hi rend="italic">rami</hi>
                    form a more acute and elongated angle. These animal characters are still more
                    conspicuous in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Car</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >nivora,</hi> most of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata,</hi> Ruminants, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia.</hi> The
                    ascending <hi rend="italic">ramus</hi> also becomes short in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata</hi> and several of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cetacea,</hi> more so in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga,</hi> and is almost
                    extinct in several of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> for instance the
                    paca, beaver, and porcupine, and the armadillo, ant-eater, and duckbill, among
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Edentata.</hi> In the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Zoophaga,</hi> however, in which the prehensile and masticatory muscles are
                    large and powerful, the <hi rend="italic">ramus</hi> becomes broad, and its
                    coronoid process is extensive. The angle which the <hi rend="italic">ramus</hi>
                    forms with the body of the jaw, and which is almost right in the adult human
                    subject, becomes obtuse in the lower animals, nearly at the same rate at which
                    the <hi rend="italic">rannts</hi> disappears; and indeed the transition of the
                    angle into a straight line implies the disappearance of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ramus.</hi> This, therefore, is the character in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Edentata</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> in which there is neither
                    <hi rend="italic">ramus</hi> nor coronoid process, after thesie parts have been
                    seen for the last time in the amphibious <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia.</hi></p>
                <p>When the mammiferous cranium is considered generally, and the relative direction
                    and proportion of the cranial and facial part of the head examined, we recognise
                    more distinctly the characters by which the lower orders of that class arc
                    distinguished from man. This character consists in the position of the occipital
                    bone and hole, the position and direction of the facial bones in relation to the
                    frontal, the elongation of the former, and large size which they present in
                    relation to the cranial.</p>
                <p>In the human subject, it has been already observed, the position of the occipital
                    bone is oblique and horizontal, and the plane of the occipital hole is
                    horizontal, while its position is anterior. In most quadrupeds, while the bone
                    assumes a vertical position, the hole becomes posterior, and its plane vertical
                    or oblique, in proportion as the face is elongated. The plane of the occipital
                    hole forms with that of the horizontal a considerable angle, which Daubenton
                    undertook to determine, by drawing one line through the plane of the aperture,
                    and another from its posterior margin through the lower edge of the orbit.
                    (J∕e⅛. <hi rend="italic">de l’Acad, des Sciences de Paris,</hi> 1764, p. 568.)
                    In the horse this angle is about 90°, while in the ourang-outang it is only 37°,
                    and in the <hi rend="italic">lemur</hi> 47°. In other respects, however, it
                    furnishes an imperfect result, since in most quadrupeds which differ very much
                    it ranges between 80° and 90°.</p>
                <p>The direction of the face in relation to that of the&lt; cranium, determined
                    according to the method of Camper,] furnishes more accurate results. While in
                    the human <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> subject it varies, according to the
                    races, from 70° to 80°, in the ourang-outang it is only 65°; in the American and
                    long-tailed monkeys about 60°; in the macaca and baboon about 45°; and, lastly,
                    in the mandrillo, the most vicious and ferocious of the monkey tribe, only 30°.
                    In some species in which the ear is elevated and the guttural <hi rend="italic"
                    >fossa</hi> deep, for instance in the pongo and <hi rend="italic">alouate</hi>
                    or howler, the small size of this angle does not indicate proportional
                    elongation of muzzle; and to rectify this inconvenience, it is requisite to draw
                    the basilar line of the facial angle parallel to the base of the nostrils. With
                    this modification, however, the Camperian line admits of correct application to
                    the human race and <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana</hi> only, in which the
                    frontal sinuses are small and not prominent. In quadrupeds, for instance the
                    carnivora, several of the ruminants, and in the elephant, the frontal sinuses
                    are so large and prominent as to affect the results given by the facial angle
                    very materially. In other orders, again, for instance the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Rodentia</hi> and the morse, the nose occupies so much space that the cranium
                    is inclined backwards without its walls being free before; and it is impossible
                    to know where the facial line passes. These, therefore, must be measured by the
                    inner surface. Lastly, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095652"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5652-0007"/>in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> the
                    pyramidal elevation of the cranium above an elongated but flattened face renders
                    the facial line much more vertical than it ought to be. The following
                    measurements show the angle subtended by a line drawn parallel to the base of
                    the nostrils, and another passing by the anterior margin of the <hi
                    rend="italic">alveoli,</hi> and touching the convexity of the cranium, whether
                    the point of contact be concealed by the face or not.</p>

                <p> Aware of the imperfect results obtained in this method of measurement, Cuvier
                    proposes to estimate the relative proportion of the cranial and facial part of
                    the head, by comparing the respective areas exhibited by a longitudinal and
                    vertical section of both. In this section the area of the cranium is to that of
                    the face sometimes in a ratio of majority, sometimes of minority, occasionally
                    of equality.</p>
                <p>In the European the area of the cranial section is about four times that of the
                    face, excluding that of the lower jaw. In the negro the cranial area remaining
                    the same, that of the face augments about one fifth, whereas in the Calmuck it
                    augments only one tenth. In the ourang-outang the proportion is still less. In
                    the American ape the facial is almost half the cranial area. The ratio is that
                    of equality in the mandrill and most of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Carnivora,</hi>
                    except the varieties of short-muzzled dogs, as the pug, in which the facial is
                    rather less than the cranial area. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata,</hi> Ruminants, and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Solidungula,</hi> the facial is larger than the cranial area. Among the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> in the hare and marmot, it is a third larger; in
                    the hedgehog double; in the Ruminants almost double; in the pig a little more
                    than double; nearly triple in the hippopotamus; and almost four times in the
                    horse. In the morse and elephant the face is rendered large by the height of the
                    <hi rend="italic">alveoli;</hi> and it may be regarded as augmenting the organs
                    of the senses. The cranium of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> is very
                    convex, and the face very flat, and the proportional area of the latter is
                    thereby diminished. The facial area of the dolphin may be a third larger than
                    the cranial.</p>
                <p>The outline of the cranial section in the human subject is oval, that of the
                    facial section forms a triangle, with the longest side contiguous to the
                    cranium, and the smallest without, while the angle formed by the latter with the
                    third side or palate is the facial. In the lower animals, this triangle, which
                    may be named the <hi rend="italic">facial,</hi> becomes so much elongated, that
                    the cranial side, which is the longest in man, becomes the shortest of the three
                    in the <hi rend="italic">cynocephalus</hi> and mandrill, and continues so in the
                    other quadrupeds.</p>
                <p>The basin <hi rend="italic">{pelvis')</hi> of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia</hi> in general agrees with that of man in forming a part common to
                    the trunk and the lower extremities. It differs, however, altogether in the
                    direction which it takes, which is obliquely backwards, with its anterior
                    opening or brim forwards and downwards, and in the bones being smaller and much
                    narrower; both of which characters are connected with its not being used in the
                    lower animals to oppose the gravitating weight of the abdominal and pelvic <hi
                    rend="italic">viscera,.</hi> In the apes, most similar to man, the coxal bones
                    are much elongated; and in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga,</hi> their
                    superior or ilial part is not much broader than their pubal. In the Ruminants,
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Solidungula,</hi> the ilial portions again become broad; and in the elephant
                    and rhinoceros especially, this width, combined with the length of the
                    ilio-pubal <hi rend="italic">rami</hi> and the concave abdominal surface,
                    concurs to give the <hi rend="italic">pelves</hi> of these animals the
                    prodigious capacity by which they are distinguished. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >pelvis of</hi> the amphibious <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> differs from
                    that of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoopiiaga</hi> only in being narrow and
                    elongated, and in the <hi rend="italic">pubis</hi> being thrown behind. In the
                    ant-eater, mole, and shrew, the pubal junction is open as in birds; and in the
                    two latter <hi rend="italic">genera,</hi> the bones are so narrow that the
                    sexual and urinary organs are placed without its circumference. In the sloth <hi
                    rend="italic">genera,</hi> e. g. the <hi rend="italic">Ai</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Unau,</hi> the pelvis is wide, the cotyloid cavities turned
                    upwards, and the ischial tuberosity is united with the sacrum, so as to convert
                    the ischiatic notch into a hole. This sacro-ischial junction is also observed in
                    others of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi> as the ant-eater and
                    armadillo, and in the <hi rend="italic">phascoloma {didelphis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ursina).</hi> The marsupial animals present two minute bones, one
                    on each side, connected by movable articulation to the pubis, and which are
                    employed to sustain the mammillary pouch <hi rend="italic">{marsupium)</hi> or
                    nipple-bag, in which the young are reared after exclusion from the <hi
                    rend="italic">uterus.</hi> These bones, which are distinguished by the name of
                    marsupial <hi rend="italic">{ossa marsupialia),</hi> are oblong and flattened.
                    Lastly, in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> in which the pelvic
                    extremities are wanting (Plate XXXIV. fig. 2), the pelvis is also so far
                    deficient, that instead of consisting of the sacrum and coxal bones, it is
                    represented by a small bony appendage, suspended in the soft parts on each side
                    of the anus, and which, meeting at angles on the mesial plane so as to form a
                    bone like the letter V, are merely a rudiment of the ischial bones.</p>
                <p>The shoulder of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> generally differs from
                    that of man by the absence or the proportions of the collarbone, and by the
                    shape of the <hi rend="italic">scapula.</hi></p>
                <p>The collar-bone exists in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana</hi> nearly as in
                    man; but it is wholly wanting in the three orders of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ungulata</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">—</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata,</hi>
                    the Ruminants, and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula—</hi> and in all the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cetacea.</hi> Between these extremes it is found in various
                    forms in the intermediate orders of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Unguiculata.</hi>
                    Among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga</hi> it exists in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ciiiroptera,</hi> especially the bats proper, in which it is
                    strong and large; the <hi rend="smallcaps">Insectivora,</hi> as the hedgehog,
                    shrew, and mole <hi rend="italic">genera</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in the
                    didelphis or opossum among the marsupial animals. In the others of this order,
                    as the bear, raccoon, coati, weasel, otter, dog, cat, and seal, the collar-bone
                    is represented by clavicular bones, suspended among the muscles, touching
                    neither the sternum nor acromion; and in some species it is altogether wanting.
                    The <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> may be distinguished into two
                    subdivisions, as they are provided with or void of collarbones. The first
                    comprehends the squirrel, beaver, and mouse, with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >helamys,</hi> marmot, and aye-aye or cheiro-mys <hi rend="italic">genera.</hi>
                    The second consists of the porcupine, hare, and cavy <hi rend="italic"
                    >genera,</hi> as the guinea-pig and paca, in which the collar-bone is rudimental
                    only, suspended among the soft parts. It exists in most of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi> as the sloth, armadillo, ant-eater, and the
                    gigantic fossil animal named <hi rend="italic">megatherium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but it is wanting in the pangolin, and was believed to be wanting in the
                    <hi rend="italic">echidna</hi> and duckbill till Cuvier demonstrated its
                    existence. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> there is no vestige of
                    collar-bone.</p>
                <p>From these facts it results that the clavicle exists in all animals, the fore
                    legs of which are frequently or habitually protruded, either to seize, as apes
                    and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi>; or to fly, as bats; or to dig and
                    burrow, as the mole; or to rake the ground, as the hedgehog and ant-eater. In
                    the mole particularly, the collar-bone, instead of being long, is <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193095665" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5665-0008"/>a broad, thick, short,
                    quadrangular bone; and while it is connected to the acromion by a ligament, it
                    is articulated to the humerus by a large facette. The collar-bone 'of the <hi
                    rend="italic">echidna</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ornithorhyncus</hi> is very
                    singular. It consists of a broad central bone, surmounted by two transverse
                    branches spreading out on each side, so as to give the whole bone some
                    resemblance to the letter T, but sinuated so as to make the diverging branches
                    like the Greek υ. In young animals this bone consists of three portions. The two
                    diverging branches are genuine collarbones, and may be regarded as a bifurcated
                    bone; while the middle is supported on the sternum, and has articulated to each
                    side a part of the <hi rend="italic">scapula,</hi> corresponding to the coracoid
                    process. The collar-bone, indeed, is a power? ful buttress, which prevents the
                    arm-bone from being thrust too much forward.</p>
                <p>Of the shoulder-blade or <hi rend="italic">scapula,</hi> which is present in all
                    red-blooded animals with thoracic extremities, and hence in all the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> the principal point is to remark the varieties
                    which its shape presents. Though in man, most of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Quadrumana,</hi> the <hi rend="smallcaps">Chiroptera,</hi> and the elephant,
                    the vertebral margin or base of several authors on human anatomy is the longest,
                    it becomes the shortest in most quadrupeds, especially those which, like the
                    Ruminants and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,</hi> have long legs and
                    narrow chest. In most of them, also, this margin, instead of being straight, is
                    rounded,as in theCARNivoRAandllθDENriA. In theCAR- <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >nivora</hi> without collar-bone, the hedgehog and <hi rend="italic"
                    >dideiphis,</hi> the acromion is less prominent; there is another eminence
                    directed backwards, almost perpendicular to the spine. The coracoid process,
                    also, which is present in the Cm-ROPTEiiA, the hedgehog, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >dideiphisgenus,</hi> is wanting in most of the zoophagous tribe. In the hare
                    the acromion terminates in a long slender process, rising at right angles and
                    bending backwards, which may be named the <hi rend="italic">recurrent.</hi> In
                    the Ruminantsand <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,</hi> notonly are this and the
                    acromion, but even the coracoid, wanting. The <hi rend="italic">scapula,</hi>
                    again, of the hog and rhinoceros is remarkable for the disappearance of the
                    spine at the glenoid angle; while from its middle proceeds a prominent process
                    towards the costal or inferior margin. In the mole the scapula is long and
                    narrow, like a cylindrical bone, placed parallel to the spine,—an arrangement
                    which, together with the shortness and thickness of the clavicle, already
                    mentioned, is evidently connected with the burrowing habits of this animal.
                    Lastly, in the <hi rend="italic">echidna</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >ornithorhyncus,</hi> which in so many characters of organization approach the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Amphibia</hi> on the one side, and the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Birds</hi> on the other, the scapula is a single sinuous bone, attached by one
                    extremity to the sternum and middle part of the clavicular bone, with the other
                    loose; and in the middle an articular cavity, in which the head of the humerus
                    is plaçed, and which evidently corresponds to the glenoid. In this instance,
                    therefore, the clavicle and <hi rend="italic">scapula</hi> may be regarded as
                    united into a single bone.</p>
                <p> The <hi rend="italic">humerus,</hi> which exists in all the animals with
                    thoracic extremities, undergoes considerable variations. In the lower animals
                    generally it is much shorter than in man; and .it is invariably shorter in
                    proportion as <hi rend="italic">the, metacarpus</hi> is elongated. Thus, in
                    animals with what is named a <hi rend="italic">cannon</hi> bone, that is, one
                    metacarpal, as in the horse and the ruminants, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >humerus</hi> is so short that it is concealed in the soft parts as far as the
                    cubit. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> it may be said to attain its
                    maximum of brevity. In the bat and sloth it is long in proportion to the rest of
                    the body.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">humerus</hi> of the mole is perhaps the most extraordinary
                    of all those of the mammiferous animals. Not only is it articulated with the <hi
                    rend="italic">scapula</hi> by a small head, but it is connected with a facette
                    of the clavicle by another belonging to the great tuberosity, and between which
                    and the head is a deep pit. Tile crest of the small tuberosity is so large, that
                    it represents a square placed vertically, so that the <hi rend="italic">ĩinea
                    aspena,</hi> is above. The rest of the body of the bone, which is very short, is
                    arched above, so that the cubital extremity is directed upwards. From this
                    arrangement it results that the cubit is elevated above the shoulder while the
                    palm is turned downwards,—a disposition necessary for the burrowing habits of
                    the animal.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">simiae</hi> the <hi rend="italic">radius</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ulna</hi> are arranged as in man, except that in the <hi
                    rend="italic">cynocephalus,</hi> mandrill, magot, and guenon, the coronoid
                    process of the <hi rend="italic">ulna</hi> is narrower, and the radial facette
                    deeper. In the other <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ulna</hi> very generally disappears or becomes rudimentary only. In the bat
                    family and the colugo <hi rend="italic">{galeopithecus)</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">ulna</hi> is wanting or is represented by a slender style placed
                    below the radius. These animals are therefore destitute of the power of
                    pronation and supination. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">radius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ulna,</hi> though separate, are
                    void of rotatory motion; and the <hi rend="italic">olecranon</hi> is compressed,
                    and continued farther back than in man. In the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Paciiy-dermata</hi> the <hi rend="italic">radius</hi> is before and the <hi
                    rend="italic">ulna</hi> behind, and, though distinct, there is no rotation. In
                    several of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> for instance the marmot,
                    porcupine, &amp;c. the coronoid process is small, and in others, <hi
                    rend="italic">e. g.</hi> the cavy, hare, and mouse family, it is altogether
                    effaced. In the Ruminants the <hi rend="italic">ulna</hi> is united immovably to
                    the radius; and in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula</hi> it is represented
                    by an <hi rend="italic">olecranon</hi> adhering to the posterior surface of that
                    bone. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> though both bones are present,
                    they are much flattened.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">carpus</hi> of the ape <hi rend="italic">genus</hi>
                    contains one bone more than that of man, situate between the pyramidal and large
                    bone, and which seems to result from the trapezium being divided into two parts.
                    Conversely, in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga,</hi> but especially in the
                    dog, cat, hedgehog, shrew, bear, and seal, the scaphoid and semilunar are united
                    into one large bone. Those which have a vestige of thumb, as the hyena and
                    glutton, have the trapezium very small. The mole has not only 9 carpal bones, as
                    the ape, but a large sickje-shaped bone, which is attached to the radial margin
                    of the fore paw, and which gives it the shape proper to the habits of the
                    animal. The toes are further very short. Of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Rodentia,</hi> the hare resembles the ape; but in the beaver, marmot, squirrel,
                    and cat, the scaphoid and semilunar make one bone; while in the porcupine the
                    supernumerary bone is between the pisiform and metacarpal of the fifth toe. In
                    the two-toed ant-eater there are only 6 carpal bones, 4 in the first row and two
                    in the second; in the three-toed sloth there are only 5, 3 in the first row and
                    2 in the second; the pangolin has 7; the cachecame 8 and a rudimental small toe;
                    the elephant 8, 7 wedge-shaped and one elongated, corresponding to the pisiform;
                    and the other <hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata</hi> 8. In the rhinoceros, which
                    has only 3 toes, the trapezium only is wanting; but there is a supernumerary
                    bone on the margin of the scaphoid, and on that of the unciform, as in the
                    porcupine. The first range consists, in the Ruminants and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Solidungula,</hi> of 4 bones; in the former, excepting the camel, the second
                    consists of 2, and the latter of 3. Those of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cetacea,</hi> which are much flattened, are 3 in the first row and 2 in the
                    second.</p>
                <p>Ιhe <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> generally have as many metacarpal bones as
                    toes, that is, never fewer than 3 or more than 5, with the exception of the
                    Ruminants, in which these bones are in early life consolidated into one named
                    the <hi rend="italic">cannon</hi> bone. In animals which walk on the tips of the
                    toes, or which use them as organs of prehension, the metacarpal bones are
                    lengthened·to nearly double; and hence in all hese animals the <hi rend="italic"
                    >metacarpus</hi> is erroneously named the. tore leg, and therefore it has been
                    imagined, that in several <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095678"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5678-0009"/>of our domestic animals the different parts of the
                    lower extremity are articulated in opposite directions to those of; man. Thus
                    the fore leg of the horse, deer, sheep, and dog are in truth the <hi
                    rend="italic">metacarpus</hi> of these animals; and what is vulgarly named the
                    fore knee or <hi rend="italic">cannon</hi> bone of the horse, is actually the
                    <hi rend="italic">carpus</hi> or wrist-joint. It is therefore convex on the
                    dorsal, and concave and inflected on the palmar aspect, exactly as the <hi
                    rend="italic">carpus of</hi> the human subject.</p>
                <p>In the three-toed sloth, the three bones of which the metacarpus consists are
                    mutually consolidated at the base and with the rudiment of a fourth toe. In the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> the metacarpal bones, which are much
                    flattened, are also mutually united.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> generally, if we include imperfect or
                    rudimental phalanges concealed in the skin, there are never fewer than 3, nor
                    more than 5. The Unguiculated animals generally have 5, perfect and imperfect·
                    The character of the perfect fore toe or finger is to consist of 3 rows or
                    phalanges, excepting the first of the radial side, which has only 2. In the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana</hi> this is separate, and opposable to the other
                    toes, constituting a thumb, and giving this tribe of animals a prehensible organ
                    entitled to the epithet of hand. It is, however, shorter and less perfect in
                    other respects than the genuine thumb of the human hand. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">coăìta</hi><hi rend="italic">(simia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >paniscus)</hi> it is converted into a rudimental bone, concealed under the
                    skin.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga,</hi> which have no power of grasping minute
                    objects, the thumb or first toe is parallel to the others, and, though equal in
                    length to these in the ursine family, it is shorter in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mustela, viverra,</hi> canine and feline <hi rend="italic">genera.</hi> In the
                    latter, which have the power of erecting the claws, to prevent them from being
                    blunted in walking, the shape of the middle and unguinal phalanx is remarkable.
                    The former is triangular prismatic, with two lateral and a plantar or palmar
                    inferior surface. The third or unguinal phalanx is shaped like a hook,
                    consisting of two parts. One, directed forwards, sharp and pointed, receives the
                    nail or claw, in a long groove like a sheath. The second part of the hook, which
                    is behind, rises vertically from the lower part by which it is articulated, and
                    is produced into two processes, to which are attached the erecting muscles of
                    the claw, which are flexors of the phalanx.</p>
                <p>Among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> there is a perfect but short thumb
                    in the hare, beaver, and jerbois; a two-phalanx but concealed one in the
                    squirrel, mouse, and rat family, porcupine, paca, agouti; and a one-phalanx
                    concealed one in the cavy, guinea-pig, marmot, &amp;c. In the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Edentata</hi> the number of fore toes varies much; in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tamanoir,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tamandua</hi> or four-toed
                    ant-eater, the thumb· toe is obliterated; in the <hi rend="italic">Ai</hi> or
                    three-toed sloth, both that and the fifth toe are obliterated; and in the
                    two-toed ant-eater, and <hi rend="italic">Uhau</hi> or two-toed sloth, these,
                    with the second toe also, are obliterated.</p>
                <p>The elephant has 5 perfect toes, all concealed under the thick, callous hide of
                    the foot. In hoofed animals with 4 toes, for instance the hog, tapir, and
                    hippopotamus, the thumb-toe is in the shape of a śmall rudimental bone.</p>
                <p>In the Ruminants the single metacarpal bone (Chesel-den’s figure of the Deer,
                    Plate I.) is articulated with two digital phalanges, which constitute one of the
                    distinguishing characters of this order—the cloven foot. In some genera, at the
                    root of these two perfect toes are two small bones, often covered with horn,
                    which represent two other toes. The last or unguinal phalanx is always
                    trilateral in shape. In the horse and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula</hi>
                    generally, the two lateral toes are represented only by two bony styles, named
                    the splint bones, situate on the two sides of the metacarpal or <hi
                    rend="italic">cannon</hi> bone. The three phalanges of the single toe which
                    constitutes the foot are distinguished as the <hi rend="italic">pastern
                    bone,</hi> which is the first phalanx; the <hi rend="italic">coronet,</hi> which
                    is the middle or second; and the <hi rend="italic">coffin</hi> bone, which is
                    the third or unguinal phalanx, which has the shape of the hoof, rounded before,
                    convex above, and flat below. To the back of the pastern joint are connected two
                    sesamoid bones; and to the coffin bone is attached another, named the shuttle
                    bone. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> all the phalanges, which are
                    flattened, and often cartilaginous, are united in the fin or paddle.</p>
                <p>The thigh-bone, which is single in all the classes, follows the type of that of
                    the human frame in general figure and parts. In the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia</hi> it is, however, proportionally shorter, and its length diminishes
                    as that of the <hi rend="italic">metatarsus</hi> augments. In the Ruminants and
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,</hi> for instance, it is so short that it is
                    concealed by muscles against the belly; and hence it is too often overlooked and
                    confounded with the leg. In other respects the general characters are, that it
                    is not arched; that, excepting in the bear and some of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >simia</hi> genus, e. <hi rend="italic">g.</hi> the ourang-outang, it is shorter
                    than the leg-bones; that its neck is very short, and more perpendicular to the
                    <hi rend="italic">axis</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">diaphysis</hi> than in man;
                    and that the great trochanter is raised above the head, which is directed
                    inwards. In the <hi rend="italic">simiae</hi> it is quite cylindrical, and void
                    of <hi rend="italic">linea, aspera.</hi> In the tapir the middle part is found
                    flattened; and at the external margin there is a prominent crest, terminating in
                    an unciform process. In the rhinoceros the great trochanter and the unciform
                    process are so elongated as to unite almost, and form a hole between them and
                    the <hi rend="italic">diaphysis.</hi> The unciform process is observed also in
                    the horse, beaver, and armadillo. The thigh-bone of the seal is so short, that
                    the half of its length consists of the two articular extremities.</p>
                <p>Though the leg-bones of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> bear a general
                    similitude to those of man, the <hi rend="italic">tibia</hi> alone is constant;
                    and the <hi rend="italic">fibula,</hi> after becoming unusually slender, and
                    changing its position from the outside to the posterior part of the tibia, is
                    converted into a mere appendage, and at length disappears entirely. Thus, though
                    it is distinct, and occupies its usual position in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >simiae,</hi> in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Chirop-tera</hi> it is extremely
                    slender; and since the <hi rend="italic">femora</hi> are directed backward, the
                    <hi rend="italic">fibulae</hi> are turned towards each other. In several of the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi> for instance the pha-tagin, armadillo, and
                    sloth, it is large, curved, and remote from the <hi rend="italic">tibia.</hi> In
                    the dog family and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> it is altogether
                    behind the <hi rend="italic">tibia.</hi> In the mole and murine <hi
                    rend="italic">genus</hi> it is consolidated to the lower third of the <hi
                    rend="italic">tibia,</hi> leaving an empty trilateral space above. In the
                    rhinoceros, elephant, and hog, the <hi rend="italic">fibula</hi> is flattened
                    and united to the whole length of the <hi rend="italic">tibia.</hi> In the
                    ruminants it is represented by a small bony appendage, placed on the outer
                    margin of the <hi rend="italic">astragalus,</hi> below the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tibia,</hi> and forming the external or fibular ankle. Lastly, in the horse and
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">fibula</hi> is
                    reduced to a styloid rudimental pro-, cess, which is firmly consolidated in the
                    adult animal to the upper part of the <hi rend="italic">tibia.</hi></p>
                <p>Between the <hi rend="italic">tarsus of</hi> man and that of the other <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> the following are the principal differences.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">simiae</hi> the fibular facette of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >astragalus</hi> is nearly vertical, and the tibial is very oblique; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">calcaneum</hi> wants the tuberosity, except in the pongo. In the
                    ordinary bat family the calcaneum is elongated into a styloid process, concealed
                    in the substance of the membranous ubiform expansions; but in the roussette <hi
                    rend="italic">(pteropus)</hi> the tuberosity projects beneath the foot.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> the calcaneum is produced considerably
                    backwards, while the scaphoid, which consists of two parts, forms a tubercle on
                    the sole. Among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Edentata</hi> the three-toed sloth is
                    peculiar in having a tarsus, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095691"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5691-0010"/>consisting of four bones only, the <hi
                    rend="italic">astragalus,</hi><hi rend="italic">calcaneum,</hi> and two
                    cuneiform bones, the first of which is articulated not only with the <hi
                    rend="italic">tibia, fibula,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">calcaneum,</hi> but with
                    the 'large cuneiform bone, without any intermediate scaphoid bone. Its
                    connection with the <hi rend="italic">tibia</hi> is by means of a convex
                    articular surface, which rolls on the external part of the tarsal end of the <hi
                    rend="italic">tibia.</hi> From this mode of articula <hi rend="subscript">
                    φ</hi>- tion it results that the foot of the sloth admits neither of being
                    elevated nor depressed, but simply of performing lateral motions of adduction
                    and abduction, to which it owes the power of clasping the trunks of trees and
                    climbing, but which renders progression difficult and laborious.</p>
                <p>¾ιe hog has a scaphoid with three ordinary cuneiform bones, and a rudimental
                    great-toe bone beneath the first. In the tapir and rhinoceros there are only two
                    cuneiform bones. All the animals already enumerated have the same number of
                    metatarsal bones as of toes. .</p>
                <p>In the Ruminants the cuboid and scaphoid bones are united, unless in the camel,
                    in which they are distinct. At the outer margin of the pulley of the astragalus
                    is a bone which represents the lower head of the <hi rend="italic">fibula,</hi>
                    and which is farther articulated to the upper surface of the os calcis. In this
                    side also there are only two cuneiform bones, which are united in the giraffe.
                    The two metatarsal bones are always united, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >metacarpus,</hi> into one, which forms a posterior cannon bone. The <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Solidungula</hi> resemble the camel in this, that the scaphoid
                    is distinct from the cuboid bone, and that there are two cuneiform bones, while
                    the peroneal rudiment and the corresponding articular surface of the calcaneum
                    are wanting. The metacarpal arc also consolidated into a single piece, named the
                    hinder <hi rend="italic">cannon bone,</hi> each side of which is provided with a
                    minute bony style.</p>
                <p>The toes of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana</hi> and the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Marsupialia</hi> are longer than those of man; but the great toe is shorter
                    than .the others, and its metatarsal bone is susceptible of separation and
                    opposition, as the thumb or thumb-toe of the hand. Hence Cuvier, in his first
                    classification, distinguished the latter by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pedimana.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Aie-are</hi> among the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> appears to possess the same faculty. Among the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoopiiaga</hi> the great toe remains always conjoined with
                    and parallel to the others; and in the canine and feline genera it is
                    obliterated. Among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> that of the beaver is
                    nearly equal to the other toes; those of the marmot, porcupine, and the murine
                    genus, are shorter; in the paca it is almost obliterated; it is reduced to a
                    single bone in the Cape gerboa; and the leporine genus have no trace of it. In
                    the cavy, agouti, and guinea-pig, the great and small toes are each reduced to
                    one bone. In the gerboa <hi rend="italic">(mus jaculus)</hi> and alactaga <hi
                    rend="italic">(mus</hi><hi rend="italic">sagitta)</hi> the three middle
                    metatarsal bones are united into a single one similar to the cannon bone of the
                    Ruminants and <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula</hi>; and while the two lateral
                    toes are distinct, though short, in the former animal, they are obliterated
                    altogether in the latter.</p>
                <p>Among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi> the ant-eater, <hi rend="italic"
                    >orycteropus,</hi> pangolin, and armadillo, have five toes, of which the great
                    is the shortest in all. In the sloth the great and small toe are reduced to one
                    small bone. The other metatarsal bones are united at their base. The toes have
                    only two phalanges, of which the unguinal are the largest.</p>
                <p>In the subsequent, families the metatarsal bones deserve particular attention, In
                    the elephant and <hi rend="smallcaps">Pach yder-mata,</hi> their tarsal
                    extremity has a flat surface, and the phalangeal consists of a convex tubercle,
                    which presents below a prominent line in the middle of the bone. In the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Solidun</hi><hi rend="superscript
                    smallcaps"> t</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">gula</hi> this line is above and below
                    both. In the Ruminants, in which the cannon bone consists of the two metatarsal
                    bones, the line of union is represented by a deep line like the tract of a saw.
                    The elephant has 5 perfect toes; the hog 4; the tapir and rhinoceros 3; the
                    Ruminants have two perfect toes on one metatarsal bone, and two small ones
                    attached behind its .base, lhe ðo- <hi rend="smallcaps">lidungula</hi> have one
                    perfect toe, and two imperfect, which are reduced to a single styloid bone. In
                    these animals the body is supported in walking by the last or unguinal phalanx
                    alone; and hence the term <hi rend="italic">foot</hi> is not of the same import
                    as in the human subject and animals similarly constructed. While indeed man
                    supports his person in progression on the <hi rend="italic">os</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">calcis</hi> and the poster ior. or metatarsal phalanges, in the
                    other mammiferous animals the former bone touches not the ground, but is always
                    elevated above it a considerable height. All the .zoophagous or unguiculated
                    animals, excepting the plantigrade, support themselves chiefly on the unguinal
                    and middle phalanges both of the fore and hind foot; and neither the posterior
                    <hi rend="italic">phalanges</hi> nor the <hi rend="italic">calcaneum</hi> touch
                    the ground, as is easily demonstrated on observing the gait of the hedgehog,
                    dog, fox, cat, or similar individuals of the same family. The animals
                    distinguished by the name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Plantigrade</hi> are believed
                    to support themselves on the entire foot. But though the foot is certainly
                    spread on the ground more freely than in those already mentioned, by the bear,
                    glutton, badger, and others, it appears that not the heel, but the <hi
                    rend="italic">metatarsus,</hi> is allowed to touch the ground in progression. In
                    the Ruminants and <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,</hi> as already mentioned,
                    the only part of the foot which is applied to the ground is the unguinal
                    phalanx; and it is well known that the horse supports himself on the plantar
                    surface of the coffin bone only.</p>
                <p>Lastly, in the Amphibious Mammals, while the extreme brevity of the <hi
                    rend="italic">humerus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">femur</hi> unfit them for
                    progression on land without extreme awkwardness and difficulty, the expanded
                    shape and oblique position of the metacarpal bones and phalanges, the length of
                    the <hi rend="italic">tibia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fibula,</hi> and the
                    greater length of the first and last than the middle metatarsal phalanges, all
                    concur to give these animals great facility in swimming. (Cuvier, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ossemens</hi><hi rend="italic">Fossiles,</hi> tome V. partie i.
                    septième partie.) In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> again, while the
                    total want of pelvic extremities renders motion on land quite impracticable, the
                    fin-like disposition of the metacarpus and metacarpal phalanges, with the great
                    strength of the lumbar, and the length of the coccygeal vertebrae, peculiarly
                    qualify them for locomotion in the waters.</p>

                <p>The number of vertebrae of which the different regions of the spine consist, is

                <p>In this table the most remarkable circumstance is the great number of ćervical
                    vertebrae, which are much more numerous than in the Mammalia. They vary from 9,
                    the number in the sparrow, to 23, which is that of the cervical vertebrae of the
                    swan. The most common number is 11, which is that of 10 <hi rend="italic"
                    >genera.</hi> The next most frequent is 12, 13, and 14, which are equally the
                    numbers of 9 <hi rend="italic">genera.</hi> The next is 15, which is that of 8;
                    10 occurs in 6, 18 in 4, and 16 in 3. In the stork and crane they are 19.</p>
                <p>The next remarkable circumstance is, that the dorsal or costal vertebrae are
                    greatly fewer than in the Mammalia, never exceeding the number of ll,.and being
                    more frequently about 7 or 8. Thus, while they arc 11 in the cassowary, swan,
                    and sheldrake, 10 in the goose, bernacle, and grebe, and 9 in the sparrow, lark,
                    humming-bird, parrot, crane, avoset, oyster-catcher, cormorant, and blackdiver,
                    they are 7 or 8 in all the other <hi rend="italic">genera,</hi> and only 6 in
                    the bullfinch.</p>
                <p>’ There are no lumbar vertebrae strictly so named, for those which extend from
                    the chest to the' tail are· consolidated into one piece with the iliac'bones.
                    The tail, which iŝ short, consists of from 7 to 9 vertebrae.</p>
                <p>j The part most variable in proportional length is the neck. It is .so much
                    .longer as-the feet arcelevated, except in some of the swimmers, in which it is
                    greatly longer, because they require to seek their food below the surface of the
                    waters on which they float.</p>
                <p>The bodies of the cervical vertebrae are articulated not by plane facettes, which
                    would admit obscure motion only, but by portions of cylinders, which allow
                    extensive motion. The 3d, 4th, or 5th superior vertebrae allow of anterior
                    inflection only, and the others of posterior inflection. This gives the necks of
                    birds an alternate serpentine in-flectiön; and it is by rendering the two
                    arches, of which this curvature consists, straight or convex, that the animal
                    elongates or shortens his neck. The articular processes of the superior
                    vertebrae are directed upwards and downwards; those of the lower are turned
                    anteriorly and posteriorly.</p>
                <p>Instead of transverse processes, the cervical vertebrae of birds are provided
                    with a tubercle above, and the anterior extremity of which terminates in a
                    narrow style, descending parallel to the body of the vertebra.</p>
                <p>Only the most superior and inferior vertebrae have distinct spinous processes,
                    and these have anterior as well as posterior ones. The middle ones have before
                    two crests, which form a half-canal, and.behind a tubercle, often biful, or,
                    when they are elongated, two rough lines. The atlas, which is articulated with
                    the occipital bone by a single facette, has the shape of a minute ring.</p>
                <p>As the neck of birds is movable, the back is fixed. The spinous processes of
                    these vertebrae are in mutual contact, and they are connected by strong
                    ligaments. Most of these processes are generally consolidated into a single
                    continuous crest, extending along the whole back. The extremities of the
                    transverse processes terminate in two <hi rend="italic">apices,</hi> one
                    directed forwards, the other backwards; and occasionally they are consolidated
                    into a continuous mass like the spinous. That this arrangement is requisite for
                    the trunk to remain fixed during the violent motions which take place in flying,
                    is rendered probable by the fact, that in birds which do not fly, as the ostrich
                    and cassowary, the spinal column retains its mobility.</p>
                <p>The last dorsal vertebrae are often placed on the crest of the iliac bones, and
                    they are then united, as the lumbar, on the large piece of the iliac bones, from
                    which it results that the number of vertebrae can often be estimated in no other
                    mode than by that of the holes of the nerves which issue from the chord.</p>
                <p>The caudal vertebrae are most numerous in the species which move the tail with
                    most energy; for instance, the magpie and swallow. They have spinous processes
                    below as well as above, and very long transverse processes. The last of all, to
                    which the pinions are attached, is longest, and has the shape of a ploughshare
                    or a compressed quoit. In the cassowary, which has no visible tai), the last
                    bone is conical; in the peacock, on the contrary it has the shape of an oval
                    plate, situate horizontally.</p>
                <p>It was early observed by the original zoologist and traveller Pierre Belon, that
                    the <hi rend="italic">crania</hi> of birds were void of sutures; and that in a
                    few only were these lines of distinction into separate bones recognised. The
                    explanation of this peculiarity is found in the history of the ossification of
                    the head in young birds, which shows that the cranium consists at that period of
                    separate bones, corresponding in number and situation to those of quadrupeds.
                    Thus, there are two frontal bones, which are continued forwards to form the
                    vault of the orbits; two small parietal bones behind the frontal; a temporal
                    bone on each side of the ścull; a sphenoid united to the occipital, even in
                    subjects in which the other sütures are distinct; or a sphello-occipital bone,
                    which is early united with the temporal.' ,</p>
                <p>These sutures, however, are distinctly seen only in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193095717" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5717-0012"/>young birds and those
                    recently hatched; for the bones are very early united, and in the adult bird the
                    cranial sutures are invariably obliterated. Thus, in the domestic fowl and
                    turkey the scull is one piece; and the only trace of suture that remains is a
                    linear depression in the middle of the frontal bone, indicating the original
                    formation in two halves. In the recently hatched bird, also, the sphenoid is
                    separated from the occipital bone by a transverse suture, extending from the one
                    ear to the other. The occipital bone is at the same time a ring, consisting of
                    four parts; a superior, two lateral, and an inferior which is small. The
                    sphenoid, which forms the greater part of the base of the cranium, is nearly
                    trilateral, with a small anterior process, to which the palatine arches are
                    articulated. It has no pterygoid processes, and does not touch the posterior
                    aperture of the nostrils. The temporal bone, though void of zygomatic process,
                    has a pointed style, which contributes to form the posterior margin of the
                    orbit. The frontal bone, after covering part of the cranium, is continued
                    forwards in a broad, thin plate, which forms the vault of the orbits, while
                    these cavities are separated by a thin vertical bony plate which descends at
                    right angles from the frontal bone, and is connected behind with the sphenoid.
                    The long eminences observed on the heads of the cassowary, curlew, pintado, and
                    some species of hocco, are produced from this supraorbital part of the frontal
                    bone; and their interior, which consists of loose <hi rend="italic">diploe,</hi>
                    communicates with that of the same bone.</p>
                <p>The face in birds is rarely so firmly consolidated as the cranium. It is composed
                    of two lacrymal bones, forming the anterior margins of the orbits, and united on
                    the mesial plane; two nasal bones anterior to the lacrymal; two bones
                    corresponding to the superior maxillary, and forming the external lateral parts
                    of the upper half of the bill; two inter-maxillary bones; two anterior palate
                    bones, corresponding to those of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi>; two
                    posterior palate. bones corresponding to the pterygoid processes of the
                    sphenoid; and the lower jaw a paraboloid bone, consisting of twortroi united
                    before, where they are covered by the horn of the lower half of the bill.
                    Besides these, there is in the whole class an irregular-shaped bone, common to
                    the Cranium and lower jaw, and connecting these two together. This bone, which
                    has been rather improperly named the square, quadrangular, or quadrilateral bone
                    <hi rend="italic">(os</hi><hi rend="italic">quadratum),</hi> consists of a body
                    with curvilinear hollow margins, terminating in two elevated and rather pointed
                    processes, one of which is connected with the cavity named <hi rend="italic"
                    >tympanum,</hi> while the other, projecting into the orbit, affords attachment
                    to several muscles. The anomalous character of this bone has perplexed several
                    of the most distinguished zootomists; and while Geoffroy gives it the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">os Tympano-styloideum,</hi> Spix considers it analogous to the
                    annular process of the temporal bone, which in the human foetus is separate; and
                    Carus regards it as representing the <hi rend="italic">incus,</hi> to which it
                    bears a remote resemblance in shape and in one of its connections.</p>
                <p>Both <hi rend="italic">maxillae</hi> are void of teeth; but the hard, horny
                    matter of the bill covering the margins and extremities of each jaw, and
                    constituting the mandibles <hi rend="italic">(mandibula),</hi> is manifestly
                    constructed to perform for <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> what teeth do for the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia.</hi> But the most remarkable peculiarity of the,
                    facial bones of this class is, that the upper jaw admits of more or less motion.
                    In the majority of instances this is effected by the jaw being united to the
                    cranium by means of thin, flexible, elastic, bony plates; but in the parrot
                    family the upper jaw is entirely distinct, and is connected by a proper
                    articulation.</p>
                <p>The base of the palatine surface of the upper jaw is divided into 4 branches,
                    which diverge backwards. The two external ones, which correspond to the
                    zygomatic arches of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> and which are very
                    slender, are articulated to the quadrangular bone which moves on the temporal
                    before the ear. The two intermediate ones, which have been already stated to
                    correspond to the pterygoid processes, and which are parallel, are placed
                    beneath the septum of the orbits, and are articulated by their posterior
                    extremities with a small bone, variable in shape, but named <hi rend="italic"
                    >omoid</hi> by Hérissant, which is also articulated with the quadrilateral. From
                    this arrangement results a singular species of broken lever, not dissimilar to
                    the parallel joint of the piston and lever of the steam-engine, and the effect
                    of which is, that whenever the lower jaw is depressed by its proper muscles, it
                    necessarily causes the quadrilateral bone to perform a slight rotatory motion,
                    in consequence of which, by means of the omoid bone, the upper jaw is at the
                    same time elevated on the elastic plates; and as soon as the lower jaw is
                    raised, the elasticity of these plates forces down the superior one.</p>
                <p>The upper jaw is immovable in a few instances only, and of these the <hi
                    rend="italic">calao</hi> or rhinoceros bird is one.</p>
                <p>The breast bone <hi rend="italic">(sternum)</hi> is a trilateral, boat-shaped
                    bone, concave internally, convex with a middle longitudinal crest externally,
                    with the base of the triangle above, and the apex, which is also incurvated
                    backwards, below. The middle longitudinal crest, which is occasionally named the
                    keel <hi rend="italic">(carina),</hi> is shaped something like a spherical
                    triangle, with the broadest side above, the base before, and the apex behind;
                    and its prominence forms large spaces on each side for the attachment of the
                    pectoral and other muscles used in flight. In the male wild swan <hi
                    rend="italic">(anas cygnus),</hi> in some sjpecies of curlew, in the crane, and
                    in the guinea-fowl, this crest forms a cavity for the reception of the windpipe.
                    In the ostrich and cassowary, which do not fly, the sternum is void of crest,
                    and is merely arched strongly.</p>
                <p>The ribs, which rarely exceed 10 pairs, may be distinguished into
                    sterno-vertebral and vertebral. Though the latter are generally before, they are
                    sometimes also behind. The vertebral end terminates in two diverging processes,
                    one of which is articulated with the vertebral body, the other with the
                    transverse process. The sternal extremity consists of a bony process, which
                    performs the part of the sterno-costal cartilages of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia</hi> by uniting the rib to the sternum. The ribs of birds, however,
                    are further distinguished by presenting near their middle a flat long process,
                    projecting from the rib backwards at an acute angle, and resting on the rib
                    immediately below, so that each rib is supported not only on the vertebrae and
                    sternum, or the vertebrae alone, but on the next rib below. These processes are
                    obliterated in the lower ribs.</p>
                <p>The coxal bones constitute one piece with the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae. The
                    ischial portion is united with the sacrum, and the ischiatic notch is converted
                    into a hole. The part which corresponds to the <hi rend="italic">os pubis</hi>
                    of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> is not consolidated before so as to
                    form a symphysis, but proceeding directly backwards, terminates in a styloid
                    process, variable in length and slenderness. The only exception to this mode of
                    structure occurs in the ostrich, in which the pubal bones are united below. The
                    infra-pubal or oval hole is present in the whole class notwithstanding. It is
                    worthy of remark, however, that in young birds this and the ischial aperture are
                    still notches, in consequence of the deficient ossification of the parts.</p>
                <p>The direction of the <hi rend="italic">pelvis</hi> in birds is nearly that of the
                    spine, that is, obliquely backwards, and deviating but little from the

                <p>The wings or thoracic extremities are connected to the trunk by three bones, the
                    collar-bone or clavicle, the <hi rend="italic">scapula,</hi> and the bifurcated
                    bone. The collar-bones, which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095730"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5730-0013"/>are straight, strong, and cylindrical, are
                    articulated by a large head with the anterior and lateral part of the sternum,
                    in which its motion is rather limited. It forms before and laterally two short
                    processes, one anterior-inferior and internal, articulated with the bifurcated
                    bone; the other posterior-superior and external, uniting with the scapula, and
                    forming a cavity, in which the head of the <hi rend="italic">humerus</hi> is
                    lodged. ’</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">scapula</hi> is a long bone, flattened, but narrow, and
                    slightly incurvated, with the convex side turned towards the spine, to which it
                    is nearly parallel in position. The head or anterior extremity is thick and
                    extensive, oblique from before backwards, and is articulated behind with the
                    clavicle, before with the <hi rend="italic">humerus.</hi> The free extremity is
                    thin, flattened, and sharp. The whole bone is not dissimilar in shape to a
                    scimitar.</p>
                <p>Besides these, which <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> possess in common with the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> we find an azygous bone, situate on the
                    mesial plane, denominated in ordinary language the <hi rend="italic">Merry
                    thought,</hi> and, from its shape, the fork-like or bifurcated bone. It consists
                    of two long, rounded, converging branches, united at an acute angle, and forming
                    a broad process, flat in the vertical direction, and by which it is articulated
                    to the anterior extremity of the crest or carinated part of the breast-bone. To
                    the posterior or free extremities of the divergent branches are articulated the
                    humeral ends of the collar-bones, which are thus enabled to sustain the violent
                    motions of the humerus during flight. The branches of the bifurcated bone are
                    separate in the ostrich, and each is united with the clavicle and <hi
                    rend="italic">scapula of</hi> the same side, so that the three bones form only
                    one, much flattened, and with a hole towards the sternal extremity. In the
                    cassowary the bifurcated bone is reduced to a mere rudimental process at the
                    inner margin of the head of the clavicle. From these facts it results, that the
                    bifurcated bone is particularly useful in the energetic and continued efforts of
                    the wings in flight, and not only serves to keep the clavicles apart, but, by
                    lengthening the distance between the collar-bones and sternum, enables the
                    animal to use a longer lever. It is freest, strongest, and most elastic in the
                    birds which fly best. In birds which do not fly, and which use the wings merely
                    to sustain the equilibrium, as the ostrich and cassowary, it is reduced to
                    almost nothing, or it is in such a rudimental and imperfect form, that it cannot
                    keep the collar-bones apart.</p>
                <p>The bones of the thoracic extremities, or those of the wings, correspond in
                    general to those of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia.</hi> They consist of a
                    single cylindrical humerus, articulated with the <hi rend="italic">scapula</hi>
                    and collar-bone above, two bones of the fore wing corresponding to the <hi
                    rend="italic">ulna</hi> and <hi rend="italic">radius,</hi> two bones of the <hi
                    rend="italic">carpus,</hi> two of the <hi rend="italic">metacarpus,</hi>
                    consolidated by their extremities, one styloid bone as a thumb, a long finger
                    consisting of two <hi rend="italic">phalanges,</hi> and a short one consisting
                    of one. The thumb supports the bastard pinions, the large finger and <hi
                    rend="italic">metacarpus</hi> the primaries, while the small one, which is
                    covered by the skin, is destitute. In several of the webfooted divers, for
                    instance the duck and penguin <hi rend="italic">(alca im-pennis</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">spheniscus),</hi> these bones are flattened like thin plates.</p>
                <p>In the pelvic extremities the thigh-bone is provided with one trochanter only, is
                    shorter than that of the leg, and is almost invariably straight; and is arched
                    only in the cormorant, duck, and dobchick. In the ostrich its diameter is about
                    four times that of the <hi rend="italic">humerus.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >tibia</hi> differs from that of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> chiefly
                    at its lower extremity. While the <hi rend="italic">fibula</hi> adheres to it
                    like a slender appendage as far as the middle, the tarsal extremity terminates
                    in two trochlear condyles, with an intermediate pulley-like groove. The <hi
                    rend="italic">tarsus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">metatarsus</hi> are represented
                    by a single bone of considerable length, and the head or tibial end of which
                    consists of a middle prominence and two lateral depressions, and which,
                    therefore, <hi rend="subscript"> χ</hi> moves in cardinal opposition, but does
                    not admit of extension beyond the straight line. Though variable in proportion
                    to the length in different orders, this bone is very long in the order <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Grallae</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(Grallatores).</hi> It
                    terminates below in 3 pulley-shaped processes, to which are attached the bones
                    of the 3 anterior toes, with an internal margin for that of the great toe. In
                    the ostrich there are 2 processes only, corresponding to the two toes. In the
                    penguin tribe, however, the <hi rend="italic">tarsus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >metatarsus</hi> consist of 3 bones, separate from each other in the middle, but
                    united at the tibial and digital extremities. To the tarso-metatarsal bone of
                    the cock, and others of the Gallinaceous tribe, is attached the spur, a conical
                    pointed excrescence of hard horny matter.</p>
                <p>SECT. III.—OSTEOLOGY OF THE REPTILES.</p>
                <p>The number of vertebrae, and all the other attributes of the spinal column, vary
                    more in this class than in all the others.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cheloniad</hi> or Tortoise family there are 7
                    cervical, 8 dorsal, connected with the shell in an immovable piece, so as to
                    have neither processes nor articular facettes; from 3 to 5 lumbar and sacral,·
                    consolidated in like manner; and about 20 caudal or coccygeal. (Plate XXXIV.
                    fig. 5.)</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi> or Lizard tribe, the number 7
                    predominates in the cervical, being that of the crocodile and most lizards. In
                    several, however, there are 8, as in two of the monitor genus, the American
                    safeguard, the lizard of Fontainebleau, the dragon, the iguana, the anolis, and
                    the gecko and seine; and in a few, as the Nilotic monitor, and an undetermined
                    species of monitor, they amount to 9. In the chameleon there are only 5 cervical
                    vertebrae. Here, however, a singular peculiarity is observed. Instead of the
                    cervical vertebrae being, as in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi>
                    distinguished by being unconnected with ribs, to those, from the third to the
                    seventh inclusive, short ribs, unconnected with the sternum, are attached. The
                    <hi rend="italic">atlas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">axis,</hi> therefore, alone
                    are proper <hi rend="italic">cervical</hi> vertebrae; but the general analogy is
                    observed in the cervical ribs being exceedingly short and almost rudimental. The
                    dorsal vary from 11, which is that of the crocodile and iguana, to 29 and 30,
                    which are the numbers in the New Holland seine and Nilotic monitor. In the
                    American safeguard, <hi rend="italic">cordy-lus,</hi> stellio, crested basilisk,
                    dragon, guana, and great anolis, they are 16; in the chameleon, black safeguard,
                    and ameiva, 17; in the tupinambis, spotted gecko, and golden seine, 18; in the
                    green lizard and spotted guana <hi rend="italic">(poly-chrus)</hi> 19; in the
                    Fontainebleau and gray lizard 20; 21 in the Levant seine and undetermined
                    monitor; and 22 in the Java and New Holland monitor.</p>
                <p>TheBATRACHoiD or Ranine reptiles are void of ribs, and it is impossible therefore
                    to distinguish the first three orders of vertebrae from each other. In general,
                    however, there are from the nape to <hi rend="italic">¢ae pelvis</hi> 8
                    vertebrae, all provided with long transverse processes, and which are longest in
                    the last. The <hi rend="italic">sacrum</hi> is represented by a long flattened
                    but pointed bone, without <hi rend="italic">coccyx.</hi> In the Surinam toad <hi
                    rend="italic">(rana pipa)</hi> the last vertebra is consolidated with this bone;
                    and the transverse processes of the second and third vertebrae are so much
                    larger than the others, that they resemble rudimental ribs. In the Salamander
                    family there are from the head to the sacrum 14 vertebrae, all alike in shape
                    except the first, which receives the occipital bone, and the last, which is
                    articulated with the sacrum. These two are distinguished by wanting rudimental
                    ribs, which are small elongated bones, movable, and articulated with the trans
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095743" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5743-0014"/>verse
                    processes,'which are directed backwards. The articular processes are large and
                    imbricated, the posterior resting on the anterior, so as to resist the motion of
                    the spine backwards. The sacrum consists of one vertebra only, but the coecyx or
                    tail is composed of 27.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Serpentine</hi> tribe the vertebrae may be said to
                    attain the most extensive numerical developement. With the exception of the head
                    and rudimental ribs, they constitute the whole skeleton. (Fig. 3.) From the head
                    to the tail their shape is the same, and may be distinguished into body,
                    articular and transverse spinous processes. In some species, for instance the
                    <hi rend="italic">boa,</hi> the spinous processes of the back are so much
                    separated as to allow mutual motion to a considerable extent. In others,
                    conversely, for instance the rattlesnake, these processes are so long and broad
                    as to touch each other, while the oblique proeesses, which form their bases, are
                    imbricated over each other. In consequence of this arrangement the motion of the
                    spine is limited behind, but more extensive on the ventral surface. The
                    vertebral bodies, whieh move easily on each other, are provided with a sharp
                    spine directed towards the tail, which somewhat limits motion in this
                    direction.</p>
                <p>The first vertebra differs from those of the rest of the body in supporting short
                    or rudimental ribs; there are therefore no cervical vertebrae and no proper neck
                    in the serpent family. The caudal vertebrae are distinguished by not supporting
                    ribs, and by their spines both dorsal and ventral being double, and forming two
                    rows of tubereles. The articulation of the bodies of these vertebrae is
                    peculiar. On the anterior part of the body is a round hemispherical tubercle,
                    while the posterior presents a corresponding cavity, so that each vertebra forms
                    a cup and ball joint with the following one.</p>
                <p>The number of costal vertebrae varies from 32, which is that of the blind worm
                    <hi rend="italic">(Anguis fragilis),</hi> to 204 in the ringed snake (<hi
                    rend="italic">Coluber</hi><hi rend="italic">natrix),</hi> 244 in the snake, and
                    252 in the <hi rend="italic">Boa constrictor,</hi> and which is perhaps the
                    greatest known number. Of intermediate numbers, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphisbaena</hi> has 54, the viper <hi rend="italic">(Coluber berus)</hi> has
                    139, the rattlesnake 175, and the cobra di capello 192. The caudal vertebrae
                    vary in number from 7, which is that of the <hi rend="italic">Ampkisbaena,</hi>
                    to 112, which is that of the <hi rend="italic">Coluber</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >natrix.</hi> Of intermediate numbers, the blind worm has 17, the rattlesnake
                    26, the boa 52, the viper 55, and the cobra 63; from which it appears that the
                    number of the caudal is not in proportion to that of the costal vertebrae.</p>
                <p>Of the heads of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ciieloniads,</hi> the most remarkable
                    characters are, that the facial line is horizontal, and quite continuous with
                    the cranial line; that the orbits, though complete without, are continuous
                    behind with the temporal fossae; that the parietal and occipital bones are
                    compressed laterally, while the latter terminates above in a sharp spine,
                    projecting behind. The occipito-parietal and occipito-temporal sutures are
                    distinct. The cranial cavity is small compared with the volume of the scull.</p>
                <p>These characters are not less remarkable in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi>
                    or <hi rend="smallcaps">Lacertine</hi> Reptiles. The cranium of a erocodile
                    measuring from 13 to 14 feet is scarcely capacious enough to admit the thumb;
                    and Cuvier estimates the area of the cranial section, which is oblong, at about
                    ģ¾ of that of the whole head. In these animals, indeed, the bones of the
                    superior and inferior jaws are so much prolonged, and occupy so large a
                    proportion of the head, that small space is left for the proper cranial cavity,
                    which indeed is an immediate continuation of the vertebral. In these animals,
                    also, the anatomist can trace, much more distinctly than in the more perfect,
                    the resemblance between the cranial bones and the vertebral. In the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ciieloniads,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi>
                    especially, the occipital bone is very distinctly a cephalic vertebra.</p>
                <p>Still more manifest is this arrangement in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ranine</hi>
                    or <hi rend="smallcaps">Batrachoid</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Serpentine</hi>
                    or <hi rend="smallcaps">Ophidial</hi> Reptiles. In the former, as exemplified in
                    the frog, the occipital bone, which forms the posterior cranial vertebra,
                    consists of four pieces, and has two articular proeesses. The middle cranial
                    vertebra is represented by the parietal bones above and the posterior part of
                    the sphenoid below, while between it and the occipital or posterior is contained
                    the temporal as the organ of hearing. The third or anterior cranial vertebra is
                    represented by the anterior part of the sphenoid bone below and the two narrow
                    frontal bones above. The ſace, which may be regarded as the organ of the senses,
                    is elongated anterior to the head, somewhat after the manner of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cheloniad</hi> family; while an approximation to the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> is indicated in the articulation of the lower jaw,
                    which is connected to the head by the intervention of a quadrilateral bone.</p>
                <p>In the Serpentine family, the cranium of which is very similar in other respects,
                    the most remarkable deviation is in the want of ethmoid bone. .The lower jaw is
                    connected to the cranium by an intermediate bone, corresponding to the
                    quadrilateral, but of an oblong shape, and something like a collar-bone.</p>
                <p>The chest of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptile</hi> class varies much in the mode
                    of formation. While true ribs are recognised in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Saurial</hi> family only, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Batraciioið</hi> reptiles
                    have a sternum without ribs, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Serpentine</hi> ribs
                    without sternum, and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ciieloniad</hi> ribs united into
                    the dorsal shell, and a sternum expanded into the abdominal one.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi> family the ribs correspond in number to
                    that of the costal vertebrae already mentioned, that is, 12 in the crocodile and
                    iguana, two of which are not connected to the sternum, 17 in the chameleon, 18
                    in the tupinambis, and 27 in the monitor. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi>
                    reptiles, however, are peculiar in having from 1 to 6 ribs attached to the
                    eervical vertebrae, and the opposite ends of which are not connected to the <hi
                    rend="italic">sternum.</hi> These, which have been named eervical ribs, form a
                    transition to the rudimental ribs of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Serpentine</hi>
                    family, which are larger in the neck than elsewhere. The sternum of the
                    crocodile consists of two parts,—an anterior or thoracic, which is osseous,
                    supporting the two collar-bones,—and a posterior or abdominal, which is
                    cartilaginous, and extends to the <hi rend="italic">pubis,</hi> and furnishing
                    to the abdominal parietes eight cyhndrical eartilages. In the East India
                    erocodile it appears that these lateral processes are converted into a single
                    broad piece of cartilage on each side. (Fig. 4.)</p>
                <p>The ribs of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ciieloniad</hi> family are represented by
                    the dorsal shell, which consists of eight broad incurvated plates, identified
                    behind with the dorsal vertebrae, and terminating before in the margin of the
                    shell, and which are doubtless genuine ribs. In the ordinary land-tortoise <hi
                    rend="italic">(Testudo</hi><hi rend="italic">Groeca)</hi> these are seen in the
                    shape of elevated bonyridges, proceeding from the head of each rib in
                    atrans-verse concave bend to the margin of the dorsal shell. On each side of
                    these ridges the bone is depressed, and is united at its lowest point by a
                    genuine suture with the adjoining ones. These sutures, however, are not
                    continuous with those of the sterno-abdominal shell, but meet it in the
                    intermediate points. (Fig. 5.) The sterno-abdominal shell consists, in like
                    manner, of several transverse pieces consolidated into one. The ordinary number
                    is eight on each side of the mesial plane, and a ninth azygous, generally placed
                    in the centre of the shell. In a specimen, however, of the tabular tortoise (<hi
                    rend="italic">Testudo tabulata),</hi> in our possession, the number of the
                    sterno-abdominal pieces is 11, of which 8 are in pairs, united on the mesial
                    line from before backwards, and 3 azygous at the posterior tip of the shell. In
                    young animals it is easy to recognise the unions of these constituent bones,
                    which consist of suturesex-actly<pb break="no" facs="nls:193095756"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5756-0015"/> similar to those of the cranium in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia.</hi> So feeble is the union, that it often happens
                    that the ab- <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> dominai shell especially separates at
                    the lines of junction, in the attempt to detach it from'the dorsal.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Batraciioid Reptiles,</hi> though void of ribs, are
                    provided with a <hi rend="italic">sternum,</hi> which before is a cartilaginous
                    process, terminating on a disc placed below the larynx, where it receives the
                    collar-bones, and forms behind a broad plate placed below the abdomen, and
                    giving attachment to the muscles. In the Salamander tribe, which are without <hi
                    rend="italic">stermιm,</hi> the ribs consist of twelve pair of small rudimental
                    processes, articulated with the vertebrae, but admitting of very limited
                    motion.</p>
                <p>Lastly, in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Serpentine</hi> family, though there is no
                    sternum, the upper vertebrae are provided with costal processes, quite
                    rudimental. The great number of these costal rudiments, amounting in the
                    rattlesnake to 175, in the <hi rend="italic">cobra di capello</hi> to 192, in
                    the <hi rend="italic">coluber</hi><hi rend="italic">natrix</hi> to 204, and in
                    the <hi rend="italic">boa constrictor</hi> to 252, and the freedom of their
                    anterior extremities, enable the animals of this tribe, which are destitute of
                    locomotive members, thoracic or abdominal, to employ the spinal column and the
                    ribs as organs of progressive motion. On this point the reader will find some
                    interesting observations by Sir Everard Home <hi rend="italic">(Phil.
                    Trans.</hi> 1812, p. 163). In the region of the neck, where the ribs acquire
                    peculiar length, they are employed in erecting that region, and producing the
                    expansive swelling peculiar to this tribe of animals. It is an important link in
                    the same series of facts, that in the animal absurdly named the flying lizard
                    <hi rend="italic">(draco</hi><hi rend="italic">volans),</hi> the five posterior
                    ribs are recurvated and elongated to form the bony skeleton of the membranous
                    sails by which the animal supports itself in its desultory flight from tree to
                    tree.</p>
                <p>It is in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi> family that the locomotive
                    extremities of Reptiles ought first to be studied. In these we -find an
                    elongated <hi rend="italic">scapula</hi> without spine, and one short flat bone,
                    constituting the clavicle, united to the sternum. In the iguana and chameleon
                    this bone is broad and nearly quadrilateral, while in the tupinambis it is large
                    and oval-šhaped, with its greatest length from before backwards, •and with two
                    unossified points.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ranine</hi> tribe, while the <hi rend="italic"
                    >scapula</hi> consists of two articulated pieces, the upper towards the spine,
                    each shoulder is provided with two collar-bones attached to the two extremities
                    of the sternum, and the two anterior of which correspond to the bifurcated bone
                    of birds. The <hi rend="italic">sternum,</hi> collar-bone, and first part of the
                    <hi rend="italic">scapula,</hi> form one piece. In the salamander, in which the
                    same consolidation is observed, the scapular portion is most distinct and
                    directed to the spine, while of the clavicular portion the part connected to the
                    sternum stretches below the chest, but, without uniting with that of the
                    opposite side, the right glides over the left,—an arrangement which facilitates
                    the dilatation of the chest during inspiration.</p>
                <p>A nearer approach still to the bifureated bone than is seen in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ranine</hi> may be recognised in theCHELONiAD family. In these
                    animals three bones are united to form the humeral cavity. The first is a flat,
                    trilateral bone, situate below the abdominal and thoracic <hi rend="italic"
                    >viscera,</hi> close to the abdominal shell, and which, notwithstanding its
                    situation, is evidently the <hi rend="italic">scapula.</hi> The second is a bone
                    about the same length, flat, and like the feather of an oar at one extremity,
                    which is free, round in the middle, and flattened in the opposite direction at
                    the other end, which is firmly united at a right angle to a long slender
                    cylindrical bone. At the angle of union of these two bones is part of the
                    glenoid cavity, which is complete in the small end of the scapula. The first of
                    the two bones is the collarbone proper; the second is the lateral branch of the
                    bone, which forms the bifurcated, and which is occasionally united with its fe

                    attachment to the membranous web by which the animal occasionally elevated
                    itself into the atmosphere. This animal, which, like the dragon <hi

                    have combined the contradictory characters of a flying reptile, may be regarded
                    as forming the link between the <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> as the <hi rend="italic">Ichthyosaurus</hi> does

                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">pelvis</hi> of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cheloniad</hi>
                    family it is remarkable that the pubal and iliac bones appear to change places.
                    Thus the <hi rend="italic">ilium</hi> on each side is a narrow bone proceeding
                    backwards to the sacral part of the spine, which is received between its
                    posterior aperture; while the <hi rend="italic">pubis</hi> appears in the shape
                    of a broad, trilateral, flat bone, uniting before with its fellow on the mesial
                    plane, behind with the <hi rend="italic">ilium,</hi> and below with a flat,
                    thin, quadrilateral bone, corresponding to the <hi rend="italic">ischium,</hi>
                    with which it forms the oval aperture. The inner of these three bones presents,
                    as usual, the cotyloid cavity. It is further to be observed, that the two iliac
                    bones, and consequently the whole <hi rend="italic">pelvis,</hi> are movable on
                    the vertebral column. (Plate XXXIV. fig· 5∙)</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi> Reptiles the pelvic bones are arranged
                    and shaped nearly as in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cheloniad.</hi> In the <hi

                    elongated, and the pubal and ischial are consolidated into one piece, the
                    symphysis of which forms a rounded crest.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The femur</hi> is short, thick, and incurvated sinuously, with
                    the convexity before towards the tibial end, and the concavity towards the
                    pelvic. Trochanters, though present in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ciieloniad,</hi>
                    are wanting in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ranine</hi> Reptiles. In the leg we find both <hi rend="italic">tibia</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">fibula</hi> distinct, and of nearly equal size, in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cheloniad</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi> family,
                    but conjoined in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ranine</hi> family. The <hi
                    rend="italic">tarsus</hi> consists of five bones, and sustains four or five
                    metatarsal ones, on which are supported three rows of phalanges. The metatarsal
                    bones, which vary in length, are longest in the crocodile and others of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Lacertine</hi> tribe. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ranine,</hi>
                    again, the <hi rend="italic">astragalus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >calcaneum</hi> are the bones of greatest proportional length.</p>
                <p>The anatomical characters now enumerated are proper to the skeletons of Reptiles
                    at present existing on the surface of the earth or in its waters; and in these
                    we find a gradual transition from the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cheloniad,</hi> by means of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Serpentine,</hi> to the finny inhabitants of the ocean. Even the <hi

                    >Siren Lacertina,</hi> the characters of the Reptile are combined with those of
                    the Fish, in having at once lungs or internal respiratory cells, and gills or

                    strongly demonstrated in the osteological characters of two <hi rend="italic"
                    >Genera</hi> of animals now extinct, so far as is yet known,—the <hi

                <p>From the specimens of the <hi rend="italic">Ichthyosaurus</hi> hitherto
                    discovered, it appears that the number of vertebrae varies from 80 to 90 or
                    more; in one entire specimen they amounted to 104 (Conybeare and De la Beche);
                    that they are flattened, with the transverse diameter greater than the
                    longitudinal, and the two articulating surfaces of the bodies calycoid or
                    cup-shaped as in Fishes. Though the annular <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> part
                    is distinct from the body, it is united to its sides. The spinous processes,
                    which are long and prominent, form a continuous ridge above the spine, and are
                    connected to each other by a process from the front of the one spine, which is
                    inserted into a pit in the back of the other. Instead of proper transverse
                    process, a certain number of the vertebrae are provided with two tubercles on
                    each side of the body, of which the superior, convex, is articulated to the
                    tubercle of the rib, while the other, which is concave, receives the head. In
                    the inferior part of the vertebral column, these two tubercles, after
                    approximating, are eventually identified into one.</p>
                <p>The ribs, which are numerous, and extend from the <hi rend="italic">occiput</hi>
                    to the <hi rend="italic">pelvis,</hi> are slender and trilateral in shape,
                    bifurcated above, and attached to the vertebrae by a head and tubercle. In the
                    perfect specimen of Mr de la Beche they amount to 31, and of these 17 appear to
                    be cervical or anterior false ribs, with single tubercles; thus affording
                    another mark of resemblance to the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi> family in
                    osteological characters.</p>
                <p>The bones of the head, distinguished by the extraordinary size of the orbit, are
                    similar to those of the Saurial Reptiles. The <hi rend="italic">sternum,</hi>
                    collar-bone, and scapula, though also similar to those of this family, bear a
                    much closer resemblance to the figure of these parts in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Echidna</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ornithorhyncus.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >humerus</hi> is short, thick, and sinuated; the bones of the fore arm flat, and
                    probably constituting part of the fore or thoracic fin. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carpus</hi> consists of three rows, the first containing three bones, the other
                    two, four each. These are followed by five or six rows of flattened, irregularly
                    cuboidal bones, gradually diminishing in size and number to the tips, and which
                    represent at once the <hi rend="italic">metacarpus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >phalanges of</hi> the fore paw, used apparently chiefly as a fin or paddle. The
                    pelvic extremities appear to have been less strong and perfectly constructed
                    than the thoracic. The <hi rend="italic">femur</hi> is smaller and shorter than

                    of which 35 appear to be cervical, while the other 55 are dorsal and caudal, the
                    regions of which are proportionally short. The head of this animal also is small
                    and compressed, nor has it the large orbit of the <hi rend="italic"

                    united at an obtuse angle, the former articulated by a single head to the
                    transverse process, and the latter connected with its fellow by a transverse
                    slip, so that the lower or abdominal ribs appear to have surrounded the abdomen
                    with a complete cincture. The anterior part of the chest is occupied by two
                    trilateral bones uniting in the middle, which, from their connection with the
                    scapula, are believed to be the coracoid bones; and above these is a transverse
                    piece, with a middle notch and lateral sinuated elevations, which is regarded as

                    nevertheless, that the middle portions named coracoid bones are the sternum, and
                    the transverse bone the clavicles; and it is worthy of remark, that not only
                    this bone, but the middle piece, closely resembles in figure and disposition

                <p>SECT. IV. OSTEOLOGY OF THE FISHES.</p>
                <p>' The <hi rend="smallcaps">Serpentine</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Ophiad</hi>
                    Reptiles present in their osteological characters an approximative transition to
                    those of Fishes. While in the former order the skeleton is reduced to the spinal
                    column, ribs, and head, in the latter class the spine and head only are left;
                    and in some tribes the transition is still more distinctly marked by the
                    presence of ribs.</p>
                <p>The vertebra of a fish is distinġuished from that of any other animal by the
                    shape of its body. The cephalic and caudal, or anterior and posterior surfaces,
                    are hollow cuplike cones, so that the union of each two vertebrae forms a double
                    conical cavity, united by the base, containing a substance composed of
                    concentric fibro-cartilaginous layers, with intermediate albuminous or
                    gelatinous matter. By this cartilage the vertebral bodies are united; and on
                    this the motions of the spine are effected. This motion, however, is chiefly
                    lateral; for the spinous processes are so long, and the articulation so complex,
                    that antero-posterior inflection or extension is nearly impracticable.</p>
                <p>In the cartilaginous fishes, for instance the shark, sturgeon, and lamprey, the
                    vertebral bodies form simple tubes, which, from the extreme elasticity of the
                    constituent cartilage, propel the contained fluid to a considerable distance.
                    Thus Sir E. Home saw the fluid.projected to the height of four feet from the
                    intervertebral cavities of the shark. <hi rend="italic">{Phil. Trans.</hi>
                    1809.) In this order, also, the spine is infinitely more flexible, and its
                    resilient power, when bent by the muscles, is almost incredible. On each side,
                    also, the vertebrae are excavated, to form a canal for lodging the large
                    blood-vessels.</p>
                <p>The vertebrae of fishes are numerous, and not easily distinguished into classes.
                    They may, however, be distinguished into two, according as the spinous process
                    is above only, or above and below at once. Those with the dorsal spine only are
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">dorsal or abdominal verte-broe,</hi> and have
                    commonly at the sides transverse processes for the attachment of the ribs. Those
                    with the dorsal and ventral spines are distinguished as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >caudal vertebrae.</hi> The last caudal vertebra is generally trilateral,
                    flattened in the vertical direction; and its tip is marked with articular pits,
                    which indicate the attachment of the small elongated bones which sustain the
                    caudal fins.</p>
                <p>The number of vertebrae varies. In the <hi rend="italic">uranoscopus</hi> or
                    star-gazer there are only 25, in the <hi rend="italic">balista</hi> 17, and in
                    the four-spined trunk-fish <hi rend="italic">(pstracion)</hi> only 13; while in
                    the sturgeon the number is 84, in the eel 115, and in the shark 207.</p>
                <p>Ţhough'FiSHEs have no chest, and require none, since their respiratory organs are
                    gills, all of them are not void of ribs. The ray, shark, <hi rend="italic"
                    >syngnathus, tetraodon, diodon, cy-</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193095782"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5782-0017"/><hi rend="italic">clopterus, fistularia,</hi>
                    &amp;c. have indeed no vestige of rib. But in the sturgeon, <hi rend="italic"
                    >balista,</hi> eel, <hi rend="italic">uranoscopus, pleuronectes,</hi> sea-wolf,
                    and dory, they are in the shape of short rudimental processes; in the7r⅛⅛ and
                    <hi rend="italic">loricaria</hi> their sides are horizontal; in the perch, carp,
                    pike, and <hi rend="italic">chetodon,</hi> they encompass nearly the whole upper
                    region of the abdominal cavity; and, lastly, in the silver-fish <hi
                    rend="italic">(zcus vomer),</hi> the herring, rhomboidal salmon, &amp;c. they
                    are united to a sternum. In the little animal named sea-horse <hi rend="italic"
                    >(syngna-thus hippocampus),</hi> several series of osseous tubercles of the
                    skin, surrounding the body like belts, are supposed to represent false ribs. The
                    sternum is limited to a small number of <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes.</hi>
                    Besides those already mentioned, in the dory there is a series of minute flat
                    bones disseminated along the lower edge of the belly, which is supposed to
                    represent a rudimental sternum.</p>
                <p>In size and number the ribs vary, though in the <hi rend="italic">silurus,</hi>
                    carp, and <hi rend="italic">chetodon</hi> they are of largest proportional size;
                    in the herring they are as fine as hairs.</p>
                <p>The head in the finny tribes is more an object of zoological than anatomical
                    description. The chief points to be remarked are, that the cranium forms but a
                    small part of the head; that the orbits are separated by a <hi rend="italic"
                    >septum,</hi> sometimes membranous, occasionally, as in the wolf-fish, bony; and
                    that there is on each side a large movable bone, corresponding to the
                    quadrilateral of <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> not square, however, but
                    oblong, which supports not only the lower jaw and palatine arches, but the
                    gill-cover. In the cartilaginous fishes the sutures are early obliterated, and
                    the cranium consists of an inseparable mass of cartilage. In the bony fishes the
                    cranium is separable into numerous pieces, and in the perch they amount to 80.
                    In the cranium of fishes the anatomist recognises more distinctly than in the
                    superior orders the formation according to the vertebral type. Small in
                    proportion to the whole head, the cranium appears like a direct continuation of
                    the vertebral column. In the osseous division of the class especially, the
                    cranium may be distinguished into the occipital or posterior vertebra, the
                    spheno-parietal or middle, and the frontal or facial vertebra. The cavity thus
                    formed is very small; yet small as it is, it is not exactly filled by the brain,
                    between which and the bones there is interposed a pellucid fluid, contained in
                    fine cellular tissue. The cranium of the osseous fishes also is widest between
                    the ears, because the organ of hearing is contained within its cavity with the
                    brain. In the cartilaginous it is quite different.</p>
                <p>Though <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> are destitute of extremities similar to
                    those possessed by the other three classes of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Vertebrata,</hi> they are not, however, without locomotive members. The
                    thoracic extremities are represented by the pectoral fins, and the pelvic by the
                    ventral. In short, it may be said that the bones of the thoracic and abdominal
                    extremities are converted into osseous rays in the finny tribes.</p>
                <p>In the Bay <hi rend="italic">genus,</hi> in which the wing-like disposition of
                    the pectoral fins gives the body a rhomboidal shape, they consist of numerous
                    radiating cartilaginous lines, all attached to a cartilage parallel to the
                    spine, divisible into two or three others, and articulated above to another
                    adherent to the spine. Below there is a strong transverse bar common to the
                    cartilages of both fins, and separating at once the sternum and clavicle. This
                    transverse bar is also seen in the shark tribe; but their pectoral fins, which
                    are much smaller, are not articulated with the spine.</p>
                <p>In the osseous fishes, and in many others usually referred to the cartilaginous
                    division, <hi rend="italic">e. g.</hi> the <hi rend="italic">balista,</hi> the
                    pectoral fins are fixed to an osseous belt, which surrounds the body behind the
                    gills, and which supports the posterior margin of their aperture. This belt
                    consists of a single bone on each side, articulated to the posteriorsuperior
                    angle of the cranium, and uniting below the breast with that of the opposite
                    side. This bone, which - may be regarded as a <hi rend="italic">scapula,</hi>
                    varies in shape and the angle which it forms with its fellow in different
                    species. In fishes flattened vertically, the angle of union is acute; in those
                    which are depressed, the angle is so obtuse as to' form nearly a straight line.
                    In many fishes, especially those of the order <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Thoracici,</hi><hi rend="italic">e g. pleuronectes, cottus, zeus,
                    chetodon,</hi> perch, &lt;⅛c., in the small unicon <hi rend="italic"
                    >(balista),</hi> and others, the superior part forms a large spine, which
                    descends immediately behind the fin, and to which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >adductor</hi> muscles are attached. This spine, which is movable, has been
                    improperly named a <hi rend="italic">clavicle.</hi></p>
                <p>The rays by which the membrane is supported are not directly articulated to this
                    belt, but are connected by a row of minute flat bones, which may be compared to
                    the <hi rend="italic">carpus</hi> in the other three classes. When the first ray
                    of the pectoral fin, however, is thorny, as in the harness-fish <hi
                    rend="italic">(loricaria),</hi> and some species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >silurus,</hi> it is articulated directly with an osseous belt; and it is
                    remarkable that some fishes, as the <hi rend="italic">silurus</hi> and
                    stickle-back, have the power of retaining this spinous ray erected against the
                    body as a means of defence. This is effected by a cylindrical tubercle, on which
                    the spinous ray is articulated by a hollow, bounded before and behind by an
                    elevated process. When the spine is erected, the anterior process, entering a
                    hole in the cylindrical tubercle, is locked in it by the spine revolving
                    slightly on its axis, so that it cannot be inflected unless by the spine
                    revolving in the opposite direction.</p>
                <p>The pectoral fins are so long that they answer the purpose of wings in several
                    species of <hi rend="italic">trigla,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">trigla</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">hirundo,</hi> the flying gurnard <hi rend="italic">(trigla</hi><hi

                    >(trigla</hi><hi rend="italic">evolans,)</hi> in the <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">(exocoetus</hi><hi rend="italic">volitans),</hi> and some others.
                    Their situation also is liable to vary. In the <hi rend="italic">exocoetus</hi>
                    they are near the gills, but in the <hi rend="italic">biennius</hi> and others
                    they are remote. Lastly, they are totally wanting in a small number only, as the
                    lamprey <hi rend="italic">(petromyzon),</hi> the hag-fish <hi rend="italic"
                    >(myxine,</hi> Lin.; <hi rend="italic">gastróbranchus),</hi> the <hi

                    rend="italic">sphagobranchus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The abdominal or ventral fins, which correspond to the pelvic extremities of the
                    other classes, are so denominated because in the majority of fishes they are
                    situate below the belly, and nearer the anal outlet than the pectoral. By this
                    circumstance a numerous order are distinguished by the name of Abdominal Fishes
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">(Abdominales).</hi></p>
                <p>In a small number of fishes, comprehending the <hi rend="italic">gadus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">biennius,</hi><hi rend="italic">kurtus, callionymus,
                    trachinus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">uranoscopus,</hi> the ventral fins are
                    placed under the throat, below the aperture of the gills, and before the
                    pectoral fins. This order is therefore distinguished by the name of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Jugulares.</hi></p>
                <p>In the most numerous order of all, the ventral fins are situate behind and below
                    the pectoral fins. These have therefore been denominated Thoracic Fishes <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(Thoracici).</hi></p>
                <p>The ventral fins consist of two parts—one formed of rays covered by a double
                    membrane, apparent externally, and constituting the proper ventral fin; the
                    other internal, representing the coxal bones of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pelvis,</hi> always supporting the pinnal rays, and often articulated with the
                    bones of the trunk. It is never articulated, however, with the spine, nor does
                    it form an osseous belt round the abdomen. The bones of which it consists are
                    generally flattened, varying in shape, and in mutual contact by the internal
                    margin. In the shark and ray <hi rend="italic">genera</hi> only is there a
                    single transverse bone, nearly cylindrical, to the extre-inities<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193095795" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5795-0018"/> of which the fins are
                    attached. The direction of the pelvic plane to the walls of the abdomen varies
                    according to the shape of the body of the fish. In the flat fishes they are
                    directed obliquely, and their inner margin forms the keel of the belly. In
                    fishes with a broad or cylindrical belly they form a plane more or less
                    horizontal.</p>
                <p>. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Jugular</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Thoracic
                    Fishes,</hi> the pelvic bones are always articulated with the base of the belt
                    which sustains the pectoral fins; and they vary much in shape and situation.</p>

                    and perch, these two bones are united by their inner margin. In the

                    internal margin,.they are broad, flat, and oval. In the sole and flounder <hi
                    rend="italic">genus (pleuronectes),</hi> in which the fins are attached to their
                    anterior tip, they are united in a quadrangular pyramid, the apex of which is
                    directed backwards and upwards, and the base forwards. In some of the
                    stickle-backs these bones are altogether separate, and being long, receive in
                    their middle a movable spine, which supplies the place of the ventral fin. In
                    the dory <hi rend="italic">(zeus</hi><hi rend="italic">faber,</hi> L.) they are
                    flat and triangular, in mutual contact by their whole surface. In the
                    silver-fish <hi rend="italic">(zeus vomer)</hi> they are small and
                    cylindrical.</p>
                <p>In the whole of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Abdominal</hi> order, on the contrary,
                    the pelvic bones are equally unconnected with the bones of the shoulder and with
                    the osseous belt of the pectoral fins, and are confined to the middle-inferior
                    part of the belly, not far from the <hi rend="italic">anus.</hi> In general
                    these two bones are separate from each other, and are retained in their
                    situation by ligaments. In the carp,. in which they are elongated, they touch
                    only by their posterior third. In the herring, in which they are small and
                    approximated, they are continuous with the minute bones of the sternum. In the
                    pike they are broad and trilateral, approximated by their anterior tips,
                    separate behind where the fin is attached. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >silurus,</hi> in which they are united, they form a round and often spinous
                    shield before, while the fins are attached to the exterior-posterior margin.
                    Lastly, in the cuirassier or harness-fish <hi rend="italic">(loricaria),</hi>
                    the pelvic bones are united in one piece, the posterior notch of which forms the
                    anal aperture, while the fins are attached to its external margin.</p>
                <p>The proper fin consists of a certain number of osseous rays, simple or biful,
                    supported by one or two rows of ιni- ∙nute bones placed between them and the
                    pelvic bones. On these small bones the constituent rays move, diverging or
                    converging like the rods of a fan, while the whole fin maybe inflected or
                    extended by the minute bones moving on the pelvic, so as to adduct or abduct the
                    fin.</p>
                <p>’ In the cartilaginous fishes the structure is different. To the tip of each
                    pelvic bone are articulated two principal cartilages, one external, forming a
                    kind of toe with seven or eight joints; the other internal, supporting all the
                    other rays of the fin, which often exceed thirty in number.</p>
                <p>r If we suppose these bones, like the minute ones of the <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> pectoral fin, to represent the <hi rend="italic">tarsus of</hi> the other
                    three <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> classes, it must follow that, in the
                    locomotive extremities, the <hi rend="italic">humerus,</hi> with the <hi
                    rend="italic">ulna</hi> and <hi rend="italic">radius,</hi> and the <hi

                    rend="italic">fibula“,</hi> are obliterated. It is not en-important to observe,
                    that the general structure of <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Vertebrata</hi> tends through various transitions to this
                    termination. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Amphibia</hi> the long bones of the
                    extremities are shortened by removing the <hi rend="italic">diaphysis,</hi> and
                    leaving their articulating ends only. In tha <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetaçea</hi>
                    the pelvic •extremities are removed altogether. In the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cheloniad</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial Reptiles</hi> the same long
                    bones of the extremities are much abridged; and in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ichthyoid.Reptiles,·</hi> now extinct, but sharing by their structure a form of
                    animal existence partaking, of the. reptile and fish at once, and perhaps
                    intermediate between the two, this abbreviation is carried perhaps to its
                    greatest possible degree, in leaving the articular ends only of the four
                    locomotive extremities. Lastly, this reduction is merely preparatory to that
                    exhibited in the whole class of <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes,</hi> in which the
                    three longitudinal bones so conspicuous in the higher classes of animals are
                    completely obliterated, and those representing the hand or forepaw and foot are
                    articulated directly to the shoulder and pelvic bones.</p>
                <p>Besides the bones already mentioned as constituting the skeleton, there are
                    observed in the osseous fishes minute bones, generally fork-like in shape,
                    disseminated through all the muscular parts of the body. The purpose of these
                    bones, which, as being totally insulated from the other parts of the skeleton,
                    arc denominated <hi rend="italic">ossicula</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >musculorum·,</hi> is chiefly to afford points of support; and they are probably
                    to be regarded as rudimental representatives of osseous parts, more completely
                    developed in the higher animals.</p>
                <p>It is further a curious circumstance, that the skeleton, which is so symmetrical
                    in all the other classes and orders, begins to exhibit a deviation from this
                    first in the skeleton of the finny tribes. In the Sole <hi rend="italic">genus
                    (Pleuronectes)</hi> this deviation is very conspicuous. Both eyes are placed on
                    the same side of the mesial plane; and the side on which the eyes are placed is
                    broader than the opposite one. The former is bounded by a convex margin, the
                    latter by a concave one. The orbit towards the former is large, the other small
                    and imperfect. Conversely, it is to be observed, that in the latter the
                    maxillary and intermaxillary bones are larger than in the former. The sides of
                    the inferior jaw are less discordant; and though in the Sole and Plaice those of
                    the eyeless side arc more straight and elongated than those of the other, in the
                    Turbot <hi rend="italic">(Pleuronectes</hi><hi rend="italic">maximus)</hi> they
                    are nearly symmetrical,</p>
                <p>CHAP. II.—COMPARATIVE MYOLOGY.</p>
                <p>Though this is the proper place to consider the peculiarities of the muscular
                    system of animals, the limits assigned to this sketch will not allow us to enter
                    into details. We shall merely, therefore, take a cursory view of those points in
                    which the myology of the lower animals differs from that of the human
                    subject.</p>
                <p>In general, in the lower animals, especially the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,
                    Birds,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles,</hi> the muscles correspond in
                    situation to those of the human subject; and whatever modifications they undergo
                    consist in changes of figure, and in some few instances in changes in
                    attachment. The former kind of changes may be in all cases pretty accurately
                    estimated by the osteological characters of the class, order, or genus; for when
                    the position, shape, or direction of, a bone is altered, in the same proportion
                    nearly are the attached muscles altered in their attributes.</p>
                <p>Though in the lower animals, however, the zootomist traces muscles in general
                    quite analogous to those of the human subject, in several instances this analogy
                    ceases to be observed. In general the muscles of the lower animais are less
                    numerous than those of the human subject; and this, deficiency in number, though
                    not much observed in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana,</hi> is very
                    remarkable in all the inferior orders of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi>
                    and still more in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Reptiles.</hi> In general, also, these variations are most conspicuous in the
                    locomotive extremities. Thus the small; pectoral muscle, which is present in the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadru-mana,</hi> is; wanting in the <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    remarkably by the occipital ‘part of the <hi rend="italic">rhomboideus,</hi> the
                    fibres of which being parallel to the spine, pass below the proper <hi

                <p>The common extensor of the fingers or fore toes is the only muscle which is
                    common to man and all the quadrupeds. Of the proper extensors the horse has two

                    pastern; another between the common extensor and the extensor of the pastern,
                    and which seems merely an appendage to the former. The proper extensor of the
                    index is wanting in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> Ruminants, and <hi

                    of the latter. Lastly, the lower animals are wholly destitute of the short
                    muscles of the hand, which in man produce flection, abduction, adduction, and
                    opposition. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Chiroptera</hi> only is there one
                    extensor, and flexors of the fore toes.</p>

                    in general soft. The ⅛ame distinction is observed in the muscles of the two
                    extremities. In birds much on the wing these muscles are dark Coloured and firm,
                    while those of the legs are comparatively lighter and more tender; and,
                    conversely, in birds little on the wing and mostly on the legs, as the domestic
                    poultry and many of the <hi rend="italic">Gralloe,</hi> the waders, swimmers,
                    &amp;c. the muscles of the wings are light coloured and tender, while those of
                    the legs are dark coloured, firm, and strong.</p>
                <p>The flexor muscles of the leg and toes of <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> merit
                    notice. They consist of muscles corresponding to the long flexors, which are
                    divided into three masses. The first consists of· five portions, three of which
                    may be regarded as constituting a single <hi rend="italic">common perforated
                    flexor.</hi> It rises by tWo bellies, one attached to the external condyle of·
                    the <hi rend="italic">femur,</hi> forming a perforated tendon, which receives
                    one of those of the muscle corresponding to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >peronoeus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the other to the posterior surface of
                    the femur,. forming the tendons of the index and small toe. This muscle is
                    further connected by intermediate fibres with the accessory femoral flexor,—a
                    muscle placed on the internal surface of the thigh, and sending its tendon over
                    the knee·; <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> and as the tendons are inserted into
                    the unguinal phalanges, when the· accessory femoral bends the thigh the flèkors
                    of the toes inflect them also, and retain them in· the inflected position. By
                    means of this arrangement birds are enabled to clasp a perch or other small body
                    when roosting, without continued muscular effort, and thereby-to sleep on the
                    perch. This mode of explanation, which was originally given by Borelli, has been
                    controverted by Vicq d ’ Azyr; but apparently not on good grounds. ∙ </p>
                <p>Among the class of Reptiles, while the muscles of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >OphiDIAL</hi> family are confined to tho⅛e∙ of the vertebrae and rudimental
                    ribs, in the <hi rend="smallcaps">CheĺoniáD</hi> these are obliterated, and the·
                    muscles <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> of the neck, head, and tail, and those of
                    the locomotive'extremities alone, are left. In the other two class⅛s of reptilès
                    the muscles are in general analogous to those' of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mamm'aiia.</hi></p>
                <p> »There ate nöt many instattcés of muscles which, though unknown in foan, äre

                    eye. The former was absurdly maintained tó’exist in the human subject/
                    especially by Niċolaŭs Massa; but it is*manifest that the-assertion was derived
                    from the dissection of tile lower animals’ only. » It was <hi rend="superscript"
                    >:</hi> not-long after demonstrated by Charles-Etienne, that no fleshy pannićle
                    or cutaneous <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> muscle exists,* süċh áš is found in
                    the lower -animals; ahd <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095821"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5821-0020"/>that the only cutaneous muscles in man are the <hi
                    rend="italic">latissimus colli,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">epicranius</hi> or
                    scalp-muscle, and those which are attached to the face, and which by their
                    motion give expression to the countenance. The cutaneous muscle even is not
                    found in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Qüadrumana,</hi> nor does it exist in the pig.
                    In various other animals, however, it is found in different degrees of
                    distinctness. It is very well marked in the hedgehog and porcupine ;—by its
                    means they have the power of erecting their spines, and rolling themselves up
                    ;—and in the armadillo and the anteater tribe. In the mole, also, we have seen
                    it pretty well marked.</p>
                <p>It is an interesting fact, that Galen originally observed that the lower animals
                    possess a seventh muscle of the eye, or one more than man. The suspensory or
                    infundibular muscle <hi rend="italic">(musculus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >clioanoides),</hi> as it has been named, from its shape, especially in the
                    Ruminants and <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,</hi> has the <hi rend="italic"
                    >apex</hi> fixed to the margin of the optic hole, and its base inserted a little
                    behind the four straight muscles. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga</hi> and
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> it consists of four parts, so that these
                    orders appear to be provided with 8 straight muscles. In the rhinoceros it
                    consists of two portions.</p>
                <p>There is yet another part, the muscles of which· can scarcely be said to exist in
                    the human subject, but which attain a very great degree of developement in the
                    lower animals. The <hi rend="italic">coccyx</hi> of the human subject is
                    expanded in the lower animals into a highly flexible prolongation denominated
                    the tail <hi rend="italic">(caudd),</hi> variable in length, but always
                    consisting of separate vertebrae, articulated and movable on each other. While
                    the <hi rend="italic">coccyx</hi> of the human subject possesses two muscles
                    only, the <hi rend="italic">iscliio-coccygeus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >sacro-coccygeus,</hi> which are so insignificant in size that they scarcely
                    serve to move the part, the caudal vertebrae of the lower animals are moved by
                    muscles greatly larger, more numerous, and more powerful.</p>
                <p>The tail is to animals a much more useful and powerful organ than the coccyx to
                    man. It is a member which peculiarly belongs to them; and though in ordinary
                    circumstances pendulous, it is made to assume a variety of motions of which no
                    other organ is susceptible, and to perform duties which would be otherwise
                    impracticable. With many, as the long-tailed monkeys, the sloths, the ant-eater,
                    and the squirrel tribes, it is indispensable as an organ of prehension. The
                    majority of animals, as the Ruminants, <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,
                    &amp;c.</hi> use it as a whip or lash to drive away insects. The lion, tiger,
                    and others of the feline tribe, lash their sides with it when enraged. The
                    Cetaceous swimmers employ it as a rudder and oar in the waters. The beaver uses
                    it as a trowel, to enable him to construct his clay-built dwelling. An organ
                    employed so variously must consist of a muscular apparatus rather complex.</p>
                <p>The different motions of which the tail of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi>
                    is susceptible may be referred to three heads,—one by which it is extended or
                    elevated, another by which it is inflected or depressed, and a third by which it
                    is made to beat the sides. The combination or succession of these motions gives
                    rise to secondary ones more complex in character. It may be twisted on its axis,
                    or turned in a spiral direction. These motions are effected by three classes of
                    muscles.</p>
                <p>Isŕ, The muscles which raise the tail are situate above; they are <hi
                    rend="italic">musculi</hi><hi rend="italic">sacro-coccygeei</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">superiores.</hi> Commencing at the base of the articular processes
                    of the 3 or 4 last lumbar vertebrae, or those of the sacrum and the caudal
                    vertebrae, by fleshy slips, they are connected to tendons, which are inserted
                    into the base of the first of the caudal vertebrae, which are void of articular
                    processes. The second tendon goes to the next following vertebra, and so on to
                    the 13th, each contained in a ligamentous groove, which forms an investment. The
                    muscles of both sides acting together, elevate or incurvate the tail up-
                    wards.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">interspinalis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">spinalis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">obliquus</hi> or lumbo-sacro-coccygeal are the continuations of
                    the <hi rend="italic">interspinales dorsi et lumborum.</hi> The spinous
                    processes, however, becoming indistinct, or being represented by two tubercles,
                    the attachments vary.</p>
                <p>2d, The muscles which depress or inflect the tail downwards take their origin
                    within the pelvis, and are prolonged to various extents along the inferior
                    surface of the tail. Of these there are four pairs, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ileo-coccygeal</hi> of Vicq d’Azyr, the inferior <hi rend="italic"
                    >sacro-coccygeal,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">inter-coccygeal</hi> muscles, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">pubo-coccygeal</hi> of the same author. The insertions of
                    these muscles vary in different genera, according to the number of vertebrae of
                    which the tail consists. The pubo-coccygeal is wanting in the raccoon, but it is
                    distinct in the dog and opossum. The effect of the ileo-coccygeal and it, is to
                    depress the tail and apply it forcibly to the <hi rend="italic">anus.</hi> 3<hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi>, There are only two muscles which carry the tail to the
                    sides of the animal—the <hi rend="italic">ischio-coccygaeus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">externus,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">intertransυersalis</hi>
                    of Vicq d’Azyr; the former proceeding from the pelvic surface of the <hi
                    rend="italic">ischium</hi> below and behind the <hi rend="italic"
                    >acetabulum,</hi> to the transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae, the
                    second extending in a continued band between all the transverse processes.</p>
                <p>The tail, therefore, in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> consists of a
                    series of successively decreasing vertebrae, moved by eight pairs of
                    muscles.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> it is not easy to trace any analogy between
                    the muscles and those of the other classes. Though the spine, head and fins,
                    have appropriate muscular bundles, the natural or fascial distinctions are less
                    evident than in the other three classes. It is important, however, to remark,
                    that while the muscles which move the spinal column are placed in these classes,
                    partly before, and chiefly behind the vertebrae, those of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Fishes</hi> are placed on each side. Hence the lateral motion of the spine,
                    which is inconsiderable in <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammiferous</hi> animals, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles,</hi> becomes
                    very conspicuous in the finny tribes, especially in the motion of swimming,
                    while the anteroposterior inflection or extension is altogether
                    insignificant.</p>
                <p>It is almost superfluous to remark, that, in the greater part of the finny
                    tribes, the muscles are white or pale coloured. In a few only, for instance the
                    salmon, trout, gwiniad <hi rend="italic">(coregonus),</hi> herring <hi
                    rend="italic">(clupea</hi><hi rend="italic">harengus),</hi> carp <hi
                    rend="italic">(cyprinus),</hi> and some others, are the muscular fibres of a
                    pale flesh red. The circumstances on which these differences depend arc not
                    known; but it is supposed that in the latter sorts the proportion of
                    oleo-albuminous matter is more abundant than in the former. The proportion of
                    albumen, however, in the muscles of fish, seems in general to be small. They
                    abound in gelatine and isinglass; and in some of the cartilaginous fishes
                    especially, the greater part of the muscles seem to consist chiefly of gelatine
                    in various degrees of consistence. This is particularly the case with the
                    lamprey, the hag-fish <hi rend="italic">(myxine</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >glutinosa),</hi> and even with the sturgeon. The sterlet especially <hi
                    rend="italic">(acipenser</hi><hi rend="italic">Ruthenus),</hi> a small species
                    of sturgeon found in the rivers of Russia, both European and Asiatic, abounds in
                    gelatine; and the presence of this principle enables the inhabitants to use it
                    in the preparation of a species of soup, the sterlet, which is esteemed a great
                    delicacy. In some of the <hi rend="italic">genus Pleuroncctes</hi> this
                    principle is also very abundant. Thus the Plaice <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pleuronectes</hi><hi rend="italic">Platessa),</hi> sole <hi rend="italic">(P.
                    Solca),</hi> and especially the turbot <hi rend="italic">(P. Maximus),</hi>
                    contain a considerable proportion of gelatine. On the proportion of this
                    principle depends the quality of fish used <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095834"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5834-0021"/>as an article of food in nourishing without
                    exciting. All fishes which abound in gelatine uncombined with oleo-albuminous
                    matter may be safely used as articles of food; while those in which the latter
                    ingredients predominate are invariably eaten with the risk of disordering the
                    stomach and producing indigestion.</p>
                <p>CHAP. III.—COMPARATIVE AESTHIOLOGY, OR THE COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE ORGANS OF
                    SENSATION.</p>
                <p>SECT. I. THE ORGAN OF SMELL.</p>
                <p>The organ of smell consists of the nasal cavities, those of the ethmoidal and
                    turbinated bones, and the frontal, Sphenoidal, and superior maxillary sinuses,
                    all of which communicate with the nasal. The whole of these parts are invested
                    by fine periosteum, lined by mucous membrane. The ethmoid bone is the essential
                    organ of smell; and the others appear simply to multiply the extent of the
                    membrane.</p>
                <p>. The ethmoid bone consists of a perforated plate, with a middle vertical one
                    attached at right angles to it, and lateral portions composed of thin bony
                    plates convoluted with various degrees of complexity and minuteness in different
                    orders and genera of animals. These convoluted plates form what are denominated
                    the ethmoidal cells. They may be represented as numerous tortuous canals,
                    proceeding from the perforated plate forwards and outwards, approximating
                    mutually, and forming numerous communicating cavities. Such nearly is the
                    structure of these plates in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ruminantia,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,
                    Pachydermata,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Carnivora,</hi> the last of which
                    have more complicated cells than the first. In the dog they are numerous and
                    extensive. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> for instance the
                    porcupine, they are few—not above 3 or 4 on each side.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> the internal side of each nostril is occupied
                    by three orders of plates; the inferior turbinated or spongy bone; the middle,
                    consisting of one plate convoluted on itself two turns and a half; and the
                    upper, shaped like a bell, adhering to the frontal and lacrymal bones. These
                    form three tortuous passages, varying in size and tortuosity in different <hi
                    rend="italic">genera.</hi> Though generally cartilaginous, these turbinated
                    bones are membranous in the cassowary and albatross, and bony in the calao and
                    toucan.</p>
                <p>In the nostrils of <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles</hi> there are convoluted
                    prominent plates, which, however, are merely membranous productions, unsupported
                    by any bone.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes,</hi> in like manner, there are membranous
                    folds, the disposition of which is tortuous. They arc, however, more regularly
                    arranged than in the other classes. In the cartilaginous fishes they consist of
                    semilunar folds placed in parallel tracts on each side of a broad plate, which
                    divides the one side of the nasal cavity from the other. In the sturgeon,
                    however, they are arranged in diverging plates, which are subdivided into more
                    minute ones, like the branches of a tree. In the osseous fishes generally they
                    consist of radiating plates disposed round a prominent central tubercle.</p>
                <p>In these three classes the olfactory nerve is distributed to the membrane much in
                    the same manner. This nerve, however, does not proceed farther than the superior
                    turbinated bones; and the middle and inferior appear to be supplied with
                    filaments of the fifth pair, the naso-ophthalmic branch of which is distributed
                    to the nose in all the vertebrated animals. In the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia,</hi> further, the spheno-palatine ganglion sends several filaments to
                    the posterior part of the narine membrane.</p>
                <p>By most zootomical authors the trunk of the elephant has been described as an
                    organ of smell peculiar to that animal. We are satisfied, however, from
                    observing the motions of this body in the living animal, that it is an organ,
                    not of smell, but of prehension. Cuvier, after adopting the ordinary view, has
                    relinquished it, and, on the ground of personal inspection, admits that the
                    sense of smell in the elephant is confined, as in other animals, to that portion
                    of the nasal cavities which is contained within the bones of the head. The trunk
                    of the elephant, therefore, will with greater propriety be noticed under a
                    subsequent head.</p>
                <p>The nasal cavities of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetaceous</hi> animals are not so
                    much organs of smell as channels of respiration, and must also be noticed
                    afterwards. It is sufficient here to remark, that in these animals the part of
                    the cranium corresponding to the ethmoid bone is penetrated by no aperture, or,
                    in other words, is not an ethmoid bone. It has therefore been asserted that the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> have no olfactory nerve, and no sense of
                    smell. This, however, is by no means established. Blainville and Jacobsen have
                    observed in the dolphin nerves which they regard as olfacient; and Treviranus
                    delineates nerves of the same character. By Otto and Rudolphi, on the contrary,
                    who have had frequent opportunities of dissecting the dolphin and whale, the
                    existence of these nerves is denied.</p>
                <p>Though almost all the invertebrated animals give proofs of the existence of the
                    sense of smell, in none of them do we find any organ in which this sensation
                    appears with certainty to be exercised. That these animals possess the faculty
                    of smell, is inferred from the fact, that insects recognise their food at a
                    distance; that male butterflies scent the female even when inclosed in cages;
                    and that the ordinary flesh-fly deposits her eggs on tainted meat, and
                    occasionally on fetid plants, in the belief that they arc the proper <hi
                    rend="italic">nidus,</hi> though in the latter case the <hi rend="italic"
                    >larvae</hi> perish for want of the necessary sustenance.</p>
                <p>Since odorous particles are evidently applied to the olfactory membrane of all
                    aeropnoic animals by the medium of the atmosphere, and since the organ of smell
                    is therefore situate in connection with the wind-pipe, it was conjectured by
                    Baster, that, in insects at least, the organ of smell is situate at the entrance
                    of the <hi rend="italic">tracheae</hi> or airtubes. This conjecture derives some
                    probability from the fact, that the inner tracheal membrane in these animals is
                    soft and moist, and that those in which it is expanded into convoluted <hi
                    rend="italic">lacunae</hi> and tortuous vesicles, for instance beetles, flies,
                    and bees, are remarkable for the nicety of their sense of smell.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">antennae,</hi> in which this sense has been placed by some
                    anatomists, appear to be rather organs of touch than of smell.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusea</hi> the whole cutaneous covering seems to
                    combine the character of an organ of touch or tact, and of smell. Like an
                    extensive pituitary membrane, it is soft, villous, moist, and liberally supplied
                    with nerves. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Articulata</hi> and Zoophytes seem much in
                    the same state. But on all these points information is rather conjectural than
                    positive.</p>
                <p>SECT. II. THE EYES; THE ORGANS OF VISION.</p>
                <p>All red-blooded animals, without exception, are provided with two movable eyes,
                    consisting of the same essential parts as those of man, forming globular organs,
                    and placed in the cranio-facial cavities named orbits. In none are there more or
                    fewer; and the exceptions to the general rule, either in relation to the
                    presence of these organs, or number, are only apparent. Among the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,:</hi> indeed, there are two instances of
                    blindness,—in the <hi rend="italic">zemni</hi> or blind rat <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Mus</hi><hi rend="italic">typhlus,</hi> Lin.; <hi rend="italic">Spalax
                    typhlus,</hi> Pall.), and <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> the golden mole (<hi
                    rend="italic">Talpa</hi><hi rend="italic">Asiatica,</hi> Lin.; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chrysochloris,</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi> Lacep. and Cuvier).
                    But in neither of these animals are <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095847"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5847-0022"/>the eyes absolutely wanting; they are merely very
                    minute, and covered by a thin fold of hairy skin, in which there is said to be
                    no aperture. Much in the same manner the <hi rend="italic">muraena
                    coecilia,</hi> and the hag-fish <hi rend="italic">(myxine,</hi> Lin., <hi
                    rend="italic">gastrobranclius caecus),</hi> though provided with eyes, are
                    deprived of the use of these organs by the opacity of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >conjunctiva.</hi> In the <hi rend="italic">Anableps ( Cobitis Anableps,</hi>
                    Lin.), the <hi rend="italic">cornea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">iris</hi> are
                    biparted by transverse bands, so as to give the animal the appearance of having
                    two pupils in each eye, though the crystalline lens, vitreous humour, and
                    retina, are single. This animal affords the only example of this structure among
                    the vertebrated animals; but a similar arrangement is observed in the
                    Cephalopodous <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusea</hi> and cuttle-fish family.</p>
                <p>The general shape of the eye depends on the medium in which the animal lives. It
                    is nearly spherical, or approaching the spherical shape, in man and the
                    quadrupeds moving along the surface of the earth; that is, in the lowest and
                    most dense region of the atmosphere. The <hi rend="italic">cornea</hi> merely
                    forms a slight convexity, in consequence of being the segment of a smaller
                    sphere than the rest of the eyeball; yet in the porcupine, opossum, &amp;c.,
                    this difference is inconsiderable. To show the degree of this convexity, it is
                    merely requisite to compare the axis or antero-posterior diameter with the
                    transverse diameter of the ball, as exhibited in the following table :—</p>

                <p>According to the measurements of the younger Soemmering, the axis of the human
                    eye, taken in a beautiful Tyrolese girl of 20, is to the transverse diameter as
                    100 to 95; that of the eye of the magot <hi rend="italic">(simia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">inuus)</hi> as, 85 to 84; and that of the bat <hi rend="italic"
                    >(vespertilio auritus)</hi> as 12 to 11. In the raccoon <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ursus</hi><hi rend="italic">lotor)</hi> and lynx <hi rend="italic"
                    >(felis</hi><hi rend="italic">lynx)</hi> alone the axis is exactly equal to the
                    diameter. In all the other vertebrated animals, it is, as in the measurements of
                    Cuvier, less than the transverse diameter at the rate of from 9 to 33 or 45 per
                    cent. In the horse it is as 186 to 212, in the seal as 130 to 142, in the Indian
                    elephant as 135 to 180, and in the black whale <hi rend="italic">(balaena
                    mysticeius)</hi> as 20 to 29. In the owl it is as 17 to 18, in the golden falcon
                    as 14½</p>
                <p>to 16, in the ostrich as 18 to 19∣, and in the swan as 7 to 10. In the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Reptiles</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> it is always
                    less at the rate of from 3 to. nearly 10 per cent. In the cuttle-fish, which may
                    be taken as a general example of the invertebrated classes, it is much greater,
                    the axis being to the diameter as 80 to 57. (D. W. Soemmering <hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">Oculorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Hominis Animaliumque

                <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi>
                    which inhabit the sea, the anterior part of the eyeball is much more flattened,
                    and in many fishes it resembles a hemisphere with the plane surface before, and
                    the convex behind. In the ray <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> the superior part is
                    also flat, so as to give the eýe the appearance of the quadrant of a sphere, cut
                    through two large circles perpendicular to each other. In some fishes,
                    especially the burbot <hi rend="italic">(Gadus Lota),</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cornea</hi> is convex.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> which occupy the elevated regions of the
                    atmosphere, the deviation from the spherical shape is in the direction opposite
                    to that of fishes. On the anterior part, which is sometimes flat, sometimes
                    shaped like a truncated cone, is chased a short cylinder, closed by a very
                    con-vex, and occasionally hemispherical <hi rend="italic">cornea,</hi> always
                    belonging to a much smaller sphere than the posterior convexity.</p>
                <p>These differences in shape depend on the proportion between the density of the
                    medium iń which the animals live and that of the aqueous humour. In the higher
                    régions of the atmosphere, in which the air is very much rarefied, the
                    refracting power of the aqueous humour is much more considerable than at the
                    surface, occupied by quadrupeds; and hence it is more abundant in the former
                    than in the latter class. Its refracting power, however, would be almost
                    extinguished in a watery medium, from which it could differ but little in
                    density; and hence it is either trifling or absolutely wanting in the
                    inhabitants of the deep. In the cuttle-fish family it is entirely wanting.</p>
                <p>The crystalline lens in <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes,</hi> which is nearly
                    spherical, projects through the pupil, and leaves little room for the aqueous
                    humour. The lens is also very convex in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Amphibious Mammalia,</hi> the diving birds, as the
                    cormorant, and the marine and aquatic <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles.</hi></p>
                <p>Affecting the oblate spheroidal shape in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi>
                    it becomes extremely so in man, and still more in <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Birds.</hi> Its consistence is greatest in animals in which it is most convex;
                    and hence it is matter of common observation, that the crystalline of fishes is
                    particularly firm. It also contains rather more albumen than the lens of the <hi

                    space of the eyeball in man, and most in fishes.</p>
                <p>The comparative spaces occupied by each of the humours may be understood from the

                <p>On the proportion of the total volume occupied by each of the three transparent
                    parts there are few accurate facts. It may be remarked, however, that the human
                    eye among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> is that in which the vitreous
                    humour is proportionally most abundant. It is estimated to be twenty times more
                    copious than the aqueous. In the ox it is only ten times, and in the sheep nine
                    times the quantity of the aqueous.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> generally, the sclerotic is
                    comparatively elastic, soft, and yielding; but in all animals in which the eye
                    deviates from the spherical shape, as the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,
                    Fishes,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> this membrane is strengthened
                    by greater solidity and thickness of tissue, or supported by accessory parts of
                    a hard unyielding structure.</p>
                <p>In the eye of the whale these two parts, the hard and soft, are naturally
                    distinguished in a very striking manner. The lateral parts of the sclerotic are
                    nearly an inch thick, and very hard. The posterior part is about one and a half
                    inch thick, and softer, because the spaces between the firm fibres are filled
                    with oily substance. The, posterior part presents Tor the optic <hi
                    rend="italic">nerve</hi> a canal one and a half inch long, the walls of which
                    are formed chiefly by fibres in direct continuity with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >durd mater,</hi> the only fact, it may be observed, which favours the statement
                    of the ancient anatomists, that the sclerotic is derived from the <hi
                    rend="italic">dura mater.</hi> The sclerotic of the porpoise, though only two or
                    three lines thick has the same structure as that of the whale. In the seal it is
                    thick before and thicker behind, but the middle zone is'thin and flexible.</p>
                <p>The sclerotic in <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> is thin flexible, and elastic
                    behind, with a bluish glistening aspect, and without distinct fibres. The optic
                    nerve, enters, not by a hole, but an oblique canal. The anterior part consists
                    of two plates, between which is enchased a zone of thin, hard, oblong,
                    osseous<pb break="no" facs="nls:193095860" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5860-0023"/>
                    scales, varying in number from 11 or 12 to 14 or 15, imbricated over each other
                    so as to give the anterior part of the eyeball a great degree of hardness, and a
                    figure unsusceptible of change. Though these plates are nearly flat in most
                    birds, and form an annular zone slightly convex, they are broad, arched, and
                    concave internally in the owl <hi rend="italic">genus,</hi> and form a
                    bell-shaped tube, with the posterior aperture oval and the anterior round. This
                    may be denominated the osseous ring <hi rend="italic">(annulus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">osseus,</hi><hi rend="italic">zona</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ossea).</hi> In the ostrich it is narrow and flat.</p>
                <p>Among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles,</hi> the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cheloniads</hi> possess an osseous zone, consisting of plates inclosed in the
                    membrane without being continuous with its substance. They are also found at the
                    lateral part of the sclerotic in the chameleon and some of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi> Reptiles, as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crocodilus</hi><hi rend="italic">Sclerops</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lucius,</hi> the monitor, and the iguana (D. W. Soemmering). It is also an
                    important character in the structure of the eye of the Ichthyosaurus, which
                    indicates the connection of that animal with the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Saurial</hi> tribe, that its sclerotic was provided with an osseous zone,
                    consisting, as in these, of 13 separate pieces.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> the sclerotic is cartilaginous, homogeneous,
                    semi-translucent, elastic, and, though thin, firm enough not to collapse. In the
                    ray it is expanded into a tubercle, by which the eye is attached to a peduncle
                    or stalk. The sclerotic of the sturgeon is so thick that it resembles a
                    cartilaginous sphere, with the external part hollowed for the humours and
                    membranes.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cepiialopodous</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusea</hi>
                    it forms behind a truncated cone, with the apex at the bottom of the orbit
                    containing the gangliform swelling of the optic nerve, and several glandular
                    parts, with the eye before.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">cornea</hi> has often been represented to be merely a
                    continuation of the sclerotic; and though, this is easily disproved by accurate
                    dissection of the human eye and that of our ordinary domestic animals, its
                    inaccuracy is much more manifestly demonstrated in the animal world at large. In
                    the whale and rhinoceros the margins of the two membranes penetrate
                    reciprocally. In man and the ox the corneal margin is enchased within the sharp
                    imbricated edge of the sclerotic. In the tope-fish <hi rend="italic"
                    >(squalus</hi><hi rend="italic">milandra,</hi> Lin.; <hi rend="italic"
                    >galeus,</hi> Cuv.) the cornea is observed distinctly passing within the
                    sclerotic in the manner of imbrication. The cuttle-fish is destitute of cornea;
                    and as there is no aqueous humour, the crystalline lens is covered by a fine
                    thin membrane, extended beneath the conjunctiva.</p>
                <p>In all animals provided with eyelids, the mucous membrane, after being folded
                    behind the eyelids, is reflected forwards over the sclerotic and cornea, in the
                    form of a thin, transparent membrane. In those void of eyelids, as most fishes
                    are, the skin, passing into mucous membrane, is continued directly over the <hi
                    rend="italic">cornea,</hi> without forming any angular fold, and adheres
                    strongly. This is very distinct in the eel, which may be flayed without leaving
                    any trace at the site of the eyes, except a round, translucent spot. The same
                    peculiarity is remarked in <hi rend="smallcaps">Serpents</hi> and in the
                    cuttle-fish family. In the <hi rend="italic">zemni,</hi> golden mole, blind eel,
                    and hag-fish, it has been already stated that the cornea is covered by opaque
                    mucous membrane.</p>
                <p>The choroid coat exists in all animals yet examined. It is always very vascular.
                    The inner layer, which has been distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >tunica lìuyschiana,</hi> can scarcely be said to exist in man, s∏ialf
                    quadrupeds/ and birds. In the large quadrupeds^,however, especially the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cetaceous</hi> animals, it appears in . the form of a distinct
                    simple membrane like <hi rend="italic">epidermis.</hi> The lateral and anterior
                    parts of the membrane are/always invested by a semifluid, viscid substance, of
                    different shades of black or brown black <hi rend="italic">(pigmentum
                    nigrum)</hi>; chocolate'brown in.the hare, rabbit, and pig; deep red brown in
                    some birds; and purple red in the <hi rend="italic">calmar.</hi> The absence of
                    this dark-coloured pigment, which is not unfrequent, is observed in <hi
                    rend="italic">albinos,</hi> both human and animal, for instance white rabbits
                    and white mice. The transparency of the Ruyschian membrane then shows the
                    choroid of its natural red colour; and the pupil is red and contracted, and the
                    eye intolerant of light.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoopiiaga,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ruminantia,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata, Solidungula,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> the concave or inner surface of the Ruyschian
                    membrane is diversified with colours of metallic lustre, more or less brilliant
                    and something iridescent. In the ox it is of bright metallic green, changing to
                    sky-blue; in the horse, buck, buffalo, and stag, it is a silvery blue passing to
                    violet; in the sheep of a pale golden green, sometimes bluish; in the lion, cat,
                    bear, and dolphin, of a pale gold yellow; and in the dog, wolf, and badger, of a
                    pure white, surrounded by blue. This coloured part of the inner choroid surface,
                    which occupies chiefly the side opposite to that on which the optic nerve
                    enters, is named the <hi rend="italic">tapetum.</hi> The use of it is by no
                    means obvious. The explanation of Monro in reference to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tapetum</hi> of the ox, that it represents more distinctly to that animal the
                    colour of his natural food, is not only frivolous, but inapplicable to the other
                    <hi rend="italic">genera.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">tapetum</hi> is wanting in all <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Birds</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes,</hi> excepting the ray, in which
                    there is at the bottom of the eye a beautiful silvery-coloured space, produced
                    by the transparency of the Ruyschian tunic, through which the tint of the
                    choroid is seen.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> generally the choroid consists of two
                    distinct separable membranes; the external, the proper choroid, white, silvery,
                    or golden, very thin and not vascular; and the inner or Ruyschian, black, and
                    consisting of a network of vessels. Between these two membranes is a body of a
                    bright red colour, consisting of numerous tortuous vessels, convoluted and
                    inclosed in pulpy filamentous tissue. Its general shape is that of a thin
                    cylinder, encompassing the optic nerve like a ring, which, however, is
                    incomplete at one side. This is the choroid gland,—a body about which there has
                    been some difference of opinion, but which appears to be glandular rather than
                    any thing else. Its vascular structure is well seen in the globe-fish, <hi
                    rend="italic">perca</hi><hi rend="italic">labrax,</hi> and cod, in which they
                    are very large, and form numerous anastomotic communications. They are generally
                    covered by a white, opaque, viscid flüid.</p>
                <p>The choroid gland is wanting in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cartilaginous
                    Fishes,</hi> the eye of which approaches more nearly to that of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> in this as in other circumstances. The choroid of
                    the ray and shark <hi rend="italic">genera</hi> is a threefold tissue of
                    vessels, thick and consistent; the <hi rend="italic">txinica Ruyscħiana</hi> is
                    very thin and semi-transparent; and between these is a layer of silvery matter
                    with metallic lustre.</p>
                <p>In the cuttle-fish genus, though between the sclerotic and choroid there are
                    several glandular bodies, there are none between the choroid and Ruyschian
                    tunic. The choroid is thick, soft, and vascular; the Ruyschian thin, firm, and
                    dry; and though there is no <hi rend="italic">tapetum,</hi> the whole interior
                    surface of the eye is covered by deep purple, semifluid, viscid varnish.</p>
                <p>Ciliary processes are found in all theMAMMALiA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi>
                    several <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles,</hi> and even in the cuttle-fish among'
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusea</hi>; but they are wanting in almost all
                    fishes.'</p>
                <p>The indented border of these processes is more distinct, and is converted into a
                    genuine fringe in the large animals, as the òx, horse, rhinoceros, and whale, in
                    v¢hich the angle applied to the capsule is more acuminated than in other
                    animals. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Carnivora,</hi> particularly the lion, the
                    base of the plates is shorter in proportion to the other sides than in the
                    previously mentioned animals, so that the opposite angle is more prominent; nor
                    is the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095873" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5873-0024"/>border
                    indented. In all the species every third or fourth plate is shorter than the
                    others, but without determinate order.</p>
                <p>The ciliary plates of <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> are mere serrated <hi
                    rend="italic">striae,</hi> without sufficient prominence to make them undulate
                    in fluid. In the owl they are fine, closely set, and numerous; in the ostrich
                    they are larger and more numerous; and if t all, their extremities adhere firmly
                    to the capsule of the lens.</p>
                <p>In the tortoise the ciliary processes are so short that they are recognised only
                    by the impression left on the vitreous humour; in the crocodile, however, they
                    are distinct, and terminate each by an angle nearly right. They are indistinct
                    in the toad, and imperceptible in the ordinary lizards and serpents.</p>
                <p>The ciliary body and processes are large and distinct in the tope-fish; but if
                    they are seen in any other of the cartilaginous fishes, they are wholly wanting
                    in the osseous, in which the Ruyschian tunic is directly continuous with the <hi
                    rend="italic">uvea.</hi></p>
                <p>The utility of these processes in retaining the lens in its position is nowhere
                    so distinctly seen as in the eye of the cuttle-fish family, and especially the
                    many-feet of the ancients <hi rend="italic">(polypus octopodd).</hi> In these
                    the ciliary processes form a large diaphragm or zone, in the aperture of which
                    the crystalline lens is truly chased. They penetrate a deep annular furrow which
                    surrounds the lens, dividing it in two unequal hemispheres, and cannot be
                    detached without laceration.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">iris,</hi> of the same intimate structure as in man, is of
                    a deep tawny or brown in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> and marked with
                    fewer coloured <hi rend="italic">striae</hi> than the human <hi rend="italic"
                    >iris.</hi> In <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> it is of a uniform lustreless
                    colour, varying according to the species, bright yellow, red, or clear blue. In
                    the microscope it appears like a net-work formed by the intersection of numerous
                    very minute fibres. The <hi rend="italic">uvea</hi> is so fine that when the
                    viscid varnish is removed it becomes transparent, and the iris appears of the
                    same colour on both sides. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes,</hi> conversely, the
                    <hi rend="italic">iris</hi> is so thin and transparent that the <hi
                    rend="italic">uvea</hi> is seen through it, of a golden or silvery brilliance,
                    showing its direct connection with the choroid. Intermediate in metallic
                    splendour is the iris of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles.</hi> The vessels,
                    however, are greatly more conspicuous, especially in the crocodile.</p>
                <p>The central aperture or pupil, though round in man, the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Quadrumana,</hi> many of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Carnivora,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> is not of that shape when contracted in all
                    animals. In the feline family it consists of two elliptical segments, which form
                    angles above and below, and which approach mutually so as to form a slit nearly
                    vertical. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ruminants</hi> it is oblong transversely,
                    and forms at its greatest contraction an oblong or transverse slit. In the
                    horse, in which it is also transverse, its upper margin is distinguished by a
                    five-pointed festoon. In the whale it is oblong transversely, and in the dolphin
                    it is heart-shaped. The pupil of the crocodile resembles that of the cat; in the
                    frog and gecko it is rhomboidal; and round in the tortoise, chameleon, and
                    common lizards. In the ray among <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> the upper
                    margin forms several radiating slips like the branches of the palm-tree,
                    gold-coloured without, dark within. In the dilated state these slips are folded
                    backwards between the upper margin of the pupil and the vitreous humour; but
                    when the eye is pressed they are erected, and close the pup'il like a blind.</p>
                <p>The motion of the pupil is voluntary in the parroquet, and is indistinct in most
                    of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes.</hi></p>
                <p>The pupillary membrane is well known to exist in the foetuses of all the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi>; but it is not determined whether it is found in
                    the chick of birds.</p>
                <p>On the subject of the retina in the lower animals the most important point is the
                    structure of the melanoplectic or pectiniform membrane <hi rend="italic"
                    >(pecten, marsupium nigrum)</hi> of <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds.</hi> In this
                    class the optic nerve forms not a round disk as in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia,</hi> but a narrow white line, the margins, and extremity of which are
                    in continuity with the <hi rend="italic">retina.</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> 1</hi> Along this line is suspended a plicated or convoluted]
                    membrane, very fine and vascular in structure, like the &lt; choroid, from
                    which, however, it is quite distinct, and en-J tering a depression of the
                    vitreous humour almost like a∙i wedge. Its vessels, which proceed from a proper
                    branch <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> of the ophthalmic artery, are distributed
                    in a minute arborescent form, among the folds of which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >marsupium</hi> consists; and from these vessels the black viscid pigment with
                    which its folds are covered appears to be secreted. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >plicae</hi> or membranous folds vary in number. In the cassowary they are only
                    4; in the brown owl (&lt;S ’. <hi rend="italic">aluco)</hi> 5; in the common
                    owl, ostrich, Guiana macaw, and merganser, they are 7; in the flamingo 9; in the
                    falcon and swan 11; in the vulture and goose 12; in the duck, large heron,
                    woodcock, and coot, 13; in the stork and partridge 15; in the crane 17; in the
                    pheasant 20; in the turkey 22; in the jackdaw 25; and in the thrush 28.
                    According to the observations of the elder Soemmering, to whom we are indebted
                    for these numbers, the number of folds, though variable in different species, is
                    the same in the same. In most birds the folds are arranged in a pectiniform
                    order. On the use of this organ different opinions have been entertained by
                    Petit, Haller, and Home; but all of them are conjectural.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles</hi> and many <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Fishes,</hi> between the optic nerve and the <hi rend="italic">retina</hi> is a
                    small tubercle, from the margins of which the latter membrane appears to rise;
                    and radiating fibres are perceived more distinctly than in most quadrupeds. In
                    many other <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> the connection of the retina with
                    the optic nerves resembles that of <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds.</hi> Thus, in the
                    salmon, trout, herring, mackarel, cod, dory, and moon-fish, the optic nerve,
                    after passing through the Ruyschian tunic, appears to be parted into two long
                    white processes, which, following the outline of this membrane parallel but not
                    contiguous to each other, are connected with the <hi rend="italic">retina</hi>
                    by their opposite margins.</p>
                <p>In all animals provided with ciliary processes the <hi rend="italic">retina</hi>
                    terminates at and is connected with the gray pulpy zone denominated ciliary
                    ligament. In those without ciliary processes, as the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Fishes,</hi> it terminates suddenly at the attached or large margin of the <hi
                    rend="italic">uvea.</hi></p>
                <p>In several of the reptiles the retina presents the yellow-spot of Soemmering. The
                    principal peculiarities of the humours have been already mentioned.</p>
                <p>Of the appendages the most important are the lacrymal gland and nictitating
                    membrane.</p>
                <p>In the Ruminants the lacrymal gland consists of two or J three bodies, each
                    composed of granules, each provided £ w-ith a separate short excretory duct. In
                    the hare and rabbit, in which the gland is large, there appears to be only one
                    excretory duct, which perforates the upper eyelid near its posterior angle.</p>
                <p>A gland peculiar to certain species, and wanting in man, that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Harder,</hi> is situate at the external or nasal angle, and
                    presents an aperture under the third or nictitating eyelid, from which issues a
                    thick viscid fluid. It is found in the. <hi rend="smallcaps">Ruminants,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> the <hi rend="smallcaps">Pachyderm ata,</hi>
                    and in the sloth genus.</p>
                <p>The caruncle exists in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ruminants</hi> as in man, and
                    appears to consist of numerous aggregated follicles. It is wanting in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rodentia.</hi></p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> as in most animals which live under
                    water, there is neither gland nor lacrymal passages; and they are represented
                    apparently by <hi rend="italic">lacunae</hi> below the upper eyelid, which
                    discharge a thick mucilaginous fluid.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> though destitute of caruncle, have both
                    lacrymal<pb break="no" facs="nls:193095886" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5886-0025"/> gland
                    and that of Harder, the latter large, oblong, and flesh-coloured, placed betwixt
                    the <hi rend="italic">levator</hi> and <hi rend="italic">adductor,</hi> and
                    discharging by a single canal, opening at the inner surface of the third eyelid,
                    a thick yellow fluid. The lacrymal, which is small, round, and very red, is
                    provided in general with two or three canals, which, though small, are distinct.
                    In most of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Grallae</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Palmiped</hi> Birds there is, in place of the lacrymal gland, a hard granular
                    body, occupying the upper part of the orbit, and following in situation the
                    curvature of the eye. It has, nevertheless, no visible excretory duct.</p>
                <p>In the turtle there is a reddish granular tabulated body, of considerable size,
                    extending beneath the temporal vault. In the tortoise, frog, and toad, there are
                    two small blackish glands without apparent excretory ducts. Neither in Serpents
                    nor <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> has any glandular apparatus in the eye been
                    recognised.</p>
                <p>Though in man and the monkey tribe the eyelids consist of two semilunar
                    cutaneo-muscular folds, with a minute mucous duplicature at the nasal angle, the
                    latter acquires such a developement in the lower animals as to constitute a
                    genuine third eyelid, often distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >nictitating membrane.</hi> This duplicature is semilunar in shape in the
                    Ruminants, <hi rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pachy-Dermata.</hi> In the rhinoceros it is thick and fleshy; but of this the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> present no trace. In the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Birds,</hi> on the contrary, in which the eye is covered by the elevation of
                    the lower eyelid, which is also the largest, the third eyelid is large, and
                    covers the eye like a blind drawn before it; yet it is in some degree
                    translucent, for it is evident that birds see objects through the membrane. In
                    the owl and goatsucker the eye is closed by the depression of the upper as well
                    as the elevation of the lower eyelid.</p>
                <p>Though the <hi rend="smallcaps">Serpentine</hi> reptiles are void of eyelids
                    entirely, in the crocodile, tortoise, and <hi rend="smallcaps">Batrachoid,</hi>
                    there are three, as in birds, the third being vertical in the two former orders,
                    and horizontal in the latter. In the S <hi rend="smallcaps">auri al</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cheloniad,</hi> also, the third, which is translucent,moves
                    from before backwards by means of a single muscle, and may cover the whole eye.
                    In the lizard <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> the eyelids consist of a circular
                    veil drawn before the orbit, and perforated by a horizontal fissure, which is
                    shut by a <hi rend="italic">sphincter,</hi> and opened by a <hi rend="italic"
                    >levator</hi> and <hi rend="italic">depressor.</hi> The gecko has no movable
                    eyelid.</p>
                <p>In insects, the eye consists of innumerable hexagonal surfaces, slightly convex,
                    and mutually separated by minute furrows, containing fine hairs variable in
                    length. Each of these hexagonal surfaces, which constitute a hard, elastic, very
                    transparent membrane, may be regarded as a cornea or crystalline lens, convex
                    externally, concave within, and thicker in the centre than on the margins.
                    Immediately behind is an opaque, viscid coating, varying in colour in the
                    different species, analogous to the choroid pigment of the vertebrated animals,
                    and completely obstructing the transmission of light. Beneath this varnish are
                    short, whitish filaments, corresponding in number to the corneal surfaces, and
                    mutually joined like mosaic or tessellated pavement, separated only by the
                    dark-coloured pigment, and which appear to correspond to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >retina</hi> of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Vertebrata.</hi> Behind these again is
                    a delicate, darkcoloured membrane, which appears to correspond to the choroid;
                    and exterior to this is a membrane continuous with the optic nerve, and which
                    seems to be a <hi rend="italic">general retina,</hi> forming, by subdivision of
                    its parts on the anterior part of the choroid, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >divided</hi> or multiplied <hi rend="italic">retina.</hi> This is the structure
                    of what are named <hi rend="italic">compound eyes.</hi> That of the simple eyes
                    of insects is too minute to be accurately demonstrated; but analogy gives
                    probability to the inference that they are not dissimilar.</p>

                    canals named vestibule <hi rend="italic">(vestibulum),</hi> and a conical

                    in a spiral form, and hence is denominated, as in man, the <hi rend="italic"

                    in this class only.</p>
                <p>The organ of hearing in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> consists of the
                    same parts nearly as in man. In somei indeed, for instance the guinea-pig <hi

                    makes three turns and a half; and, conversely, in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cetacea</hi> only one and a half. In most of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Zoophaga,</hi> and in the hog, elephant, and horse, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cochlea</hi> is much larger in proportion than the semicircular canals; but in
                    the hare it is small, and in the mole very small. In the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cetacea,</hi> while the <hi rend="italic">cochlea</hi> is very large and fully
                    developed, its spiral is on the same plane throughout; and the semicircular
                    canals are so small, that their existence was tang denied by Camper, till they
                    were demonstrated by Cuvier in a foetal whale. In general the labyrinth of the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> is greatly smaller in proportion to the head
                    than in <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds.</hi></p>
                <p>This part, which is membranous, is inclosed in the solid compact substance of the
                    temporal pyramid, so closely that its existence appears to be identified with
                    the latter. Researches, however, on the labyrinth in the foetus of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> and especially in those of whales, demonstrate
                    the fact that it is in a completely membranous form, dis- ∙ tinct from the bony
                    inclosure; that in shape and constituent parts it exists previous to the bony
                    inclosure; and that the latter is afterwards moulded round the different parts
                    as they acquire their full developement. It is also to be observed, that in the
                    mole the semicircular canals are seen within the cranium without preparation,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">cochlea</hi> is merely inclosed in fine cellular
                    tissue. In the bat family, also, both parts are seen without bony inclosure.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">tympanum</hi> of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> is
                    peculiar. It consists of a bony plate, convoluted on itself like a <hi
                    rend="italic">buccinum,</hi> unless that the thick side, instead of containing a
                    spiral cavity, is entirely solid. The opposite side is thin, with an irregular
                    margin. The anterior extremity of the <hi rend="italic">tympanum</hi> is open,
                    and there commences the Eustachian tube, which ascends along the pterygoid
                    process, and, penetrating the maxillary bone, terminates at the upper part of
                    the nose. This direction of the tube and position of its orifice is so much more
                    necessary, because, since these animals have no external bony <hi rend="italic"
                    >meatus,</hi> and the ear-hole scarcely admits a pin, the vibrations of the air
                    reach their organ of hearing entirely by the Eustachian tube, and because the
                    Eustachian tube also in these animals conveys odorous impressions to the part in
                    which the sense of smell appears to reside. The aperture by which it
                    communicates with the nose is provided with a membranous valve, which prevents
                    the water from entering when the animal expels it by his nostrils.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> of the three semicircular canals the vertical
                    is largest, and obliquely directed forwards and outwards; the second is
                    horizontal and turned outwards; and the third, which, like the first, is
                    vertical, crosses the second, and is turned in the direction opposite to that of
                    the first. The vestibule is small and nearly spherical. The bilocular cone,
                    which is obtuse at the <hi rend="italic">apex,</hi> is situate obliquely
                    backwards and outwards below the inferior part of the cranium. The longitudinal
                    septum consists of two narrow cartilaginous plates connected by a thin membrane.
                    The posterior canal is short, and, as in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi>
                    is separated from the tympanal cavity by the membrane of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fenestra rotunda;</hi> while the anterior, which is larger, communicates
                    directly with the vestibule. The whole of these parts are inclosed, as in the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> in the compact bone of the pyramid.</p>
                <p>The posterior and inferior .walls of the tympanal cavity are formed by part of
                    the occipital bone; the lateral aperture is large, and the cavity superficial;
                    and its anterior part is closed by the posterior superior <hi rend="italic"
                    >cornu</hi> of the quadrilateral bone and a membrane. The inner wall presents
                    the two apertures—the oval or vestibular, and the round or cochlear. In this
                    class, however, while the upper is round or triangular, the lower is distinctly
                    elliptical,—a disposition the reverse of what is observed in man. The Eustachian
                    tube or tympano-guttural canal is entirely osseous. The tympanal cavity contains
                    only one <hi rend="italic">ossiculum,</hi> consisting of two branches; the first
                    attached to the tympanum, corresponding to the <hi rend="italic">malleus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> the second closing by an oval or triangular plate the
                    vestibular aperture, and therefore corresponding to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >stapes</hi> of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia.</hi> By Carus the incus is
                    supposed to be represented by the quadrilateral bone.</p>
                <p>The external <hi rend="italic">meatus</hi> is short, and opened by a simple
                    aperture, while the absence of external ear is compensated by a ring or zone of
                    fine elastic feathers with thin barbs, between which the air passes very easily.
                    In the owl tribe it terminates in a large cavity, the margins of which are
                    covered by a smooth valvular fold of skin.</p>
                <p>The ear of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles</hi> is remarkable for the last
                    appearance of the bilocular cone, and the first of the saccular apparatus which
                    is found in the Fishes. In the crocodile and lizard this part appears, as in
                    Birds, in the shape of a conical tube, divided by a cartilaginous partition into
                    a double canal, one separated by the membrane of the round hole from the
                    tympanal cavity, the other communicating with a membranous sac containing three
                    very small friable stones, not harder than starch. There are also three
                    semicircular canals of considerable size, each forming a large circumference. In
                    the frog and toad, while the three canals form almost a complete circle, the sac
                    contains an amylaceous friable stone; but the bilocular cone is no longer
                    observed. In the salamander, also, in which the three canals form together a
                    sort of equilateral triangle, the sac which is below contains a single
                    amylaceous stone. The same arrangement is observed in the Cartilaginous Fishes,
                    unless that the sac contains two amylaceous stones, nearly oval in shape,
                    suspended in a gelatinous semifluid pulp. In the Osseous Fishes it is a little
                    different. The three semicircular canals terminate in a membranous sac, which is
                    divided by septa into compartments which contain one, two, or three small stones
                    suspended in gelatinous fluid. These minute stones, however, instead of being
                    soft, friable, and amylaceous, as in Reptiles and cartilaginous Fishes, are as
                    hard as rock, and white as porcelain. These parts are situate on the sides of
                    the cranial cavity, and are fixed to it by cellular tissue, vessels, and osseous
                    or cartilaginous processes. This sac, in the fluid of which the extremities of
                    the auditory nerve are distributed, is believed to correspond to the bilocular
                    cone of the higher classes.</p>
                <p>These membranous cavities are contained, in the bony fishes, in the general
                    cavity of the cranium; and while only the middle of the canals is inclosed in
                    the bone of the cranium, the extremities and the sac are quite free. The
                    sturgeon, which belongs to the cartilaginous order, is the first in which the
                    canals are entirely inclosed in the cranial cartilage; but even in this a
                    membrane is interposed between the cranium and sac, which is free. In the ray
                    and shark <hi rend="italic">genera,</hi> again, these organs are entirely
                    inclosed in the cartilage of the head.</p>
                <p>The tympanal cavity, in like manner, is modified, and eventually disappears as we
                    descend in the scale. Though present in the tortoise, crocodile, and lizard
                    tribe, it is superficial and open; it becomes membranous behind in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ranine</hi> tribe, and communicates directly with the back of
                    the mouth; and in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Serpentine</hi> reptiles it entirely
                    disappears, so that the handle of the osseous plate by which the oval aperture
                    is closed is suspended in the soft parts with its free extremity below the skin,
                    near the articulation of the lower jaw. In the lizard tribe, also, the round or
                    cochlear aperture is seen for the last time. In the Cheloniad, for instance, the
                    Batrachoid, and the Serpentine, this aperture disappears, and the oval or
                    vestibular alone is left; and in the salamander both disappear, and there is no
                    communication between the external part of the cranium and the labyrinth. This
                    arrangement is continued in the fishes.</p>
                <p>In the molluscous animals the labyrinthine membrane is a simple sac, globular or
                    ovoidal, containing pulpy matter, in which is suspended a small body, which is
                    osseous in the <hi rend="italic">sepia</hi> and amylaceous in the many-feet <hi
                    rend="italic">(polypus),</hi> in which the filaments of the auditory nerve are
                    distributed.</p>
                <p>Our limits do not allow us to enter into the detailed description of the organ in
                    the other <hi rend="smallcaps">Invertebrated</hi> animals.</p>
                <p>SECT. IV. THE ORGAN OF TASTE.</p>
                <p>Though the sense of taste is seated chiefly in the tongue in animals, yet that
                    organ performs, in all the classes, so important a part as an instrument of
                    prehension, that it cannot with much justice be distinguished by the former
                    title only. In the present section, therefore, we must regard it as one of
                    prehension as well as of taste.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095912" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5912-0027"/>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> the
                    tongue is a muscular organ invested by mucous papillated membrane, supported by
                    a proper bone, the hyoid, which serves as a point of support in its various
                    motions. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ranine Reptiles</hi> it is also muscular,
                    attached to the margin of the lower jaw. In the salamander, however, it is
                    attached as far as the tip, and is movable on the sides only. In the crocodile
                    it is attached so generally, both by tip and margins, that it was long asserted
                    that the animal was tongueless. In the <hi rend="italic">stellio</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">iguana</hi> it is as movable as in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia</hi>; and in the seine and gecko to this property is added that of
                    being biful, or divided by a longitudinal notch into two pointed tips. In the
                    ordinary lizard, tupinambis, monitor, &amp;c. the tongue is remarkable for its
                    great extensibility, and terminates in two long, flexible though
                    semi-cartiiaginous extremities. That of the chameleon is still more extensible,
                    and forms, by a peculiar arrangement of vessels, a cup-like extremity. The
                    tongue of the blind worm <hi rend="italic">(anguis fragilis)</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">amphisbaena</hi> is also biful at the tip. The cartilaginous
                    fishes are void of tongue, while in the bony division of the class this organ is
                    represented by a hard protuberance, attached to the middle branchial bone.</p>
                <p>In some of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> however, the tongue is not
                    exclusively muscular. In the singularly long, extensible, and tortuous tongue of
                    the giraffe, Sir Everard Home describes a peculiar arrangement of vessels, which
                    he represents as a substitute for muscular motion. Though Sir Everard does not
                    appear to understand the exact nature of this arrangement of vessels, all the
                    circumstances tend to •show that it is that denominated erectile. These vessels,
                    from the account given, are large, numerous, and communicate freely; and it
                    would be impossible to discover the reason of such a vascular system, unless for
                    some purpose of this description. <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.</hi> Comp.
                    Anat.) When the tongue is protruded it becomes perfectly black or bluish-black,
                    evidently from the injection and detention of the blood in its elongated and
                    anastomosing veins. By means of this mechanism the giraffe not only elongates
                    the tongue to the distance of about twenty inches or two feet beyond the mouth,
                    but twists it round the soft leafy twigs of the trees on which he feeds. It is
                    not improbable that a similar vascular arrangement exists, though in less
                    degree, in the tongue of the deer, and in the long projectile tongue of the
                    animals of the ant-eater tribe, as the <hi rend="italic">Tamanoir,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Tamandua, &amp;c.</hi></p>
                <p>The erectile arrangement is still more distinctly pre- . sented in the tongue of
                    the chameleon. The researches of Mr Houston of Dublin show that the tongue of
                    this animal consists of two parts,—a prehensile, which is anterior, and provided
                    with a glandular apparatus for secreting the viscid fluid by which its tip is
                    covered, and insects are entangled; and an erectile, which is posterior between
                    the prehensile and the hyoid bone, in the form of a trellis-work of innumerable
                    minute anastomosing bloodvessels, not very dissimilar to those of the cavernous
                    body in animals generally, and inclosing a central tube connecting the
                    prehensile portion to the hyoid bone. The effect of this arrangement is, that
                    when the vascular network is injected with blood, the anterior part of the
                    tongue is rapidly darted out at the insects on which the animal lives. The
                    injection of these vessels, and the consequent projection of the tongue, is not
                    independent altogether of the will of the animal; for the veins by which the
                    blood is returned pass through a slit in the tendon of the internal
                    cerato-maxillary muscles, which are always contracted in order to protrude the
                    hyoid style, and thereby tend, by compressing the veins, to inject the erectile
                    part, and project the’ tongue. <hi rend="italic">(Trans.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    probability found in several of the lizards, the tongues of which, like that of
                    the chameleon, are darted out suddenly, and become of a dark-blue colour at the
                    moment of projection.</p>
                <p>In all the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> the tongue is invested by a
                    papillated muco-villous membrane, in which the papillae are of the same general
                    characters as in man—granular, mushroom-like, or fungiform, tubercular or
                    calycoid, and conical or acuminated. The only differences consist in the size
                    and abundance of the fungiform <hi rend="italic">papillae,</hi> in the number of
                    the calycoid and the mode of their arrangement, and in the shape of the conical
                    papillae and the mode of their termination. In the Ruminants especially, the
                    conical papillae are numerous, long, slightly incurvated, and each terminating
                    in a horny but flexible style slightly incurvated backwards. The tongue of the
                    dolphin and porpoise, examined even by the microscope, presents no distinct
                    conical papillae, but is covered by minute eminences, each penetrated by a small
                    aperture.</p>
                <p>In the tongue of the dog <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> there is a ligamentous
                    substance extended longitudinally from the hyoid bone to the tip of the member.
                    This, which has been vulgarly distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >worm</hi> of the tongue, and has been absurdly supposed to be the seat of
                    hydrophobic <hi rend="italic">rabies,</hi> is merely a central pillar of support
                    for the muscular fibres to act with greater steadiness and effect, and which
                    enables the animal to protrude and expand the tongue in lapping water or other
                    fluids better than he could have otherwise done. A similar central ligament is
                    found in the opossum.</p>
                <p>The tongue of <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> is generally more or less horny,
                    and almost cartilaginous. That of the woodpecker and wryneck is peculiar in
                    consisting of two parts,—a basilar or posterior, loose and fleshy; and an
                    anterior projectile, long, smooth, acuminated, and covered laterally with four
                    or five stiff spines directed backwards, which make the organ a sort of barbed
                    arrow. The soft, loose, or basilar part of the tongue contains the aperture of
                    the glottis; and the surface is covered with minute spines pointed backwards,
                    and each of which is placed in the centre of a fleshy <hi rend="italic"
                    >papilla.</hi></p>
                <p>As a prehensile organ of very singular construction, the trunk of the elephant
                    deserves particular notice; and it cannot be more conveniently introduced than
                    under the present section, since it is used not only to convey food, but drink,
                    into the mouth. The trunk may be described as a cylindrical tubular organ,
                    consisting of integument, a sort of fibro-cartilage, muscles, fat, and a
                    membrane of villous character internally. This tube contains two long canals
                    continued from the nostrils, parallel to the axis of the trunk, and separated
                    throughout by a partition of adipose substance about two fifths of an inch
                    thick. From the extremity to the middle part of the intermaxillary bone, in
                    which the tusks are fixed, these canals are nearer the anterior-superior than
                    the posterior-inferior part of the tube, the latter wall being thickest; and
                    their diameter is the same throughout. At this part they undergo a sudden
                    incurvation, approaching the anterior surface of the intermaxillary bone, and
                    form a semicircular bend with the convexity turned forwards. Here also they are
                    so narrow that, without a muscular effort on the part of the animal to dilate
                    them, fluids could not ascend beyond this point; and hence this forms the only
                    valvular contrivance, either to impede the progress of fluids upwards, or to
                    propel them downwards, at the will of the animal.</p>
                <p>Above this curvature each canal is dilated before the upper part of the
                    intermaxillary bone, and again is contracted where it bends back to enter the
                    bony nostril; and the curvature is protected before by the nasal cartilage,
                    which is oval, convex in the male, and flat in the female.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095925" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5925-0028"/>
                <p>Both canals are lined by a dry, greenish-yellow coloured membrane, marked with
                    superficial intersections <hi rend="italic">(rugae),</hi> inclosing rhomboidal
                    spaces, and some venous branches.</p>
                <p>Though the muscular <hi rend="italic">fasciculi</hi> of the trunk are numerous,
                    they may be referred to two orders,—those forming the substance or inner part of
                    the organ, and those by which it is invested. The former, which are transverse,
                    and cut the <hi rend="italic">axis</hi> in different directions, consist of
                    numerous small muscular packets proceeding in various directions, some running
                    from the inner membrane to the circumference of the tube, others directly from
                    right to left, and others crossing the two former obliquely. All these little
                    muscles are inclosed in cellular tissue, containing white homogeneous fat; and
                    all of them terminate in slender tendons, some of which cross the layers of the
                    longitudinal muscles in their course to the external covering, while others are
                    attached to the internal membrane. Cuvier calculates the number of these minute
                    transverse muscles in the trunk of the elephant to be not fewer than 30,000 or
                    40,000. (Plate XXXVĲ. fig. 13.)</p>
                <p>The longitudinal muscles, which are external, may be distinguished into anterior,
                    posterior, and lateral bundles. The first extend from the anterior surface of
                    the frontal bone, above the nasal bones and cartilages, in parallel bundles,
                    connected by tendinous intersections downwards on the trunk. The posterior
                    extend from the posterior surface and inferior margin of the intermaxillary
                    bones, and form two layers which meet on the median line along the lower surface
                    of the trunk. The lateral muscles form two pairs, one of which, descending
                    between the anterior and posterior muscles to the middle of the trunk, may be
                    regarded as a continuation of the orbicular muscle of the lips, or the
                    representative of the <hi rend="italic">nasalis labii superioris</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> while the other, which is attached to the anterior margin
                    of the orbit, and is expanded over the root of the former, may be supposed to
                    correspond to the <hi rend="italic">levator</hi> of the upper lip.</p>
                <p>The whole of these muscles are supplied by a very large branch of the
                    infraorbital or second branch of the trifacial nerve, which, entering on each
                    side between the lateral and superior muscle, is distributed to the whole of the
                    trunk.</p>
                <p>With such a construction, it is not difficult to understand the numerous motions
                    of the elephant’s trunk. While the longitudinal muscles are employed either to
                    shorten the tube, to bend it upwards or downwards or to the side, or by means of
                    the tendinous intersections to give it peculiar inflections, it is manifest that
                    the transverse ones, which act as antagonists to the longitudinal, may also
                    either dilate or close the canals, or incurvate or alter the direction of
                    particular parts.</p>
                <p>The foot of the <hi rend="italic">Lacerta Gecko</hi> and the house-fly presents a
                    prehensile apparatus of peculiar construction for .walking along surfaces, in
                    opposition to the action of gravity. In the former animal the plantar surface of
                    each toe presents sixteen transverse slits, leading into an equal number of
                    pouches, which by means of appropriate muscles are capable of forming an equal
                    number of <hi rend="italic">vacua,</hi> so that the atmospheric pressure is
                    employed with muscular effort to support the animal in his unnatural position. A
                    similar apparatus is found in the upper surface of the head of the sucking fish
                    <hi rend="italic">(echencis</hi><hi rend="italic">remora)</hi>; and something
                    approaching to it, though less distinctly, in the foot of the walrus. (Home, <hi

                <p>CHAP. IV.—COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE ORGANS OF</p>
                <p>VOICE.</p>
                <p>Under this head our limits allow us to mention very few circumstances.</p>
                <p>In the American long-tailed monkeys <hi rend="italic">(sapajous)</hi> the
                    cuneiform cartilages form, by means of adipose cellular tissue, before the upper
                    extremity of the ventricle of the <hi rend="italic">glottis,</hi> a large
                    cushion like a spherical segment, which, touching that of the opposite side,
                    causes the air to whistle through the canal in its course to the mouth, and
                    occasions the flute-like voice of some of these animals, as the weeper <hi
                    rend="italic">(s. apella)</hi> and the capuchin <hi rend="italic">(s.
                    capucina).</hi> In the howler <hi rend="italic">(s.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >seniculus),</hi> so remarkable for its morning and evening yelling, though the
                    larynx is similar in general characters to that of the common <hi rend="italic"
                    >sapajou,</hi> in having the two rounded cushions before the ventricles, the
                    hyoid bone is arched in the form of a spherical chamber, with a large
                    quadrilateral aperture, and each ventricle opens into a membranous sac, lying
                    between the <hi rend="italic">epiglottis</hi> and the adjoining wing of the
                    thyroid cartilage. The air, which passes between the vocal chords, is therefore
                    partly impelled into this osseous and elastic cavity of the hyoid bone, and
                    probably by its resonance in this situation gives the voice of these animals the
                    deep-toned howl by which they are known in the American forests.</p>
                <p>Among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga,</hi> in the dog the cuneiform cartilages
                    are large, the arytenoid small, the vocal chords well marked, and the ventricles
                    deep. In the feline tribe the anterior ligaments, though destitute of cuneiform
                    cartilages, are thick, and separated from the back of the epiglottis by a broad,
                    deep furrow. The posterior ligaments, though neither free nor sharp-edged, are
                    distinguished from the anterior by an appearance of greater firmness, more
                    regular fibres, and by an intermediate furrow. The approximation of the anterior
                    ligaments towards the <hi rend="italic">glottis</hi> forms a sonorous vault, in
                    which the air may be forcibly vibrated by the posterior. In the bear the
                    cuneiform cartilages assume the shape of styles, and their posterior extremity
                    forms a distinct eminence, not above, but without the arytenoid cartilages,
                    while the ventricles are merely deep fissures.</p>
                <p>The kangaroo has neither cuneiform cartilage, anterior ligament, nor ventricle;
                    and it may even be said to be void of vocal chord, while the margins of the <hi
                    rend="italic">glottis</hi> are much separated in the middle. This arrangement
                    appears to indicate that the animal is almost destitute of voice. In the
                    opossum, in which there is merely a small inferior ligament susceptible of
                    tension, voice is limited to a whistling sound.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,</hi> in which the cuneiform cartilages
                    are completely concealed by the mucous membrane, there is neither superior
                    ligament nor proper ventricle; but an aperture in the lateral wall of the
                    laryngeal membrane, above the vocal chord, leads into a large, oblong, sinuous
                    cavity, situate between this membrane and the thyroid cartilage, and covered
                    chiefly by the thyro-arytenoid muscles, by which it may be compressed; and above
                    the anterior commissure of the vocal chords, or below the base of the <hi
                    rend="italic">epiglottis,</hi> is an aperture on the mesial plane, leading into
                    a cavity below the vault formed by the anterior margin of the thyroid cartilage.
                    This cavity, which may be named the infrathyroid, is superficial in the horse,
                    and its aperture is large; while in the ass, with a small, round aperture, the
                    cavity is large, capacious, and globular in every direction, and allows the
                    latter animal to make his voice re-ecħo in the singularly harsh sound
                    denominated the <hi rend="italic">bray.</hi> Conversely, though the lateral
                    cavities are equally large in both animals, the apertures in those of the ass
                    are small, round, and situate nearer ∖ <hi rend="italic">hz. epiglottis</hi>
                    than the vocal chord, while those of the horse are large, oblong, and situate
                    immediately above the vocal chord on each side. On the latter peculiarity
                    appears to depend the neigh of the horse.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> we recognise neither vocal chords nor
                    <hi rend="italic">glottis,</hi> that is to say, an aperture variable in size ac
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095938" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5938-0029"/>cording to the
                    will of the animal; but the superior part of the <hi rend="italic">trachea,</hi>
                    which represents the larynx, forms a hollow pyramid or funnel, rising into the
                    posterior part of the nostrils, in which only it opens, while on the sides is
                    left a passage for the food. This pyramidal funnel is formed by an elongated
                    triangular cartilage, corresponding to the <hi rend="italic">epiglottis,</hi>
                    attached by membrane to the arytenoid cartilages, which also take the shape of
                    scalene triangles, with the small side connected to the cricod cartilage.
                    Strictly speaking, therefore, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> have no
                    larynx, and probably no vocal organ; and the superior part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">trajchea,</hi> with the nostrils, serves merely to admit the
                    atmospheric air for the purposes of respiration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> are distinguished by possessing not only a <hi
                    rend="italic">glottis</hi> or laryngeal aperture similar to that of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> at the upper end of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >trachea,</hi> but a second, denominated the inferior <hi rend="italic"
                    >glottis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">larynx,</hi> at the lower end, near its
                    bifurcation. The former, which is composed of four cartilages, or six, according
                    as the cricod consists of one or three pieces, on the middle of the posterior
                    part of which is a small round bone, articulated with two oblong longitudinal
                    bones, parallel, and forming between them in the posterior wall of the windpipe
                    a longitudinal slit, susceptible of approximation by means of muscles, is
                    intended merely to regulate the admission of air into the windpipe, or its
                    expulsion from that tube, and to close more or less accurately its superior
                    orifice.</p>
                <p>The inferior larynx consists of a membrane projecting from each side of the
                    inferior aperture of the <hi rend="italic">trachea.</hi> This aperture is
                    divided into two, occasionally by an osseous anterior-posterior middle bar,
                    occasionally by the angle at which the two bronchial tubes unite. Since the
                    first bronchial arc has the same curvature as the last tracheal ring, the second
                    and third, which are arcs of larger circles, are less convex without, but more
                    prominent within, than the former. Over this prominence the tracheobronchial
                    membrane forms a fold, which, half closing on each side the inferior tracheal
                    aperture, forms a plate susceptible of vibrating by the motion of the air, and
                    producing sound. This apparatus, which constitutes what is named the <hi
                    rend="italic">inferior larynx,</hi> or rather <hi rend="italic">glottis,</hi> is
                    of two kinds, one void of proper muscles, the other provided with muscles.</p>
                <p>In the former kind of larynx the state of the glottis is altered only by those
                    muscles which depress and elevate the trachea. The depressors are two pairs, the
                    sternotracheal and the glosso-tracheal, the latter attached to the bifurcated
                    bone and <hi rend="italic">trachea.</hi> There are no proper elevators; but the
                    windpipe is raised by the mylo-hyoid muscle through the ligaments which connect
                    the hyoid bone to the superior larynx. In the quiescent or relaxed state, and
                    while the trachea is depressed, the bronchial rings approximate, and the second
                    and third even gliding below the first, the <hi rend="italic">glottis</hi> may
                    be elongated. When the trachea is elevated by these pairs of muscles, the <hi
                    rend="italic">bronchi</hi> are at the same time dragged upwards, and the second
                    and third arcs are separated from the first; and while the external prominence
                    of the glottidal membrane diminishes in length, its tension is augmented. These
                    forms of larynx without proper muscles may yet be subdivided into two sorts, as
                    they have or have not lateral pouches, membranous or osseous. These are observed
                    in the male duck <hi rend="italic">(anas)</hi> and the merganser <hi
                    rend="italic">(mergus),</hi> but never in the female; and to this perhaps the
                    harsh and deep tone of the voice of the male bird is to be ascribed. The larynx
                    without muscles and without pouch is observed in all the gallinaceous order
                    without exception.</p>
                <p>The forriis of larynx provided with proper muscles may be distinguished into
                    three subdivisions.</p>
                <p>The first, which has only one proper muscle on each side, is observed in the
                    whole of the falcon <hi rend="italic">genus,</hi> e. g. the eagle, hawk, falcon,
                    buzzard, sparrow-hawk, and goss-hawk; in the owl <hi rend="italic">genus</hi>
                    and the majority of the waders and swimmers, as the heron, bustard, woodcock,
                    lapwing,, rail, coot, gull, cormorant, and some of the passerine birds. In these
                    birds, in which the motions of the lower ]arynx are necessarily limited, the
                    voice is not variable or extensive in its notes.</p>
                <p>The second form of <hi rend="italic">larynx</hi> has three pair of proper
                    muscles, a <hi rend="italic">constrictor</hi> of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >glottis,</hi> an auxiliary constrictor, and a <hi rend="italic">laxator</hi> or
                    opener of the glottis. This kind of larynx is observed in the whole of the
                    parrot <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> and psittacoid birds generally, as the
                    toucan, macaw, calao, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In the third kind of musculo-membranous <hi rend="italic">larynx</hi> there are
                    no fewer than five pair of muscles, the longitudinal <hi rend="italic"
                    >levator</hi> of the demiannular cartilages, the posterior <hi rend="italic"
                    >levator</hi> of the same cartilages, the small <hi rend="italic">levator,</hi>
                    the oblique <hi rend="italic">levator,</hi> and the transverse <hi rend="italic"
                    >levator.</hi> This quinque-muscular larynx is found not only in all the birds
                    properly named whistlers or warblers, as the nightingale, hedge-sparrow,
                    blackbird, thrush, goldfinch, lark, linnet, canary, chaffinch, &amp;c., but in
                    others whose tones are more monotonous, as the swallow, sparrow, stork,
                    crossbill, &amp;c., and even in some the tones of which are harsh and positively
                    disagreeable, <hi rend="italic">e. g.</hi> the jay, magpie, crow, raven,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The differences remarked in the notes of these three divisions of birds with the
                    quinque-muscular larynx depend not so much on anatomical peculiarities as on the
                    <hi rend="italic">timbre</hi> of their larynx, and on the mobility of the <hi
                    rend="italic">trachea</hi> in relation to the larynx, and on the tracheal
                    membrane having dilatations and contractions.</p>
                <p>On the whole, the inferior larynx of birds is to be regarded in three lights:
                    1⅛Z, As the reed of a wind-instrument, like a hautboy or clarionet, in which the
                    notes vary as the lower glottis varies in its position to the windpipe; 2&lt;∕,
                    as an instrument susceptible of uttering different tones, according to the
                    distance between the mouthpiece and vent, or as the windpipe is elongated or
                    shortened; and, 3d, as an instrument capable of uttering different notes by
                    varying the diameter of the mouth-piece, or as the superior <hi rend="italic"
                    >glottis</hi> is widened or contracted.</p>
                <p>The only bird in which the inferior larynx is wanting is the vulture.</p>
                <p>The vocal organ of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles</hi> consists of the
                    superior larynx only, analogous to that of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia.</hi> This is a cartilaginous apparatus, composed in general of five
                    distinct pieces at least in the large individuals of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Saurial</hi><hi rend="italic">genera,</hi> as the crocodile and alligator, and
                    forming a broad cavity behind, before a narrow slit, bounded by two vertical
                    pillars. The <hi rend="italic">glottis,</hi> however, is entirely membranous;
                    and there are neither vocal chords nor ventricles. There are nevertheless two
                    muscles, one for opening and another for shutting the <hi rend="italic"
                    >glottis.</hi> When these act, and the air is made to vibrate against the
                    anterior pillars, it gives a slight whistling sound only. In the iguana,
                    tupinambis, lizard, tortoise, and serpent, the arrangement of parts is nearly
                    the same; and these animals, therefore, can utter only slight hissing sounds. In
                    the chameleon the pillars are furnished with a tense, vibrating membrane, a
                    fleshy tubercle which contracts the <hi rend="italic">glottis,</hi> and a
                    membranous pouch opening below, between the lower laryngeal cartilage and the
                    first tracheal ring. In the frog tribe, so remarkable for their croaking noise,
                    the vocal chords are large and prominent. The males have also two membranous
                    pouches, opening by a small aperture, not in the larynx, but deep in the lateral
                    part of the mouth. When the frog croaks these pouches are inflated, and swell
                    the skin on each side below the ear. Though these sacs are wanting in the female
                    frog, and toad both male and female, as well as the tree-frog, there is beneath
                    the throat a single pouch on the median plane.</p>

                <p>CHAP. V.—COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY.</p>
                <p>A general view of the nervous systems in different classes of animals shows that
                    the only common part is an azygous tubercle, situate at the anterior extremity
                    of the spinal chord, connected by means of two lateral bundles or peduncles to
                    the rest of the system. This mass, which corresponds to what is denominated the
                    <hi rend="italic">cerebellum</hi> in man, is connected in the vertebrated
                    red-blooded animals with several pairs of tubercles, forming generally a larger
                    mass than itself, and connected to the rest of the system by two longitudinal
                    bundles or limbs, which mingle with and intersect those of the cerebellum. These
                    anterior-superior tubercles, which constitute the brain proper, present numerous
                    modifications in figure, disposition, and magnitude, and even in presence, in
                    the different orders of the animal world.</p>
                <p>In the vertebrated animals the brain or central part of the nervous system
                    consists of the vertebral or funicular portion, named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >spinal chord,</hi> and the cranial or cephalic portion, properly denominated
                    the brain.</p>
                <p>The funicular portion has the shape of a <hi rend="italic">cylinder</hi>
                    flattened on its superior or dorsal and inferior or sternal surfaces. It
                    consists of two similar chordiform productions, united on the mesial plane, and
                    marked at the line of junction by linear longitudinal furrows, of which the
                    superior is most deep and distinct. This, however, which was observed by Blasius
                    in several animals, is denied by Bellingeri, who asserts, from various
                    observations, that though in some parts the superior furrow penetrates more
                    deeply than the inferior, in the general course of the chord the latter is the
                    deepest. <hi rend="italic">( De Medulla</hi><hi rend="italic">Spinali
                    Annotationes</hi><hi rend="italic">AnatomicoPhysiologicae.</hi> Auctore C. F.
                    Bellingeri, Aug. Taurinorum, 1823.) This discordance appears to depend on the
                    circumstance that the sternal or inferior furrow is in truth deeper and more
                    distinct in man, the monkey tribe, and a few <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi>
                    than the dorsal; whereas in most others/ as the coati, raccoon, horse, &amp;c.
                    the dorsal furrow is of the same depth as the sternal; and in the mole, murine,
                    and leporine <hi rend="italic">genera,</hi> it is deeper and more distinct than
                    the sternal. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> and the cartilaginous <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> the sternal furrow is deepest; in Reptiles the
                    dorsal and sternal are nearly equally deep; and in the osseous <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> the dorsal is the deepest. On each side of the
                    chord, also, there is a slight longitudinal depression commonly called the
                    lateral <hi rend="italic">(sulcus lateralis).</hi></p>
                <p>The breadth and thickness of the spinal chord vary in different regions. The
                    lower cervical portion is in general the broadest and thickest; at the upper
                    dorsal region it is somewhat more slender, becoming thicker again at the lower
                    dorsal region; and after again becoming more slender in the lumbar region, it is
                    expanded into a filamentous brush-like termination of different lengths in
                    different classes, and even in different orders. These enlargements at the
                    superior dorsal and lumbar regions are believed by Serres to correspond with the
                    origins of the thoracic and pelvic extremities; and each swelling he represents
                    to predominate over the other, as the animal habitually employs the one or the
                    other kind of members. It is remarkable in illustration of this principle, that
                    in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> which are void, of pelvic extremities,
                    the lumbar enlargement is wanting; and in the amphibious <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia,</hi> the pelvic extremities of which are feeble, this enlargement is
                    also inconsiderable.</p>
                <p>The spinal or funicular brain consists of white cerebral matter on the surface
                    and gray matter in the centre, the former being most abundant, unless in the
                    sacral region, where both are nearly equal in quantity, or the gray rather
                    predominates. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> the gray matter is in
                    greater proportion to the white than in the other three classes, in which the
                    white matter progressively augments.</p>
                <p>The sternal and dorsal longitudinal lines indicate the original formation of the
                    chord in two lateral portions, with an intermediate cavity denominated the
                    spinal canal. This exists only during the formation of the chord in the human
                    foetus, in some of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> when adult, and in the
                    other three classes. Its disappearance in the human foetus, and in that of
                    various <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> is represented by Serres to depend
                    on the progressive deposition of gray cerebral matter on the inner or central
                    surfaces of the component pillars of the chord. Though obliterated in man, in
                    whom the gray matter is abundant, it is not hermetically sealed in the monkey
                    tribe, in which some traces of it are left. In the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Amphibia</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> it is larger than in the
                    monkey tribe; its diameter augments in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Carnivora,</hi>
                    feline, canine, and ursine, in which the gray matter is thinner than in the
                    former; and in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> it is said to be largest
                    of all among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia.</hi> Lastly, in the birds,
                    reptiles, and fishes generally, in which the gray matter is scanty and the white
                    predominates, the spinal canal is large and distinct.</p>
                <p>The lateral regions of the spinal chord are connected with a double series of
                    nerves by means of two rows of nervous filaments, an anterior and posterior,
                    separated by a longitudinal membrane of fine white tissue, with a serrated or
                    festooned border. This membrane, which is named the denticulate, is the same in
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds.</hi> That
                    these nerves do not issue from the spinal chord, must be inferred not only from
                    the phenomena attending the original developement of the nervous system, but
                    especially from what is observed of their comparative size, and that of the
                    chord in the inferior classes. In that of fishes especially, while the chord is
                    small and slender, and by no means fills the vertebral canal, it is remarkable
                    that the nerves which supply the voluntary muscles are exceedingly large. Thus,
                    in many both of the cartilaginous and osseous divisions, as the sturgeon,
                    dog-fish, ray, wolf-fish, cod, &amp;c. the nerves which supply the pectoral fins
                    are large, broad chords, two or three of which seem to contain more substance
                    than the whole spinal chord itself.</p>
                <p>The chord is expanded at its cephalic end into a thick eminence denominated the
                    spinal bulb, the surface of which presents three pairs of eminences. These
                    eminences are developed in various degrees in the different classes and orders.
                    In some of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> the anterior pyramids or
                    pyramidal bodies are more distinct than in man, for instance the ape tribe, the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea, Carnivora,</hi> Ruminants, and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rodentia.</hi> They are small in most Birds, all the Reptiles,
                    and the Cartilaginous <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes.</hi> In the osseous division
                    they assume the appearance of two parallel chords at the base of the brain. The
                    olivary bodies, less prominent in the ape than in man, are still less so in the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> and progressively through the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Amphibia, Carnivora,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Ruminantia,
                    Rodentia,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Insecti-vora,</hi> and the other three
                    great classes of vertebrated animals. Conversely, the restiform bodies or
                    posterior pyramidal eminences, from man through the ape tribe, the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cetacea, Amphibia,</hi> to the Ruminants, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Carnivora,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> increase in size.</p>
                <p>Though the brain of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> presents the same
                    parts, and is arranged nearly in the same order, as that of man, it varies in
                    its proportions to the rest of the body; in its proportions to the <hi
                    rend="italic">cerebellum</hi> and spinal bulb; in general figure; in the
                    presence, absence, and number of convolutions; in the configuration of its
                    central surface; in the communication of its central with its external surface;
                    and in the manner of its connections with the cerebral nerves. As it is
                    impossible in this sketch to examine all <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095964"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5964-0031"/>these circumstances fully, we shall confine our
                    attention to the notice of a few only.</p>
                <p>It is not easy to ascertain the proportion of the mass of the brain to that of
                    the rest of the body. Excluding as much as possible the ordinary sources of
                    fallacy, in small animals the brain is proportionally larger; yet in this
                    respect man is surpassed only by a small number of animals, habitually lean, and
                    with little muscle, as bats, small birds, &amp;c. While the proportion of brain
                    in man to that of the whole person varies from a 22d to a 35th part, that of the
                    monkey tribe varies from a 22d to a 42d part; and in the baboon it is only the
                    104th part of the body. Among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> have in general the largest proportion of brain,
                    and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata</hi> the smallest; and while the hare
                    has a brain about the 300th part of the size of the body, that of the elephant,
                    the most sagacious of animals, is about the 500th part the size of his body. It
                    is also remarkable, that while the brain of the horse is only a 400th part of
                    the size of his body, that of the ass amounts to a 254th part. The Reptile brain
                    becomes excessively small, that of the turtle being rather more than the 5000th
                    part the size of his body; and in some of the Fishes, not all, it appears to
                    attain the maximum of decreasing proportion, that of the tunny being so small as
                    the 37,000th part of his body, while the brain of the earp is so large as to
                    approach the proportion of the elephant. It may be doubted whether, under such
                    circumstances, any precise conclusions can be drawn from results so variable and
                    so little to be expected.</p>

                    >cerebellum</hi> is, excepting in the ease of one species of ape, the <hi
                    rend="italic">saimiri,</hi> greater in man than in any other animal. The ox is
                    equal to man in this respect, and the dog approaches him. The animals most
                    remote are the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> as the beaver, rat, and
                    mouse, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The convolutions, which are so numerous and so deep in man, diminish both in
                    number and size in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Carnivora,</hi> and are nearly obliterated in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rodentia.</hi> In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ungulated</hi>
                    animals, however, and especially in the Ruminants and the horse, the
                    convolutions are numerous; and even in the dolphin among the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> they are numerous and deep. In all the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> the <hi rend="italic">cerebellum</hi> is
                    foliated.</p>
                <p>On the whole, the peculiar character of the brain of man and the ape family
                    consists in the existence of the posterior lobe and digital cavity. The brain of
                    the Zoo-PHAGA is remarkable for the small size of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nates</hi> or anterior pair of the bigeminous eminences in proportion to the
                    <hi rend="italic">testes</hi> or posterior pair. In the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Rodentia</hi> the organ is distinguished for the large size of the <hi
                    rend="italic">nates,</hi> and the want or superficial nature of the
                    convolutions. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ungulated</hi> division of animals,
                    <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata,</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ruminantia,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,</hi> the
                    brain is remarkable for the large size of the <hi rend="italic">nates</hi>
                    combined with the number and depth of the convolutions; while that of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> is remarkable for its height and breadth, and the
                    want of olfactory nerves. It is further to be observed as a general distinction
                    between herbivorous and carnivorous or zoophagous animals, that in the former
                    the <hi rend="italic">nates</hi> are larger than the <hi rend="italic"
                    >testes,</hi> whereas in the latter the <hi rend="italic">testes</hi> are
                    largest. Lastly, Man and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana</hi> are the only
                    animals which possess genuine olfactory nerves. In the other quadrupeds they are
                    represented by the mammillary processes of the ancients; and in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> they have not yet been unequivocally
                    demonstrated.</p>
                <p>The brain of <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> is at once recognised by consisting
                    of six distinct tubercles, two representing the cerebral hemispheres, two
                    representing the optic eminences, one the cerebellum, and one the bulb of the
                    chord. The hemispheres are void of convolutions, but the cerebellum is marked by
                    transverse parallel striae corresponding to the <hi rend="italic">lamince</hi>
                    of the mammiferous brain. There is neither middle band <hi rend="italic">(corpus
                    callosum),</hi> vault, nor <hi rend="italic">septum.</hi> The ceiling or vault
                    of the aqueduct or passage from the third to the fourth ventriele is not, as in
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> surmounted by the bigeminous eminences,
                    but is merely a thin plate corresponding to the valve. Each optic eminence
                    contains a cavity communicating with the others by the Sylvian aqueduct. The
                    anterior eminences <hi rend="italic">(corpora striata)</hi> are not striated
                    with alternate white and gray matter, as in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia.</hi> Between the anterior and the optic eminences are four rounded
                    tubercles, best seen in the ostrich, which are to be regarded as entirely
                    heterologous to the structure of the mammiferous brain, and connecting the
                    cerebral structure of <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> with that of Reptiles and
                    Fishes, in which also these tubercles are observed.</p>
                <p>The Reptile brain is smooth and uneonvoluted. The optic eminences, which are
                    situate behind the hemispheres, are uncovered, and contain a ventriele
                    communicating with the third. At the extremities of the latter are the anterior
                    and posterior commissures, but there is neither soft commissure nor bigeminous
                    eminences. The hemisphere presents an anterior eminence, which, however, in the
                    brain of Birds is unstriated. The cerebral valve is, like that of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> unsurmounted by bigeminous eminences.</p>
                <p>In the class of <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> the structure becomes still more
                    simple. The tubercles of which the brain consists are placed in a row; and their
                    increase in number only demonstrates the decomposition of the organ, and its
                    resolution into simple integrant parts. The two representing the hemispheres are
                    ovoidal, unconvoluted, and contain a ventriele, in which is seen the eminence
                    analogous to the striated bodies. The optic eminences, situate beneath the
                    hemispheres, though small, contain each a cavity, as in the two oviparous
                    classes already noticed. Lastly, there are in several <hi rend="italic"
                    >genera,</hi> under the common vault of the hemispheres, occasionally two,
                    occasionally four tubercles, variable in shape and proportions, but which would
                    be analogous to the bigeminous eminences, were they not, like those already
                    mentioned in <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> situate before and above the optic
                    chambers. In the cartilaginous fishes, in which these tubercles are not
                    observed, the anterior or striated eminences are obliterated. The <hi
                    rend="italic">cerebellum</hi> does not cover the fourth ventriele.</p>
                <p>Behind the <hi rend="italic">cerebellum</hi> are two tubereles, which in the ray
                    give origin to the fifth pair, and are very distinct in the pike, trout, salmon,
                    and perch. These tubereles are peculiar to this class.</p>
                <p>The cavities in the interior of the optic eminences in Birds, Reptiles, and
                    Fishes, are observed in the foetal brain of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia</hi> during its early growth.</p>
                <p>It is almost superfluous to mention, that, in the two warm-blooded classes,
                    Mammalia and Birds, the brain, with its investments, fills completely the
                    cranial and vertebral cavities. In the Reptiles, however, in which the brain
                    does not approach the cranial walls, we remark the first departure from this
                    arrangement; and in the Fishes it is so completely violated that the brain and
                    chord occupy but a small proportion of the cranio-vertebral cavity; and between
                    the former and the osseous walls there is a quantity of fine but very loose
                    filamentous tissue, containing in its cells a large quantity of pellucid fluid.
                    Though this arrangement gives this the appearance of a white jelly-like
                    substance; it is not gelatinous, as is generally represented, but merely a
                    pellucid fluid, sometimes pale straw-coloured, occasionally with a reddish tint,
                    contained in numerous communicating cavities of a tissue which appears to repre∙
                    sent the arachnoid of the warm-blooded animals.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">pia</hi><hi rend="italic">mater</hi> in the reptiles and
                    fishes is reduced to a filamento-vascular web, accompanying the
                    blood-vessels.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> undergoes some peculiar modifications in
                    different orders. In the duckbill a bony plate is contained between the <hi
                    rend="italic">laminae</hi> of the falx; and the same structure is found in the
                    porpoise, perhaps in the other <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea.</hi> An osseous <hi
                    rend="italic">tentorium</hi> with a quadrangular aperture is found in the coaïta
                    and marten, and the feline and ursine families; and an osseous partition
                    consisting of three parts is found in the dog, horse, Cape ant-eater <hi
                    rend="italic">(orycteropus),</hi> the wombat, and the seal. The bony <hi
                    rend="italic">tentorium</hi> îs also found in the woodcock and others of the
                    feathered class. In the red but cold-blooded animals the <hi rend="italic">dura
                    mater</hi> forms neither falciform nor tentorial process.</p>
                <p>On the nerves or ramified chords of the nervous system a few words must suffice.
                    In fishes the tenth or pneumogastric consists not of a common trunk, but of
                    three orders of filaments, the first and largest of which are distributed to the
                    gills, and correspond to the pulmonary nerves of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia</hi>; the second, slender, are distributed to the muscles of the
                    tongue and the surface of the <hi rend="italic">oesophagus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and the third terminate in a large nerve which traverses the body
                    longitudinally immediately beneath the lateral line. The phrenic nerve is
                    wanting in birds, reptiles, and fishes.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusea</hi> the nervous system consists of a number
                    of whitish cerebral masses distributed in different parts of the body, with one
                    or two more conspicuous than the rest, and supposed therefore to represent the
                    brain, placed transversely over the oesophagus, which it encompasses with a
                    nervous collar.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Articulata</hi> the nervous system consists of two
                    long chords extending along the belly, and expanded at various intervals into
                    gangliform knots or enlargements. The first of these, which is situate on the
                    oesophagus, rarely exceeds the others in size. Among the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Zoophytes</hi> hitherto examined the nervous system assumes either a radiated
                    or an arborescent form.</p>
                <p>PART II.</p>
                <p>COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE ENTROPHIC ORGANS.</p>
                <p>CHAP. I. THE LIMITROPHIC ORGANS. SECT. I. THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION. § 1. THE
                    TEETH.</p>
                <p>Though genuine teeth are found in three classes of animals only, viz. the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> the <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes,</hi> yet all the orders of these classes are not
                    provided with teeth. Thus, among the first class, the ant-eater tribe, the
                    pangolin, the <hi rend="italic">echidna</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >ornithorhyncus,</hi> and the whales—among the second the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cheloniads</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> and among the third the sturgeon—are
                    altogether destitute of these organs. In all the invertebrated classes, the
                    jaws, when present, are provided with notches varying in number. The <hi
                    rend="italic">echinodermata</hi> alone have genuine teeth, inserted in a
                    mechanical apparatus very different from ordinary jaws.</p>
                <p>Though in general structure the teeth of the lower animals resemble those of man,
                    in some respects they differ Considerably. These varieties consist either in
                    some change or modification of the constituent parts of the teeth, or in the
                    addition of some other substance to those parts.</p>
                <p>The first variety to be noticed is of the former description.</p>
                <p>Though in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Qüadrumana</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Zoophaga</hi> the bony matter of the teeth is quite similar to that of man, in
                    Other orders this substance appears in the form of a very hard, compact, and
                    more regularly fibrous substance than bone, and to which the name of ivory <hi
                    rend="italic">(ebur)</hi> is applied. It is chiefly in the canine or tearing
                    teeth that this substance is found to represent the bony pillar of the teeth;
                    and it is principally among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata,</hi> and some
                    of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Amphibia</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi>
                    that this change is observed.</p>
                <p>The ivory of the elephant is the most tender, and that which most rapidly becomes
                    yellow on exposure to air. It is readily distinguished from the ivory of other
                    animals by the curve lines which radiate from the centre to the circumference of
                    the tooth in various directions, and which form by intersection regular
                    curvilinear lozenges.</p>
                <p>The ivory of the hippopotamus is greatly harder and whiter, and is on that
                    account preferably employed for the preparation of artificial teeth. A
                    transverse section of this substance shows <hi rend="italic">striae</hi>
                    extremely delicate and regular. In this animal, also, not only the canine but
                    the incisor teeth consist of this substance. The tusks of the Ethiopian boar <hi
                    rend="italic">(sus</hi><hi rend="italic">Aethiopicus)</hi> consist of ivory
                    similar to that of the hippopotamus. In those of the ordinary boar, though no
                    <hi rend="italic">striae</hi> are recognised, there is sometimes a mixture of
                    brown substance disposed in layers. The ivory of the teeth of the morse, though
                    void of <hi rend="italic">stnae,</hi> is compact and susceptible of polish
                    nearly as brilliant as that of the hippopotamus; and its character is, that the
                    central pillar of the tooth consists of minute round grains, indiscriminately
                    aggregated, like pebbles in puddingstone. The axis or pillar of the molar teeth
                    of this animal, which are without internal cavity, consists of similar minute
                    grains. The ivory of the dugong is homogeneous and without <hi rend="italic"
                    >striae.</hi> That of the teeth of the white whale or cachalot resembles the
                    bone of human teeth in its satin-like appearance. The ivory of the tusk of the
                    narwal is very compact and homogeneous in appearance.</p>
                <p>The most singular structure of teeth among quadrupeds is observed in those of the
                    Cape ant-eater <hi rend="italic">(orycteropus).</hi> The teeth of this animal,
                    which have the appearance of two cylinders conjoined, consist of an infinite
                    number of minute straight parallel tubes, so that their transverse section
                    resembles that of a rush. As these tubes are closed only at the triturating
                    surface, it is there only that the tissue of the tooth is compact; and when the
                    enamel is worn, the upper orifices of these tubes begin to be exposed. There is,
                    therefore, no general cavity in the interior of the tooth. These teeth are also
                    void of root. A similar tubular structure is observed in the two molar teeth of
                    the <hi rend="italic">ornithorhyncus,</hi> and in the teeth of some fishes.</p>
                <p>The enamel <hi rend="italic">(lamella</hi><hi rend="italic">vitrea,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cortex</hi><hi rend="italic">striatus)</hi> presents peculiarities
                    in the lower animals, as well as the bone of the tooth.</p>
                <p>While the enamel of the human tooth is confined to the crown, in several of the
                    lower animals, as the morse, it envelopes the tooth all round; and in the molar
                    teeth of this animal, which, indeed, are void of cavity, it is thicker under the
                    root than at the crown. A similar arrangement is observed in the old or adult
                    teeth of the cachalot, which, when their cavity is obliterated by the full
                    deposition of osseous substance, are also covered with enamel below.</p>
                <p>The texture or constitution of the enamel is best seen in the grinders of the
                    elephant. The section of a tooth in the germ exhibits fibres similar to those of
                    asbestos or fine velvet. The fracture of the enamel is more distinctly fibrous
                    than that of the bone, and the fibres are everywhere perpendicular, or nearly
                    so, to the surface of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095990"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5990-0033"/>the tooth. The hardness of this substance may be
                    inferred from the fact that it strikes fire with steel. These component fibres,
                    however, are not always rectilineal. Most frequently they describe curves with
                    the convexity of incurvation towards the crown and the concavity towards the
                    root. This arrangement at least is observed in the ruminants. The distinction
                    between the enamel and bony matter is recognised by a gray line, and another
                    whiter which belongs to the latter substance.</p>
                <p>The enamel varies chiefly in thickness in different animals. The tusks which
                    project from the mouth are generally observed to be less white, less hard, and
                    more similar to bone or ivory than the other teeth; and on this account,
                    probably, the existence of enamel has been denied in the tusks of the elephant.
                    It is nevertheless certain that the external layer of these tusks presents
                    radiating fibres, though it is by no means so hard, or possesses the same grain,
                    as the enamel of the other teeth. Enamel is more apparent, though thinner, in
                    the tusks of the morse, dugong, and boar; and it is quite as distinct in those
                    of the hippopotamus as in the other teeth of that animal. Lastly, the enamel of
                    the teeth of the cachalot, which is very thick, shows in its section only <hi
                    rend="italic">striae</hi> parallel to the surface of the osseous substance.</p>
                <p>Teeth may be distinguished according to the mode in which their component tissues
                    are arranged into three sorts. Isŕ, When the enamel invests the axis all round,
                    and does not penetrate the latter, the tooth is said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >simple (dens simplex).</hi> Such is the character of the human teeth, and those
                    of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana</hi> and Zoo- <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >pnaga,</hi> and several other animals, and all the reptiles. <hi rend="italic"
                    >[ 2d,</hi> When the enamel is folded as it were round the bony part, but
                    without inclosing it, so that the latter forms a continuous band several times
                    folded on itself, and sections of the tooth in every direction divide repeatedly
                    the component substances, the tooth is said to be compound or complex <hi
                    rend="italic">(dens multiplex</hi><hi rend="italic">vel compositus).</hi> A good
                    example of this structure is seen in the grinders of the elephant. 3<hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi>, When the base or root of the tooth is simple, and the
                    folds of the enamel and bone penetrate only to a certain depth, they are said to
                    be semicopound. Examples of this modification of arrangement are seen in the
                    grinders of the ruminating animals.</p>
                <p>In the compound, and part of the seitiicompound teeth, the enamel is covered by a
                    third substance; and as the latter is arranged, especially in the former sort,
                    so as to leave intervals between it and the next layer of enamel, this substance
                    serves to fill all these intervals, and consolidates the component lobes of the
                    tooth even before their osseous parts are united below. This substance, which is
                    denominated by Cuvier <hi rend="italic">cement,</hi> by Tenon <hi rend="italic"
                    >cortex</hi><hi rend="italic">osseus,</hi> and by Blake <hi rend="italic"
                    >crusta</hi><hi rend="italic">petrosa,</hi> though less firm than either bone or
                    enamel, is dissolved by acids more slowly than the former, and sooner becomes
                    black in the fire. In the teeth of the elephant and <hi rend="italic"
                    >cabiai</hi> it forms half their mass at least. In most <hi rend="italic"
                    >genera</hi> it presents no apparent organization, and resembles a sort of
                    crystalline tartar incrusted on the tooth. In the cabiai, however, it presents
                    numerous pores very regularly arranged. Tenon was of opinion that it arose from
                    ossification of the membrane which enveloped the tooth; blake ascribed it to
                    deposition from the opposite surface of the enamel membrane; but Cuvier
                    ascertained that it is deposited by the same membrane and the same surface as
                    the enamel. This accurate observer found, on inspecting the germs of the teeth
                    of the elephant, that when the internal membrane of the dental capsule has
                    deposited the enamel, it undergoes a change of structure, and becomes thick,
                    spongy, opaque, and reddish, to furnish the cement, which is then deposited, not
                    in regular crystalline fibres, but in random drops.</p>
                <p>The teeth of the Reptiles consist of hard, compact, osseous matter, invested by a
                    thin covering of enamel, and without cement.</p>
                <p>The teeth of Fishes vary much in structure. They are either siiŉple or compound.
                    The simple teeth are those which consist of bone invested by enamel. They may be
                    distinguished into two species, according to their mode of attachment. The first
                    are the simple teeth, which are not implanted in <hi rend="italic">alveoli,</hi>
                    but merely attached to the gum, or fixed by articulation to the jaw, as those of
                    the shark tribe; the second are simple teeth growing in alveolar cavities, as is
                    observed in the majority of fishes, the pike, dory, &amp;c. The simple teeth
                    attached to the gum are chiefly distinguished by their fibres intersecting in
                    the manner of the cancellated tissue of bones, and being therefore at first
                    light, porous, and spongy, and becoming afterwards uniformly hard and compact
                    like ivory.</p>
                <p>The compound teeth, which consist of an infinite number of minute tubes mutually
                    aggregated and invested by a common covering of enamel, form plates of different
                    sizes, adhering to the bones of the jaws or palate by an intermediate membrane
                    only. In some they affect the disposition of the quincunx; in others they occupy
                    the whole breadth of the upper jaw at least, as in the ray as seen on the small
                    scale, and in the same manner in larger fishes; others are in straight
                    transverse bars; others assume the shape of a circular segment, or the figure in
                    heraldry denominated the chevron.</p>
                <p>In the wolf-fish the jaws are provided with eminences composed of fibres or tubes
                    proceeding from the base to the circumference, and which are connected to the
                    jaw by a substance more spongy than the rest of the bone.</p>
                <p>After their first formation the teeth retain nearly their original shape in the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga,</hi> man, and the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Quad-rumana.</hi> In the two latter only their crowns begin to be worn,
                    rendering the incisor and canine less pointed by the use of food partly
                    vegetable; but in the zoophagous tribes they undergo no detrition whatever. In
                    the herbivorous animals, however, the crown begins to undergo detrition more or
                    less rapidly; and in no long time the superior layer of enamel is entirely worn
                    off, and the surface of the tooth exposes the succession of bone or ivory,
                    enamel, and cement. These substances are well seen in the teeth of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rouentia,</hi> for instance the hare; those of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata,</hi> as the elephant; the Ruminants, as the stag,
                    sheep, and ox; and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Solldungula,</hi> as the horse. In
                    all these animals the enamel, which is hardest, forms prominent lines or ridges;
                    while the bone and cement are indicated by depressions.</p>
                <p>This detrition, which is purely mechanical, might proceed to such an extent in
                    the herbivorous quadrupeds as to destroy the whole of the crown of the
                    tooth,'and leave the process of mastication to be performed by the jaws only. It
                    appears to be chiefly to obviate this inconvenience that the dentition of the
                    elephant, the Ethiopian boar, and perhaps all the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pachydermata,</hi> is conducted in a successive manner through a series of six
                    or eight sets of teeth at least. In the former animal, in which this process has
                    been best observed, and was ably explained many years ago by Mr John Corse Scott
                    <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.</hi> 1799), each half-jaw, whatever it contains,
                    exhibits at one time only one complete grinder and part of another behind it,
                    the prominent parts of which are placed obliquely to the horizon, forming an
                    inclined plane, so that the anterior parts are worn before the posterior. The
                    anterior complete one, which is employed in mastication, undergoes progressive
                    detrition till its anterior portion is worn down to the level of the jaw. In
                    this state the fangs of the anterior part of the tooth begin to diminish,
                    rendering the tooth narrow before; while the crown of the posterior<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193096003" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6003-0034"/> begins to be
                    worn, and undergoing the same detrition, the posterior fangs also begin to give
                    way. While this process, however, is advancing, the posterior tooth, of which
                    only the anterior part was appearing above the gum, gradually rises, with its
                    crown forming a plane inclined from before backwards, similar to that of the
                    anterior grinder. When this posterior tooth has been raised sufficiently to
                    allow its anterior margin to be used in mastication, the residue of the anterior
                    tooth drops out altogether, and the posterior one continues to rise and advance
                    rapidly, until it is completed, when it is found to be much larger than the
                    previous tooth, and to consist of a greater number of plates of ivory and enamel
                    <hi rend="italic">(denticuli).</hi> In no long time this new tooth, which
                    undergoes the same process of detrition, is succeeded by another one, the
                    anterior margin of which rises first behind the posterior one of its
                    predecessor, and which passes through the same stages of growth, detrition, and
                    shedding. This process is repeated at least seven or eight times, and each
                    succeeding tooth is larger, and contains a greater number of ivory and enamel
                    plates than its predecessor. The elephant has thus 7 or 8 grinders in each
                    half-jaw, or 28 or 32 grinders respectively; yet there are never more than one
                    tooth and part of another, or at most two, that is, eight teeth in the upper and
                    lower jaws, at the same time. Though the disappearance of the fangs of the
                    anterior tooth is ascribed to absorption—which indeed is a good general name—yet
                    the true reason is the fact that the maxillary or dental vessels of the elephant
                    are unable to sustain more than one tooth in each half-jaw at once; and that
                    since these vessels gradually transfer their blood to the new tooth, while those
                    of the old one shrink and are obliterated, the new tooth grows as the old one is
                    actually dehematised or atrophied. The order in which the teeth of the elephant
                    succeed each other is nearly the following. The first or milk grinder, composed
                    of 4 eburneo-vitreous plates <hi rend="italic">(denticuli),</hi> cuts the gum
                    eight or ten days after birth, is well formed in six weeks, and completely out
                    in three months. The second, which consists of 8 or 9 plates, is completely
                    exposed at the age of two years; the third, consisting of 12 or 13 plates, at
                    six years. The fourth to the eighth grinder consist of plates varying in number
                    from 15 to 23; but the period at which these teeth appear has not yet been
                    determined. This process has been shown to have taken place also in the gigantic
                    fossil animal named the <hi rend="italic">mastodon.</hi></p>
                <p>A similar process of displacement and renovation takes place in the poison-teeth
                    of serpents, and in the teeth of the shark, <hi rend="italic">diodon,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">tetraodon</hi> tribes. In the wolffish <hi rend="italic"
                    >(anarrhicas lupus)</hi> the teeth are shed along with the spongy membrane in
                    which they are contained, exactly as the horns of the stag.</p>
                <p>In the horse, in which the process of dentition has been carefully observed, it
                    is usefully employed to determine the age of the animal. The milk incisors
                    appear at the end of 15 days; the four middle ones, or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nippers,</hi> are shed at 30 months; the four following ones at 42 months; and
                    the four external, or the comer teeth, at 54 months. The permanent corner teeth
                    do not grow so quickly as the other incisors; and by these especially the age of
                    the horse is determined. At first they scarcely rise above the jaw. Their middle
                    then presents a hollow filled with blackish tartar, the margins of which are
                    worn down as the tooth rises from the gum, and is rubbed against the
                    corresponding one; and it diminishes progressively from 54 months to 8 years,
                    when it is altogether obliterated. The hollow of the other incisors is
                    obliterated at a later period than that of the corner ones; and the age of the
                    animal is then estimated from the length of the incisors, which continue to
                    increase.</p>
                <p>The first two molar teeth appear in each jaw and on each side about the 8th day,
                    the next at the 20th, and the complementary or small anterior grinder about the
                    5th or 6th month. The first posterior molar appears about the 11th month, and
                    the second in the 20th. At the 30th or 32d month the first two milk grinders are
                    shed, the third in the 3d year; and about the 5th or 6th year the last posterior
                    grinder appears. The milk grinders are longer from before backwards than the
                    permanent ones, which are themselves contracted in this direction, as they are
                    pressed by the posterior grinders; from which it results that the dental crowns
                    of young horses are oblong, while those of the old are quadrangular.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> the teeth are always implanted in the
                    jaw-bones, and never, as in other animals, in the tongue, palate, &amp;c. The
                    only exception to this rule is the <hi rend="italic">echidna.</hi></p>
                <p>The three kinds of teeth, incisor, tearing, and grinder, are found together only
                    in Man, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana,</hi> the Zoop∏AGA, the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata</hi> except the elephant and two-horned
                    rhinoceros, in the hornless Ruminants, and in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Solidungula</hi>; but, of all these animals, in man only are the three forms of
                    teeth arranged in an uninterrupted series, and in such a manner that those of
                    the lower jaw are applied to those of the upper. In one other animal only, now
                    extinct, the <hi rend="italic">anoplotherium,</hi> is this continuity of
                    arrangement observed.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Zoophaga,</hi> and all those in which the canine are larger than the other
                    teeth, there is a gap on each side of the jaw to receive the canine of the
                    opposite one. In the ursine genus there is a large empty space behind each
                    canine tooth. In the hedgehog, shrew, phalanger, and tarsier, in which the
                    canine are shorter than the other teeth, a space is left between them and those
                    opposite. In the maki tribe, proper bat, colugo, and camel, there is a large
                    interval between the upper incisors. Lastly, the Ruminants want the incisors of
                    the upper jaw, and the morse those of the lower.</p>
                <p>Some animals provided with the three classes of teeth lose the incisors at a
                    certain age; for instance several of the bat tribe, and the Ethiopian hog. Other
                    Mammalia have only two sorts of teeth, for instance incisors and grinders,
                    separated by an interval without canine, as the wombat and all the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> in which there are only 2 incisors in each jaw;
                    the kangaroo, which has two below and 6 or 8 above; and the cavy or <hi
                    rend="italic">hyrax</hi> genus, which have 2 above and 4 below. The elephant has
                    grinders and two tusks planted in the superior intermaxillary bone, but no
                    inferior incisors or canine teeth.</p>
                <p>Animals may possess grinders and canine teeth without incisors, as the sloth
                    tribe and the dugong. The grinders, which are most essential, are most rarely
                    wanting; and when others are deficient these are present, as in the armadillo
                    tribe, the <hi rend="italic">orycteropus,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ornithorhyncus,</hi> two-horned rhinoceros, and lamantin. The jaws of the
                    dolphin are provided with uniform conical teeth all round, while the cachalot or
                    white whale has them in the lower jaw only. In the narwal there are only two
                    long spiral tusks implanted in the intermaxillary bone, and of these one is
                    often wanting.</p>
                <p>Lastly, teeth are entirely wanting in the ant-eater tribe, pangolin, and <hi
                    rend="italic">echidna,</hi> which are therefore arranged among the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Edentata.</hi> In the whale the teeth are represented by plates
                    of the laminated, fibrous, bluish substance distinguished by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">whale-bone.</hi></p>

                <p>Under this head ought to be noticed the modification which the salivary glands
                    undergo in the lower animals. Our limited space, however, obliges us to proceed
                    immediately to notice the peculiarities of the other divisions of the alimentary
                    canal.</p>

                <p>§ 3. (ESOPHAGUS, STOMACH, AND INTESTINAL TUBE.</p>
                <p>The muscular tissue of the oesophagus consists, in most of the Mammalia, of
                    spiral fibres twisted in two opposite directions, the external from before
                    backwards, the internal from behind forwards. This arrangement, which was first
                    observed in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ruminantia,</hi> was supposed to explain
                    the process of rumination. This opinion, however, is refuted by the fact that
                    the arrangement is not confined to this order, but is very general among the
                    zoopha~ fous and other animals which do not ruminate. In the angaroo the
                    direction of these fibres is, as in man, transverse in the internal layer, and
                    longitudinal in the external.</p>
                <p>The oesophageal mucous membrane is covered by epidermis, which extends to the
                    cardiac opening of the stomach in man, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana,</hi>
                    and all the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoopha-ga.</hi> This membrane, as well as the
                    mucous, is thrown, by the action of the muscular tunic, into longitudinal folds,
                    which are effaced only when the oesophagus is distended. In the tiger, lion, and
                    lynx, there are large transverse valvular folds, and smaller ones in the civet
                    and couguar— an arrangement connected probably with the carnivorous habit.</p>
                <p>The stomachs of the lower animals vary considerably in shape, in the insertion of
                    the oesophagus, in the disposition of their muscular tunics, and in the
                    simplicity or complication of their cavities. These characters it is impossible
                    in such a sketch as the present to consider in detail; and we shall confine our
                    attention to those peculiarities which are most striking in the digestive organs
                    of the animal world.</p>
                <p>The stomachs of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> may be distinguished into
                    the simple and compound. Those of man, the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Quad-rumana,</hi> zoophagous and most of the herbivorous tribes, belong to the
                    former order. This simple form of stomach, however, may be generally
                    distinguished into two parts, a cardiac and a pyloric, more or less separated
                    from its other by a central transverse contraction of its annular muscular
                    fibres. This is particularly seen in the horse, man, murine family, and many
                    other animals which occasionally feed both on animal and vegetable matter. In
                    the human stomach this contraction is represented in Plate XXXVI. fig. 4. In the
                    porcupine, however, there are three pouches. This contraction depends on a
                    strong annular band of muscular fibres at this part of the organ. In the pure
                    carnivorous animals, however, as the feline family, the annular fibres, which
                    are very thick, are nearly equally so from the cardiac to the pyloric end.</p>
                <p>The compound stomachs, or those which contain more cavities than one, are found
                    in the sloths, and the ruminant and cetaceous animals chiefly.</p>
                <p>In the first tribe the stomach of the <hi rend="italic">Unau,</hi> or two-toed
                    sloth, is two-fold. The first cavity is large and globular, but tapering behind
                    into a conical appendage, separated by a semilunar fold; while a large cul de
                    sac on the left of the <hi rend="italic">cardia</hi> opens into a canal which
                    proceeds at first backwards, and then turning to the right, enters the second
                    cavity by a narrow aperture. The second, which is small, tubular, and folded
                    under the former from left to right, is distinguished by a semilunar fold into
                    two halves, the first of which opens into a small cul de sac on the right side
                    of the first cavity. The inner membrane of both cavities is smooth, and without
                    <hi rend="italic">villi.</hi> A similar arrangement is found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ai,</hi> or three-toed sloth, with this exception, that the
                    appendage of the second gastric cavity is divided into three compartments by two
                    longitudinal bands. This canal seems analogous to the arrangement of the
                    ruminating stomachs, in so far as it may allow the alimentary matters to pass
                    occasionally from the oesophagus directly into the second stomach.</p>
                <p>The stomach of the <hi rend="italic">hyrax,</hi> ashkoko, or Cape cavy, also
                    consists of two pouches, separated by a middle partition, in which there is an
                    aperture for mutual communication. In the hippopotamus the cardia communicates
                    with three pouches, two of which only are cognizable without, and with a long
                    tubular bowel, the interior of which is divided across by several valvular
                    folds.</p>
                <p>In the kangaroo the stomach receives the oesophagus near its left extremity,
                    which is small and biful (Plate XXXV. fig. 8); and forming a larger cavity on
                    the right, passes upwards, making a turn, and crosses to the left before the
                    oesophagus, makes another turn, and again crosses the mesial plane to the right,
                    where it terminates in a tapering cavity at the pylorus. In this course it
                    presents internally a longitudinal band <hi rend="smallcaps">(l, l, D,</hi>
                    extending all round to near the pyloric end, and crossed by valvular membranous
                    folds, which divide the cavity into cells not unlike those of the colon,
                    especially in the horse. The mucous epidermis is continued from the oesophagus
                    over the space marked <hi rend="italic">c, c.</hi></p>
                <p>The stomach of the Ruminants consists of four distinct but communicating
                    cavities. The first, denominated the Paunch <hi rend="italic">(×ofKia, rumen,
                    penula,</hi><hi rend="italic">ingluvies;</hi><hi rend="italic">la panse,</hi><hi

                    double),</hi> is a large bag occupying the left side of the abdomen chiefly,
                    marked externally by two saccular appendages, and separated within into four
                    parts. (Plate XXXV. fig. 1, A, A, <hi rend="smallcaps">a, a.)</hi> Its inner
                    surface, upon which the epidermis is continued, is occupied by flat <hi
                    rend="italic">papillae.</hi> By a pretty wide aperture <hi rend="smallcaps">(b,
                    b),</hi> with rounded margins, this communicates with the second cavity named
                    the Kings-hood (%sx^υpαλoi, <hi rend="italic">reticulum,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >le</hi><hi rend="italic">bonnet),</hi> which is distinguished by the rhomboidal
                    and polygonal cells, into which its inner membrane is moulded. An aperture at
                    the further end of this (c) leads into the third or smallest cavity, termed the
                    Maniplies (sχ∕voς, <hi rend="italic">omasum,</hi><hi rend="italic">le
                    feuillet),</hi> from the numerous concentric crescentic folds formed by its
                    inner membrane (fig. 2, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >p).</hi> These folds amount to about 40 in the sheep and 100 in the ox. The
                    smallest of them, between the aperture from the second into the third cavity,
                    are puckered or collected towards their further end by a transverse membranous
                    fold, which acts as a valve to the aperture between this and the fourth cavity.
                    This one, generally named the Red <hi rend="italic">(yw&lt;srξpv,
                    abomasum,</hi><hi rend="italic">la caillette),</hi> is of an elongated pyriform
                    shape, slightly incurvated on itself (fig. 2, <hi rend="smallcaps">d),</hi> and
                    is marked internally by longitudinal folds (p) incurvated according to the
                    curvature of the cavity itself, and terminating near the pyloric end in <hi
                    rend="italic">rugae</hi> or irregular duplicatures <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(r).</hi> This is the structure of the gastric cavities in the ox.</p>
                <p>In the camel, dromedary, and lama, the stomach is equally complicated, though the
                    structure is a little different. In the first of these animals, which may be
                    taken as an example of the others, the Paunch or first cavity is a large bag,
                    divided into two compartments on the posterior part; by a strong band passing
                    from the right side of the cardiac orifice longitudinally downwards <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(l,l,</hi> fig. 3), and forming one border of a groove leading
                    to the orifice of the second. From the left margin of this band proceed eight
                    muscular bands, nearly at right angles, and intersecting with others, form
                    cellular cavities on the left side of the paunch <hi rend="smallcaps">(n)</hi>;
                    while on the right side there are similar cells, though smaller, and wholly
                    unconnected with the longitudinal band. From the left margin of the cardia, in
                    like manner, proceeds a broad muscular band <hi rend="smallcaps">(μ,</hi> fig.
                    3) to the aperture <hi rend="smallcaps">(b)</hi> of the Paunch into the
                    Kingshood, after which it takes another direction <hi rend="smallcaps">(μ,</hi>
                    fig. 4) towards the Maniplies or third cavity, within the orifice of which it
                    terminates (c, fig. 4). The Red or fourth chamber is much the same as that of
                    the bullock <hi rend="smallcaps">(d, p, r,</hi> fig. 5), and the only
                    peculiarity is, that after terminating in (∏) the pylorus, it opens in a small
                    cavity (o) which leads into the duodenum (∆).</p>

                <p>From this description, for the particulars of which we are indebted to the
                    accurate account of Sir E. Home, it results that the stomach of the camel
                    differs from that of the ox and other horned ruminants chiefly in the possession
                    of the quadrilateral cells in the second stomach. Into these the water is
                    conveyed by the animal when drinking, and in these it remains. By the action of
                    the muscular band <hi rend="smallcaps">(μ),</hi> the aperture between the Paunch
                    and Kingshood is opened, and the water is directed into it so as to fill its
                    cells. When these are filled the surplus runs off into those of the first
                    stomach, where at least those on the left side of the long band may be regarded
                    as part of the general cellular structure. These cells are represented of a
                    large size in fig. 5, in which they appear like oblongs with rounded corners.
                    They are always larger on the left side of the band, in the Paunch, than those
                    in the second stomach.</p>
                <p>Both in the bullock and in the camel, and in all the Ruminants, the first and
                    second stomachs only are covered by mucous <hi rend="italic">epidermis.</hi></p>
                <p>In the Cetaceous animals similar complication of the gastric cavities is
                    observed. In the bottle-nose porpoise, which may be taken as an example, the
                    oesophagus, which is large and capacious, terminates in <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    spheroidal or ovoidal flask-like bag (fig. 6, <hi rend="smallcaps">a, a)</hi>
                    with an aperture a little below the cardiac, consisting of rose-like annular
                    folds, and leading into a second cavity. This, which corresponds to the ruminant
                    kingshood, is nearly spherical in shape (fig. 7, <hi rend="smallcaps">b),</hi>
                    and presents valvular folds more circular than in the ruminants, and intersected
                    by others so as to give it the honeycomb appearance characteristic of this
                    cavity. From this another aperture leads into the smallest cavity of the three
                    (c, fig. 7); and thence into the fourth, which is long, cylindrical, and
                    slightly incurvated. The third cavity is remarkable for presenting in its inner
                    membrane numerous apertures of mucous glands.</p>
                <p>Birds are distinguished by possessing a stomach consisting of three cavities. The
                    first is the crop, which may be regarded as a mere expansion of the oesophagus,
                    and confined chiefly to land birds. It is filled not only with food, but with
                    small stones; and its chief purpose seems, by mechanical comminution, to supply
                    the place of the teeth in dividing the granular aliment, and bruising or killing
                    the animals swallowed. It is found chiefly in the granivorous birds. It is
                    wanting in the ostrich, in the piscivorous birds, and most of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Grallae.</hi></p>
                <p>The second is the glandular crop or subsidiary stomach <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ventriculus</hi><hi rend="italic">succenturiatus, bulbus glandulosus),</hi> a
                    mem-brano-glandular sac, which may be also regarded as an oesophageal
                    dilatation. It is larger when the crop is wanting; and though, when conjoined
                    with it, it is always very glandular, and may be therefore regarded as a
                    chemical solvent of alimentary substances, it appears to supply the want of the
                    crop, which is certainly chiefly a mechanical apparatus. The glandular crop or
                    subsidiary stomach .is remarkable for the number and size of the glandular
                    bodies contained between its mucous and muscular tunics. These glands, though
                    variable in shape, are generally conical; and some consist of several glands
                    conjoined in one common peduncle (Plate XXXVI. fig. 3). All of them are hollow,
                    and secrete a fluid which is discharged by one or more minute apertures, and
                    which is of essential importance in the solution of the food. In some instances,
                    as in the American ostrich (fig. 2), they are few in number, and occupy only a
                    small part of the posterior wall of the oesophagus.</p>
                <p>The gizzard or proper stomach of birds may be considered as a horny mucous
                    membrane, somewhat cartilaginous, .continuous with that of the oesophagus, and
                    covered by two strong thick muscles, the fibres of which converge to a point.
                    (Plate XXXVI. fig. 1.) In the carnivorous and piscivorous <hi rend="italic"
                    >genera</hi> of birds, especially those in which the crop is wanting, the
                    gizzard loses its muscular character, and is converted into a membranous
                    pouch.</p>
                <p>The stomach of <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles</hi> does not present those
                    dilatations observed in <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi>; and when it changes its
                    diameter or capacity, it is only progressively and insensibly. Its general
                    diameter, nevertheless, is proportionally larger than in the two classes already
                    noticed. Most generally without <hi rend="italic">cul de sac,</hi> its shape is
                    spheroidal, more or less oblong; its membranous walls are thin and transparent;
                    its muscular layer almost imperceptible; the cellular identified with the mucous
                    tissue; the situation of the <hi rend="italic">cardia</hi> indeterminate; and
                    the <hi rend="italic">pylorus,</hi> without valve, is distinguished by a simple
                    tapering contraction of the gastric walls, and the appearance of the structure
                    proper to the intestines.</p>
                <p>In this class of animals, further, digestion appears to be less regulated by
                    fixed principles than in the other two. It is evidently not confined exclusively
                    to the stomach. The oesophagus of the turtle is provided with numerous large,
                    firm, pointed processes, which in all probability contribute to the mechanical
                    division of the food, so much the more requisite as the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cheloniad Reptiles</hi> are toothless. Except in the crocodile, the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sau-rial</hi> Reptiles are destitute of large arch or proper
                    cardiac cavity. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ophidial</hi> or Serpentine Reptiles
                    the stomach has the figure merely of a dilated sac between the oesophagus and
                    intestines, and presents no curvature. It is probably in connection with this
                    modification of structure that we find animals remain for days in the oesophagus
                    of serpents; and this tube appears to be to a certain extent capable of
                    digesting aliment as much as the stomach. The best mark of distinction in such
                    circumstances is the cessation of <hi rend="italic">epidermis.</hi></p>
                <p>In no class of animals does the stomach vary more in shape, structure, and
                    situation, than in <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi>; and perhaps the general
                    character of the alimentary canal in this class is most justly given by
                    representing it as deviating from those attributes of regularity which we find
                    in the higher classes. While in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> it is always distinguished by its spheroidal or
                    pyriform enlargement between two tapering extremities, and by being much more
                    dilated than any other part of the alimentary canal, in the Reptile class it
                    begins to part with this character; and it loses it altogether in the Fishes. In
                    most of the finny tribes it is often not more capacious than the oesophagus; and
                    it is distinguished from this tube only by the villous character of its internal
                    membrane. In general, also, the situation of this pyriform dilated sac is
                    transversely across the body in the Mammiferous class. In the feathered tribes
                    this character also is slightly set aside, and partly from the alteration in
                    shape, partly from that of position, the stomach occupies less of the transverse
                    diameter than of the longitudinal extent of the body. Among the Reptiles this
                    character, though still retained in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ciieloniad,</hi>
                    and even in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial,</hi> is gradually enfeebled in the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Ophidial</hi>; and in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi>
                    it may be said to be entirely obliterated, since the organ occupies much more
                    longitudinal extent than transverse width of the body.</p>
                <p>The first character of the alimentary tube of fishes is the width or capacity
                    combined with shortness of the oesophagus. The latter character is manifestly
                    associated with the absence of lungs and consequent want of chest; so that
                    between the throat and abdominal cavity, the interval, which corresponds only to
                    the space occupied by the heart, is extremely abridged. The oesophagus consists,
                    as in the other classes, of a mucous membrane surrounded by a muscular tunic;
                    but the mucous membrane is distinguished by the firmness and whiteness of its
                    corion, which in some <hi rend="italic">genera</hi> approaches to the
                    consistence of horn or cartilage, and by the presence of conical <hi
                    rend="italic">pa-piiloe,</hi> sometimes of great hardness, and which appear to
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096042" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6042-0037"/>act
                    mechanically on the food. It is almost superfluous to notice the facility which
                    the large capacity of this tube affords fishes for swallowing their prey. Most
                    of them ’ are voracious in the extreme; and it is not uncommon to find the
                    stomach and oesophagus crammed to the throat.</p>
                <p>The figure and position of the stomach of Fishes are so variable, that it is
                    difficult to give a character of general application. Though in many <hi
                    rend="italic">genera,</hi> especially of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Jugulares,</hi> it consists of a cylindrical sac with a slight dilatation
                    immediately below the <hi rend="italic">cardia,</hi> in others it is oblong
                    ovoidal, as the ray and shark tribe; and in others, as the sole, dory, and flat
                    fishes generally, it is orbicular. In the sturgeon it consists of a cylindrical
                    tube incurvated twice on itself. In none is there more than one <hi
                    rend="italic">cul de sac,</hi> the depth of which varies as the part
                    corresponding to the <hi rend="italic">pylorus</hi> is more or less remote from
                    the <hi rend="italic">fundus.</hi> When the limits of the stomach are
                    indistinct, the situation of the cardia įs equally so. In the lamprey <hi
                    rend="italic">(petromyzon)</hi> and pen-fish <hi rend="italic"
                    >(syngnathus</hi><hi rend="italic">pelagicus)</hi> the whole tube is of a
                    -uniform size from the mouth to the anus; and much the same may be said of the
                    carp genus. The genera in which it forms a distinct dilatation or cul de sac are
                    chiefly the following; the eel <hi rend="italic">(muraena</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >anguilla),</hi> conger <hi rend="italic">(ni.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">Bagre.</hi> In the anableps the dilatation disappears; and in the

                    it is a large sac incurvated in an arch-like bend.</p>
                <p>The intestinal canal in most of the Mammalia is very similar to that of man; and
                    the chief differences of different orders and genera are found in the difference
                    of longitudinal extent either of the whole intestinal tube or the comparative
                    lengths of its several parts.</p>
                <p>From the time of Grew to that of Cuvier, and most <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    modern anatomists, it has been a point of some importance to determine the
                    length of the intestinal tube in relation to that of the body. This comparative
                    length, which is greatest in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> diminishes
                    successively in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds, Reptiles,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Fishes.</hi> It has been occasionally stated by different
                    anatomists, that the intestinal tube is longer, <hi rend="italic">coeteris
                    paribus,</hi> in granivorous than in carnivorous animals, and conversely. When
                    we come, however, to compare the different lengths of this tube in the several
                    tribes, we find that this statement demands modification. In the ape family its
                    length varies from 5 to 8 times that of the body; in several of the <hi
                    rend="italic">lemur</hi> tribe from 4 to 6 times, the smaller length being in
                    this case compensated by the size of the <hi rend="italic">ccecum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and in others of the lemur tribe, <hi rend="italic">e.
                    g.</hi> the <hi rend="italic">lori,</hi> the intestine is only three times the
                    length of the body. Among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Chiroptera</hi> there are two
                    examples of very great contrast in this respect. While the intestine of the <hi
                    rend="italic">noctula</hi> or great bat <hi rend="italic">(vespertilio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">noctula,</hi> Lin.) is the shortest of all the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> and scarcely does more than exceed the length of
                    the animal’s body, that of die roussette <hi rend="italic">(pteropus)</hi> or
                    East India bat, which lives chiefly on vegetable matter, is at least 7 times
                    longer than its body. A similar instance of the meeting of extremes is found in
                    the Marsupial order, in which the marmoset and cayopollin have intestines only
                    2⅜ times longer than the body, while that of the phalanger is more than 11 times
                    longer. In the plantigrade or ursine family, which occasionally live on
                    vegetable matters, the proportional length approaches to that of the ape.</p>
                <p>In the carnivorous animals the intestine, though generally short, varies from 3
                    times to 8 times the length of the body. The former is the proportion in the
                    lion, wild cat, ocelot, couguar, and weasel; and the latter in the hyena. Some
                    of them also vary among themselves. Thus the intestine of the wild cat is
                    greatly less than that of the domestic animal. The proportion is very great
                    among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> in several of which it is 8,
                    10,12, or 16times longer, as in the agouti, than the body of the animal. Among
                    the murine tribe, however, it undergoes a diminution. Among the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi> again, especially the sloth tribe, it diminishes
                    very much, being only about 3∣ times longer than the body in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ai</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Unau.</hi> This brevity is so much
                    the more extraordinary that these animals are void of caecum, and live on
                    vegetable matters; but, in all probability, the duplicature of the gastric
                    cavities· in some degree compensates this deficiency.</p>
                <p>The intestinal tube attains its greatest proportional length in the Ruminant
                    animals, being at least 11 times longer than the body, as in the goat, and 28
                    times longer in the ram. This immense length is supposed to compensate the
                    absence of dilatation in the large intestines, and the small size of the caecum.
                    In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,</hi> again, which are remarkable for
                    the large size*of the caecum, the length of the intestine diminishes much, being
                    8 times longer than the body in the zebra, 9 times in the ass, and 10 times in
                    the horse.</p>
                <p>Lastly, it is a singular circumstance, that in different species of the same
                    genus the comparative length varies much. We have already noticed the difference
                    between the length of the intestine in the wild and in the domestic cat. The
                    wild and tame boar is a similar instance of the same, the intestine being only 9
                    times longer than the body in the former, and so much as 13∣ times in the
                    latter. It is possible that such differences may depend on the different habits
                    of the animal in his wild and domestic condition. This explanation, however, is
                    totally inadequate to account for the difference in the comparative length of
                    the intestinal tube in the Asiatic and African elephant, being 10 times longer
                    than the body in the former species, and only 7 times in the latter. The same
                    may be observed of two animals very closely allied, if not of the same <hi
                    rend="italic">genus,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">echidna</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ornithorhyncus.</hi> The intestine of the former animal is 7 times
                    longer than his body, while that of the latter is only 5 times.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> generally the intestine is shortest among
                    those genera which prey on animals and fish; it varies from twice to five times
                    the length of the body. In the gallinaceous and passerine birds, which live on
                    grains, it is always longer and more capacious than in those which live on
                    animal substances. In the cassowary, which is granivorous with a short
                    intestine, the intestine is divided by contractions into distinct pouches, to
                    compensate for the brevity of the tube. It must be remarked, nevertheless, that
                    in several birds which prey on fishes, * the intestinal tube is proportionally
                    longer than in those which feed only on grain; and the proportional length is
                    not diminished in birds living indiscriminately on animal and vegetable
                    aliment.</p>
                <p>The intestinal tube of the Reptiles is still shorter than that of Birds, and
                    often it does not exceed twice the length of the body. It is longest in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cheloniad,</hi> and shortest in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ranine</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Serpent</hi> tribe. In the tadpole,
                    however, a singular peculiarity is observed. The intestinal tube of the tadpole
                    of a frog is nearly ten times longer than the space between the muzzle and the
                    vent <hi rend="italic">(anus)</hi>; whereas, after the animal has become a frog,
                    the intestine is only twice as long as this space.</p>
                <p>In the class of Fishes the intestinal tube is still shorter and more direct in
                    its course to the vent or outlet. In a few which live chiefly on marine
                    vegetables, for instance some of the <hi rend="italic">chaetodon genus,</hi> it
                    is about six times longer than the body of the animal; and in a few of the carp
                    <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> (viz. <hi rend="italic">cyprinus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">capaeta)</hi> it amounts to ten or twelve times longer than the
                    body. In others, however, of the same genus, for instance the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cyprinus</hi><hi rend="italic">niursa,</hi> it is scarcely as long again,
                    showing here once more an instance of the conjunction of extremes not easily
                    explained.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096055" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6055-0038"/>
                <p>In most vertebrated animals the intestinal tube may be distinguished by natural
                    marks into two divisions, one extending between the pyloric end of the stomach
                    to a part <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> of the tube, where it becomes wider and
                    more capacious; the other from this to the vent or outlet. In some instances,
                    however, this distinction is very obscurely and imperfectly marked. In the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> in which-the distinction is observed, it is
                    indicated by one or more appendages, which, if large, are denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">caeca,</hi> and if slender and long, are termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >vermiform, processes.</hi> Man, the ourang, and the wombat <hi rend="italic"
                    >(phascolomys),</hi> are the only animals which are possessed at once of <hi
                    rend="italic">caecum</hi> and vermiform appendage. In the other genera of the
                    ape tribe, in the maki of the <hi rend="italic">lemur,</hi> in the colugo among
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Chiroptera,</hi> the ichneumon, many of the carnivorous
                    tribe, the opossum and kangaroo, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> except
                    the dormouse, the Cape ant-eater, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata</hi>
                    except the hyrax, the Ruminants, <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Amphibia,</hi> there is only a caecum without vermiform
                    process. The caecum is wanting in the sloths, the bat tribe, the Ursine except
                    the ichneumon, the marten, pine-marten, weasel, &amp;c. the dormouse, and all
                    the Cetaceous animals.</p>
                <p>The presence of caecum or vermiform process, however, is not necessary to
                    distinguish the canal into two portions. The inner or mucous surface of the <hi
                    rend="italic">ileum</hi> is always villous and uniform; and the whole intestine,
                    except its superior or pyloric portion, is convoluted in proportion to its
                    length, and moves about freely in the abdominal cavity; whereas the colon is
                    more or less fixed at different points, it is shorter and more capacious, andits
                    inner membrane is merely mucous without long <hi rend="italic">villi.</hi> A
                    mark equally general is the semilunar duplicature of mucous membrane placed
                    between the ileum and colon, and named the <hi rend="italic">ileocolic</hi>
                    valve. In the sloth and armadillo tribes, which want caecum and vermiform
                    process, this and the slight difference of diameter are the only marks of
                    distinction between the ileum and colon. In all the other <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia</hi> which are destitute of caecum the whole tube is of the same
                    calibre, occasionally diminished towards the vent; and the division into <hi
                    rend="italic">ileum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">colon</hi> is no longer
                    cognizable.</p>
                <p>In all the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> with one caecum, it appears in the
                    form of a production from the large intestine beyond the part at which it
                    receives the <hi rend="italic">ileum;</hi> and though variable in its diameter
                    and structure, it bears a general resemblance to the colon in these respects. In
                    herbivorous animals, and even in some that are omnivorous, as the ape and lemur
                    tribes, it is generally large and puckered by tendinous bands. To this, however,
                    an exception is observed in the Ruminants, in which the caecum is moderate in
                    size and unpuckered. It is small and unpuckered in the kangaroo-rat and wombat;
                    while, conversely, in the colugo and brown phalanger, which are believed to be
                    chiefly zoophagous, it is very large and puckered.</p>
                <p>In the zoophagous animals generally both the <hi rend="italic">colon</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">caecum</hi> are of small calibre, little different from that of
                    the <hi rend="italic">ileum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and both the colon and
                    caecum are destitute of cells or compartments. In herbivorous and several
                    omnivorous animals, on the contrary, the inner surface of the colon is divided
                    by longitudinal and transverse bands into a number of cells or compartments.
                    From this rule, however, there is an exception in the wombat, kangaroo, and the
                    Ruminants. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> the colon is cellular at
                    its commencement only.</p>
                <p>In birds the canal is provided with two <hi rend="italic">caeca,</hi> one on each
                    side, not far from the vent. In the omnivorous and granivorous these <hi
                    rend="italic">caeca</hi> are generally long and capacious. While they are very
                    large in the nocturnal predatory birds, they are either obliterated or wanting
                    in the diurnal predatory birds, in the green woodpecker, the lark, and the
                    cormorant. In the heron, bustard, and grebe, there is a single small one; in the
                    cassowary two very slender; and in the merganser, diver, &amp;c. they are short
                    and thick.</p>
                <p>In all birds the short bowel between the insertion of the, <hi rend="italic"
                    >caeca</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">cloaca</hi> is a little wider and more
                    capacious than those between the <hi rend="italic">pylorus</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">caeca</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and this is the only
                    circumstance which indicates in this class the distinction of the tube into <hi
                    rend="italic">ileum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">colon.</hi></p>
                <p>In the reptiles the intestinal tube is generally void of <hi rend="italic">caeca
                    or</hi> appendage; and the only distinction consists in the one part of the
                    tube, which is long and slender, being joined to another which is short and
                    thick, and in the presence of a semilunar membranous fold at the point of
                    insertion. In the <hi rend="italic">iguana</hi> alone has a genuine <hi
                    rend="italic">caecum</hi> been observed.</p>
                <p>The distinction into small and large intestine, or <hi rend="italic">ileum</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">colon,</hi> is still less obviously observed in the class
                    of fishes. It sometimes happens that the difference of capacity is inverted, and
                    that the calibre of the portion which terminates at the vent is actually smaller
                    than that of the part connected with the stomach. This arrangement is observed
                    in the ray, shark, sturgeon, and even the bichir; in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >syngnathus,</hi> trunk-fish, and <hi rend="italic">balista.</hi> In other
                    instances the diameter is the same throughout; and the only distinction is
                    derived from the anatomical characters of the inner membrane. In the lamprey,
                    sea-devil, rough star-gazer, radiated sole, <hi rend="italic">holocentrus
                    sago,</hi> carp tribe, <hi rend="italic">mormyrus,</hi> and mullet, it is
                    impossible to distinguish the intestine into large and small.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> resemble <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles</hi> in
                    being destitute of <hi rend="italic">caecum</hi> at the junction of the small
                    and large bowel. In many of them, howe-⅛r, there is attached to the intestine,
                    somewhere below the <hi rend="italic">pylorus,</hi> a variable number of small
                    intestines terminating in blind ends, similar in size and structure to the
                    intestine with which they communicate. These tubes, which have been not very
                    happily named <hi rend="italic">pyloric</hi> appendages <hi rend="italic"
                    >(appendices pyloricae),</hi> in so far as they are most frequently connected
                    rather with the part of the bowel corresponding to the duodenum, vary in number
                    from 2, 4, 6, or 8, to 80 or 180 in some genera, and even their number is not
                    the same in different species of the same genus. Thus, while there are 6 in the
                    smelt <hi rend="italic">(salmo</hi><hi rend="italic">eperlanus),</hi> there are
                    68 in the s. <hi rend="italic">lacustris,</hi> and 70 in the salmon <hi
                    rend="italic">(s.</hi><hi rend="italic">salar).</hi> In like manner, though
                    there are 18 in the anchovy, <hi rend="italic">(clupea</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >encrasieous),</hi> there are 24 in the herring <hi rend="italic">(c.
                    harengus),</hi> and fourscore in the shad <hi rend="italic">(c. alosa).</hi> In
                    some, as the cod and pollach, they consist of several large trunks ramified into
                    numerous small ones.</p>
                <p>These appendages, however, are wanting in the cartilaginous fishes with free <hi
                    rend="italic">branchiae,</hi> in most of those with fixed <hi rend="italic"
                    >branchiae,</hi> in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Apodes,</hi> and in several of the
                    thoracic and abdominal order. In the sturgeon and some others they are
                    represented by a series of communicating cavities inclosed in the intestinal
                    membrane, which is covered by a cellulo-muscular tunic and peritoneum (Plate
                    XXXVI. fig. 5), and which assumes the external appearance of a pancreas.</p>
                <p>Among the cartilaginous fishes the brevity and directness of the intestinal tube
                    is compensated by a peculiar disposition of the intestinal mucous membrane. This
                    consists in part of the membrane projecting like a broad fold or process from
                    the inner surface of the intestine, and winding round from the pyloric to the
                    anal or lower extremity (fig. 7 and 8). This, which is denominated the spiral
                    valve, may be easily understood from these figures, which represent the
                    arrangement as it is observed in the shark. In the sturgeon, in which it is
                    found in the last portion of intestine (fig. 6), its peculiarities have been
                    described by the writer of this article in the <hi rend="italic">Wernerian
                    Transactions,</hi> vol. vi.</p>
                <p>In all the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> the intestinal tube terminates in a
                    distinct bowel denominated the <hi rend="italic">rectum,</hi> the mucous
                    membrane of which is continuous with the skin at the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096068" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6068-0039"/>anus. This rule can scarcely
                    be said to be violated in the case of the <hi rend="italic">echidna</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ornithorhyncus,</hi> in which there is an aperture at the lower
                    part for the urine and the semen of the male and the <hi rend="italic">ova</hi>
                    of the female. These anomalous and singular animals form a transition to the
                    mode in which the intestinal tube terminates in the three genuine oviparous
                    classes. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds, Reptiles,</hi> and most of the
                    cartilaginous <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes,</hi> the intestinal tube terminates
                    in an outlet common to it with the urinary organs, denominated generally the <hi
                    rend="italic">cloaca.</hi> In the sturgeon, however, it has been shown, in the
                    paper already mentioned, that there is a distinct urinary outlet; and that
                    consequently this animal cannot be said to have a <hi rend="italic">cloaca.</hi>
                    In the greater part of fishes, while there is one vent for the excrement, there
                    is another common one for the urine, the <hi rend="italic">ova,</hi> and the
                    spawn.</p>
                <p>On the subject of the liver, spleen, and pancreas, it is impossible to enter with
                    any interest in this sketch.</p>
                <p>CHAP. II. SECT. I. THE HEMATROPHIC ORGANS.</p>
                <p>The Mammalia and Birds agree in having a heart consisting of two pairs of
                    chambers, a venous auricle and ventricle, and an arterial auricle and ventricle.
                    The Eustachian valve is often wanting in the Mammalia. It is wanting, for
                    instance, in the lion, bear, and porcupine; while it is broad and muscular in
                    the seal, and assumes a spiral direction along the upper walls of the right
                    auricular sinus in the elephant.</p>
                <p>It was at one time imagined that the aquatic <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi>
                    were distinguished from the terrestrial by the <hi rend="italic">foramen
                    ovale</hi> being open and forming a communication between the two auricles.
                    This, however, is a mistake, at least in the adult animal; for neither in the
                    otter, the seal, nor the porpoise or dolphin, did Cuvier find this aperture
                    pervious; and it may be inferred, that when it is open, it is an anormal remain
                    of the fetal structure. In the <hi rend="italic">ornithorhyncus,</hi> also,
                    according to Sir Everard Home, it is impervious. In the porcupine and elephant,
                    in which there are two anterior <hi rend="italic">venae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cavae,</hi> the blood of the left anterior <hi rend="italic">cava,</hi> which
                    opens in the sinus near the auricoventricular aperture, is conveyed directly
                    into the right ventricle.</p>
                <p>The reptile heart, the first in the cold-blooded division, varies somewhat in the
                    several tribes. In the first three, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cheloniad,
                    Saurial,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Ophidial∕</hi> it consists of two
                    auricles and one ventricle, divided in some instances into communicating
                    chambers. In the Batrachoid family, on the contrary, it always consists of one
                    auricle and one ventricle, the interior of which is unilocular or undivided. In
                    several of the Turtle tribe, among the first family, the ventricle consists of a
                    pulmonary chamber, in which the blood is more particularly directed to the
                    pulmonary artery, and a general or aortic chamber, which is above, and from
                    which the blood is conveyed into the aorta. In the crocodile the ventricle is
                    divided into three chambers, communicating by several apertures. One is inferior
                    and to the right, and communicates with the right auricle by a large aperture
                    provided with two valves. On the left, and before, is the second chamber,
                    receiving the orifice of the left descending aorta. Behind is an aperture
                    leading into the smallest chamber of the three, situate at the middle of the
                    base of the heart, and receiving the common trunk of the pulmonary arteries. The
                    left chamber is above. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ophidial</hi> or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Serpentine</hi> family the ventricle is divided into two
                    chambers, a superior and inferior, separated by an imperfect partition, which
                    allows the two to communicate.</p>
                <p>The heart of the finny tribes is as simple as that of the Ranine reptiles, which
                    indeed constitutes the preparatory step in the descending scale of organic
                    forms. It consists, as in these animats, of two chambers only, an auricle and
                    ventricle. The former receives the blood from the body at large, and transmits
                    it to the ventricle, which is almost in all cases unilocular. From this a single
                    vessel conveys it, not to the body at large, but to the gills, from which it is
                    again collected by several branchial veins.</p>
                <p>Of the blood-vessels of the four vertebrated classes it is superfluous to speak
                    in any detail.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable circumstances are the minute subdivisions which in some
                    classes the arteries undergo previous to final distribution. In the Ruminants,
                    and several of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata,</hi> the branches of the
                    carotid artery, instead of uniting by the communicating vessels, are subdivided
                    into a great number of minute vessels, which form round the pituitary gland a
                    communicating plexus, denominated by the ancients <hi rend="italic">Pete</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mirabile.</hi></p>
                <p>In the slow lemur <hi rend="italic">(lemur</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tardigradus)</hi> Sir A. Carlisle found the subclavian artery, after entering
                    the axilla, divide into 23 arterial cylinders of equal size, and the iliac on
                    the brim of the pelvis into at least 20 equal-sized tubes, which in both cases
                    surrounded the principal artery, reduced to a small vessel, and, proceeding
                    along the extremity, were distributed chiefly to the muscles. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phil. Trans.</hi> 1800.) A similar arrangement, carried to a still greater
                    extent, was found in the <hi rend="italic">Ai</hi> or three-toed sloth, in which
                    the axillary and iliac arteries were divided into about 60 or 65 cylindrical
                    parallel tubes. In the slender lemur <hi rend="italic">(Lemur loris)</hi> these
                    vessels are subdivided into 4 or ô only.</p>
                <p>In Fishes in which the unilocular ventricle sends its blood to the gills only,
                    the heart is pulmonary, and the arterial system is destitute of central
                    impulsive organ. In the sturgeon, which is one of the best examples of the
                    distribution of the arterial system in the finny tribes, the blood, which is
                    distributed in the <hi rend="italic">branchiae</hi> by the large artery, is
                    collected in numerous vessels, which may be regarded as analogous to the
                    pulmonary veins of the warm-blooded classes, but which have thick <hi
                    rend="italic">parietes</hi> like arteries; and these uniting, form a large
                    vessel, which is lodged in a cartilaginous canal formed by the continuous bodies
                    of the <hi rend="italic">vertebrae.</hi> This vessel is further void of
                    compressive or elastic tunics, and the blood moves through it as through an
                    immovable and inelastic tube. From its sides, however, a series of arterial
                    vessels issue, which forthwith assume the usual characters of arterial tubes. In
                    many other fishes the <hi rend="italic">parietes</hi> of the large artery adhere
                    in part to the semi-osseous canal in which it is lodged.</p>
                <p>SECT. II. THE ORGANS OF AERATING CIRCULATION.</p>
                <p>The lungs of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> are in all essential points
                    perfectly similar to those of the human subject.</p>
                <p>The lungs of Birds differ chiefly in not presenting distinct lobules, in having
                    the air-vessels larger and more distinct, in the branchial tubes not becoming
                    quite so small, and in terminating not alone in the pulmonic vesicles, but in
                    perforated parts of the surface of the lungs, which lead into large air-sacs,
                    communicating with all parts of the body, and forming an accessory lung. In the
                    ostrich, which may be taken as a general example, there are four of these cells
                    or aerolabous sacs. The first, which is anterior, extends from the <hi
                    rend="italic">apex</hi> of the chest to the iliac bones, between the first ribs
                    and heart above, and between the lower ribs and a cell which surrounds the
                    intestines. It is divided into four chambers, the first two communicating with
                    the lungs by large apertures, while the fourth opens in the iliac bones. Behind
                    this large sac are two small ones, between the iliac bones and the peritoneal
                    sac. Before it is another small one occupying the lateral regions of the <hi
                    rend="italic">apex</hi> of the chest, and communicating with sacs in the <hi
                    rend="italic">axillae</hi> and neck. Besides these, the stomach, liver, heart,
                    and intestines are surrounded by sacs. All of these communicate by saccular
                    processes with the cavities of the bones. By this peculiar arrangement <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> possess the greatest extent of respiratory surface
                    of all classes of animals.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096081" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6081-0040"/>
                <p>The lungs of Reptiles are distinguished by consisting of large sacs, subdivided
                    by membranous partitions into polygonal cells, which again are subdivided by
                    smaller slips into smaller cells. In these cells the bronchial tubes are not
                    ramified, but divide abruptly in them at the surface of the lung. Some idea of
                    this arrangement may be obtained from the lung of the ordinary land-tortoise <hi
                    rend="italic">(Testudo</hi><hi rend="italic">Groeca,</hi> Plate XXXVII. fig. 1).
                    The sacs or large cells are smaller and more numerous in the turtle (fig. 2);
                    but the general disposition is much the same.</p>
                <p>The young of the Batrachoid family, and several of the water-lizard tribe, are
                    provided with fimbriated or ciliated processes attached to the neck, and which
                    are in all respects similar to the gills of fishes. These gills disappear as the
                    animal grows; and when it assumes the true ranine or reptile character,
                    vesicular lungs like those of other reptiles, and which had continued in a
                    hitherto latent and rudimental state, are developed, and the animal breathes as
                    others of the same tribe.</p>
                <p>A peculiar form of respiratory organ is found in the lamprey or seven eyes, and
                    the two species of hag-fish, <hi rend="italic">(Myxine,</hi> Lin.; <hi
                    rend="italic">Gastrobranchus,</hi> Bl.; and <hi rend="italic">Gastrobrauchus
                    Dombey).</hi> The former has on each side seven apertures leading into
                    cylindrical tubes, in which the branchiae are contained. (Plate XXXVII. fig. 3.)
                    In the two species of hag these tubes are dilated into ovoidal cavities, in
                    which the water is received, and on the membrane of which the branchial vessels
                    are distributed. In this respect, therefore, the hag-fish approaches to the mode
                    of respiration among the cephalopodous <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusea,</hi> in
                    which the <hi rend="italic">branchiae</hi> are inclosed in a cavity. Lastly, in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Aphrodite</hi><hi rend="italic">aculeata,</hi> which may
                    be taken as an example of the respiration of worms, there is a series of tubes
                    like <hi rend="italic">tracheae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bronchi,</hi>
                    proceeding from the surface to the interior, and in which the water containing
                    the air requisite for respiration is received. (Fig. 6.)</p>
                <p>SECT. III.—SECRETORY ORGANS.</p>
                <p>Under this head ought to be described the urinary organs of the four vertebrated
                    classes. Those of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> agree in consisting of
                    kidneys more or less tabulated, ureters or excretory tubes, a reservoir or
                    urinary bladder, and a urethra opening on the same mucous surface with the
                    organs of generation. In the three oviparous classes considerable changes are
                    made. Though in Birds and Reptiles the glandular organs denominated kidneys are
                    left in the shape of aggregated glands with the two excretory tubes, the bladder
                    is withdrawn, and the ureters open in the <hi rend="italic">cloaca.</hi> The
                    only apparent exceptions are the ostrich and cassowary, in which the <hi
                    rend="italic">cloaca</hi> is so organized that it may serve as a bladder or
                    temporary receptacle of the urinary secretion. In the Reptiles the presence of
                    this organ is variable, being found in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Che-loniad</hi>
                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">Batrachoid</hi>; and the iguana, tupinambis, chameleon,
                    stellio, and dragon, among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi> tribe; but
                    wanting in the crocodile, lizard, <hi rend="italic">agami,</hi> gecko, and the
                    whole <hi rend="smallcaps">Ophidial</hi> tribe. In Fishes it is not less
                    variable. While the ray and shark tribe are destitute of bladder, and the
                    ureters terminate in a <hi rend="italic">cloaca,</hi> this receptacle exists in
                    the sea-devil, lump-fish, globe-fish, and others of the cartilaginous
                    division.</p>
                <p>A peculiar secreting organ, deserving notice, is the poison gland of the
                    poisonous serpents. It is a glandular body situate on each side above the upper
                    jaw, behind and below the eyes, with a considerable cavity, which opens into a
                    tang excretory tube, lying along the outer surface of the upper jaw, and opening
                    in the tubular tooth, represented at fig. 17 and 18; and which is movable in an
                    articulation, and may be erected, as in fig. 18, or depressed, as in 16, at the
                    will of the animal. The poisonous serpents are therefore distinguished from the
                    innocuous by the presence of the erectile movable tubular fangs. Fig. 15 is the
                    head of the innocuous, and 16 of the poisonous serpent.</p>
                <p>PART III.—REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS.</p>
                <p>Under this head we mention only the nipple-bag <hi rend="italic"
                    >(marsupium</hi><hi rend="italic">mammillare),</hi> or secondary uterus of the
                    Marsupial animals (Plate XXXa <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> II. fig. 7); the
                    nipples (fig. 8); and the manner in which the foetal animal, in a very imperfect
                    and embryal form, becomes attached by the mouth to the nipples (fig. 10). The
                    <hi rend="italic">Marsupium,</hi> therefore, ought to be regarded, not as a mere
                    pouch in which the young may take refuge after they are grown, but as a
                    subsidiary <hi rend="italic">uterus,</hi> combining the character of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mammoe</hi> of the other orders. «</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> are peculiar in possessing a <hi
                    rend="italic">uterus.</hi> In the other classes this organ is withdrawn, and the
                    ovary (fig. 11) and oviduct alone are left. In the ovo-viviparous animals, as
                    the ovo-viviparous shark, the oviduct (fig. 12) resembles that of the common
                    fowl. In the lower classes the ova are hatched out of the body entirely.</p>
                <p>In the space assigned to this article, it was impossible to treat fully of a
                    subject so extensive as the structure of the animal world; and while the author
                    has arranged its divisions in such a manner as to show in what order it may be
                    most easily and advantageously studied, he has introduced only those topics
                    which are most indispensable, and most require illustration. For more complete
                    details, therefore, he refers the reader to the following works.</p>

                    from the work of Cuvier and the papers of Sir E. Home in the <hi rend="italic"

                    vols. 8vo. The arrangement of this work, in which the author examines the forms
                    of organs as they ascend, from the lowest to the highest classes, diminishes its
                    general interest. 4. <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Comparative Anatomy, in which

                    Home, Bart. Lond. 1823, 6 vols. 4to. This work consists of the papers read by
                    the author at the Royal Society, and published in their Transactions. Though
                    entitled, therefore, <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Comparative Anatomy,</hi> it
                    embraces a much more extensive field, and contains a great number of
                    physiological and pathological papers. This renders it at once rather desultory
                    and prolix. It contains, nevertheless, a-great number of facts illustrative of
                    peculiarities of structure in the animal world; and it is particularly valuable
                    by the number of engravings with which it is embellished. It can scarcely be
                    said to possess any arrangement whatever. 5. <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur
