                <p><label type="entry">AQUATINTA <hi rend="smallcaps">Engraving</hi></label>, so
                    called from its near resemblance to water-colour drawings, is of modern
                    invention, and was much practised about 12 or 15 years ago, since which period
                    it has not been so much in fashion.</p>
                <p>It is performed in a variety of ways; but the most approved is by covering or
                    immersing the copper-plate in a solution of resinous matter, rendered so in
                    rectified spirits of wine, and by working or drawing the object which is wished
                    to be represented, upon the plate, with a prepared pigment, commonly called the
                    bursting ground. These solutions and grounds are made of a variety of
                    substances, described in recipes at the end of this article.</p>
                <p>The work is generally commenced by etching, or tracing the outline upon the plate
                    with an etching needle or other sharp instrument, which being done, and the
                    etching ground removed, the plate must be made particularly clean and free from
                    grease, with whitening and water. The plate is then to be placed in a flat tin
                    or earthen vessel, in an inclined position, and the resinous solution or ground
                    (No. 1, &amp;c.) poured quickly upon it from the top to the bottom, so that the
                    superfluous ground may run off, and be preserved for after-use in a vessel so
                    placed as to receive it. Should the subject to be engraved be a landscape, it
                    will be advisable to allow the ground upon the plate to dry in the inclined
                    position, because the granulation of the shade or tint has a tendency to be
                    closer and finer in proportion as it is nearer the top of the plate; and in this
                    way the sky is represented by the finest grain at the top, and the foreground by
                    the coarsest at the bottom of the plate. Should the subject require an equality
                    of tint or grain, it will be procured by reversing the inclined position of the
                    plate backwards and forwards as quickly as possible after the ground has been
                    poured on it. The spirit of wine will very speedily evaporate, leaving the plate
                    dry, with the ground upon it ready for work; but in order to render it more
                    secure, it may be held over a clear fire, with the back of the plate next the
                    coals until the resin of the ground is a little heated, and so fixed to the
                    plate more completely. Care must, however, be taken, in this operation, not to
                    melt the resinous granulations so much as to cause them to unite into solid
                    masses.</p>
                <p>The design is now to be drawn upon the plate with the bursting ground (No. 10,
                    &amp;c.), exactly in the same manner as any water-colour drawing is set about:
                    every part where a tint is required is to be covered over with the bursting
                    ground, and the lights alone left untouched with it. When this composition is
                    quite dry, take a broad camel»</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193099669" xml:id="kp-eb0703-9669-0316"/>
                <p>hair pencil, such as is used for painting skies, and go over ;the whole surface
                    of the plate with the varnish (No. 13). The plate is now to be surrounded with a
                    border of wax (14), so as to retain the aqua fortis. When the varnish is dry, as
                    much clean water must be poured upon the copper as can be contained within the
                    border wax, and in about 15 minutes the bursting ground will burst open the
                    varnish, and leave the aquatinta ground ready for being bit in with the diluted
                    acid. The bursting away of the bursting ground may be aided with the help of a
                    clean camel-hair pencil or goose-qui∏ feather; but if the composition be
                    properly made this will not be necessary. The plate may now be said to be ready
                    for the first tint being bit in with the aqua fortis, which must be allowed to
                    remain upon it until the shade is seen to be of a proper colour, when the acid
                    must be poured off, and the plate cleaned with water, to prepare it for the
                    second tint; which is to be accomplished in the same manner as described for the
                    first; and thus the greatest softness of shade, and the utmost sharpness of
                    touch in the foreground or sky, may be attained. A pair of bellows may be used
                    to dry the plate more quickly between the bitings with the aqua fortis, and so
                    prevent the copper from becoming corroded by the water. From the description
                    above given, it will be obvious that in some cases the bursting ground will not
                    be required, and that the lights alone will need to be stopped out with the
                    varnish ;—such as in fleecy white clouds, the high lights upon metallic
                    substances, &amp;c.; all which practice will soon suggest to the artist.</p>
                <p>Before we proceed to describe some other modes of performing this operation, we
                    may remark, that when very fine grounds are required, it is customary only to
                    bite in the lightest shades with the first granulation, and then to clean the
                    plate and lay on a second, or even a third and fourth ground, at various stages
                    of the work. But it must be held in mind, that in proportion as. the grounds are
                    multiplied, the granulations are subdivided, and their rich grain lost; while at
                    the same time the work is rendered less serviceable, by its casting off a
                    smaller number of impressions.</p>
                <p>Should the bursting ground not flow on the plate freely, out of the camel-hair
                    pencil, in consequence of the plate being greasy, it may be washed with very
                    weak aqua fortis before commencing. If the weather should be very cold, it is
                    difficult to obtain a good ground; on which account it will be advisable to heat
                    the apartment with a stove to a moderate summer heat.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dust Grounds</hi> are prepared by covering the plate with
                    powders of various mixtures, and fixing them by holding it over a clear fire;
                    and the operation o: biting in the subject with the aqua fortis, and the
                    painting of the objects upon the plate, may be performed in the manner above
                    described, and either with or without the bursting grounds. The powders may be
                    applied to the surface of the copper in a variety of ways. As good a mode as any
                    is to cover over the top of a small box with one or two layers of muslin, and
                    dust the powder through these layers of muslin equally upon it. For this purpose
                    the plate will require to be a little greasy, that the powder may adhere the
                    more readily; and when the whole surface is covered, give the plate a sharp
                    stroke upon the back, that the superfluous particles may be disengaged.</p>
                <p>Madame Prestel’s ground, celebrated for its fineness, is produced in the
                    following manner: The plate is placed with its face upwards in a box, about six
                    inches deep, covered with a lid: at one end introduce through a ein ular hole
                    the small end of a hair-dresser’s powder machine, filled with finely pulverized
                    resin, and work it till the plate is completely covered with the powder, which
                    fix over a clear fire, as already described.</p>

                <p>. All these compositions may be mixed one with another, or even two or three may
                    be combined; and the results, interesting in consequence of the variety of
                    granulations which will be produced, and, as mentioned before', the coarseness
                    and fineness, will vary in proportion to the quantity of spirits which are

                    kind as will make them liquid; set them on the fire until all are well melted,
                    and, when cool, the composition may be used immediately. These two last recipes
                    may be coloured with the same substances as No. 10.</p>
                <p>No. 13. The varnish used for covering over these bursting grounds is common
                    turpentine varnish, thinned down with turpentine to the proper consistency
                    required.</p>
                <p>No. 14. Border-wax is composed of equal parts of shoemaker’s resin and
                    bees-wax.</p>
                <p>. The preceding is the method for prints of one single tint. But if different
                    colours are to be expressed, there will be required as many different plates,
                    each plate having only tĥe part etched upon it which is designed to be charged
                    with its proper colour; unless (as may happen in particular subjects) some of
                    the colours are so distant from each other as to allow the printer room to fill
                    them in with his rubber without blending them; in which case <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193099682" xml:id="kp-eb0703-9682-0317"/>two or more different colours
                    may be printed from the same plate at once. Where different plates are
                    necessary, a separate one, having a pin in each corner, must be provided as a
                    sole or button to the aquatinta plates; and these a <hi rend="superscript">
                    σ</hi> ain must be exactly fitted, having each a small hole in their corners for
                    passing over the pins of the sole; the said pins serving the double purpose of
                    retaining the plates successively in their due position, and of directing the
                    printer in placing the paper exactly on each plate so as not to shift; by which
                    means each tint or colour will be exactly received on its proper place. A
                    landscape or similar subject, however, may be printed off at once in the
                    different proper colours, by painting these upon the plate. In this case the
                    colours must be pretty thick in their consistence; and the plate must be
                    carefully wiped in the usual way after the laying on of each tint, as well as
                    receive a general wipe upon its being charged with all the tints. For more
                    particular information upon this art, see the third edition of Green’s <hi
