                <p><label type="entry">ANTRIM</label>, a maritime county of Ireland, in the province
                    of Ulster, situate in the northern extremity of the island. It presents a
                    considerable line of coast to the Northern Ocean and to the Irish Channel. By
                    the former it is bounded on the north, and by the latter on the east.
                    Carrickfergus Bay, or Belfast Lough, and the river Lagan, on the south-east,
                    divide it from the county of Down, as far to the south as Spencer’s Bridge. To
                    the southwest it has the same county, which, running to a point, meets
                    Loughneagh at Shanport. The winding shores of Loughneagh and Loughbeg form its
                    boundaries on the west, as far as the point where it meets the river Bann;
                    whence this river taking a northern course, inclining west, separates the
                    counties of Antrim and Derry, until it touches the liberties of Coleraine (about
                    3000 acres), which are on the Antrim side of that river.</p>
                <p>This county lies between 54° 26'and 55° 12' north latitude. Its greatest length,
                    from Bengove Head north to Spencer’s Bridge south, is 41 Irish miles; and its
                    greatest breadth, from the Gobbins east to Toome west, is about 24 miles;
                    comprising, according to the latest authorities, 420,999 Irish acres.</p>
                <p>In 1584-5 the county was divided into eight baronies, viz. Dunluce, Glenarm,
                    Toome, Antrim, Belfast, Massereene, Carey, and Kilconway. Of late years all
                    except the two last have been subdivided into half-baronies, called Upper and
                    Lower. There are also smaller divisions, as parishes, granges, manors,
                    constablewicks, townlands or quarterlands. The number of parishes is 72, the
                    townlands amount to 1543. As far as the original names of the latter have been
                    discovered, they are purely Celtic, and expressive of the qualities of the land,
                    or of some other local circumstances. This subdivision is said to have taken
                    place in the 13th century. Several of the granges are extra-parochial, and some
                    of them do not pay tithes.</p>
                <p>The county returns four members to the imperial parliament, viz. two for the
                    shire, and one for each of the towns of Belfast and Lisburn, both of which are
                    close boroughs. Carrickfergus, though within the lower half-barony of Belfast,
                    yet is a county corporate, distinct from the county of Antrim. It is a free
                    borough, and returns one member to parliament.. .In Carrickfergus are held the
                    assizes, elections, and sessions twice every year, for the county of Antrim. The
                    other chief towns are, Ballymena, Ballymony, Antrim, and Larne: sessions arc
                    held in the first three, and also in Belfast. . ?.. <hi rend="subscript">

                <p>The bishopric of Connor comprehends the county'of Antrim and liberties of
                    Coleraine, except the parish of Aghalee, in the barony of Massereene, which is
                    in the diocese of Dromore, and the townland of Ballyscullion-beg, on the Antrim
                    side of the river Bann, attached to that of Derry.</p>
                <p>The interior of the county on the eastern side is mountainous, nearly destitute
                    of plantations, and abounding in bogs, many of which, from their situation,
                    appear irreclaimable. This character also in some measure applies to the
                    northern side; and it is computed that at least 119,136 acres are incapable of
                    improvement. The baronies of Belfast, Antrim, Massereene, and Toome, are the
                    most level and fruitful. A stupendous assemblage of basaltic columns, the
                    Giant’s Causeway, which is described under its own title, is seen on the
                    maritime confines of Antrim; as also Fairhead, and other lofty capes and
                    promontories. These are composed of thousands of prismatic pillars of various
                    dimensions, ranged in successive strata, and so closely connected in some places
                    that a cavity formed in the surface holds water. The principal mountains are.
                    Knocklead, near Ballycastle; Aura, Trostram, Slemish;and Devis, near
                    Belfast.</p>
                <p>Besides basalt, there are found limestone, gypsum, coals, surturbrand or fossil
                    wood, freestone, and marble. The fossil wood, or wood-coal, in most places, as
                    at Ballintoy and Killymorris, is covered with columns of basalt. In burning it
                    emits a disagreeable smell, resembling that of rotten wood. Notwithstanding the
                    compressed state in which it is found, the bark and knots are quite distinct,
                    and the rings denoting the annual growth of the wood may be counted. In some
                    instances the roots of the trees maybe traced. Their heads all lie to the east,
                    and seem as if laid down by a storm. Of the three coal mines which are wrought
                    in Ulster, there are two in Antrim; the one at Ballycastle, the other at
                    Killymorris. The greater quantity of coal raised at Ballycastle is exported; at
                    Killymorris little is raised, except in wet seasons when peat is scarce.</p>
                <p>The rivers of this county are numerous, but in general small. The most
                    considerable are, the Lower Bann, which discharges the waters of Loughneagh into
                    the sea near Coleraine; the Lagan, which falls into the Lough of Belfast; and
                    the Maine, which rises near Ballymony, and disembogues itself into Loughneagh
                    near Randlestown. The other rivers are the Bush, Revel, Braid, Kells-water,
                    Six-mile-water, Crumlin, and Glencavy, none of which is navigable. Near
                    Ballycastle and Rasharkin are chalybeate springs; and there is a salt spring
                    near Carrickfergus. Loughneagh, belonging more properly to the county of Armagh,
                    will be described under that article. It may be proper, however, to notice in
                    this place, that, of the two islands in this expanse of water, Ram Island, from
                    its contiguity to Antrim, is considered as belonging to that county. It contains
                    about seven acres, and is the property of Lord O’Neill, who has erected on it a
                    beautiful cottage.</p>
                <p>Rathlin Island lies off the northern coast of the county, opposite to the town of
                    Ballycastle, from whose quay its nearest point is distant five miles. This
                    island is about five miles in length, and, at a mean, upwards of three quarters
                    of a mile in breadth, divided into 25 quarterlands, and containing 1996 acres,
                    about one fourth of which is arable. Barley is almost the only grain sown, and,
                    with kelp, furnishes their chief exports. In 1802 the island contained 145
                    dwelling-houses, and 1021 inhabitants: in 1821 it had 1080 inhabitants.· On the
                    northern angle of the island are some vestiges of a castle celebrated as having
                    afforded refuge in 1306 to Robert Bruce. Near-this building is a natural cavern
                    called Bruces Cave; at its entrance is a wall of lime and stone, which, had
                    evidently been erected for its defence.</p>
                <p>No regular accounts of the climate of Antrim have been kept except at Belfast;
                    and from these it appea <hi rend="superscript"> ri</hi> that less rain falls
                    here than is generally supposed, the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193099136"

                    years, /being only 24∙700 inches. The greatest height of the barometer between
                    the years 1796 and 1809 was 31 inches, the lowest 28 inches. The greatest height
                    of the thermometer during that period was 78° ∙80, the lowest 25°. The mean
                    temperature of the northern coast of Antrim, near the town of Ballycastle, in
                    latitude 55° 12', as observed in the year 1788, by means of copious springs
                    flowing from limestone soil, was 4b <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>.</p>
                <p>The estates in Antrim are in general freehold, being either immediate grants from
                    the crown, or held under those grants: the only exceptions are the properties
                    held under the see of Connor. Some of the estates are very large. The marquises
                    of Hertford and Donegall, and the Antrim family, possess the fee of the greater
                    part of the county. The estate of the first includes 11 parishes, containing
                    nearly 80,000 English acres. The marquis of Donegall usually lets his lands on a
                    fine for 61 years, or three lives: of late he has also granted many
                    perpetuities. Most of the Antrim estate is let on perpetuity, in lots worth from
                    L.1000 to L.4000 per annum. The other chief proprietors are Lord O’Neill, the
                    countess of Massereene, Colonel Packenham, and Lord Templeton. The estate of the
                    last is only leasehold under the marquis of Donegall. In January 1830 the total
                    number of registered freeholders in this county for L.10 and upwards was 2037:
                    in the same year the anìount of the county cess was L.4l,627. 9s. lid.</p>
                <p>The farms in Antrim are in general small; in the arable districts they generally
                    vary from six to thirty acres, and the average rent is estimated at between 20s.
                    and 35s. the Irish acre. The principal feature in the tillage system of a great
                    part of the county is the potato fallow. The quantity of potato land is commonly
                    regulated by the manure that can be collected: of late years the culture of
                    potatoes has been much increased by the use of lime. After potatoes, wheat or
                    oats are sown; if the latter, two or three crops are successively taken. When
                    the ground is exhausted, potatoes are again planted, or the land is suffered to
                    rest for a year or two, until it is covered with natural grass, in which state
                    it is termed <hi rend="italic">lea.</hi> The sowing of wheat is chiefly confined
                    to the baronies of Belfast, Antrim, and Massereene. In 1763 there was not one
                    flour-mill in the county. Flax is also sown after potatoes, except in the lower
                    or northern part of the county. It bears a very small proportion in the general
                    crop, less being sown than formerly. Flax-seed is rarely attempted to be saved.
                    Of late years a considerable quantity of flax has been imported, chiefly from
                    Holland. In 1830 the quantity of flax-seed imported at Belfast was 5637
                    hogsheads, the greater part of which was sown in the counties of Down, Armagh,
                    and Derry. Barley is also sown in many places, but seldom in large quantities.
                    Die culture of beans is chiefly confined to the parishes of Island-Mag¢e and
                    Cairncastle; they are mostly exported to Scotland. Turnips or vetches are rarely
                    sown. Kail are seldom planted as food for cattle. Sueh is the principal feature
                    of the husbandry of the county of Antrim, which, however, from the improvements
                    made by individuals, admits of many exceptions. This is strikingly exemplified
                    in those districts where the tenants hold leases under liberal landlords there
                    underwoods have been cleared off, bogs or marshes reclaimed into arable lands or
                    meadow, and better and less cumbrous fences erected. Where the tenants hold at
                    will, the lands are usually let at a rack-rent; and the smallest improvement by
                    the occupier is almost certain of promoting a corresponding advance in his rent,
                    of which he rarely receives advice till he waits on the land-aģentoris visited
                    by his bailiff. i .i ‰ j&lt;. <hi rend="subscript"> llj</hi>,&lt; . ·,„ <hi

                <p>The county at present(1830) perhaps possesses less timber than at any formel
                    period. The woods of Portmore and Glenarm have long since yielded to the axe;
                    and the extensive plantings at Antrim, Templepatrick, Bally clare, and
                    Clementshill, have shared a similar fate. Many thriving plantations of trees
                    have, however, been planted of late years near noblemen and gentlemen’s seats,
                    which already ιdd much to the appearance of the face of the country. The
                    plantations of Lord O’Neill at Shaneseastle and Claggan, and those of the late
                    Lord Macartney near Loughguile√ are the most extensive. On the Hertford estate,
                    near Loughneagh, many orchards are planted; which produce valuable varieties of
                    the apple, the greater part of which is sold in Belfast; and considerable
                    quantities are annually exported to Scotland.</p>
                <p>The cattle of Antrim have no feature to distinguish them as being allied to any
                    particular stock. Of late years considerable attention has been paid by
                    gentlemen farmers to the ⅛provement of the breed, by crossing with the Dutch,
                    Leicester, and Ayrshire cattle, which is said to have improved much those kept
                    for milk. In 1827 81,092 firkins of butter were exported from Belfast. Sheep are
                    little attended to, and the few kept are mostly of an inferior kind. Few goats
                    are kept, and those chiefly by cottagers. Pigs are reared and kept in
                    considerable numbers, and on these the small farmers and cotters depend chiefly
                    to make up their rents; so that it is not uncommon to find from two to eight or
                    ten of these animals about each farmer’s house.∙ During the salting season,
                    which may be said to commence in September and end in May, the number brought to
                    market is immense. In the months of November, December, and January, 1826-27,
                    upwards of 71,000 pigs were sold in Belfast, which, taken one with another,
                    weighed 200 lbs., and varying in price from L.l. 12s. to L.2. 14s. per cwt.</p>
                <p>Antrim has long been distinguished for its linen manufacture; but latterly the
                    manufacture of cotton has in some measure supplanted it, especially in the
                    vicinity of the towns of Belfast, Lisburn, Antrim, and Carrickfergus. In 1771
                    there were 441 linen looms at work in Belfast; at present not one is employed.
                    The cotton spinning by jennies was first introduced in 1777 by Robert Joy and
                    Thomas M‘Cabe of Belfast, under the direction of a female spinner from Glasgow.
                    In the following year the latter gentleman also introduced the fly-shuttle. In
                    the year 1800 it was computed that upwards of 13,000 people were <hi
                    rend="italic">directly</hi> employed in the cotton manufacture; and, including
                    all manner of persons occupied in itdn various ways, the number was at least
                    27,000, within a circuit of ten miles, comprehending, however, the towns of
                    Belfast, Lisburn, and Carrickfergus. The number employed in the same space is
                    now probably little short of twice that number. For many years after the
                    introduction of the cotton business, the greater part of the yarn used for
                    warps, and much of the weft yarn, were imported from Manchester or Scotland, *
                    Of late years cotton yarn has been exported from Belfast, though some is still
                    imported, chiefly from Glasgow. In 1790, 39,603,451 lbs. of cotton wool were
                    imported at Belfast; in 1826, 159,999,446 lbs. were imported at the same port,
                    since which time the quantity has increased. In 1800 a weaver commonly earned,
                    at weaving calico, from 10s. to 16s. per week; at present his earnings vary from
                    3s. 6d. to 5s. each week, for which he perhaps works about 17 hours per day.</p>
                <p>The linen manufacture, though now much depressed, may still be considered the
                    staple manufacture of Antrim. It is a peculiarity of this business, as it is
                    ^established in Ireland, that it does not remove the peåsant from the comforts
                    and healthiness of rural life. In Antrim the weaver and the laboùrer of the soil

                <p>Many weavers have small farms, and only employ themselves in weaving during the
                    intervals of their farming occupations; and almost all who pursue this trade
                    possess gardens, and ground for potatoes. Many of the houses have from two to
                    three looms, which cost from L.4 to L.5. 5s. each. Looms are also let out on
                    hire by the year, at about 10s. Boys are hired out to attend looms: when they
                    attend two looms, which is ample work for a boy of 12 or 15 years of age, the
                    wages are about 16s. the half-year, with diet and lodging. A fine web, that is,
                    a 16 or 18 hundred, is commonly woven in ten days or a fortnight. In some places
                    the cloth is chiefly wrought by the flyshuttle. Formerly the wages paid for this
                    work varied from 14s. to 20s.; at present it is less: hence many weavers have
                    become day-labourers. The price of linen yarn is also much reduced: that which
                    formerly sold at !0d. or Is. per hank often brings little more than the half of
                    that price. This is in a great measure owing to the spinning of flax by
                    machinery. Of late, cloth-merchants prefer cloth made from the yarn spun by the
                    hand, and some refuse altogether to buy that made from the machine yarn. The
                    best linen cloth is made in a district commonly called Kells-water, extending
                    from Connor to near Randlestown. Nearly all the yarn wrought in this district is
                    bought in Ballymena, and the cloth is sold in Belfast.</p>
                <p>There are several considerable salmon fisheries on the rivers and coast of
                    Antrim. One at Redbay, near Cush-indall, another at the Point of Tor, near
                    Fairhead; one at Ballycastle; one at Carrickareade; another between it and the
                    Giant’s Causeway, and another at the Bush-foot. The greatest is at the river
                    Bann, at a place called the <hi rend="italic">Cults,</hi> near Coleraine. The
                    price of salmon, when sold in the neighbouring towns, or Belfast, varies from
                    5d. to 10d. per lb. There is also a considerable eel fishery at Toome.</p>
                <p>The antiquities of this county consist of cairns, caves, cromlechs, mounts or <hi
                    rend="italic">forths,</hi> ecclesiastical and military remains, and round
                    towers. There are three round towers standing, viz. Antrim, which is perfect,
                    and 95 feet high; Armoy, about four miles from Ballycastle, which is 44 feet
                    high, part only being standing. Ram Island tower is 43 feet high, a portion
                    having evidently fallen down. Until lately there was also a small round tower at
                    Trumery: it fell in March 1829.</p>
                <p>. In 1712 the number of dwelling-houses in the county of Antrim was 19,268; in
                    1726 their number was 18,916; in 1791 the houses were 30,314, of which 22,353
                    paid for one hearth, and the remainder were returned as inhabited by paupers,
                    being unable to pay that tax. By the population returns of 1813, the county
                    contained 42,258 dwelling-houses and 231,548 inhabitants; by the returns of
                    1821, 46,661 dwelling-houses and 262,860 inhabitants, 125,053 of whom were
                    males, and 137,807 females.</p>
                <p>Antrim has been supposed to contain a greater proportion of Protestants than any
                    other county in Ireland; and of the Protestants a very great proportion are
                    Presbyterians. The greater part of these are in connection with the general
                    synod of Ulster, the others are <hi rend="italic">Remonstrants,</hi> who
                    separated from the synod in 1829; Burghers, Antiburghers, Covenanters,
                    Independents, and a few Moravians. In several parishes, however, a decided
                    majority are Roman Catholics: these parishes are Loyd, Culfeigh-toin, and
                    Duneane. In several other parishes the number of Roman Catholics is also
                    considerable. »</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Antrim,</hi> a town in Ireland, in the county of the same
                    name, situated near the north end of Loughneagh, on the banks of the
                    Six-mile-water, 12 miles north-west of Belfast, and 84 north of Dublin. It gives
                    the title of earl to the noble family of MaeDonnell, and prior to the Union in
                    1800 it was a potwalloping borough, and returned two members to parliament,
                    under the patronage of the Sker-fington family.</p>
                <p>The town has been much improved of late years; and adjoining is the castle of the
                    earl of Massereene, which'' was thoroughly repaired a few years ago. Markets are
                    held each Thursday, and fairs in May and November. In 1821 the town contained
                    476 dwelling-houses and 2489 inhabitants. Near the town is a flour-mill and two
                    paper-mills. On the 7th of June 1798 a smart action was fought in the town
                    between the king’s troops and a large body of rebels, in which the latter were
                    defeated. In this action Lord O’Neill was mortally wounded by a pike.</p>
