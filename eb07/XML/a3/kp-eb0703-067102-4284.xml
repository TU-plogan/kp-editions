                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> division of the globe is distinguished by its vast
                    extent; by the striking character of its interior geography; above all by the
                    stupendous revolutions of which it has been the scene; and, lastly, by the high
                    antiquity of its civilization, of which we can still faintly trace the precious
                    remains. Stretching from the southern hemisphere into the northern regions of
                    perpetual winter, it comprises within its bounds the opposite extremes of heat
                    and cold; all the varieties consequently of the animal and vegetable tribes; and
                    that still more interesting variety which the irresistible law of climate
                    impresses on the human species. The surface of Asia, towering to its height far
                    above the regions of perpetual snow, presents, when superficially examined, a
                    confused mass of lofty mountains, diverging into an endless variety of inferior
                    ridges, apparently without plan or system. But a more attentive survey
                    discloses, amid the bold irregularities of nature, the same order and unity of
                    design in the structure of this great continent, as in all the other works of
                    creation.</p>
                <p>Asia was the earliest abode of the human race; and, when all the other parts of
                    the world were either uninhabited or sunk in barbarism, it was the seat of great
                    empires and of flourishing and splendid cities, of commerce, of literature, and
                    of all the arts of civilized life. But its early prosperity was blighted by the
                    ruthless devastations of war; its populous cities were utterly destroyed, so
                    that .the spot on which many of them stood is now only marked by masses of
                    ruins; their arts and literature have perished; and in such fragments of their
                    writing as still survive, all meaning is buried under the impenetrable veil of
                    an ancient and unknown character. In touching on the various topics which are
                    comprehended under the designation of Asia, it must be remembered that in the
                    following article we are to confine our attention to such general views of its
                    geography, history, institutions, policy, and manners, as will not supersede a
                    more particular description of its various states under their respective
                    designations.</p>
                <p>The name of Asia was at first, applied by Homer and others of the ancient poets
                    and historians to a small district of Lydia, occupied by a tribe called Asiones,
                    who inhabited a city of the name of Asia. The Greeks, gradually enlarging their
                    discoveries in those eastern countries, still retained the original name, until
                    it embraced the whole of Asia Minor and the countries to the east; and it was at
                    last applied to all the vast regions which subsequent discoveries have brought
                    to light.</p>
                <p>The limits of Asia are in some cases marked out by nature, and admit of no
                    dispute; in other parts they are not very clearly defined, and have been
                    differently settled by geographers, according to their own notions of propriety
                    or distinctness. The modem innovation or improvement of erecting the Indian
                    Archipelago and the numerous islands scattered over the Pacific Ocean into a
                    fifth division of the globe, under the title of Australasia, has given rise to
                    some difficulties in fixing the limits of the continent on the south-east.
                    According to some, the Philippines, the Moluccas, the Celebes, Borneo, Java, and
                    Sumatra, should still be included within the boundaries of Asia, leaving on the
                    east the islands of Papua and New Holland to form the western limits of
                    Australasia. Others, however, are for giving the whole Indian Archipelago to
                    Australasia, on the ground that there can be no possible reason for detaching
                    the Philippines and the other islands from the chain of which they evidently
                    form a part, and assigning them to Asia; that they form one entire mass, which
                    presents no natural point of separation; and that on this account the passage
                    between the Philippine Islands and Formosa and the Straits of Malacca
                    constitutes the most natural boundary of Asia on the cast. According to this
                    division, all the islands to the east and south of this line, as far as New
                    Zealand and the Society Islands, would belong to Australasia, the continent of
                    which, or the principal mass of land, would be formed by the immense island of
                    New Holland. But this division, simple and distinct though it may appear, has
                    not been generally adopted by geographers, who have assigned for the western
                    boundary of Asia a line passing from Kerguelen’s Land to the' north-east,
                    cutting off on the west the islands of Timorlaut, Ceram, Mysol, and Salwatty,
                    and on the east the island of Papua or New Guinea, and stopping at the 132d
                    degree of east longitude, at the equator; thus giving to Asia the fertile
                    islands of Sumatra and Java, the great island of Borneo, Amboyna and the Spice
                    Islands, the Celebes Islands, and to the north of the equator the Philippines,
                    the Pelew Isles, the Carolinas, the Ladrones, the isles of Japan, the Kurile
                    Isles, and, beyond the latitude of 50 degrees, the Aleutian or Fox Islands. The
                    other boundaries of Asia are, on the south the Indian Ocean, and on the
                    south-west the Straits of Babelmandib and the Red Sea, separating it from
                    Africa, with which its only point of junction is by the Isthmus of Suez. Asia is
                    divided from Europe towards the west by the Mediterranean, the Archipelago, the
                    Straits of the Dardanelles and of Constantinople, the Black Sea, the Straits of
                    Caffa, and the Sea of Azof. Here this natural boundary ceases; and from the
                    Straits of Caffa to those of Waigatz in the Northern Ocean different boundaries
                    have <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104297" xml:id="kp-eb0703-4297-0672"/>been
                    assumed. Some will have the ancient Tanáĩs, now the Don, to be the natural
                    boundary between the two continents of Europe and Asia. But besides that the Don
                    has too winding a course for this purpose, it soon terminates, and we are then
                    left to find our way to the Northern Ocean by an arbitrary line, which has
                    accordingly been sometimes traced as the western limit of Asia from the mouth of
                    the Don to that of the Dwina in the White Sea. But in all cases a natural is to
                    be preferred to an artificial boundary; and the line which leaves the smallest
                    space to be filled up by the fancy of geographers is surely the best. On this
                    ground the Uralian Mountains, which stretch from the 50th degree of north
                    latitude in a northern direction, to the sea of Kara in the Arctic Ocean,
                    constitute a strongly marked boundary between Northern Asia and Europe; and in
                    order to avail ourselves of this boundary, we must approach the Caspian from the
                    Black Sea; and here, therefore, the line of separation between Asia and Europe
                    will run eastward along the rivers Manitch and Kuma, the first flowing by a
                    westerly course into the north-eastern angle of the sea of Azof, and the second
                    eastward into the Caspian. From the mouth of the Kuma the Caspian Sea will mark
                    the frontier of Asia to the mouth of the river Ural, which, along with the Ural
                    Mountains, will complete the western boundary as far as the Straits ofWaigatz.
                    From these straits the Frozen Ocean, of which very little is known, bounds the
                    northern shores of Asia to Behring’s Straits, which separate the Asiatic from
                    the American continent. From Behring’s Straits the Pacific Ocean extends along
                    the eastern shores of Asia to the Straits of Malacca.</p>
                <p>Asia contains a larger area than any of the other divisions of the globe. Europe
                    is estimated to be 2000 miles in breadth, and nearly 3000 in length; Africa
                    about 4300 miles by 4140; and America about 10,000 miles by the average breadth
                    of 2000. The length of the Asiatic continent, taken obliquely from the Isthmus
                    of Suez to Behring’s Straits, is about 7370 miles; and its breadth from north to
                    south, from Cape Comorin in India to Cape Tai-mura in Siberia, is about 4230
                    miles. Under the 30th parallel, from Suez to Nanking, its length is less than
                    6000 miles; from the Straits of the Dardanelles to Cova it is 6000 miles; and
                    under the polar circle it is about 4230 miles. Asia is not of the same irregular
                    form as America, nor is it, like that continent, broken into two natural
                    divisions of North and South. It forms, like Europe and Africa, one continuous
                    mass of solid continent. It is surrounded on all sides except the west by the
                    sea; and, by the provident economy of nature, it has on this side, for half its
                    length, the two great navigable inlets of the Red Sea, which for the space of
                    1400 miles divides Arabia from Egypt and Abyssinia; and of the Mediterranean,
                    which, penetrating into the land from the west to the depth of nearly 2000
                    miles, and skirting the whole extent of the European and African shores, gives
                    to Asia a sea-coast of nearly 1500 miles in extent, and secures a navigable
                    communication on this side with the Atlantic Ocean, as well as with Africa and
                    Europe. The northern shores of Asia are occasionally irregular and broken, and
                    indented with some deep inlets, which it is useless to enumerate, as they can
                    never, in those frozen regions, be subservient to the purposes of commerce. On
                    the eastern shore there is the sea of Ochotsk, in breadth between 300 and 400
                    miles, inclosed on the east by the peninsula of Kamtschatka, projecting
                    southward to a great length, and running out into the Kurile Islands; and on the
                    west by the shores of Siberia, part of Chinese Tartary, and the island of
                    Saghalien. The islands of Japan, which commence where the Kurile Islands
                    terminate, stretch along the shore for above 600 miles, and inclose between them
                    and the coast of Chinese Taŕ-tary the Sea of Japan. These islands are succeeded
                    as we advance southward by the Loochoo and other islands, by the large island of
                    Formosa, and finally by the Philippines, Celebes, Borneo, Sumatra, Java, and
                    other groups of the Indian Archipelago. Between the islands of Japan and the
                    coast of Corea, which shoots out southward, is the Strait of Corea, 60 miles in
                    breadth; and between the coast of Corea on the east and the Chinese shore on the
                    other, is inclosed the Yellow Sea, which penetrates northward into the land, and
                    forms a deep inlet, which is of great utility to the commerce and navigation of
                    the northern provinces of China. The southern shore of Asia, from Cambodia to
                    the Red Sea, presents an immense waving line, the ocean and the land alternately
                    encroaching on each other, and forming immense bays and gulfs, and peninsulated
                    tracts of land. Thus, on the eastern extremity, the Gulf of Siam is formed by
                    the kingdom of Cambodia on the one side, and on the other by the peninsula of
                    Malacca, the most southern point of Asia; and westward of this peninsula the
                    Indian Ocean, advancing northward, forms the Bay of Bengal, bounded on the east
                    and west by the two great Indian peninsulas. The same Indian Ocean makes another
                    deep inroad into the land, between Arabia on the west and Hindostan on the east;
                    and towards the north-western frontier of Hindostan it forms the two smaller
                    gulfs of Cutch and of Cambay. On the opposite shore it penetrates deeply into
                    the land, and forms the Persian Gulf, which divides the Persian from the Arabian
                    shore, and is 600 miles in length and 220 miles in its greatest breadth, though
                    at the entrance it is not above 55 miles broad.</p>
                <p>The islands of Asia on its southern shore are the Andaman Islands, the Mergui
                    Archipelago, and the Nicoar Isles on the eastern side of the Bay of Bengal; and
                    on the opposite coast of Coromandel the large island of Ceylon. The Laccadive
                    and Maldive Islands lie off the coast of Malabar; and in the Persian Gulf is the
                    celebrated island of Ormuz, formerly the seat of a splendid city and of an
                    extensive commerce. In the Mediterranean are the islands of Cyprus and Rhodes,
                    which belong to Asia.</p>
                <p>The interior structure of this continent is on a scale of peculiar magnificence:
                    its mountains are of stupendous height; and these, together with its great
                    rivers and its vast and boundless plains, impress on the mind the highest
                    conceptions of natural grandeur. America, which vies in some respects with Asia
                    in its imposing aspect, is nevertheless formed on an entirely different plan. It
                    is long in proportion to its breadth; and throughout its whole length, from Cape
                    Pilares in the Straits of Magellan to its northern limits on the Frozen Ocean,
                    runs the vast ridge of the Cordilleras in South America and the Rocky Mountains
                    in North America, which, rising suddenly and abruptly to their height about 200
                    or 300 miles from the Pacific Ocean, but sloping more gradually towards the
                    Atlantic for the space of 1500 or 2000 miles, give to the country its peculiar
                    form and character. Asia, on the other hand, which is a more solid and compact
                    territory, attains its highest elevation towards the centre of the country; and
                    Central Asia is accordingly a vast platform, of an irregular figure, raised to a
                    great height above the surrounding country, and faced on each side with an
                    immense mountain-wall, formed of enormous rocks and peaks, which tower into the
                    regions of perpetual snow.</p>
                <p>The high land which these mountains seem to support on all sides reaches in a
                    direction north and south about 1200 miles, namely, from the 30th to the 50th
                    degree of north latitude; and in length about 2000 miles east and west, from the
                    Caspian Sea to the Lake of Baikal on the north, and on the south from the
                    sources of the Indus to those of the Burrampooter. It is the largest tract of
                    elevated ground which is to be found in the globe, and has been <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193104310" xml:id="kp-eb0703-4310-0673"/>generally distinguished by
                    the appellation of Tartary, being the native country of all those savage tribes
                    which, under the names of Huns, Tartars, Turks, or Mongols, have at different
                    periods desolated the world. It contains generally the extensive country of
                    Thibet, which lies on the northern side of the Himalaya range; Chinese Tartary
                    in the east; and, to the west of the Chinese empire, Independent Tartary, which
                    lies on the northern declivity of the great ridge, and comprehends the countries
                    watered by the Jaxartes and the Oxus, as far west as the Lake Aral and the
                    Caspian Sea; in which are Buckharia, Balk, the cities of Buckharia, Samarcand,
                    Khyvah, &amp;c. and which may be more distinctly pointed out as the country that
                    lies between the frontiers of China on the east, of Persia on the south, and of
                    Russia on the north. The high land of Central Asia constitutes the proper
                    country of Tartary, and is generally of a rude and desolate aspect. It consists
                    of low rocky hills, destitute of vegetation; of extensive arid plains; and
                    occasionally, for the space of 1000 miles, of great deserts of loose sand, which
                    being carried about by the winds, is raised aloft in drifting clouds, as in
                    Arabia and Africa, and adds greatly to the danger of journeying in those
                    inhospitable regions. The cold of winter is piercing and severe, from which the
                    Russian embassy, in their journey to Peking through the deserts of Cobi in 1820,
                    suffered grievously in the month of October, the thermometer being frequently
                    below zero; while in summer the country is often afflicted with longcontinued
                    drought, which burns up the pasture, and occasions great mortality among the
                    cattle, the chief subsistence of the pastoral tribes by whom this region is
                    inhabited.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Timkowski’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Travels of the Russian Mission through Mongolia to
                    China.</hi></p></note> But the uniform dreariness of the scene is at times
                    relieved by flowing rivers, and also by luxuriant meadows, on which the
                    inhabitants feed their flocks, shifting their habitations with the seasons, and
                    wandering over the desert in quest of pasture. The ridges of mountains which
                    encompass and uphold the great central plain of Asia gradually subside, though
                    somewhat irregularly, into lower ridges, with intervening and fertile valleys,
                    and finally into the plains, which spread outward, as from a common centre, to
                    the sea. Thus, on the north of the Altai Mountains we have the vast expanse of
                    the Siberian plains, through which the great rivers, the Irtisch, the Yenesei,
                    and the Lena, roll their lazy currents to the Northern Ocean. On the eastern
                    declivity, which is deversified with some lofty ranges of mountains, stretches
                    out the empire of China, with the extensive regions of Chinese Tartary; and the
                    rivers Hoangho and Yang-tse-Kiang here pursue an easterly course to the Pacific,
                    while the great river Amur is turned towards the north by a ridge of mountains
                    that diverges from the great body of high land. On the south the mountainous
                    ridge of the Himalaya descends into the low country of Hindostan and India
                    beyond the Ganges; while the western crest of mountains, falling to a lower
                    level, forms •the table-land of Persia and the mountainous countries of Western
                    Asia, until, in the south, it finally subsides into the Arabian mountains and
                    plains.</p>
                <p>The southern front of Central Asia overlooks Hindostan and the countries to the
                    east, and consists of the great ridge of the Himalaya or Snowy Mountains, which,
                    commencing near the Burrampooter on the east, run in a direction nearly
                    north-west, as far as the country of Cashmere, forming the magnificent boundary
                    of Bengal on the north. From Cashmere the general direction of the ridge is
                    south-west, as far as the snowy peak of Hindoo Coosh, to the north of Cabul, in
                    long. 69. 12. E. The name of Hindoo Coosh is applied to the whole of this ridge,
                    which declines in its progress westward to a lower level, and is neither so
                    conspicuous among the mountain ridges by which it is surrounded, nor does it any
                    longer present a continued line of perpetual snow. It is crossed by various
                    routes from Candahar northward to Balk, about 50 miles west, where, in the
                    mountain passes, snow is only found for four months in the year. Those
                    mountains, in extending westward to Herat, in long. 62. 15. E., still continue
                    to decline in height, and appear to be lost among the confused masses of the
                    Paropamisan chain.</p>
                <p>For a long period Europeans were but imperfectly acquainted with those
                    interesting regions of interior Asia, and the Andes of America were supposed
                    greatly to exceed in height this mountainous barrier of Hindostan. But since the
                    gradual extension of the British conquests in Central India, several
                    enterprising travellers have ascended these mountainous tracts; and it is now
                    ascertained, from the accurate mensurations of Captain Webb and others, that
                    their loftiest summits exceed the height of any other mountains in the world.
                    The height of the Andes has indeed been underrated, as well as that of the
                    Himalaya range. Chimborazo, estimated by Humboldt to rise 21,440 feet above the
                    level of the sea, was formerly supposed to be the most elevated peak of those
                    mountains. But from subsequent observations made by Mr Pentland, it appears that
                    the summit of Illimani is 24,350 feet, that of Sorate 25,400 feet in
                    height,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> No. c. p. 3G5.</p></note> which is still
                    somewhat inferior to the highest summits of the Asiatic chain, 27 different
                    peaks of which were found from Mr Webb’s corrected observations to range from an
                    altitude of 17,994 to 25,669 feet in the Hindoo Coosh Mountains, which are a
                    continuation of the Himalaya chain to the west. Lieutenant Macartney, who
                    accompanied the British embassy of Mr Elphinstone into Cabul, found one of the
                    highest peaks to rise 20,493 feet above the level of the sea. The elevated
                    tableland of Central Asia was calculated by Captain Webb to stand generally at a
                    level of 15,000 feet. The lofty summits of these stupendous mountains, towering
                    aloft in all their natural majesty, fill the mind of every traveller with
                    astonishment and awe; and the bright outline of white, when it is projected on
                    the deep azure of a cloudless sky, is seen at the prodigious distance of 150,
                    and, according to some, of 250 miles.</p>
                <p>To the south of the main ridges of the Himalaya and Hindoo Coosh the land
                    declines from its height, and presents a lower terrace of mountains, which runs
                    parallel to the great range, and by which, as well as by branches issuing from
                    it, the country is still rendered sufficiently rugged, though there are
                    intervening valleys of great beauty and fertility. In the hilly districts thus
                    formed under the higher mountains are the countries of Assam, Bootan, Nepaul,
                    Kumaon, and Sirenagur. Those lower hills rise with a steep ascent from the
                    plains of Bengal. According to Major Rennell, the southernmost ridge of the
                    Bootan Mountains attains nearly a mile and a half of perpendicular height in a
                    horizontal distance of 15 miles; and, from the summit, the traveller looks back
                    with astonishment on the extensive prospect of the plains beneath him. Where the
                    great range chapges to a westerly direction, near the sources of the Indus and
                    the Ganges, the lower mountains are separated from it by a wider interval, which
                    is occupied by the high valley of Cashmere; and to the south and south-west is a
                    mountainous country, which on the north bounds the Punjaub, or the country of
                    the five rivers, namely, the head streams of the Indus, which were crossed by
                    Alexander the Great in his invasion of India. To the south of those well-watered
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104323" xml:id="kp-eb0703-4323-0674"/> plains
                    extends a tract of sandy desert almost to the Gulf of Cutch on the Indian Ocean.
                    From the Hindoo Coosh Mountains several extensive ranges, though of inferior
                    height, branch off to the south and west, and spread over the country to the
                    west of the Indus as far as the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. Some of
                    these, such as the Soliman range, are still diversified with snowy peaks, though
                    their height gradually declines as they recede from the central high lands of
                    the country.</p>
                <p>At the distance of about 200 miles to the north of the great Himalaya ridge there
                    is another inner range of lofty mountains, which, though it does not rise quite
                    so high as the exterior ridge, runs parallel to it, and is known under the
                    appellation of Mus-tag or Moos Taugh, signifying, in the dialect of the country,
                    Ice-hill. It extends as far as the 67th degree of east longitude; and between it
                    and the main ridge of Himalaya and Hindoo Coosh is inclosed an elevated
                    table-land, extending eastward into Thibet, though it is but little known beyond
                    the meridian of Ladac, in 75. 12. E. The vast deserts of Central Asia are indeed
                    rendered almost inaccessible by the mountain-wall which surrounds them; and
                    hence a comparatively small portion of the country has been explored by European
                    travellers.</p>
                <p>The western crest of the great Asiatic high lands is formed by a range of
                    mountains which leaves the chain of Hindoo Coosh in 71° east longitude, in a
                    direction east of north, and is known by the name of Belur Tag, a corruption,
                    according to Elphinstone, of Beloot Taugh, or Cloudy Mountains. This range of
                    mountains, though inferior in height to that of Hindoo Coosh, has generally snow
                    on its summits. It crosses the ridge of Moos Taugh, and is continued towards the
                    north till it reaches the chief range of the Altai Mountains, which form the
                    northern barrier of the great central plains. It is the natural boundary between
                    Chinese and Independent Tartary, and the dividing ridge from which the rivers
                    flow east and west into both countries. Here is also the dividing ridge between
                    the Oxus and the Jaxartes, which flow northward into the lake of Aral, and the
                    great Indus, which takes a southerly course to the Indian ocean.</p>
                <p>From this great western boundary of the central plains the country descends
                    slowly to a lower level by successive ridges of rugged and desolate mountains,
                    intermingled with high and desert plains, and fertile spots scattered at great
                    distances over the barren waste. Towards the north these mountainous ridges do
                    not seem to extend beyond the sea of Aral, or about half way between the high
                    land of the interior and the Caspian Sea, leaving on the north-west of the Aral
                    vast plains, the habitation of pastoral tribes; and on the west of the Caspian
                    Sea the desert expanse of Khauresme or Carisme, the abode of predatory hordes,
                    who infest the surrounding countries. To the south of the Caspian extends the
                    great table-land of Persia, which consists of mountainous ridges, varied with
                    elevated and barren plains, which, judging from the extraordinary severity of
                    the winter cold, must be raised from 3000 to 4000 feet above the level of the
                    sea. Persia is situated in this manner on the great western declivity of Asia;
                    and its mountains are connected with those of the great central ridge of Hindoo
                    Coosh, which, extending westward, under the name of the Paropamisan Mountains,
                    to the south of Balk and to the north of Cabul or Afghanistan, sends forth
                    branches which spread over Persia in various directions in the south as well as
                    in the north. The northern ridge, taking a north-westerly course, turns westward
                    to the Caspian Sea, diverging in its progress into various ramifications towards
                    the south. It passes along the southern shore of the Caspian; and for a space of
                    1500 miles, namely, from the eastern country of Balk to the Persian province of
                    Azerbijan, west of the Caspian, it appears to form the boundary and rampart wall
                    of a great table-land to the south, which extends eastward beyond the Persian
                    territory, and is estimated to be 3000 or 4000 feet higher than the flat country
                    between it and the Caspian Sea on the north, or than the desert which extends
                    eastward of this sea into the country of Balk; and so steep are those mountains,
                    generally known by the name of the Elburz Mountains, on the north, that the low
                    country comes suddenly up to their base as to a wall. This northern chain of
                    mountains appears to unite, in the western provinces of Persia, with another
                    chain issuing from the great western coast of the central plains farther to the
                    south, and to form that mass of mountains which separate Armenia from
                    Mesopotamia, and from which diverge westward into Asia Minor, along the shores
                    of the Mediterranean, the celebrated ridge known to the ancients under the name
                    of Mount Taurus, and northward between the Black Sea and the Caspian the
                    mountain chain of Caucasus, which rises to a great height, being in many parts
                    above the line of perpetual snow. This appears to be the highest continued tract
                    of elevated territory in Western Asia; and it gives rise to the great streams of
                    the Euphrates and the Tigris, which flow southward into the Persian Gulf, as
                    well as those rivers flowing northward into the Euxine; also to the Aras, the
                    ancient Araxes; the Kur and the Kuma, which run east into the Caspian; and to
                    the Kuban, and other inferior streams, which, by a westerly course, reach the
                    Black Sea. This mountainous tract of country has chiefly a southern exposure,
                    and the dividing ridge between the waters which flow south and north being on
                    the borders of the Black Sea, the streams flowing northward from the mountain
                    tract into this sea are consequently insignificant in size compared with the
                    Tigris and the Euphrates, which run down its southern declivity. Towards the
                    east the streams, having to run over a larger space before they reach the
                    Caspian Sea, are of course more considerable.</p>
                <p>From this elevated tract of country, which takes a westerly course on leaving the
                    great ridge of the Hindoo Coosh Mountains, its altitude declining as it advances
                    in this direction, various lateral ridges, of inferior height to the main ridge,
                    project towards the south, inclosing between them extensive valleys or low
                    countries. The most westerly of these cross ridges is that which begins from the
                    body of Taurus, near the sources of the Euphrates, at the northern extremity of
                    Syria. This ridge proceeds towards the south, and afterwards inclining to the
                    southwest, it skirts the western shore of the Mediterranean, where it is known
                    under the names of Amman, Sinai, Syria, &amp;c.; and in its course southward it
                    forms the two ridges of Libanus or Lebanon, the mountain of this name being of
                    great height, as is indicated by its snow-clad top, and the inferior ridge of
                    Anti-Libanus to the east. Having passed the Mediterranean and the southern
                    border of Palestine, it advances to the eastern coast of the Red Sea, where it
                    spreads out and forms the central mass of the Arabian mountains, and the ridges
                    which run along the eastern shores of the Red Sea and terminate in Arabia Felix,
                    on the shores of the Indian Ocean.</p>
                <p>, The northern front of the great central plain of Asia is formed by the vast
                    range of the Altai Mountains, which, under different names, traverse the whole
                    extent of this continent from east to west for a space of not less than 5000
                    miles. At their western extremity they join the Ural Mountains, which seem to be
                    a continuation of them; and they stretch almost due north in a direction nearly
                    parallel to the course of the Oby, until they reach the shores of the Frozen
                    Ocean, and, crossing the narrow <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104336"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-4336-0675"/>strait of Waigatz, they terminate amid the rigours
                    of winter in the desolate island of Nova Zembla. On the east the Altai Mountains
                    send forth two ridges, which appear, in the same manner as the Ural ridge, to be
                    a continuation of the original chain, and which reach to the utmost extremities
                    of Asia. One of these, under the name of the Zangai or Changai Mountains,
                    extends in a direction south-east, and, attaining a great height, terminates in
                    the Gulf of Corea, to the northward of Peking. Another chain, namely, the
                    Daouria or Nertschinsk Mountains, proceeds north-eastward along the Gulf or Sea
                    of Ochotsk, and only terminates with the limits of the continent in the vicinity
                    of Behring’s Straits. From this chain an inferior one breaks off, and taking a
                    southeasterly direction, penetrates to the southern extremity of the peninsula
                    of Kamtschatka. This northern bulwark of the central high land of Asia is
                    greatly inferior in height to the Himalaya and Hindoo Coosh Mountains, the
                    boundary on the south. Its elevation is not supposed to exceed 5000 or 6000
                    feet, which is sufficient, however, in that northern latitude, to bring it
                    within the line of perpetual snow. Besides the outward ridge, which faces the
                    north, there are interior and parallel ridges, imperfectly known, and between
                    which the country spreads out into elevated plains. It is in these interior and
                    apparently higher mountains that the head waters are to be found of the Irtisch,
                    the Oby, the Yenesei, and the Lena, which pierce through deep defiles in the
                    outer ridge of the Altai Mountains, and make their way through the plains of
                    Siberia to the Frozen Ocean. The great river Amour, however, being confined by
                    this barrier, and turned aside to the west into Chinese Tartary, finally
                    reaches, by a northerly course, the Sea of Ochotsk. To the north of the Altai
                    Mountains the country subsides into the low country of Siberia, which, with
                    occasional ranges of high ground, presents one vast plain from the base of the
                    Altai Mountains to the Arctic Sea. Here are three tracts, or steppes as they are
                    called, which extend for hundreds of miles on a dead level, and exhibit the same
                    aspect. Of these the steppe of the Issim extends, in the southwestern part of
                    Asiatic Russia, along the base of the Altai chain, from the Ural river and the
                    Caspian Sea, across the sources of the Tobol, the Itchim, and the Irtisch. The
                    steppe of the Irtisch reaches from that river to the Yenesei, a space of 1000
                    miles from east to west; and it seems to be continued between the lower course
                    of the streams as far as the Frozen Ocean. A similar tract reaches from the
                    Yenesei to the Lena. These plains are generally barren: some of them abound in
                    rock-salt and in salt lakes, others are covered with deep forests, and some
                    parts are fitted for agriculture or pasturage. They are of the most dreary
                    aspect; and as they advance into the northern latitudes, they combine the double
                    evil of a barren soil and a severe climate.</p>
                <p>Of the mountains inclosing the great plain of Central Asia on the east, and which
                    subside into the lower country of China, we cannot attempt any geographical
                    description, as they are very imperfectly known. From the nature of the country,
                    however, which is known, and from the direction of its mountains and streams, we
                    may deduce some general inferences as to those regions which are unknown. The
                    great chain of the Himalaya Mountains, on entering the peninsula beyond the
                    Ganges, inclines towards the south; and numerous chains of inferior magnitude
                    breaking off in this direction, divide that peninsula into long parallel
                    valleys, in which the great streams of the Irrawaddy, the Menam, the Mayĝue, and
                    the Japanese, flow southward to the Indian Ocean. Those mountains which thus
                    break off from the Himalaya range to the south also diverge, without doubt,
                    towards the north; and they will thus form the western frontier of China,’ and
                    the mountain wall which supports the central tableland on the-east. We are
                    ignorant of the height or other particulars regarding this chain. But from the
                    direction of the two great rivers, the Hoangho or Yellow River, and the
                    Yang-tse-Kiang or Blue River, which water the central regions of China, and
                    which have their sources in the interior deserts, it is evident that from the
                    central high lands the country must be a continued declivity, varied
                    occasionally with lower terraces of hills, to the Eastern Ocean. A range of
                    mountains runs through the southern provinces of China, which seems to be a
                    prolongation, on a lower scale, of the great Himalaya ridge; and a lofty chain
                    of naked rocks, already noticed, runs along the southern frontier, and separates
                    China from Tartary. It is a branch of those mountains which turn aside the river
                    Hoangho into a northerly direction; and it is only by a circuitous and winding
                    turn that it regains its original course towards the east.</p>
                <p>The rivers of Asia correspond in grandeur with all the other great natural
                    features of the country. A river, it is evident, will be great or small
                    according to the extent of the basin or valley of which it is the natural drain,
                    and according also as it recedes from or approaches the regions of rain which
                    lie under the equator. The largest rivers are accordingly those which have the
                    longest course, and that course within the tropics or near to the equator; and
                    all the great rivers of the globe will be found to coincide with this
                    hypothesis; many of those in high latitudes with a long course being inferior in
                    magnitude to the rivers within the tropics which have a shorter course, and
                    which are fed by the periodical rains. The Amazons is unquestionably the largest
                    river in the world. It pours into the ocean a stream of the greatest magnitude,
                    being 180 miles broad at its mouth, and of an amazing depth; and it combines the
                    two necessary conditions of a great river. It has a long course of fully 3000
                    miles (chiefly within the 6th or 7th degree of S. lat., where it crosses nearly
                    the whole breadth of America), swollen into a most prodigious volume of water by
                    the almost constant rains of the equator. The Mississippi in North America has a
                    long course, including its windings, of nearly 3000 miles; and it is the only
                    drain of that vast valley situated between the Rocky Mountains on the west and
                    the Allegany Mountains on the east, the area of which cannot be less than
                    2,000,000 of square miles. But its course lies without the limits of the
                    tropical rains; and it wants, consequently, one of the requisites of a great
                    river. It will be found, accordingly, that it does not pour into the ocean such
                    a volume of water as the Orinoco, the course of which is not estimated to exceed
                    1300 or 1400 miles; and its basin is inferior in extent by two thirds to that of
                    the Mississippi. Yet this latter, though a magnificent stream, is not, opposite
                    New Orleans, 102 miles from its mouth, above 132 feet deep during the
                    inundation, and 4500 feet broad; while the Orinoco was found in the dry season
                    at St Thomas, 250 miles from its mouth, to be 390 feet deep and 2300 feet
                    broad.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Depons, <hi

                    2000 miles, and it has its rise within the tropics. But its northerly course
                    carries it away from the periodical rains into Northern Africa, where rain
                    seldom or never <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104349" xml:id="kp-eb0703-4349-0676"
                    />falls; and hence, for the space of 1000 miles, it receives not the aid of a
                    single tributary stream. It is merely the collected rains of the northern
                    tropic, diminished rather than increased as they flow through the African
                    deserts to the Mediterranean. Hence the magitude of the Nile is not in
                    proportion to the space over which it flows. It has not so large a stream as
                    either the Orinoco or the Ganges, which, though they have each a shorter course,
                    are yet swollen to a greater size by the tropical rains. If the Nile had flowed
                    in an opposite direction towards the equator, it would have ranked in the first
                    class of rivers. The vast expanse of Asia presents an ample area for the
                    formation of the largest streams. In the interval which extends from the
                    loftiest ridges of the central mountains, the multitudinous waters of the most
                    distant regions may be poured into one common channel; and the rivers of Asia,
                    therefore, from the space over which they flow, ought to be the greatest in the
                    world. This, however, is not the case. They are indeed most magnificent streams,
                    and present, in the roar and foam of their impatient waters while they are yet
                    imprisoned within the mountains, in the violence with which their conflicting
                    tides successively intermingle in their progress to the sea, and in the breadth
                    and majesty of the overflowing stream sweeping over the plains, all the most
                    imposing phenomena of the greatest rivers. But they are inferior in magnitude to
                    the chief rivers of South America—to the Orinoco, and still more to the Amazons;
                    and the explanation of this fact must be sought for in the position of Asia, of
                    which only the southern extremity is within the region of the tropical rains.
                    The solid mass of the Asiatic continent just reaches the northern tropic; and it
                    is only the peninsular tracks of Arabia, Hindostan, and the narrow strip of
                    Malacca, that shoot out beyond this boundary towards the equator. The greatest
                    rivers of Asia, namely, the Ganges and the Indus, are consequently without the
                    limits of the tropics. But in Asia the rainy season has a wider range than in
                    Africa, where it does not extend beyond the northern tropic. In the tropical
                    countries of Asia this season sets in with the south-west monsoon, which drives
                    the gathering clouds from the Indian Ocean over the plains of Hindostan, and as
                    far as the northern barrier of the Himalaya Mountains, by which their progress
                    is at length arrested, and extends the periodical rains over the whole
                    intervening country. Hence both the Ganges and the Indus are fed by these rains,
                    though the northern latitude in which they flow would in Africa place them in
                    the driest regions of the earth. They accordingly rank among the rivers of the
                    first class, whether we look to their length of course or to the body of water
                    which they pour into the ocean. They both have their rise in the great Himalaya
                    ridge, among the regions of perpetual snow, at no great distance from each
                    other, when they diverge—the Indus into a south-westerly, and the Ganges into a
                    north-easterly course, according to the slope of the land, and reach the Indian
                    Ocean exactly on opposite points of the peninsula of Hindostan. They form each
                    the great drain of their respective valleys, and they have many tributaries,
                    which it is unnecessary here to state in detail. The great river of the
                    Brahmaputra, which is fully equal to the Ganges, has its source from the
                    opposite side of the same mountains; and after a long easterly course among
                    desert mountains, in which it approaches the confines of China, it winds towards
                    the west by a vast circuit round the mountains, and joins the Ganges after a
                    course of about 1600 miles. The other great rivers of Eastern Asia which flow
                    down the southern declivity of the central mountains are, the Irrawaddy, which
                    has its rise in the eastern mountains of Thibet, and, after a course of 1200
                    miles, falls by many mouths into the Gulf of Bengal; the Menam, which falls into
                    the Gulf of Siam; and the Camboja, which, rising in the northern mountains,
                    after a course of nearly 2000 miles falls into the Chinese Sea to the east of
                    the Gulf of Siam, in about lat. 10. S. The course of all these rivers lies more
                    within the region of the rains than that of either the Indus or the Ganges; and
                    the Irrawaddy, and especially the Camboja, are of great length. But the basins
                    or valleys of which they are the outlets are long and narrow, and their
                    collected waters are not sufficient for the formation of such large rivers as
                    the Indus or the Ganges. Yet the Irrawaddy is of great magnitude; it has its
                    delta and its periodical overflow; and during the rainy season it is a mile
                    broad, and of great depth. It decreases during the dry season to half a mile in
                    breadth and to a depth of eight feet. The Menam is not a river of any imposing
                    magnitude; and of the Camboja we have but very imperfect accounts; but judging
                    from the great length of its course, which is also within the region of the
                    heaviest rains, its stream can hardly be inferior to the largest rivers of Asia.
                    It is said to be navigable for large vessels 40 leagues from its mouth, to be in
                    general two miles wide, and so deep that ships can approach almost close to its
                    banks. The peninsula of Hin∙dostan, which projects southward, and is subject to
                    periodical deluges of rain, is not of sufficient space for the formation of any
                    great river. Amid the lower ranges of mountains, the Nerbuddah, which in some
                    countries would be thought a large river, takes its rise, and flows from east to
                    west down the western slope of the great plain of Central India into the Gulf of
                    Cambay; and here commences the mountain range of the Ghauts, which runs along
                    the coast of Malabar to Cape Comorin, at the distance of not more than 100
                    miles; while from the opposite coast the intervening, country extends from 300
                    to 700 miles; thus exhibiting on a small scale the formation of the American
                    continent, which rises to its height at the distance of about 300 miles from the
                    Pacific Ocean, leaving the vast space on the other side of the mountains to the
                    Atlantic for the course of all the great rivers. In like manner, all the great
                    rivers of Hindostan flow down the eastern declivity of the Ghaut Mountains,
                    namely, the Mahanuddy, the Godavery, the Kistnah, the Tuptee, and the Cavery,
                    which flow from the Ghauts in an easterly direction across the country to the
                    Indian Ocean. The streams on the opposite declivity of the mountains have
                    necessarily a short course, and are chiefly inconsiderable mountain torrents,
                    except when they are swollen by the rains. The Euphrates and the Tigris, which
                    have their origin in the mountains of Armenia, are the only other considerable
                    rivers of Asia which flow southward into the ocean. They are not rivers of the
                    first class, not nearly equalling either the Ganges or the Indus, though the
                    Euphrates must be nearly equal to the Danube, the greatest river in Europe; and
                    they are in no respect tropical rivers, as they derive their supplies from the
                    melting of the snows, and from the spring and the winter rains. It is
                    accordingly in January that the great overflow of the Euphrates takes place. It
                    may be here remarked, that throughout Asia the countries without the limits of
                    the monsoon depend on the rains, which generally fall in the spring, and more
                    copiously in the winter, though these rains are far from being so regular as the
                    rainy season within the tropics.</p>
                <p>The great ridges of the Himalaya and Hindoo Coosh Mountains divide the rivers of
                    Asia which flow southward to the Indian Ocean, from those which flow northward
                    or eastward into the central deserts of Tartary. They do not appear, however, to
                    be considerable; and are probably lost amid the wastes of sand extending over a
                    great portion of that country, or in some of its interior lakes. On the north
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104362" xml:id="kp-eb0703-4362-0677"/> the Oxus, a
                    great river, and the Jaxartes, of which the sources approach those of the Indus
                    and the Ganges, being on the opposite sides of the same high land, emerge from
                    the mountain deserts into the plains, and, after a long course, both reach the
                    interior lake of Aral, to the east of the Caspian Sea. The great rivers in the
                    east of Asia, namely, the Yang-tse-Kiang and the Hoangho, which rise in the
                    unknown deserts of Thibet, and flow through China into the Eastern Seas, have
                    each a course of extraordinary length; and they must no doubt pour a large
                    stream into the ocean. But we have no accurate accounts of their size, neither
                    of their breadth nor depth; and as they are not within the limits of the rains,
                    the magnitude of their stream cannot be in proportion to its great length, as
                    the rains of these northern regions never accumulate into such a body of water
                    as the rains of the tropics. The great river Amour, which runs down the eastern
                    declivity of the Asiatic high lands, is remarkable for the length of its course;
                    but though it must be a great river, we have no accurate information respecting
                    it.</p>
                <p>On the north, where the central table-land of Asia declines towards the Frozen
                    Ocean, there is ample space for the formation of rivers; and accordingly,
                    through the vast and desolate wastes of Siberia flowthe Irtisch, the Obi, the
                    Yenesei, and the Lena, by a winding course, to the Arctic Sea. The whole breadth
                    of Asia, from the Eastern Ocean to the Ural Mountains, ,is drained of its waters
                    by these four rivers and their tributaries; and the Irtisch, the Yenesei, and
                    the Lena, from their source in the unknown deserts of Chinese Tartary, must flow
                    over a space of nearly 4000 miles, which greatly exceeds the course of the great
                    Amazons. We know little as to the volume of water contained in these rivers,
                    which, though it must be great, yet, judging from the magnitude of other rivers
                    in the same latitude, cannot equal that of the great tropical rivers. The Volga
                    is a large river; it has a great length of course; but its depth does not exceed
                    15 feet.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Pallas’ <hi

                    Siberia are no doubt of great extent; but even though we estimate their streams

                    which is not one tenth part the depth of the Orinoco, though, according to Major
                    Rennel, it is equal to that of the Ganges.</p>
                <p>Asia is distinguished by the variety and extent of its interior lakes; and its
                    extensive table-lands, intersected by mountains, favour the collection of those
                    masses of water.. In general these lakes are distinguished by the saline,-
                    brackish, or sulphureous nature of their waters. Asia Minor contains numerous
                    salt lakes which have no outlet, and some of them of considerable extent. To the
                    west of the Caspian Sea are the lakes of Van and Urmia, 0oroomea or Shahee, the
                    waters of which are intensely salt.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    chains of Libanus and Anti-Libanus contain several lakes, the most celebrated of
                    which is the Lake Asphaltites or the Dead Sea in Palestine, whose bituminous
                    waters cover a space of nearly 500 square miles. The Caspian Sea on the western
                    declivity of the central heights is beyond all comparison the largest lake that
                    is known, being in length 646 miles from north to south, and 265 in extreme
                    breadth; while the greatest length of Lake Superior in North America is not more
                    than 381 miles in length and 161 in breadth. Lake Aral, to the west of the
                    Caspian Sea, is 150 miles in length by 60 in breadth; and to the east the lakes
                    of Aksakol, Telegul, Balkashi or Paleati, and numerous smaller lakes, are
                    scattered over the region which lies between the central mountains and the
                    Caspian Sea. In all these lakes the waters are salt or brackish. Persia contains
                    in its salt deserts numerous small lakes; and also the large lake of Zere or
                    Zurrah, which covers a space of 1000 square miles.</p>
                <p>On the northern declivity of the table-land of Tartary are scattered numerous
                    lakes, many of which are scarcely known by name in Europe, though they are of
                    great extent, and are fed by the rivers from the surrounding mountains. Of these
                    the LakeTchanyor Czany is the largest. The high plains in the table-land of
                    Tartary and Thibet, environed on all sides by lofty mountains, are the
                    receptacles of the imprisoned waters of these elevated regions. Near the
                    southern ridge of this mountain tract is found the large and variously
                    designated lake which gives rise to the Irtisch; and the southern plains,
                    inclosed by the mountains of Chinese Tartary and Thibet, the most elevated
                    summits of Asia, are said to contain considerable rivers, which are either lost
                    in the sands or in interior lakes.. The country of Thibet abounds in lakes, in
                    most of which the waters are salt. Some of these are of great extent. The
                    Terkiri, according to the accounts of the Chinese missionaries, from whom we
                    derive our chief knowledge of these vast countries, is 60 miles long by 40
                    broad. The Kokonor, which signifies a great sea, is on the borders of China: it
                    contains 1840 square miles, and a space of 600 miles on both sides of Lake
                    Terkiri, and includes no less than 23 lakes, some of them of considerable
                    extent. There are comparatively few lakes in the exterior plains of Asia.<note

                    Lake Baikal, in Upper Siberia, is 366 miles in length by from 20 to 53 in
                    breadth. But Lower Siberia is one continued series of marshes, with intervening
                    plains adapted for pasture. China contains few lakes, the country being one
                    continued declivity; and from the same cause the peninsula of Hindostan contains
                    not a single lake of any extent.</p>
                <p>From its internal structure Asia does not possess the same advantages of
                    navigable intercourse as the other divisions of the globe. From the peculiar
                    structure of the American continent, all the great rivers flow to the east or to
                    the south-east, some of them across almost the whole breadth of the continent,
                    and scarcely leave any part far out of the reach of a navigable communication.
                    North as well as South America has also a southern or eastern exposure, in
                    consequence of which the Mississippi, the Orinoco, the Amazons, and the Plata
                    rivers, flow either to the south or to the east, into the seats of civilization
                    and of commerce. The structure of Asia is different: it is of the most imposing
                    grandeur and simplicity, and is eminently calculated to impress on the mind an
                    idea of vastness and of majesty; but it is not so well adapted for the purposes
                    of internal improvement. From its form, which rises into a great table-land
                    towards the centre, the rivers naturally descend on all sides to the sea, as
                    radii from a common centre, leaving vast tracts and high plains a prey to
                    perpetual drought and sterility, and without any navigable communication with
                    the sea. Not that the great table-land of Asia, if we except the vast sandy
                    deserts of Cobi and Shamo, presents such a uniform aspect of frightful wastes as
                    is generally supposed. It is not by any means wholly destitute of water and
                    vegetation, but contains extensive plains fertilized by rivers flowing into
                    interior lakes, and well adapted for pasturage, the chief occupation of the
                    inhabitants, and which, if they were properly cultivated, would yield grain and
                    other produce. But the want of moisture is still the chief disadvantage; and the
                    streams which arise in this elevated region having no outlet to the sea, afford
                    no facilities of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104375"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-4375-0678"/>exterior intercourse. This disadvantage
                    necessarily belongs to a country of elevated plains of immense extent, fenced
                    round with mountains, and thus insulated from and almost unknown to the whole
                    world besides. A lake which does not communicate with the sea merely facilitates
                    the communications between its own shores. Hence it is of no material use in the
                    intercourse of a country; and the nature of the ground to which these lakes owe
                    their formation is a positive disadvantage, as its effect is to intercept the
                    interior waters in their progress to the sea, and to collect them into a large
                    reservoir in the heart of the country. Thus the Oxus and the Jaxartes flow into
                    the Aral; and the Caspian Sea, which presents no facilities for internal
                    improvement, is the recipient of some very great rivers. But if they had reached
                    the Black Sea, how much more would they have conduced to the improvement of the
                    country. The great rivers of what we may call Southern Asia, namely, the
                    Euphrates, the Tigris, the Indus, the Ganges, and the streams which run into the
                    Indian Ocean in the peninsula beyond the Ganges, are well adapted for navigation
                    and commerce; and the Ganges more especially is of vast advantage both in
                    fertilizing the soil and improving the intercourse of the country through which
                    it flows. The course of the other great rivers, such as the Indus, &amp;c. would
                    equally promote the. same great objects; but the adjacent countries are
                    inhabited by barbarous tribes, who neglect all those natural advantages. The
                    Chinese rivers which wind across that country from the western mountains are
                    rendered eminently subservient to navigation and commerce by that industrious
                    people. But the course of the great rivers flowing from the central mountains
                    into the Frozen Ocean, into which course they are turned by the northern
                    exposure of Asia, is eminently unfavourable for the improvement of the country,
                    as they are carried entirely out of the seats of commerce and wealth to the
                    Arctic Sea, the gloomy abode of perpetual winter. These great rivers, therefore,
                    the Irtisch, the Obi, the Yenesei, and the Lena, owing to their having a
                    northern course, must for ever remain useless to commerce and navigation. They
                    lead to countries from which no benefit can ever be derived, to seas bound up in
                    perpetual ice, and to regions of sterility and cold, which mankind desire to fly
                    from rather than to visit. These rivers, great and navigable though they be,
                    present no outlet to the produce of the interior; nor can they greatly aid the
                    general routes of the traveller in crossing Siberia. They afford considerable
                    advantages, however, especially in their upper streams, for carrying goods into
                    and from China. It is singular that to the west of the Ural Mountains the
                    country should have a southern exposure, and the great rivers of northern
                    Europe, accordingly, the Volga, the Don, and the Dnieper, flow with a southerly
                    course into the Caspian or the Black Sea.</p>
                <p>From the general view which has been given of the form and interior structure of
                    this great continent, and of the system of its mountains and rivers, it may be
                    distinguished with advantage into five great natural divisions, namely, Central
                    Asia, Southern and Northern Asia, and Eastern and Western Asia.</p>
                <p>1. Central Asia, or the great high lands, with their elevated plains and almost
                    boundless wastes, is, in the eastern parts, chiefly within the limits of the
                    Chinese dominions. It contains Thibet and Chinese Tartary, to whose powers we
                    cannot assign any definite limits. But it is certain that in the south the
                    dominion of China extends very far west, to the 80th degree at least, as it now
                    borders with the British frontier in Hindostan, where Chinese horsemen are
                    placed to guard, with their usual jealous policy, the celestial empire from
                    intrusion. On the north the territories of China border with those of Russia,
                    and the whole intervening tract must be included under the Chinese dominion. But
                    we know little of these wild and desolate regions; and it is uncertain how far
                    the pastoral or predatory hordes which range over them are controlled by the
                    Chinese authorities. The country of Thibet is also bounded by China on the east
                    and on the north, though we cannot exactly determine the limits of their
                    respective territories. Farther to the north the sway of China extends to the
                    78th degree of E. long., and includes the rich and populous Mahometan towns of
                    Kashgar, in long. 76. 5. 45. E. lat. 39. 25. N., and Yarkund, in long. 78.
                    27.45. E. lat. 38. 19. N.; the first reckoned to contain 80,000 inhabitants. It
                    does not seem to be separated from Independent Tartary by any distinct boundary.
                    The countries near the sources of the Indus and the Oxus, about the 78th degree
                    of E. long., are inhabited by wild and independent tribes, who, like most of
                    their race, subsist by pasturage or plunder. Here is Balk, the ancient Bactria
                    or Bactriana, where there are several chiefs who rule over their rude and
                    intractable subjects with a precarious sway. Here is also the city of Buckharia,
                    which, with the surrounding country, is ruled by an independent sovereign; and
                    the independent states of Khyvah and Kokaun, the first extending on and near the
                    banks of the Oxus, between 100 and 200 miles, and the latter divided into two
                    parts by the Jaxartes, and reckoned to be more than 200 miles in length and 150
                    in breadth. To the west, as far as the Caspian Sea, is the proper region of
                    Independent Tartary, bounded on all sides by the Russian, Chinese, and Persian
                    empires.</p>
                <p>2. Southern Asia includes Hindostan from the Himalaya Mountains; on the west
                    Afghanistan and the independent tribes scattered in the lower valley of the
                    Indus; the kingdom of Nepaul on the east; the hilly country of Boo tan, the
                    Burman empire, the peninsula of Malacca, and the kingdom of Camboja.</p>
                <p>3. Western Asia contains Persia, the peninsula of Arabia, the extensive countries
                    over which Turkey maintains a loose and uncertain authority, comprehending
                    Mesopotamia, Armenia, Syria, and Palestine; Asia Minor, surrounded on the north,
                    south, and west, by the Mediterranean and the Black Seas, and the mountain
                    regions of Caucasus between the Black and the Caspian Seas.</p>
                <p>4. Eastern Asia is occupied by the Chinese empire and by Chinese Tartary.</p>
                <p>5. Northern Asia forms the Asiatic part of the Russian empire, which extends from
                    the Altai Mountains to the Frozen Ocean.</p>
                <p>Asia, extending from the equator to the Arctic Sea, necessarily possesses great
                    variety of climate. But though here, as in every other country, the climate is
                    regulated by the distance from the equator, this general law is modified by
                    accidental causes, which it is curious to trace. In the wide extent of Asia
                    great peculiarities of temperature occur, which cannot be very clearly
                    explained. The system of the universe is conducted on so vast a scale that our
                    faculties of observation do not keep pace with its great movements. How can we,
                    for example, trace the rapid course of the winds, on which the temperature of
                    countries so essentially depends, traversing as they do the whole space of the
                    habitable globe at the rate of 1000 miles in 24 hours? How can we ascertain
                    their origin and follow their progress, which is modified by the various
                    interruptions of mountains, continents, and seas. How can we distinctly point
                    out, amid such a complication of unknown facts, the connection between cause and
                    effect? To such inquiries some uncertainty will always attach, and anomalies may
                    appear of which we can oner no solution. In these circumstances, facts are our
                    only <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104388" xml:id="kp-eb0703-4388-0679"/>sure
                    guides; and to these, therefore, în the following observations, we shall
                    endeavour to adhere.</p>
                <p>The height of the land above the level of the sea is as sure a cause of cold as
                    distance from the equator; and countries are not only cold in proportion to
                    their height, but a mass of cold air is accumulated above them, which, being
                    dispersed, is carried towards the equator, and extends the dominion of cold into
                    the regions of heat. Land and water, also, are the causes either of heat or
                    cold, according to their situation. The great mass of the ocean is little
                    affected by the changes of the seasons; and it consequently preserves the medium
                    temperature of the whole year. Hence the vicinity of the ocean cools the
                    temperature of the equinoctial regions; and in higher latitudes it moderates the
                    extremes both of heat and cold, being in winter of a higher temperature, and in
                    summer of a lower temperature, than the superincumbent air. The surface of the
                    earth, again, imbibes heat or cold much more readily than the ocean; and it is
                    only at considerable depths that it is found to give the medium temperature of
                    the year. The vicinity of land, therefore, in the polar countries, is the cause
                    of cold, while in the southern regions of the equator it is an equally powerful
                    cause of heat. Thus Africa, which extends so far to the south, and which
                    contains a greater proportion of land within the tropics than any other division
                    of the globe, is a vast store-house of heat, from which it is dispersed far and
                    wide, and even reaches the shores of Europe in hot and parching winds; while, on
                    the other hand, the breadth and extent of the American continent towards the
                    north sufficiently accounts for the coldness of its climate, the north-west
                    winds which sweep across its frozen wastes extending their inroads into the
                    regions of heat as far sometimes as Mexicoor Vera Cruz.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Humboldt’s <hi rend="italic">Political
                    Essay on the Kingdom of Nero Spain.</hi> He mentions, that at Vera Cruz the
                    centigrade thermometer sometimes falls, owing to those northern blasts, to 0 or
                    to 32 degrees of Fahrenheit; and that even at Mexicothey sometimes, though
                    .rarely, bring down the thermometer to the freezing point.</p></note> The
                    influence of the ocean in moderating the severity of the winter is exemplified
                    in the climate of Great Britain, where no such intense cold ever prevails as in
                    corresponding latitudes on the continent of Europe, and more especially on that
                    of Asia. The climate of a country is also affected by the direction of the
                    winds; and hence the eastern shores of America, owing to the tradewinds, which
                    blow from the east, and are cooled in their passage across the Atlantic, have
                    not the same sultry heats as the opposite shores of Africa, where the same winds
                    are heated to an intense degree in their passage over the burning deserts of the
                    interior. The northern frontiers of Asia, and its prodigious elevation towards
                    the centre, necessarily consign the greatest portion of it to the dominion of
                    cold. Among, the central mountains perpetual winter reigns; and from these snowy
                    deserts the influence of cold is widely extended over the high plains of the
                    interior. In Thibet, which is about the same latitude as Northern Africa or
                    Arabia, namely, between the 30th and 35th degrees, there is a continuous and
                    severe winter of three months, which is of such uniform severity that at its
                    commencement the Inhabitants kill their meat, and it is kept perfectly fresh for
                    three months.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Turner’s

                    great ridge of the Hindoo Coosh Mountains, in the same latitude as the south of

                    the climate is remarkably severe. For three months the winter is intensely cold,
                    the wind being dry and piercing, and the snow lying deep on the ground. The

                    for three months; and this is owing entirely to its elevation, which is

                    of Asia, which lie to the south of the Himalaya Mountains, including Arabia, the
                    southern and flat parts of Persia, Hindostan, and India beyond the Ganges,
                    constitute the tropical and warm regions of this continent, of which the
                    climate, though it agrees in general with their position on the globe, still
                    varies from local causes. Hindostan, for example, and India beyond the Ganges,
                    though they approach nearer to the equator, are not nearly so hot as Arabia or
                    the adjacent countries. The course of the seasons is also more constant; and it
                    is here that we meet with those remarkable winds, the monsoons, which blow six
                    months in opposite directions, from the south-west and north-east, with some
                    slight variations, and which extend their influence over all the countries which
                    lie between the mouth of the Indus and the Chinese Sea. The monsoons follow the
                    course of the sun, and this fact points to the cause of the phenomenon. Heat and
                    cold being the great agents which, by rarefying or condensing the air, disturb
                    its equilibrium, and set the* ’ winds in motion, land, when it is heated by the
                    solar rays, acts on the superincumbent air, and causes it to ascend, when it is
                    immediately replaced by an irruption of cold air from the sea. Hence the regular
                    sea-breeze which prevails in all the tropical islands during the day, and the
                    opposite current from the land during the night; and this alternation of the sea
                    and the land breezes, occasioned within 24 hours by the varying temperature of
                    an island, is’just an example of the effect that must be produced by a heated
                    continent and by the change of the seasons. As the sun advances into the
                    northern tropic, the land of Asia, Europe, and almost the whole of Africa, is
                    heated by his influence; by which the air being rarefied, and rising aloft, a
                    current of colder air rushes in from the sea. Accordingly it is found, that with
                    the approach of summer, the plains of Hindostan, Burmah, and China, heated by
                    the intense rays of a vertical sun, violently attract the cold air, which flows
                    with a steady stream from the Southern Ocean, exactly in the tract of the heated
                    continent, ’ namely, from the south-west to the north-east. When the sun passes
                    into the southern hemisphere, the monsoon alters its course. Winter now reigns
                    in the mountainous and northern parts of Asia, and the heat in the lower regions
                    is not so great. The land, in place.of heating, cools the air, which flows into
                    the warm regions of the south from the north-east in the direction of the
                    continent, as it formerly flowed towards the north from the <pb break="no"

                    monsoon sets in about the beginning of June in all the islands of the Indian
                    Ocean, and traverses the southern plains, until it is turned towards the west by
                    the central mountains, and finally arrested in its progress. It is ushered in
                    with the most tremendous thunder and lightning, with tempests of wind and floods
                    of rain. This is the commencement of the periodical rains through all the
                    tropical regions of Asia, which are at their height in July, and gradually abate
                    about the end of September, departing amid thunders and tempests, as they came.
                    Before the setting in of the monsoons there is a clear sky, with a hot parching
                    wind, succeeded by sultry calms, under which all nature seems to droop. The
                    rains effect a sudden and total change in the aspect of the country: the rivers
                    are swollen, the air is pure and refreshing, the sky varied with clouds, and the
                    earth covered with the most luxuriant verdure.<note anchored="true"

                    coolest and shadiest parts, while dead calms prevail often without interruption
                    for 50 or 60 days, and are succeeded, as the temperature begins to vary and the
                    winds to resume their activity, by violent and hot blasts from the desert. The
                    vicinity of Arabia to the African continent, by which it is sheltered from the
                    cool breezes of the sea, while it receives the sultry air from its burning
                    plains, is unquestionably the cause of its extraordinary heat; and it will be
                    remarked that those violent heats extend eastward from Arabia exactly in the
                    direction in which they are received into the lower valley of the Euphrates and
                    the Tigris, where at Bagdad they raise the thermometer to 120° in the shade. It

                <p>Western Asia has been long celebrated for the mildness and serenity of its
                    climate, which is hot and dry, though it is tempered by the cool breezes from
                    the mountain tracts by which it is intersected. In the northern parts, along the
                    coasts of the Black Sea, the country is liable to excessive rains; while the
                    southern shores of the Mediterranean are exposed to the sultry simoom blasts
                    from the African or Arabian deserts.</p>
                <p>Northern Asia, of which the Altai chain is the boundary, is the proper region of
                    cold; and the severity of the climate is said to be aggravated by the vast
                    expanse of the continent in the frozen latitudes of the north. In the interior
                    of Asia the milder element of the ocean can have no influence on the rigour of
                    perpetual winter; and from the Arctic Ocean to the Altai Mountains the north
                    wind sweeps without interruption along the Siberian plains, and occasions an
                    intensity of cold which is not experienced in the corresponding latitudes of
                    Europe. It is remarked by Malte-Brun, that the cold increases as we proceed
                    eastward, to such a degree, that on the coasts of Tartary, in the same latitude
                    as France, the winter commences in September. This intensity of cold he ascribes
                    to several causes: Ivü, To vast mountains covered with glaciers, which rise
                    between Corea and the countries on the river Amour· 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi>
                    to the still greater mass of mountains which separates the Amour from the Lena;
                    2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> to the thick and cold fogs which constantly
                    overhang those frozen countries, and intercept the rays of the sun; and, <hi
                    rend="italic">⅛thly,</hi> t <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> the absolute want of
                    inhabitants, and consequently of cultivation. There is no doubt that such causes
                    tend to the increase of cold. They must, however, be somewhat counterbalanced by
                    the vicinity of the Eastern Ocean tempering the severity of a Siberian winter;
                    and the greatest degree of cold should still, therefore, be found towards the
                    centre of the continent. On the northern shores of Asia the severity of the cold
                    will not, as in milder climates, be counteracted by the influence of the ocean,
                    which is either covered with solid or with floating ice. The natural coldness of
                    the air in these countries will be aggravated rather than softened by the
                    vicinity of these frozen seas.</p>
                <p>Asia, from its vast extent and unequal surface, not only comprehends within its
                    bounds the vegetable produce of the whole earth, from the low creeping lichen
                    which flourishes on the borders of perpetual snow, to all the splendid varieties
                    of tropical vegetation; but it presents these varieties within a very short
                    compass. It would be inconsistent with the plan of the present article to
                    describe in detail the animal and vegetable kingdoms of Asia. It may be
                    therefore generally stated, that the great staples of agriculture, the
                    alimentary plants on which man depends for his subsistence, are, in the tropical
                    countries of Asia, rice, of which there are 27 varieties; maize, millet, and
                    many varieties of a coarser grain called dourra; as well as other species of
                    legumes not known in Europe. The cultivation of these nutritious grains is
                    confined to the plains of Hindostan and the hot countries to the east. Rice or
                    maize may be sometimes seen in Persia, or in the hot plains of Lower Syria; but
                    agriculture in these countries generally depends on the grain of a colder
                    climate. Persia is accordingly famed for the most excellent wheat, which is the
                    chief food, and for barley and millet. Oats are more rarely attempted in that
                    climate. Throughout Syria and Asia Minor, as well as Arabia, wheat, rye, barley,
                    beans, and other grains, are chiefly sown; and in Buckharia, and generally in
                    all the countries that he between the Oxus and the Caspian Sea, these and other
                    grains, with a variety of leguminous plants, constitute the chief dependence of
                    the inhabitants.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    degrees, these grains may with care be raised all over Asia; but beyond this
                    they cannot so well resist the severity of the climate, <hi rend="superscript">
                    k</hi> This is therefore the proper region of barley and oats, the cultivation
                    of which may be extended to the 60th degree. Beyond this the powers of
                    vegetation fail under the benumbing influence of cold; and the earth yields
                    nothing but dwarf trees, lichens, and some species of the wild berry. In
                    ascending the Asiatic mountains, the same varieties of vegetable produce are
                    observed as in receding from the equator, until, at the line of perpetual
                    congelation, all traces of vegetation disappear. But the decrease of heat in
                    propqr-tion to the altitude varies in different situations, according as it is
                    affected by local and accidental causes; and though the most accurate
                    calculations have been made on the subject by Leslie, Humboldt, and others, they
                    are modified by local causes. Thus the limits of perpetual congelation have been
                    fixed by Humboldt at <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104414"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-4414-0681"/>15,700 feet under the equator, and 15,000 in the
                    latitude of 20 degrees; yet Captain Webb, in his journeys among the Himalaya
                    Mountains, observed, on the banks of the Sutledge river, which must have been at
                    least in the 30th degree of north latitude, the finest pastures, and crops of a
                    species of barley from which the natives make their bread, at a height of 15,000
                    feet, the supposed line of perpetual frost. And at a pass among these mountains,
                    in 30 degrees of north latitude, plants were found that ripened their seed at
                    the enormous height of 17,000 feet. In latitude 30° 25' the same traveller saw
                    fields at the height of 11,790 feet, not only without snow, but covered with
                    extensive fields of buck-wheat and Tartaric barley. The decrease of heat in
                    proportion to the altitude attained appears not to be subject to any certain
                    rule; and it would be extremely interesting to ascertain by actual observation
                    the height at which the produce of the colder climates could be cultivated in
                    different parts. We cannot fix either the lower or the higher limit at which
                    wheat and other European grains could be brought to maturity among the Asiatic
                    mountains. It is evident that the decrease of heat as we rise above the level of
                    the sea is modified by local causes, in the same manner as when we recede from
                    the equator; and hence the same vegetable produce is not uniformly found at the
                    same height, any more than within -the same latitudes. It is possible that in
                    the interior mass of the mountains the cold may be greater than among the
                    exterior ridges, and that the European grain, and the other congenial produce of
                    a cold climate, may not on this account ripen at so high an elevation. It is
                    mentioned by Turner, that he saw wheat in Thibet in a green state, which he was
                    assured would never ripen owing to the severity of the climate.</p>
                <p>Of the other plants which minister to the comfort of man, and afford valuable
                    articles of commerce, Asia possesses great variety. The tea plant, which is
                    exported so largely to Europe, is indigenous to China, to which its cultivation
                    has hitherto been confined, and to which it is a source of prodigious wealth.
                    Arabia is the native country of coffee, where it still arrives at its greatest
                    perfection. The sugar-cane is cultivated in Hindostan, though not with the same
                    energy and skill as in the West Indies; and also in some of the hottest parts of
                    Asia Minor, but not to any extent. Tobacco is very generally produced in
                    Southern and Western Asia; and the poppy plant, the great intoxicating drug of
                    the East, is a great article of cultivation in Hindostan, and is now exported in
                    immense quantities to the China market.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    improve the advantages of nature, and to render this precious produce a valuable
                    article of commerce. The cotton shrub, which yields so useful an article of
                    clothing, has from time immemorial been naturalized in India, growing in Arabia,
                    Persia, and throughout Asia Minor; and the mulberry, which affords so splendid
                    an article of dress, is cultivated with success in Syria, Mesopotamia, and
                    Armenia. Flax and hemp are common throughout both Southern and Western Asia, and
                    they would grow also in Northern Asia if the inhabitants knew how to profit by
                    the advantages of the country. Indigo is another important article, which is
                    cultivated in India and in some parts of Syria, as well as in Arabia. The
                    Asiatic islands have been long celebrated for various aromatic plants; and the
                    juice which exudes from the trunks of the smaller trees is of the richest
                    fragrance. Among the species of laurels which abound in the southern parts of
                    India and Ceylon we find those which produce mace, cassia, and camphor; and,
                    lastly, the cinnamon tree, formerly supposed to be a native of Arabia; also the
                    clove and the nutmeg trees. The balm of Mecca is the finest of all the gums, and
                    diffuses an exquisite perfume. Arabia has also been long celebrated for
                    frankincense and myrrh. Asia furnishes also many plants used in medicine, as
                    well as in dyeing, such as the castor-oil plant, the senna, the aloe, and
                    others, which extend all over the southern parts and through Asia Minor.</p>
                <p>In Southern Asia the forests abound with the most valuable trees, with the most
                    durable woods, and with every variety of ornamental and dye woods. The teak
                    tree, which grows in the woods of India, surpasses all others in hardness and
                    durability. There are many trees which minister to the subsistence of man. All
                    the palms, for example, distil a rich and nutritious juice; that of the sago
                    palm, distinguished for its beauty and spreading foliage, is so thick and
                    nutritious, that it is used in this country as a medicinal and wholesome diet.
                    The fan palm, which grows in some parts of India, is remarkable for the breadth
                    of its leaves, one of which is sufficient to cover a dozen of men, and two or
                    three to roof a cottage. The breadfruit tree, which grows in India, yields a
                    farinaceous fruit resembling bread prepared from grain. All the common fruit
                    trees of Europe are also found in the hilly parts of India. Asia Minor and the
                    banks of the Euphrates abound in the myrtle, the laurel, the turpentine, mastic,
                    tamarind, cypress, sycamore, and other trees. The oriental plants are numerous
                    in Persia; and in the Syrian mountains the oak and the cedar, celebrated in
                    ancient times, grow to a great height. In the northern countries of Asia the
                    trees most prevalent are the oak, the ash, the elm, &amp;c.; and still farther
                    north there is the dwarf birch and the mountain willow; also the pines and the
                    firs, which rear their tall heads, and spread over the scenery their permanent
                    hue of dark green. The strong and glutinous liquid which exudes from these
                    northern trees is converted into tar, pitch, and turpentine, and becomes a
                    valuable article of commerce, useful for many purposes.</p>
                <p>All the most delicious fruits are raised in the tropical countries of Asia. Those
                    most celebrated in India are the guava, the jambo, the mango, and the
                    pine-apple; many others might be raised if garden-cultivation were attended to
                    as it might be in that country. Syria, Palestine, the banks of the Euphrates,
                    and Persia, are famous for the variety of their fruits, and produce abundantly
                    pomegranates, oranges, lemons, almonds, peaches, figs, quinces, olives, walnuts,
                    and melons of all sorts. In the neighbourhood of Damascus all the fruits of
                    Europe arrive at maturity; and near the Caspian Sea there are whole forests of
                    chesnut trees. The date tree, the fruit of which is in many parts the chief
                    subsistence of the inhabitants, grows in Persia, Mesopotamia, Arabia, Syria, and
                    Palestine. In the higher parts of these countries other fruits are to be found,
                    namely, the apple, the pear, the cherry. In Northern Asia horticulture is little
                    practised; and, excepting wild berries, few other fruits are to be seen in its
                    desert and inhospitable plains. Flowers of all sorts, in the most splendid
                    profusion and variety, and of the richest fragrance, adorn the country in
                    Southern and Western Asia, and give it the appearance of a flower-garden. On
                    such a subject, however, which presents so wide a field of inquiry, we cannot
                    enter into details, which would hardly prove satisfactory to the general reader,
                    and still less to the man of science.</p>

                <p>The desolate tracts of thick jungle and dense forest which abound in Asia afford
                    extensive cover for wild animals, which are accordingly found in great numbers,
                    and comprise all the known <hi rend="italic">genera</hi> of the globe. The lion
                    is found in Persia, Mesopotamia, on the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates, and
                    was formerly known in Asia Minor, but has now either entirely disappeared, or is
                    rarely seen. It was not supposed that this formidable animal haunted the forests
                    and jungles of India. But of late lions have been seen in great numbers in the
                    north of India, in Guzerat, and in the province of Delhi, to the north of this
                    place.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Elphinstone’s <hi

                    the islands of the Indian Ocean, where he exists in amazing power and ferocity,
                    to the great ridge of the Himalaya Mountains.<note anchored="true"

                    that he is a native of a hot climate; and it is probable, therefore, that when
                    he feels the approach of winter, he will retire from the cold of the high
                    country into the warmer and lower valleys of the south. Tigers are seldom seen
                    in the countries westward of the Indus, though they may occasionally stray from
                    their native haunts along the west of that river into the mountain tracts of
                    Belochistan.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Pottinger’s admirable account of the countries of Belochistan and Sinde, chap.
                    vii. which is replete with interesting information. The journey of this officer
                    and of Captain Christie, from India to Persia, through these wild tracts,
                    inhabited by hordes of robbers, may be considered a most perilous and honourable
                    achievement, worthy of the greatest travellers.</p></note> The tiger is not
                    found in Persia, Arabia, or in any part of Africa, though it is quite certain
                    that the country is quite congenial to his constitution and habits, and that if
                    he could once reach it he would quickly propagate his race through its deep
                    forests. Yet the lion reigns supreme in the woods of Africa, while the tiger is
                    the lord of the Asiatic jungles. It would be curious, if we had materials for
                    such a speculation, to trace the distinct regions of the globe which are
                    occupied by the various animal and vegetable tribes. Plants, we know, are
                    transported from the countries in which they are indigenous, and flourish in
                    another soil and climate equally congenial; and, in like manner, the animals of
                    one country have been transported with equal success to other countries, where
                    they have multiplied. The wild and ferocious animals it is the object of man to
                    destroy rather than to increase; and they would therefore receive no aid from
                    him in their migrations from one region to another. Hence we find that those
                    countries which are widely separated, and which present no practicable
                    communication for animals, have each its own peculiar and distinct class.
                    America has an entirely different race of animals from Africa or Asia; while the
                    animals that are found in the islands or continent of Australasia (New Holland),
                    resemble those of no other quarter of the world. The zoology of Asia and Africa,
                    from their vicinity, and from the comparatively easy communication between them,
                    does not present such diversities; yet it is remarkable, that while the lion is
                    common over all Africa, the tiger has never yet been seen; while in Asia it is
                    just the reverse, the tiger, and not the lion, being the more common of the two.
                    There can be no reason, we should imagine, why the tiger should be confined to
                    Asia, while there are other countries equally suited to his habits, except that,
                    being indigenous in the regions of Eastern Asia, he has never been able to cross
                    the barrier of mountains and deserts by which these regions are separated from
                    Persia on the west. Beyond the western banks of the Indus the country is
                    mountainous and impassable, and the climate extremely cold; the ridges from the
                    Himalaya Mountains extending southward nearly to the sea, and the country beyond
                    being merely a narrow strip of hot and sandy desert. Beyond this, farther to the
                    west, extensive deserts are found, destitute of water and of all traces of
                    vegetation, which would as effectually oppose the passage of wild beasts as the
                    trackless ocean which divides Africa and America, and leaves to each its own
                    class of indigenous animals. The other wild animals of Southern Asia are
                    leopards, hyenas, jackals, tiger-cats, wild boars, antelopes, elks, red and
                    moose deer, foxes, hares, mangooses, ferrets, porcupines, &amp;c. All these are
                    to be found in the southern plains of Asia. The hyenas, wolves, jackals, and
                    bears, abound in some of the hilly tracts, and in the mountains of Belochistan
                    and the other countries to the west of the Indus. The three first make dreadful
                    havock among the flocks. The same animals are found in Persia, Mesopotamia, in
                    Asia Minor, and in Palestine: and it is said that the lion is occasionally seen
                    on the banks of the Jordan. The ounce is a formidable animal in these countries
                    and in Syria, and is sometimes mistaken for the tiger. The timid zebra is found
                    in the depths of the Persian forests.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    30, and frequently seize a bullock, which they kill in a few minutes.<note

                    native of Persia, and is remarkably wild, and fleet in its movements. It is also
                    common in the northern mountains of India, and in the countries to the west of
                    the Indus. The wild sheep and the wild goat are common among the mountains.</p>
                <p>Of the domestic animals, the elephant claims the preeminence, being unequalled by
                    any other animal for the purposes of draught. This animal is confined to the
                    southern countries of India, where the climate is hot, being seldom seen in the
                    mountainous tracts towards the north. The camel is used for domestic purposes
                    over a far wider extent of country than the elephant. This animal is of two
                    species, the one with two humps, and the dromedary with only one hump; and it is
                    domesticated all over India and the mountainous countries to the north of the
                    Himalaya ridge, in Balk or Bactria, in Buckharia, in Tartary, in all the
                    countries bordering on the Caspian Sea, even in the southern provinces of
                    Europe, in Persia, Asia Minor, and the countries bordering on the Black Sea, and
                    in the Arabian deserts. The two-humped camel is a remarkably useful animal for
                    burden, being heavy in his make, with enormous bones, shaggy coat, amazing
                    strength, and incredible patience of fatigue and of thirst. The dromedary is
                    chiefly used for travelling, and its valuable quality is swiftness, by which,
                    joined to its capacity of enduring hardship, it is qualified to travel at an
                    incredible rate for many successive days. In all the low countries, especially
                    in the dry and sandy tracts, such as Arabia, Syria, &amp;c. the dromedary is
                    employed. The twohumped camel is a native of the high countries in the
                    neighbourhood of the Oxus and the Jaxartes, where it is <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193104440" xml:id="kp-eb0703-4440-0683"/>still chiefly used. So large
                    a portion of Asia is occupied by vast plains and wastes of sand, that its
                    interior intercourse must be maintained by land journeys. But without the aid of
                    the camel it would be impossible to traverse extensive deserts, destitute both
                    of food and water; and in those arid countries such an animal, which has been
                    truly called the <hi rend="italic">ship</hi> of the desert, is the most valuable
                    gift which Providence could bestow.</p>
                <p>The other domestic animals of Southern and Western Asia are horses, mules, asses,
                    buffaloes, black cattle, sheep, goats, &amp;c. Arabia may be considered the
                    native country of the horse, in which he arrives at the highest perfection, and
                    combines all the most estimable qualities of symmetry of form, fineness of skin,
                    fire, docility of temper, fleetness, and hardiness. It is chiefly from the
                    Arabian breed that the horses in other parts of the world have been improved. In
                    Persia the horses are neither so graceful nor so swift as those of Arabia, being
                    high, with long legs, spare carcasses, and large heads; but they are highly
                    prized by the inhabitants for their extraordinary capacity of enduring fatigue.
                    To the east of Persia, at Herat, the breed of horses is fine; also on the banks
                    of the Indus and its tributaries; and in the higher regions of Balk and
                    Buckharia they are excellent and numerous, and are exported in great numbers to
                    Hindostan.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Elphinstone’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Account of Cabul,</hi> chap. vi.</p></note> The mule and the
                    ass, all over India, are miserable animals. The mules are of a better quality in
                    the Punjaub, on· the upper course of the Indus, and they improve still more
                    farther west. In the countries west of the Indus they are superior to those in
                    Hindostan, and in Persia there is still a finer breed. But the mule of the east
                    is inferior to that of England. The ass partakes of a similar improvement in his
                    progress west, and is a far finer animal in Western Asia than in Europe. In
                    Syria, Palestine, and generally in Asia Minor, he is-distinguished by agility,
                    fire, and patience of fatigue, and ranks in the first class of domestic animals.
                    Buffaloes are found in the hot plains of Asia, as well as in the mountainous
                    tracts; and the oxen which are used in the plough have all a hump on their
                    backs. The wealth of the pastoral tribes who rove about in the western plains of
                    Khorassan, and in the hilly tracts of Afghanistan, consists chiefly in sheep,
                    which have tails a foot broad, and composed entirely of fat, and in other
                    respects resemble the English sheep, being better and handsomer than those of
                    India.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Tbid.</hi> p. 143.</p></note> Goats are common all over Asia, especially in the
                    mountains, where there are some breeds with curiously twisted horns; and they
                    are by no means scarce in the plains.</p>
                <p>In the northern parts of Asia, and in the high mountain tracts, a different class
                    of animals is to be found. These cold regions are not distinguished by the same
                    profusion of animal life as the tropical countries. The beasts of the forest
                    decrease in numbers, in size, and also in fierceness; and the wolf, the bear,
                    and the wild boar, are the only ferocious animals which thrive in these northern
                    climates. In advancing on the desolate plains of Siberia to about the 60th
                    degree of N. lat., we find the cold still taking effect on the animal as on the
                    vegetable creation, and the living creatures as well as the plants and trees
                    stinted in their fair proportions. Beyond this limit a different order of
                    animals appears, protected against the severity of the climate by a thick
                    covering of fur, which is sought after as a rich article of dress in more
                    opulent countries. These animals are accordingly hunted for their skins, which
                    constitute the great staple article of trade in Northern Asia. In the Arctic
                    regions the bear seems to form the only exception to the diminished grandeur of
                    the animal creation. This animal, nourished in the regions of perpetual snow,
                    acquires a larger size and far greater power and fierceness than in southern
                    climates. The domestic animals of the northern and mountainous countries of Asia
                    are of a less imposing appearance, and not nearly of the same strength as those
                    in the lower valleys of the south and west. In the high and cold plains of
                    Central Asia the camel is no longer used as a beast of burden, nor in the
                    northern parts of the continent. Thibet, Tartary, and the plains to the north of
                    the Altai Mountains, are mostly inhabited by Tartar tribes, whose wealth
                    consists in their cattle, which not only furnish them with food, clothing, and
                    shelter, but are also used as beasts of burden, and in the labours of
                    agriculture. The yak of Tartary, or the bushy-tailed bull of Thibet, seems to
                    supply the place of the camel in these mountainous countries. This animal is
                    about the size of an English bull, of great strength, and is reckoned a valuable
                    property among the itinerant hordes of Tartars, to whom it affords tho means of
                    easy conveyance, of clothing, and shelter for their tents, from the prodigious
                    quantity of long flowing glossy hair on its tail, and finally of subsistence
                    from its milk and flesh. In those mountains is also found the musk-deer, which
                    delights in the most intense cold, and of which the musk, a secretion by the
                    male, affords a revenue to the government, as well as a valuable article of
                    trade. Here also, on the highest mountains, amid ice and snow, is the Cashmere
                    goat, the wool of which affords the materials of the finest shawls.<note

                    >Embassy to Thibet,</hi> p. 186.</p></note> Wild horses are seen in the high
                    plains of Thibet; and the breed of sheep, a peculiar species of which is
                    indigenous to the climate, is of great value. They are nourished on the short
                    and dry herbage of these exposed plains, and serve for subsistence to the
                    inhabitants, as well as for beasts of burden. The wild and extensive plains of
                    Tartary are inhabited by pastoral tribes, who depend in like manner on their
                    herds. On the southern side of the Altai Mountains we find the same tribes of
                    wanderers, most of them the scattered remnants of the Tartar nations who had
                    formerly so deep a share in the great revolutions of Asia. All these tribes
                    subsist chiefly by pasturage. Near the Ural Mountains some live chiefly by
                    hunting or ensnaring the elk and other wild animals for their furs. Among those
                    who are shepherds, sheep and horned cattle are found; while the hunting tribes
                    have scarcely any domestic animals. In all these countries the wolf and the bear
                    are known to abound. In the rigorous climate farther to the north, where the
                    cattle are stunted in size, and can scarcely subsist, their place is supplied by
                    the rein-deer, a species peculiar to this rigorous climate, and most valuable
                    for all domestic purposes, whether for draught or for subsistence. During part
                    of the year the inhabitants of those desolate countries subsist upon its flesh
                    or milk, its skin furnishes them with the chief part of their dress, and its
                    horns with such domestic utensils as they require. The dog is also trained to
                    draw the sledge.</p>
                <p>The feathered race in Asia includes almost every known species. In the southern
                    parts are found all the tropical birds, distinguished by the most beautiful
                    plumage, and some of them uttering sounds that have a resemblance to the human
                    voice. Here are also found some of the largest and rarest birds,—the ostrich,
                    the cassowary, and in the Himalaya Mountains the condor, one of which, shot by a
                    British officer, is stated by Bishop Heber to have measured from the extremity
                    of one wing to another the enormous length of 14 feet. The other birds are <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193104453" xml:id="kp-eb0703-4453-0684"/> eagles, kites,
                    vultures, magpies in the higher countries, hawks, crows, wild geese and ducks,
                    flamingos, herons, bustards, florikens, rock pigeons, lapwings, storks, plovers,
                    snipes, quails, partridges, different species of the ortolan tribe, and almost
                    all the other small birds to be found in similar climates. In Northern Asia the
                    feathered creation is nearly the same as in Europe.</p>
                <p>The principle of life, which is so active throughout the torrid zone, and
                    produces quadrupeds of the most enormous size, is also visible in the magnitude
                    and numbers of the reptile tribe, many of them armed with the most fatal
                    poisons, all of them odious to the sight, and some, such as the boa constrictor,
                    attaining the length of 30 feet, and of such prodigious muscular strength as to
                    coil round and crush the largest animals to death. The influence of cold is
                    adverse to the growth of these serpents, which are not found in Asia to the
                    north of the Altai Mountains. The shark, which is found in all warm climates,
                    haunts the tropical seas of Asia; and the crocodile, which is a different animal
                    from the alligator of America, though equally powerful and ferocious, infests
                    the rivers. All sorts of insects, namely, musquitoes, ants, gnats, flies,
                    &amp;c. most of them noxious and destructive, swarm in the torrid regions of
                    this continent. During the short summers of Northern Asia the musquito and other
                    insects abound in the woody tracts of Siberia, insomuch that near the Ural
                    Mountains the peasants burn constant fires before their cottages, as a defence
                    against their attacks.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    locust, which is peculiar to certain parts of Asia, is the most mischievous of
                    all these winged creatures. They light upon a country in a cloud which darkens
                    the air, and leave nothing green behind them; fields sown with grain being
                    utterly laid waste, and trees stript of their leaves, and of all power to ripen
                    their fruits. They overspread the country with an appearance of blackness for
                    many miles; and when they are driven by the winds into the sea, their dead
                    bodies cover the shore in heaps. These destructive animals appear occasionally
                    in the countries to the north and west of the Indus, in Belochistan, in the
                    desert tracts of Khorassan, and in Persia.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Asia has been subject to more awful revolutions than any other part of the world.
                    Though it was at a very <hi rend="superscript">:</hi> early period the seat of
                    flourishing kingdoms, it was soon desolated by war. Its wealthy cities, sacked
                    by their conquerors, fell into decay and ruin; and many of its countries, once
                    civilized and populous, now languish in desolation from violence and misrule.
                    The mighty revolutions which have shaken this continent form an interesting
                    subject, on which volumes might be filled. All that we can propose is a
                    historical sketch of the great leading events which distinguish the annals of
                    Asia, with a brief notice of the various nations which have flourished, or are
                    now to be found within its limits.</p>
                <p>The early history of Asia, like that of all other countries, is lost in
                    antiquity; and the obscurity is but slightly dissipated by the indistinct
                    accounts which we receive from the Greek historians, and the brief notices in
                    the sacred volume, of the Assyrian and Babylonian empires. The Assyrian empire
                    appears to have been established by Ninus or Belus, the Nimrod of the
                    Scriptures, who, we are told, began to be mighty on the earth, and the beginning
                    of whose kingdom was Babel or Babylon.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Genesis, chap. x.</p></note> It was farther enlarged by the
                    renowned queen Semiramis, who carried her arms into India, and extended her sway
                    from the Euphrates to the Indus. The great city of Nineveh had its origin about
                    the same time as Babylon. Sardanapalus was the last king of the Assyrian empire,
                    which subsisted, according to some historians, 1300 or 1450 years. But Herodotus
                    fixes its duration, on what authority does not appear, at 520 years.
                    Sardanapalus was dethroned by Arbaces, governor of Media; and on the ruins of
                    this kingdom two others arose, namely, the empire of Nineveh, under Arbaces,
                    formerly governor of Media; and the empire of Babylon, under Belesis, the former
                    governor of that city. Nineveh was the capital of the former empire, which
                    embraced the countries on the upper course of the Euphrates and Tigris, and also
                    the country to the east. To the empire of Babylon belonged Chaldea, including
                    the lower valley of the Euphrates. This revolution took place in the 747th year
                    before the Christian era, and in the 7th year after the building of Rome.<note

                    Some are of opinion that three kingdoms arose on the ruin of the Assyrian
                    empire; but this is generally considered to be an error, the two supposed kings,
                    Arbaces and Tiglath-Pileser or Ninus the younger, being the same person.</p>
                <p>It is conjectured that the cities of Babylon and Nineveh were begun about 100
                    years after the flood, or in the year of the world 1771. At the same time we
                    have no data for fixing, with accuracy the chronology of this early period; and
                    the different opinions held by most learned writers sufficiently mark the
                    uncertainty of history in those ancient times. It would appear, however, that
                    the fertile countries of Asia were rapidly overspread with inhabitants. Abraham,
                    according to the Jewish chronology, was born 290 years after the flood; and in
                    his time we hear of the cities of Ur of the Chaldees and of Damascus, besides
                    others which had arisen in the valley of the Jordan, the inhabitants of which
                    devoted themselves to commerce and agriculture; and we are told that this tract
                    of country was well watered, and was even as the garden of the Lord, like the
                    land of Egypt.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Genesis,
                    chap, xiii.</p></note> But from the incidents related, it would still appear,
                    that excepting the plains of Jordan, which were brought under cultivation, the
                    country was occupied by pastoral tribes. Abraham, when he proposes to separate
                    from Lot, in consequence of the strife of their herdsmen, tells him that the
                    whole land is before him; and he gives him his choice of either going to the
                    right or to the left with his flocks; an arrangement which was scarcely
                    consistent with a high state of cultivation, and which could not have been
                    afterwards proposed when the country was fully peopled.</p>
                <p>The posterity of Abraham, who were settled in Egypt, having greatly multiplied in
                    the course of 450 years, were at last permitted to depart; and having crossed
                    the Red Sea, they pursued their triumphant march to the land of Canaan,
                    expelling or extirpating the inhabitants. Thus was laid the foundation of the
                    Jewish commonwealth, which became, in the prosperous reigns of David and
                    Solomon, one of the most flourishing empires of Asia, extending on the east as
                    far as the Euphrates, and having ports both on the Red Sea and in the
                    Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>Western Asia was in this manner occupied between the 7th and 8th centuries before
                    the Christian era by the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104466"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-4466-0685"/>great Assyrian empires of Nineveh and Babylon, and
                    by the kingdom of Israel. The limits of the first two to the east and west are
                    not accurately defined. The Assyrian monarchs sometimes carried their victorious
                    arms eastward into Bactriana and to the Indus; but whether they ruled over these
                    conquered countries is uncertain. Their empire, it is probable, extended
                    westward into Asia Minor. On the shores of the Mediterranean, Tyre, with several
                    other flourishing cities, had at a very early period attained to wealth and
                    splendour. Arabia was, as at this day, inhabited by wandering tribes of
                    shepherds and robbers; and other tribes of the same character had spread
                    themselves abroad on the northern plains.</p>
                <p>The great ruling powers of Asia were engaged in continual wars; and the Medes,
                    having thrown off the Assyrian yoke, contended with the others for the dominion
                    of the world. Having joined the Babylonians, they invaded the kingdom of
                    Nineveh, already broken by repeated assaults, and took and burnt the capital,
                    thus bringing to an end this great and ancient empire, which had flourished
                    nearly 1500 years, and 135 years after its separation from Babylon. The rise of
                    these formidable empires on the Euphrates was portentous to the peace and safety
                    of the neighbouring states. The kingdom of Israel, weakened by the revolt of the
                    ten tribes, was accordingly invaded by the Assyrian armies. Samaria was subdued;
                    and Jerusalem, overpowered by the victorious armies of Babylon, was taken and
                    utterly destroyed, and the people carried away captive. The overthrow of the
                    Jewish kingdom took place 588 years before the Christian era.</p>
                <p>Persia did not at this period <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. μ.</hi> 3405, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 599) include more than one province of the extensive
                    country since known under that name, nor did it contain more than 120,000
                    inhabitants. But it was soon after united with Media, under the vigorous rule of
                    Cyrus; and that warlike monarch enlarged his dominions on every side. Having
                    subdued the Lydians under Croesus, the allies of the king of Babylon, and the
                    other adjacent states in Asia Minor, he thence proceeded into Syria and Arabia,
                    which he also subjected; and extending his conquests from the Aegean Sea to the
                    river Euphrates, he finally advanced against Babylon, and, having taken that
                    great city, put an end for ever to the Assyrian empire, which had been renowned
                    from the earliest period of the world. The kingdom of Babylon had subsisted,
                    after its separation from Nineveh, 209 years. It was overthrown 50 years after
                    the destruction of Jerusalem, and 540 years before the Christian era.</p>
                <p>Persia continued to rule over Asia for above 200 years, when its power was
                    overthrown by Alexander the Great. His extensive conquests were divided among
                    his generals, who renewed the strife for dominion which had been for a time
                    extinguished by the ascendancy of Persia. Amid these contentions Parthia and
                    Bactriana in the east rose to the rank of independent states. The Roman armies
                    entered Asia about 200 years before the Christian era, and subduing all
                    opposition, they finally established the dominion of Rome from the Hellespont to
                    the eastern boundary of the Euphrates. By the decided triumph of this great
                    power mankind obtained a fresh respite from the calamities of war. It was the
                    first care of the Romans to cement by policy what they had gained by arms, and
                    to establish order and tranquillity in all parts of their widely extended
                    territories. From this period, accordingly, may be dated the commencement of
                    that brilliant era of prosperity and repose enjoyed by this portion of Western
                    Asia for nearly 700 years, the time which elapsed from its final conquest by the
                    Roman armies under Pompey to its subjugation by the Saracens in the 638th year
                    of the Christian era. The people, profiting by the singular felicity of their
                    lot, devoted their attention to commerce and the arts of peace, and attained to
                    a high degree of wealth and refinement. All the civil institutions of society
                    flourished; science and literature were cultivated; and mankind, basking in the
                    sunshine of domestic repose, seemed to enjoy the illusion of perfect happiness.
                    It is estimated that 500 populous cities covered the face of the country. These
                    were adorned with magnificent temples and other splendid monuments of art; and
                    some of them, such as Pergamus, Smyrna, Ephesus, &amp;c. and especially Antioch
                    and Alexandria, rivalled in extent and magnificence the majesty of Rome
                    itself.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Gibbon’s <hi

                    and China, though imperfectly known in Europe, had flourished for many
                    centuries. The origin of the Hindoo power is buried in a remote antiquity. The
                    first authentic notice of this mild and pacific people was brought to Europe by
                    the officers who accompanied Alexander’s expedition to India. Prior to the era
                    of the Mahometan conquest in the year 1000, the Hindoos possess very imperfect
                    materials for their history.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Hindostan.</hi></p></note> Hindostan comprehended then, as now, the extensive
                    country bounded by the Indus on the west and the Ganges on the east, though we
                    know but little of its boundaries or internal state. The origin of the Chinese,
                    as of other nations, is hid in obscurity. They claim their descent from a very
                    high antiquity, their history going back by tradition to the remote period of 40
                    centuries, and for 2000 years their annals are verified by the testimony of
                    contemporary historians. It is quite certain, indeed, that long before the
                    Christian era they had emerged from the barbarism of pastoral life, and were
                    devoted to agriculture and commerce; that they had acquired wealth and
                    prosperity, and were thoroughly instructed in all the arts and refinements of
                    civilized nations.</p>
                <p>The historical sketch which we have given above includes only the civilized
                    portion of India. But a great proportion of her population were in ancient times
                    shepherds, who dwelt in tents; and it is the more necessary to attend to the
                    distinction between these two classes, as it will be found to illustrate the
                    political history of Asia, and those stupendous revolutions which have not only
                    shaken this continent to its centre, but have been extended to the remotest
                    parts of the world.</p>
                <p>It has been already mentioned that the vast table-land of Central Asia, though
                    containing large tracts of desert, is nevertheless interspersed with fertile and
                    well-watered valleys, which produce abundance of pasture; and the immense plain
                    to the north of the Altai Mountains, which extends over the whole breadth of the
                    continent, from the Eastern Ocean to the Volga, is one continued meadow,
                    affording subsistence for innumerable herds of cattle. In all ages, accordingly,
                    those plains have been inhabited by wandering tribes of shepherds, rude,
                    ferocious, and delighting in war. It is finely observed by the Roman historian,
                    that “the pastoral manners, which have been adorned with the fairest attributes
                    of peace and innocence, are much better adapted to the fierce and cruel habits
                    of a military life.” Such, accordingly, has been the character of all the
                    pastoral nations. They have been always <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104479"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-4479-0686"/>addicted to violence and plunder; and their
                    predatory expeditions, whether for the plunder of individuals or of empires,
                    have been invariably conducted with the same fierceness and cruelty. In a
                    pastoral state every man is a soldier, and he is trained to war by his daily
                    occupations. He is hardened in his body by continual exercise and exposure to
                    the weather; in hunting the wild animals of the forest, he acquires skill in
                    horsemanship and in the use of all warlike weapons; and in the perpetual
                    migrations of his tribe, which must be carried on with the same order as the
                    march of an army, he is trained to vigilance and discipline. These wandering
                    barbarians were, besides, engaged, as may be easily supposed, in continual wars
                    with each other. Here, as elsewhere, the usual scarcity of subsistence and of
                    room would soon be experienced with the progress of population. Disputes would
                    thence arise, and fierce contests, which would only terminate with the
                    destruction of one or other of the contending tribes. Of such obscure wars we
                    have no accurate account, though it is certain, that from time immemorial the
                    work of mutual slaughter has been going on in the interior of Asia; and it is
                    obvious that those vast multitudes, if they had been united under some able
                    leader, who could compose or crush all domestic dissentions, might, in place of
                    wasting their strength in intestine strife, have directed it against the
                    civilized portion of the earth, where wealth presented a tempting prize to
                    barbarian cupidity; and, accordingly, this was precisely the calamity by which
                    mankind were at length overtaken. The world was to be disturbed by a conflict,
                    not as heretofore between improved states, but between barbarism and refinement.
                    The question was now to be decided, whether polished nations or barbarians
                    should rule the world; whether literature, science, the arts, the improved
                    institutions, and the whole order of civilized society, should be broken up and
                    buried under an overrunning flood of savage hostility. From the earliest times
                    the countries of Asia Minor, and some parts of Europe, were subjected to the
                    irruptions of barbarians; but no permanent conquest was ever attempted, and the
                    invaders were in general quickly repelled. Asia Minor was defended against the
                    inroads of the Scythians by the Persian monarch; and Rome, in the lion-like
                    vigour of her growing strength, quickly shook off such unequal adversaries.
                    Whether, however, from the increasing population of the Asiatic plains, or from
                    the greater political union of the different tribes, those attacks were renewed
                    with more vigour than ever; and at times the mighty mass of population over the
                    whole breadth of the continent seemed to be agitated by one movement; and,
                    according as the impulse given was to the east or to the west, the kingdoms of
                    Europe or the empires of Hindostan and China were swept by the tempest of
                    invasion. Those formidable expeditions were attended with various results. In
                    those states which were vigorously ruled, the discipline and tactics of
                    civilized warriors proved an overmatch for the untutored valour of barbarians.
                    But, on the other hand, when the people, enervated by ease and luxury, neglected
                    the study of war, and trusted for safety to a mercenary force, the country was
                    overwhelmed by its barbarian conquerors. The Chinese empire was overturned about
                    200 years before the Christian era, by an irruption of the Huns; the fertile
                    countries, on the banks of the Oxus, and of the Jaxartes as far as the Caspian
                    Sea, which had attained to wealth and prosperity under the Macedonian kings, and
                    had ever since been cultivated like a garden, were reduced by the white Huns,
                    and under their sway Carisme, Buckharia, and Samarcand became the seats of
                    industry and of flourishing manufactures, and the great marts of the Indian and
                    European commerce; while the Roman territory in the west was repeatedly
                    assailed, and finally overturned, by hosts of barbarians, who had quitted the
                    crowded plains of Asia in quest of settlements to be won at the point of the
                    sword.</p>
                <p>It was about the middle of the 7th century that the Mahometan power emerged from
                    the Arabian deserts; and the shepherds of those burning plains, inflamed by
                    religious enthusiasm and the love of plunder, were equally formidable in war
                    with their brethren of the north. Of all the invaders who, in this unhappy
                    period, desolated the world, the Arabian tribes were the most fierce and cruel.
                    Their religion enjoined the blindest intolerance; they were commanded to
                    propagate their faith by the sword; and it was accounted a merit in a true
                    believer to shed torrents of Christian blood. The track of Mahometan invasion
                    was accordingly marked by the ruin of peaceful cities and by unsparing
                    slaughter. In the course of two years the plain and valley of Syria was subdued
                    by the Arabs or Saracens, whose conquests were soon extended over Asia Minor in
                    the west and Persia in the east; and the country of Transoxiana, or the fertile
                    plains lying on the Oxus and the Jaxartes, were, after several severe battles,
                    reduced under the power of the caliphs, whose authority, a century after the
                    flight of Mahomet from Mecca in the year 662, extended in Asia about 200 days’
                    journey from east to west, from the confines of Tartary and India to the shores
                    of the Hellespont, and in Europe as far west as the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
                <p>The dominions of the Arabian princes, in their widest extent, were divided into
                    provinces, under subordinate governors, who owned themselves the servants or
                    slaves of the caliph at Bagdad, their temporal as well as spiritual ruler. In
                    the decay of the supreme power, those rulers, under the forms of the most abject
                    submission, had acquired independence; and the caliph remained at Bagdad the
                    vain object of outward homage, while he was inwardly despised. The Persian
                    kingdom was also detached from their dominion, being usurped by a new dynasty,
                    and was extended from the Caspian Sea to the ocean. This dynasty, as usually
                    happens in disorderly times, was supplanted by two families, who, making a
                    division of the kingdom, ruled, the one over Khorassan, Seistan, the high plains
                    of Balk on the northern side of the great Himalaya ridge, and the countries of
                    Transoxiana, with the cities of Buckharia and Samarcand; and the other over the
                    southern provinces of Persia, as far as the Persian Gulf, namely, Irak, Fars,
                    Kerman, Khusistan, and Laristan. These families appear to have ruled in Persia
                    for 125 years, namely, from 874 to 999. They were overthrown by the Turkish
                    princes of the line of the Gaznevides, the founder of which was Subuctageen or
                    Sebectagi, who, from a common soldier, rose to the rank of a petty prince, and
                    fixed his residence at Ghizni. His dominions consisted chiefly of the tract of
                    country which, after the division of Alexander’s empire, composed the kingdom of
                    Bactria, namely, the countries lying between the Caspian Sea and the Indus, and
                    near the source of the Oxus. He invaded Hindostan, subdued Northern India and
                    the province of the Punjaub, and rendered the princes of the countries tributary
                    to the princes of Ghizni.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    after the birth of Christ, was still more famous for the extent of his
                    conquests. He had extended his empire northward by the reduction of Buckharia;
                    and he now determined, in the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104492"

                    holy war against the idolaters of Hindostan. At this period the Mahometans had
                    effected no permanent settlement in Hindostan. The people were purely Hindoo,
                    without any admixture of foreign manners; and the whole country along the east
                    side of the Indus to Cashmere was ruled by a prince of the Brahmin race, and
                    between whom and the kings of Delhi, Agimere, Canoge, and Callinger, a
                    confederacy was now formed against the common enemy of their country and

                    kings, he reduced the province of Moultan. Eight years afterwards he penetrated
                    into the heart of India, where his farther progress was opposed by the
                    confederated princes of the country, from the Ganges westward to the Neerbuddah.
                    But the fanatical invader was still victorious, and his progress was signalized
                    by rapine and slaughter. The idols were all broken to pieces, the temples, many
                    of them of the most beautiful architecture, were pulled down, and an immense
                    spoil was carried away. In the course of his twelve expeditions into India
                    Mahmoud extended his conquests to the Ganges; and when he died in 1028, his
                    territories were of great extent. The annals of those disorderly times afford no
                    very accurate data for ascertaining their exact limits, which are variously
                    stated by writers of great authority. According to Major Rennel, the empire
                    which he established comprehended the eastern, and by much the largest part of
                    Persia, and extended nominally from the upper and western course of the Ganges
                    to the peninsula of Guzcrat, and from the Indus to the mountains of Agimere in
                    Northern India.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Major

                    Sir J. Malcolm assigns Georgia and Bagdad for its limits on the west and
                    south-west; Buckharia and Cashgar on the north and north-east; and Bengal and
                    the Deccan, as far as the Indian Ocean, to the east and south-east. But though a
                    large portion of Hindostan was at this time overrun by the Mahometan armies, it
                    was only the Punjaub, or the country of the five rivers, that was entirely
                    reduced under any regular government, the other parts of the country being
                    merely occupied by troops.</p>
                <p>The empire of Mahmoud declined after his death, owing to divisions and civil
                    wars, but chiefly to the rise of the great Tartar or Turkish tribe of the
                    Seljookee, so called from the name of their renowned chief Seljook, who, being
                    banished by his khan or chief from Turkestan, passed the Jaxartes with his
                    numerous followers, and settled in the plains pf Buckharia, in the neighbourhood
                    of Samarcand, where he embraced the Mahometan religion. It is only when those
                    barbarous hordes emerge from the desert, and come into contact with civilized
                    life, that we obtain any clear account of their migrations and history. Their
                    contests with each other, and their obscure wanderings in the interior, are not
                    chronicled among themselves, and are seldom known to other nations. Hence we
                    have rarely any clear data for tracing their origin, or their early conquests,
                    or the consolidation of many tribes into one great nation. It is certain,
                    however, that the vast population of Asia, agitated by internal tempests, has
                    been always violently driven on the great empires of China and Hindostan, or on
                    those of Persia and Rome, and has either made a breach, or, if repelled, has
                    assailed the civilized world at some other more vulnerable point. China has been
                    in all ages an object of attack; and it is generally believed that the Turks,
                    and especially that tribe of them under Seliook, had been driven by the Chinese
                    and a tribe of Tartars from the high plains of Asia, a short time before they
                    sought refuge in the provinces of Transoxiana. They were living near the
                    territories of Buckharia when they first attracted the notice of the Sultan
                    Mahmoud, the founder of the dynasty of the Gaznevides, who had advanced into
                    Buckharia with his army, and was so impressed with the fine military qualities
                    of their chief, the son of Seljook, that he induced them to cross the Oxus and
                    to occupy the country of Khorassan.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    repent of this fatal error. Like all those wandering hordes, the Turkmans or
                    Turks were shepherds or robbers. They either molested the neighbouring states by
                    petty inroads, or, with the whole united force of the nation, they practised
                    robbery on the great scale, seizing on kingdoms and despoiling nations. The
                    first emigration of these eastern Turkmans is generally fixed in the 10th
                    century. They became formidable to Mahmoud, and more especially to his successor
                    Massoud, who, from inability to resist their progress, was ’forced to grant them
                    lands. He was afterwards defeated by them in a general battle; and the vic-,
                    torious Turks, under their leader Togrul Beg, whom they had now elected king,
                    invaded Khorassan, and finally expelled the Gaznevides, the descendants of
                    Mahmoud, from the eastern provinces of Persia. They fled eastward towards the
                    Indus, and established the Ghiznian empire in the south-western provinces of
                    India. This empire was maintained with various success till about the year 1184,

                    of its limits, which in such turbulent times would naturally vary with the
                    fortune of war. They appear to have embraced the eastern parts of Persia, the
                    mountain country of Cabul or Afghanistan, and the Indian provinces of Lahore and
                    Moultan. The Ghiznian dynasty was superseded by that of the Afghan or the Patan
                    emperors, who completed the conquest of the greatest part of Hindostan Proper
                    about the year 1210. Togrul Beg hastened to improve his victory over the Persian
                    monarch. Turning his arms to the west, he invaded Irak, in the centre of Persia,
                    and advancing westward of the Caspian Sea into Azerbijan, the ancient Media, he
                    made his first approaches to the confines of the Roman empire. He afterwards
                    proceeded to Bagdad, and by his conquest of that place he gained possession of
                    the person of the caliph, who was treated with the most profound veneration. His
                    successors Alp Arslan and Malek Shah extended the empire transmitted to them by
                    Togrul Beg. They subdued the fairest portion of Asia. Jerusalem and the Holy
                    Land, which flourished under the mild sway of the caliphs, was taken and
                    pillaged by one of the lieutenants of Malek Shah; and it was the vexation and
                    rapine to which the Christian pilgrims were exposed in their journey to
                    Jerusalem under the barbarous rule of the house of Seljook, that inflamed the
                    indignation of the Christian powers, and gave rise to those wild and warlike
                    expeditions for the recovery of the Holy Land, known under the name of the
                    Crusades. The empire of the Seljookian Turks extended, under Malek Shah, from
                    Egypt and Syria to Buckharia, which he conquered as far as Samarcand and
                    Kharisme. He received homage from the tribes beyond the Jaxartes, and compelled

                <p>From this period till the invasion of Zinghis or Ghenghis Khan, which is 110
                    years, namely, from 1092 to 1202, Asia was convulsed by foreign and intestine
                    wars. The death of Malek Shah dissolved the unity of his extensive empire, in
                    which three new dynastics arose; while in many cases the provincial governors
                    contended for supreme authority, and harassed the country by their mutual wars.
                    It was during this era of division and weakness that Asia Minor, which was ruled
                    by the dynastics of Iconium and Aleppo, was invaded by the hosts of the European
                    crusaders, who rapidly subdued the country, took the holy city of Jerusalem, and
                    extending their conquests over the hills of Armenia and the plains of
                    Mesopotamia, founded the first principality of the Franks or Latins, which
                    subsisted 54 years, beyond the Euphrates. Those European invaders retained
                    possession of Asia Minor and of Syria for nearly 200 years. Exhausted at length
                    by a long series of sanguinary services, and not receiving reinforcements from
                    home, they were finally driven from all their conquests by the coalition of the
                    Turkish powers.</p>
                <p>The Turkish dynasty of the Seljooks continued for 158 years, or 215 years if we
                    reckon from the time that the tribe first emerged from the desert under its
                    leader Seljook. The sultan of Carisme orKharisme, who ruled over the country

                <p>The continued irruptions of those barbarous tribes into the regions of
                    civilization had given rise to scenes of calamity and of revolution hitherto
                    unequalled in the history of the world. Conquests had no doubt been achieved
                    before by the warlike nations of antiquity, and the rage of war had been
                    satiated by the ruin of peaceful cities and the massacre of the people. But
                    these evils, great as they were, fell far short of those inflicted on mankind by
                    the conquests of the pastoral tribes, which were carried to such a height by
                    Zinghis Khan and his destroying bands, as nearly to threaten the desolation of
                    the earth, and the extinction of all the arts, improvements, and civil
                    institutions of society. This Tartar chief, or savage, who was originally the
                    khan of a horde of shepherds, comprising 30,000 or 40,000 families, inhabiting
                    the countries to the north of China, seems, about the beginning of the 13th
                    century, to have united under his sway all the other tribes which, under the
                    various designations of Huns, Turks, Moguls, or Tartar⅛ <hi rend="subscript">

                    of AsiajmetWen China, Siberia, and the Caspian Sea. He became, to use the
                    expressive language of the great Roman historian, “the monarch of the
                    pastoral-world, the lord of many millions of shepherds and soldiers, who felt
                    their united strength, and were impatient to rush on the mild and wealthy
                    climates of the south.” This great conqueror swept over the whole breadth of the
                    earth with his barbarian hordes. Art and nature were found alike unequal to stay
                    his destructive course. He traversed mountains and rivers, barren deserts and
                    unhealthy climates, with resistless speed; and he oppressed the walled towns by
                    his countless multitudes. The Chinese were the first enemies with whom, after
                    quitting the desert, he measured his strength. His innumerable squadrons
                    penetrated at all points the feeble rampart of the great wall. Ninety-six cities
                    were plundered and destroyed, and the smaller towns and villages were reduced to
                    ashes; the aged were given up to the destroying sword; a prodigious multitude of
                    childern were carried away, who were afterwards massacred in the march homeward;
                    besides a rich spoil in gold, silver, silk, and cattle.<note anchored="true"

                    successful; the emperor fled before his enemies to a more southern residence’;
                    Yenking or Peking was taken and burnt; and, through the weakness and division of
                    the Chinese councils, the five northern provinces of the empire were reduced
                    under the dominion of the Moguls. <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> The invincible
                    arms of Zinghis were now turned against the sultan of Carisme or Kharisme, who,
                    as has been already mentioned, ruled over the fertile countries situated between
                    the Oxus and the Jaxartes, and had extended his conquests over a great part of
                    Persia. At this period his territories contained the flourishing and commercial
                    cities of Samarcand, Buckharia, Carisme, Herat, Balk, &amp;c. His troops were
                    overpowered in a bloody conflict with the Tartar host, the country was subdued,
                    and the rights of conquest were as usual most savagely abused. The open country
                    was desolated; the rich cities plundered, and the inhabitants either slaughtered
                    or carried into captivity; and in some cases every thing that had life, with the
                    city itself, was destroyed. The cities that perished in this general ruin were,
                    Buckharia, situated on a branch of the Jaxartes, a populous city, the centre of
                    an extensive commerce, and the seat of science and religion; Otrar; Cojend, on
                    the Oxus; Samarcand, situated near the source of the same river as Buckharia;
                    Carisme, where 100,000 men were massacred, and the surviving population reduced
                    to slavery; Balk, on the Upper Jaxartes, which contained 200 splendid mosques,
                    and a numerous population; Nisabaur; Herat, in Khorassan; Candahar, farther
                    east;besides numerous other smaller towns and villages. All that tract of
                    country which extends from the Caspian Sea to the Indus, comprehending the
                    ancient territories of Transoxiana, Carisme, and Khorassan, and which was
                    fertile, populous, and well cultivated, was entirely ruined by this irruption of
                    the Tartars, so that, to use the words of the Roman historian, “five centuries
                    have not been sufficient to repair the ravages of four years.” The conquests of
                    Zinghis, before his death, extended west from the Indus to the Euxine, from the
                    Pacific Ocean to the Volga, and from the Persian Gulf to the confines of
                    Siberia.</p>
                <p>The children of Zinghis, who succeeded him, completed the career of conquest
                    which he had begun. China, divided at that time into the two dynastics or
                    empires of the north and south, was subdued and laid waste by his grandson
                    Cublai, with all the unrelenting cruelty of a Tartar conqueror; and he extended
                    his influence and the terror of his arms over the circumjacent kingdoms of
                    Corea, Tonquin, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104518" xml:id="kp-eb0703-4518-0689"

                    established in China, under whose sway the country gradually settled; and in the
                    succeeding generation the habits of the invaders were mollified by the influence
                    of civilized life. Letters, commerce, and the arts of peace were revived, and
                    the ancient system and machine of Chinese manners and policy resumed its
                    accustomed action. One hundred and forty years after the death of Zinghis, his
                    degenerate race were expelled by a revolt of the Chinese, and the native dynasty
                    of princes, namely, that of Ming, was elevated to the vacant throne.</p>
                <p>Persia was overwhelmed by the invasion of the Tartar armies under Holagou Khan,
                    the grandson of Zinghis. The princes who ruled in the different districts of the
                    country, under the titles of sultans, emirs, and attabeks, were successively
                    crushed under this great conqueror, who, advancing to the Euphrates, stormed and
                    destroyed the city of Bagdad, put the caliph to death, and thus for ever
                    extinguished the line of the Abassides. Syria was overflowed by the torrent of
                    invasion; Damascus and Aleppo were given up to pillage;<note anchored="true"

                    the kingdoms of Armenia and Anatolia were overthrown; and the sultans of
                    Iconium, the last remnant of the Seljookian dynasty, were extirpated by the
                    armies of Holagou.</p>
                <p>The descendants of Zinghis had no sooner subverted the empire of China, than they
                    resolved on the conquest of the western world; and collecting a mighty host,
                    they advanced from China to Europe, inundating the intervening space with their
                    innumerable hordes, and extirpating the reigning powers in Turkestan, Tartary,
                    and the northern plains of Asia. They penetrated into Europe with their
                    victorious armies, of which detachments were sent northward to contend with the
                    Russian princes for the frozen regions of Siberia. The unity of the Mogul
                    empire, so firmly maintained by Zinghis Khan, was weakened by the extent of its
                    conquests. According to its original constitution, all the other khans were the
                    dependents or vassals of the great khan, under whose investiture they held their
                    authority. But by distance, and the various mutations of time, those ties of
                    allegiance were gradually loosened. The different branches of the Mogul family
                    conformed, from policy or conviction, to the religion of the conquered
                    countries, those who ruled in China to the idolatry of the Chinese, and the
                    invaders of the Moslem territories to the Mahometan faith; and from this
                    diversity of religion and manners divisions arose, which terminated in a lasting
                    disunion. From <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 1240 till the rise of .,Timour or
                    Tamerlane, about the year 1360, the Mogul power in Western Asia was shaken by
                    intestine strife; and a crowd of emirs, sultans, and petty rulers contended, in
                    incessant wars, for the fragments of the broken empire; while such of the Moslem
                    potentates as survived the invasion of Zinghis, still maintained, by their
                    valour, the balance of power in Syria against their Tartar enemies. The Ottoman
                    line of princes, the permanent rulers of the country, were in the mean time
                    slowly emerging into view. Amid the anarchy which reigned in Western Asia from
                    the downfal of independent powers, and the rise of usurpers in their place, the
                    country swarmed with a warlike population, with loose disbanded soldiers, and
                    adventurers of every description. Among these were many of the Turkman hordes
                    who had formerly pitched their tents on the southern banks of the Oxus, and the
                    khan of one of those obscure tribes was the father of the Ottoman dynasty.
                    Othman was the first of this line who, about the year 1326, by his conquests,
                    laid the foundation of the Turkish empire, which has ever since continued to
                    rule in Syria and Asia Minor. About the year 1400 the Turks, under Bajazet, had
                    acquired an extensive empire, the glory of which was for a time obscured by the
                    conquests of Timour the Tartar, or Tamerlane, who began to acquire renown by his
                    early conquests in Eastern Turkestan, or Transoxiana, about the year 1360, when
                    he subdued the kingdom of Cashgar, and carried his conquests 480 leagues to the
                    north-east of Samarcand.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Gibbon, vol. xii. chap. 65.</p></note> He finally extended his dominion to
                    the Irtisch and the Volga; and in 1398, having previously reduced the Punjaub
                    and the province of Moultan, he advanced across the intervening desert to Delhi,
                    which submitted to his arms, and was abandoned to pillage. He proceeded eastward
                    towards the sources of the Ganges in a crusade against the idolatry of the
                    Hindoos, who were massacred without pity; and, after an expedition of five
                    months, he finally retraced his steps to Samarcand, without effecting any
                    permanent conquest. In the western countries of Asia he encamped and overthrew
                    the rising power of the Turks under Bajaze t, and extended his conquests over
                    Syria and Asia Minor, giving over its flourishing cities, such as Aleppo,
                    Damascus, Smyrna, &amp;c. to the sword and the flame. The rise and progress of
                    this great Tartar chief, and his rapid successes, rivalled those of Zinghis
                    himself; but they were not on the same vast scale, nor had they such lasting
                    effects. The kingdoms which were conquered by Zinghis were colonized by his
                    soldiers and inherited by his children; but Tamerlane’s conquests were more like
                    predatory inroads; and though for the time he subverted the existing order of
                    things, and trampled in the dust the princedoms and powers of the country, yet,
                    as the flood of his invasion receded, those powers quickly resumed their sway.
                    In Asia Minor the Ottomans speedily regained their ascendancy on the ruins of
                    the Greek power. They reared up, in the middle of the 15th century, the
                    permanent fabric of their empire. Towards the end of the same century Persia
                    was, by a singular revolution, transferred from the Tartar chiefs to the dynasty
                    of Ser-fanean kings, or saints as they were considered before their elevation to
                    the throne. Under their rule the country continued without any material change,
                    until it was invaded in 1722, and conquered by Mahmood, the first of the Afghan
                    rulers of Persia. The independence of Persia was vindicated by the rise of the
                    celebrated usurper Nadir Shah, who, ascending the throne about the year 1730,
                    quelled all internal dissensions, and re-established the Persian empire in its
                    ancient greatness and glory. He restrained the Turks within the western boundary
                    of the Euphrates; on the north he extended his dominions to the Oxus, and awed
                    by the terror of his arms the Usbecs, and other wandering tribes of the desert;
                    and on the east he conquered Hindostan, which he plundered of its wealth, and
                    fixed the Indus as the boundary of his empire. Under his successors Persia has
                    decreased in extent of territory and in power, but has not been subjected to any
                    violent revolution, and still continues one of the independent though declining
                    empires of the east. In 1747 the Afghans, under the new dynasty of the
                    Doo-rannce kings, resumed their independence, which they still retain. Their
                    kingdom is bounded on the east by the Indus, and on the west by Persia, or by
                    intervening deserts.</p>
                <p>In Hindostan the influence of the Mahometan conquerors, which was firmly

                    rebellion and massacre. The uncertain dominion of the country appears to have
                    been shared among a crowd of tributary princes, who, from their intestine
                    quarrels, became an easy prey to the invader. Delhi was the capital of the
                    Mahometans; and their conquests were extended over Malwah, the Deccan (by which
                    we mean the country between the Nerbuddah and the Krisna rivers) and the
                    Carnatic, which was ravaged from sea to sea. The invasion, or rather the
                    predatory inroad of Timour in 1398, did not subvert the Mahometan dynasty, which
                    terminated in 1413 by the death of the monarch. The throne was then filled by a
                    Seid, <hi rend="italic">i.</hi><hi rend="italic">e.</hi> one of the race of
                    Mahomet, whose posterity enjoyed it till the year 1450, when an Afghan took
                    possession of it, and all Hindustan was divided into separate governments. After
                    an interval of reviving prosperity, the empire, about the year 1516, fell again
                    into utter confusion, which paved the way for the conquest of the country by
                    Sultan Baber, a descendant of Tamerlane and of Zinghis Khan, who being driven
                    from the provinces situated between the Indus and Samarcand, over which he
                    reigned, determined to try his fortune in India. He crossed the Indus in 1518,
                    and having defeated the emperor of Delhi, he established the dynasty of Timur,
                    or the Mogul line as it has been termed, which was illustrated by two of the
                    greatest princes that ever reigned in India, namely, Isř, Acbar, who, from 1555,
                    reigned 51 years, and subjected to his sway all the provinces that had revolted,
                    from Agimere to Bengal; and, <hi rend="italic superscript"> t</hi> 2<hi

                    continued for 50 years on the death of Acbar, ascended the throne in 1660, and
                    died in 1707, in the 90th year of his age. In this reign the dominion of the
                    Moguls was extended over the Deccan, the whole of which, excepting only the
                    mountainous and inaccessible parts, was either entirely subjected, or rendered
                    tributary to the court of Delhi.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    and his revenue amounted to 32 millions sterling. The Mogul empire gradually
                    fell to pieces under a succession of feeble princes; and about the year 1750 it
                    was reduced to the city of Delhi, and a small tract of adjacent territory. The
                    last imperial army that ever appeared in the field was defeated by the Rohillas
                    in 1749; and during this period the whole country was one scene of commotion,
                    all the viceroys and petty feudatories of the Delhi sovereigns,—the various
                    mountain tribes, such as the Rajpoots, who ruled in Agimere,—the Seiks, who had
                    become formidable, and had established themselves in Lahore,—and the Jats, a
                    tribe also in the north of India,—contending in arms for independence. Nothing
                    remains of Mogul greatness but the name, which was, and is still, used as the
                    symbol of sovereignty, and the sanction of all political and civil rights.</p>
                <p>The decline of the Mogul empire paved the way for the rise of the Mahratta power,
                    which had already become formidable in India under its founder Sevajee. At his
                    death in 1680 he had acquired considerable dominion on the western coast of
                    India. The confusion and anarchy that followed the death of Aurungzebe greatly
                    facilitated the Mahratta conquests; and in 1740 this growing empire, which was
                    divided between two chiefs, the one residing at Poonah in the west, and the
                    other at Nagpoor in the east, occupied the whole track from the western sea to
                    Orissa, and from Agra to the Carnatic.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    thus daily gathering strength, and the Mahometans, were now the two great
                    rival-powers in Hindostan. The contest between them was brought to an issue in
                    the memorable battle of Paniput in 1761, when the Mahratta host of 200,000 men
                    was entirely overthrown, with the loss of the greater part of their army, and
                    their best generals; and from that fatal day their power began to decline.</p>
                <p>The rise of the British power forms an important era in the history* of India.
                    The unwarlike inhabitants of Hindostan, successively subdued by the Greek, the
                    Mahometan, and the Tartar armies, were now destined even more surely to fall
                    under the science and discipline of Europe. The French maintained their ground
                    in India only for the short period of 12 years, from 1749 to 1761. The British,
                    who engaged about the same time in the wars and politics of India, were more
                    successful. The battle of Plassy, in 1757, fought with Surajah Dowlah, nabob of
                    Bengal, gave them a firm footing in the country. The war which followed
                    terminated in their favour; and in 1765 they acquired the right of collecting
                    the revenues of Bengal, which was in fact the sovereignty of the country. The
                    jealousies of the native powers, excited by the encroachments of the Europeans,
                    gave rise to new contests. But victory was still the result of each new
                    struggle; and all the wars undertaken against the British only tended to
                    consolidate and extend their empire. The long and memorable struggle with Hyder
                    Ali and his son Tippoo, who ruled in Mysore, terminated in their entire
                    overthrow in 1799, and in the capture of Seringapatam, the. capital of the
                    kingdom. The peace of India, which was re-established by this decisive success,
                    was not, however, of long duration. The British were regarded by the native
                    princes as the common enemies of Indian independence. They were alarmed by their
                    growing power, and they naturally united with each other against them. The
                    British, on the other hand, viewed with equal jealousy the hostile dispositions
                    of the native princes. They foresaw that a struggle would take -place for the
                    dominion of India, and they made suitable preparations for the impending crisis.
                    A combination of the Mahratta chiefs Scin-diah and the rajah of Berar was
                    overthrown by the skilful and vigorous movements of Sir A. Wellesley. Holkar,
                    who rashly measured his strength with the British, was also overthrown, and
                    peace was re established. In 1817, when the British were prosecuting the war
                    against the Pindarees, the Mahratta powers formed a new coalition, and took the
                    field in great force. They were separately overthrown: the Peshwa, the head of
                    the Mahratta states, was deprived of his throne, and his territories placed
                    under the administration of the British. The rajah of Nagpoor was also driven
                    from his dominions; and Holkar was again humbled, and deprived of his rank as an
                    independent prince. This was the last expiring effort of Indian ind.ependence,
                    by which the struggle was closed, and the dominion of the British firmly
                    established, from Cape Comorin to the Himalaya Mountains.</p>
                <p>Amid those revolutions, of which we have attempted to; give a brief sketch, it is
                    not surprising that some of the. most ancient empires of Asia should have
                    entirely disap- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> peared; that populous cities
                    should have fallen into decay and ruin; and that extensive countries, once the
                    seats of wealth, commerce, and science, should now lie desolate. The Babylonians
                    and Assyrians have been long blotted out of the page of history; and no traces
                    of them remain in the population of the world. The kingdom of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193104544" xml:id="kp-eb0703-4544-0691"/>the Jews has also been
                    overthrown; but this ancient race are still wanderers on the face of the earth,
                    and are found in most parts of Asia. There are other five principal races, who,
                    it is remarked by Sir W. Jones, have in different ages divided among themselves
                    as a kind of inheritance, and who still occupy, the vast continent of Asia, with
                    the many islands depending on it. These are the Hindoos, the Chinese, the
                    Tartars, the Arabs, and the Persians. The origin of those different races is a
                    curious subject of inquiry, and must be sought for in the remotest antiquity,
                    and from the doubtful analogies supplied by religion, manners, and language. Sir
                    W. Jones, who has so well illustrated many obscure points of ancient history, is
                    of opinion that Persia was the original seat of mankind, from which, as from a
                    common centre, they have gradually spread over the earth. According to his
                    learned hypothesis, deduced from ancient works and an examination of the
                    primitive languages, a flourishing empire was established in Persia or Iran, in
                    the earliest dawn of history; and the population consisted of the three distinct
                    races of Hindoos, Arabs, and Tartars. About the era of Mahomet, it appears that,
                    besides the language in common use, the learned had a language of their own,
                    which had the name of the Pahlavi; and there was the still more ancient and
                    abstruse language of the Zend, in which some sacred books were written, only
                    known to a sect of priests and philosophers. The Pahlavi he clearly proves to be
                    of Chaldaic origin, and the Zend, from an imperfect vocabulary which he
                    procured, to be a dialect of the Sanscrit, the ancient and learned tongue of the
                    Brahmins in India. Having thus ascertained the analogy between the language of
                    the ancient Persians and that of the Arabs and the Hindoos, he concludes that
                    they must have originally been the same nation; and that, as Persia could not be
                    peopled from the east by the Hindoos, whose religion forbids them to emigrate,
                    nor by the Arabs from the west, as we have not the slightest,.tradition of any
                    such emigration, both Arabs and Hindoos must have come from Persia, since we may
                    still trace in this country the remains of their respective tongues, all of
                    which appear to have been derived from one common and more ancient root.</p>
                <p>The people of Thibet are descended from the Hindoos, and, according to the
                    hypothesis of Sir W. Jones, who on all those subjects unites solid reasoning
                    with the most profound learning, have engrafted the heresies of Buddha on their
                    ancient religion. Their language, though it has been corrupted by an intercourse
                    with the Chinese, still bears the traces of a Sanscrit origin. The Afghans or
                    Patans, who occupy Afghanistan, between Persia and Hindostan, are said to have
                    sprung originally from the Jews; and their language, which is derived from the
                    ancient Chaldee, so far confirms this tradition. The Japanese and the Chinese
                    are evidently derived from a common stock, their literature, religion, and
                    manners being the same. The Burmese are considered, on the best evidence, to
                    belong to the Hindoo race, though others give them a Tartar origin.</p>
                <p>The Tartars, under which appellation we include the hordes of shepherds who range
                    over the vast plains of Asia, under the names of Scythians, Huns, Mongols, and
                    Kalmucs, differ entirely from the Hindoos and Arabs in features, complexion, and
                    form, as well as in manners and language, and appear evidently to be a distinct
                    race. Their language, which is the Turci or the Turki, of which the modern
                    Turkish is a dialect, might, according to Sir W. Jones, be easily traced to a
                    different root from the others. This ancient Tartarian language he mentions, on
                    grounds which it would not be easy to disprove, was current in Persia at a very
                    early age; and hence he concludes that the Tartars formed part of the ancient
                    population of Persia, and, along with the other two races, issued from that
                    country to occupy the deserts of Asia. The Chinese, according to the same
                    learned author, whose opinion is founded on the Sanscrit institutes of Menu,
                    were originally a military tribe of the Hindoos, who, abandoning the ordinances
                    of the Brahmin religion, and living in a state of degradation, emigrated
                    eastward, and occupying the countries bordering on Hindostan, laid the
                    foundation of the Chinese empire. But the whole country has been since overrun
                    and conquered by hordes of Tartars; and from the intermixture of those two races
                    have sprung the modern Chinese, whose coarse, broad, and Tartar-like physiognomy
                    bears no longer the traces of their Hindoo ancestors.</p>
                <p>We have no sure data to determine from what country the population of the world
                    at first proceeded; and most of the theories on this subject rest chiefly on the
                    doubtful analogies of language, or on other evidence equally uncertain. It is
                    the opinion of many learned inquirers that the Chinese are not Hindoos; but that
                    they, along with all the inhabitants of Eastern Asia, are originally a Tartar
                    race. This opinion is founded on the usual evidence of a common origin, namely,
                    a resemblance in features, language, and customs. Dr F. Buchanan, who travelled
                    into the Burmese country, and has furnished some interesting information
                    respecting this people, observes, that “there is one very extensive nation which
                    inhabits the east of Asia, and that it includes the Eastern and Western Tartars
                    of the Chinese authors, the Kalmucs, the Chinese, the Japanese, and other tribes
                    inhabiting what is called the peninsula of India beyond the Ganges, and the
                    islands to the south and east of this, as far at least as New Guinea.” The
                    features and figure of all those different nations which he describes indicate a
                    Tartar origin. They are in stature short, squat, and robust; their face is
                    sharpened towards the mouth and chin, while at the cheek-bones it is very broad.
                    Eyebrows that scarcely project; narrow eyes, placed rather obliquely in the
                    head; a very small nose, with the apertures of the nostril nearly circular;
                    harsh, lank, and black hair, complete the portrait of a Tartar face. By such
                    features they have been distinguished in all ages. The ancient writers, in
                    describing the barbarians who invaded the Roman empire, particularly mention
                    their small twinkling eyes, punctured as it were in their heads; their broad
                    shoulders, short stature, and their shrill voices, which is not mentioned by Dr
                    Buchanan as characteristic of the inhabitants of Eastern Asia.<note

                <p>The tribes who inhabit the great Asiatic archipelago, which extends from
                    Madagascar to the Philippines and the neighbouring peninsula of Malacca, bear in
                    their features, language, and customs the undoubted marks of the same origin;
                    and as the Sanscrit may be traced as the root of all the various dialects spoken
                    in these islands, they appear to be descended from the Hindoos. But in the lapse
                    of ages, and in the various chances of war or migration, different nations may
                    be intermingled; the original traits by which each was distinguished will then
                    gradually disappear, so that it may not be possible to discern the traces of a
                    common origin in the varieties of the same race. Like the Chinese, therefore,
                    the inhabitants of the great Arabic archipelago may have come originally from
                    Hindostan, bringing with them the Sanscrit tongue; and in the course of
                    migration or conquest they may have acquired the features of the Tartars,
                    without losing their native language. Sir Stamford Raffles, not less
                    distinguished by his eminence in eastern literature and antiquities than as a
                    legislator and a statesman, is of opinion that the Asiatic islands were peopled
                    from that portion of the continent which lies between Siam and China. “The less
                    civilized of the tribes,” he observes, “inhabiting the islands, approach so
                    nearly in physical appearance to that portion of the inhabitants of the
                    peninsula which has felt least of the Chinese influence on the one side, and of
                    the Burman and Siamese on the other, and exhibit so striking an affinity in
                    their usages and customs, as to warrant the hypothesis, that the tide of
                    population originally flowed toward the islands from that quarter of the
                    continent lying between Siam and China. But at what era this migration
                    commenced—whether, in the first instance, it was purely accidental, and
                    subsequently gradual, or whether originally it was undertaken from design, and
                    accelerated at any particular periods by political convulsions on the continent,
                    we cannot at present determine, as we have no data on which to rely with
                    confidence. It is probable, however, that these islands were peopled at a very
                    remote period, and long before the Burman and Siamese nations rose into
                    notice.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sir S. Raffles’
                    <hi rend="italic">History of Ja va,</hi> chap. ii.</p></note> Mr J. Crauford,
                    who resided for nine years in the Asiatic islands, and whose history of those
                    countries displays extensive research, and a profound knowledge of eastern
                    literature and antiquities, adopts a different hypothesis respecting the
                    original population of the Indian archipelago. He describes the original
                    inhabitants to consist of two races, one a brown-complexioned people, with lank
                    hair, and in their persons short, squat, and robust, supposed by other writers
                    to be Tartars; and the other, a negro race, of a puny stature and feeble frame,
                    in complexion black, or rather sooty-coloured, with woolly or frizzled hair. The
                    brown-coloured race compose the civilized portion of the people; and they have
                    supplanted the negroes, who are constantly found in a savage state in Sumatra,
                    Java, and Celebes, where civilization has made the greatest progress; while in
                    New Guinea and other islands the negroes are almost the sole inhabitants. The
                    origin of these two races, and the period when they settled in the Asiatic
                    islands, is, according to Mr Crauford, buried in the remotest antiquity. The
                    Tartar origin of the one race, though supported by many writers of learning, and
                    the African origin of the negroes, is treated by him as absurd and unfounded.
                    “Either hypothesis,” he observes, “is too absurd to bear the slightest touch of
                    examination. Not to say that each race is radically distinct from the stock from
                    which it is imagined to have proceeded; the physical state of the globe, the
                    nature of man, and all that we know of his history, must be overturned to render
                    these violent suppositions possible.” Dr F. Buchanan, Sir Stamford Raffles, and
                    others, deduced the Tartar origin of those insular tribes from their form and
                    features, which is the best evidence we can have where history is silent. The
                    prevalence of the Sanscrit language in these islands has also, and with
                    apparently some reason, been supposed to indicate the quarter from which the
                    tide of population flowed; nor is it easy to see how the migration of a people
                    from the continent of Asia into this archipelago is at variance with the
                    “physical state of the globe, the nature of man, and all that we know of his
                    history.” Mr Crauford traces the various languages of the Asiatic islands to one
                    common root. From this fact he concludes those islanders to have all sprung from
                    one source, and he fixes on Java as their original place of settlement. Here he
                    supposes they took up their abode when they were little better than wandering
                    savages; whence they gradually spread over the other islands. Now it is on the
                    same ground that others trace their origin to some continental nation of great
                    antiquity. The language of a nation may throw light on its origin and its
                    subsequent migrations; and in the present case it is admitted by Mr Crauford
                    that there is a large infusion of Sanscrit in all the Polynesian tongues; that
                    it is “a more essential, necessary, and copious portion of the insular languages
                    than Arabic ;” that it exists in “a state of as great purity as the articulation
                    and alphabets of the archipelago would admit, nearly unmixed with any modern
                    dialect of which it is a part, and apparently in a state of original purity ;”
                    and that it is “pure and abundant as each dialect of the same tongue is
                    improved, and rare and corrupt as the language is common and popular.”<note

                    languages, abound in the court dialect of Java in the proportion of three to
                    four, and seem to constitute its basis; in the Kami, or learned language of the
                    priests, they occur still more frequently, and in their original purity; they
                    are also common in the written language, and are found, though not so generally,
                    in the ordinary dialect of the people. The existence of Sanscrit to such an
                    extent in the languages of Java and the other islands, does not, according to Mr
                    Crauford, prove that these islands were peopled by emigrants from Hindostan. He
                    acknowledges that the fact of the Sanscrit not being mixed in their languages
                    with any living dialect of India, is somewhat puzzling, and not easily
                    reconciled to his theory; but on farther consideration, he thinks this fact
                    tends rather to explain the manner in which it was introduced, which he ascribes
                    to a few Hindoo missionaries or priests brought to thoso islands from a desire
                    to propagate their religion. They would naturally, he supposes, use the Sanscrit
                    in teaching the mysteries of their faith, which, being mixed with the common
                    language of the country, would form the Kami or learned language of the priests,
                    and would thence be diffused in a corrupted state over the common dialect of the
                    people. From the prevalence of Sanscrit to such an extent in the Polynesian
                    dialects, as well as from the ancient monuments of Hindoo idolatry which are
                    found everywhere in those islands, it seems highly probable that they must, at a
                    very early period, have been the seat of a Hindoo empire, which has disappeared
                    in the lapse of ages, while the Hindoo superstition has been supplanted by the
                    Mahometan creed. Whether this empire was established by conquest in that early
                    period, while the Sanscrit was yet a living language, or whether the Hindoos<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193104570" xml:id="kp-eb0703-4570-0693"/> were the original
                    settlers in these islands, and afterwards, from the intermixture of other races,
                    lost the traces of their ancient lineage, are points which lie hid in the
                    darkness of antiquity. It does not seem very credible, however, that a small
                    number of Hindoomissionaries should have had influence, as Mr Crauford supposes,
                    to change the language of the people, and to substitute for the ancient religion
                    of the country their own foreign superstitions. So great a change seems more
                    probably to have been produced by foreign conquest, or by a large emigration of
                    the Hindoo people.</p>
                <p>Of the various races which people those islands, the Malays appear to deserve
                    particular notice. Sir W. Jones supposes them to be descended, since the time of
                    Mahomet, from the Arabian traders and mariners who frequented the Asiatic
                    archipelago. But by later and more accurate inquiries they are now ascertained
                    to have been originally settled in Menangkabau, in the centre of the island of
                    Sumatra, and to have ruled over the whole country, from which they sent out
                    colonies to the other islands. The Malayan annals examined by Mr Marsden,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">History of
                    Sumatra.</hi></p></note> and other documents, satisfactorily prove that, so far
                    from emigrating, as was generally supposed, from the peninsula of Malacca to the
                    Asiatic islands, they were original settlers in Sumatra, from which they issued
                    to invade and conquer the Malacca peninsula; and they had established a powerful
                    empire prior to the Mahometan conquests. The Malays profess the Moslem creed,
                    which was introduced about the end of the thirteenth century, and has made rapid
                    progress among all those islanders. But their original religion was that of
                    Brahma, blended with the antecedent rude idolatry of the country, such as is
                    still seen among the Battas. The Malay adventurers who invaded the Malacca
                    peninsula in the 12th century conquered the country; and the indigenous
                    inhabitants, so far from being the stock from which the Malays have sprung, are
                    an entirely different race, resembling more nearly the negroes of Africa. The
                    Malayan empire, which extended all over Sumatra, is now dismembered, though its
                    colonies have been found on the coasts of the Malacca peninsula, and throughout
                    the islands as far east as the Moluccas. <hi rend="italic"/><note

                    2</hi> The Malayan language is spoken without any mixture in the inland country
                    of Sumatra; it is understood everywhere, and has extended over all the eastern
                    islands. The Bugis in the island of Celebes are a well-known race in the eastern
                    archipelago. During the flourishing era of the Malayan empire in Sumatra they
                    had established that of Guah or Mengkasar in Celebes on the east: like the
                    Malays, they sent forth numerous colonies; and at one period extended their
                    conquests as far west as Acheen in Sumatra and Keddan in the Malayan peninsula;
                    and in almost every part of the archipelago Malayan and Bugis settlers are to be
                    found. In all those Asiatic islands there is, however, an indigenous race, who
                    were settled there prior to the Malays or the Bugis; and these last appear to
                    have been intruders, but at what period of the world cannot now be known. The
                    native inhabitants of Sumatra, Java, and the other islands, differ from them in
                    character, habits, and features. The Battas, in the interior of Sumatra, are a
                    distinct people, with their own peculiar habits and language: they have been
                    reproached by travellers for eating human flesh, of which Sir Stamford Raffles
                    produces undeniable evidence. The natives of Java are a quiet, contented race,
                    attached to the soil, and have not the roving, maritime, and piratical habits of
                    the Malays.</p>
                <p>With regard to the number of inhabitants in Asia, <hi rend="italic">we.</hi> have
                    no data for any accurate estimate. The Asiaticsi possess no statistical
                    knowledge; and, excepting surveys <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> instituted by
                    government for the purposes of taxation, no ' other political inquiries are ever
                    set on foot by authority. The various accounts of the Chinese population differ
                    to the extent of 100,000,000. Those regarding Persia, Hindostan, the Asiatic
                    islands, c. are little more to be depended on; and still less can we expect any
                    accurate census of the roving population of Arabia or Tartary.</p>
                <p>The character of the Asiatics is represented in a very» unfavourable light by all
                    travellers. Lieutenant Pottinger,! who travelled in Hindostan, Persia, and other
                    countries, asserts that moral turpitude may be said to pervade the population
                    and society of every nation in Asia of which we have the slightest
                    knowledge:<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                    hope,” he adds in a note, “I shall not be stamped as a misanthrope on account of
                    the sentiments I entertain of all Asiatics. I am convinced the farther our
                    researches spread, and the more intimately we become acquainted with the East,
                    we shall discover stronger, clearer proofs of the general application of the
                    conclusion I have drawn. I shou!d be happy to have any evidence to the contrary,
                    but do not anticipate it.”</p></note> and this description is confirmed by other
                    travellers, who describe the people to be dissolute in their morals, of cold and
                    selfish dispositions, and withal cruel and treacherous; without any regard to
                    truth, and indulging, without either restraint or shame, in the most scandalous
                    crimes. Of all the nations in Asia the Persians are reckoned to be the most
                    refined; and yet, according to Herbert, Chardin, and others, and more recently
                    Fraser, Pöttinger, and Sir J. Malcolm, they are stained with all the Asiatic
                    vices of cruelty, meanness, lying, and the grossest licentiousness.<note

                    state of manners which, contrasted with those of Europe, may be justly

                    we need seek no other evidence than the inhuman practice, which is known to
                    prevail in all the populous cities, of exposing new-born children to perish on
                    the streets. There is no truer mark of barbarism than an indifference to the
                    sufferings of our fellow-creatures; as on the other hand it is only in a highly
                    civilized community that man is trained to the exercise of social benevolence.
                    The savage is always found to be cold, unsocial, and selfish: in the progress of
                    society this selfish principle is corrected; man is impressed with the duties
                    which he owes to his fellowmen, and is taught to know experimentally, that it is
                    not in the selfish pursuit of his own good, but in the mutual interchange of
                    benefits, that the greatest sum of individual happiness is to be found. If we
                    examine the manners, institutions, and policy of different nations, it will be
                    seen that mankind are humane and moral exactly as they are instructed; and that
                    as the diffusion of knowledge leads to the practice of all the social virtues,
                    ignorance as surely produces cruelty, selfishness, and vice. Thus, among the
                    Persians and Turks cruelties are committed which would be repudiated by the more
                    advanced civilization of Russia; and in illustration of the same principle we
                    may here mention a circumstance which serves to place in an equally striking
                    contrast the manners of the English and the Chinese. An <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193104583" xml:id="kp-eb0703-4583-0694"/>English vessel happened to be
                    at anchor in the roads of Canton, when a Chinese boat was overset, and the crew
                    precipitated into the water. The accident was observed by numbers of the
                    Chinese, who beheld with the utmost indifference their countrymen struggling for
                    their lives. But the officers and seamen of the English vessel instantly lowered
                    their boats, and were seen, with all their usual zeal in the cause of humanity,
                    striving to save the lives of those who were entire strangers to them. Now we
                    cannot have a surer index to the station which each nation holds respectively in
                    the scale of civilization, than the opposite conduct which they severally
                    pursued in this case; and this insensibility to human distress is not peculiar
                    to the Chinese; it seems to pervade the whole population of Asia; while in
                    Europe we see everywhere proofs of active benevolence,—the niosi munificent
                    establishments for the relief of misery; hospitals for the sick and infirm;
                    houses of refuge for the aged, the blind, the destitute, and the insane; besides
                    charitable associations of every description. For all the afflictions to which
                    frail humanity is subject, the active sympathy of Europe supplies a remedy; and
                    the spacious structures which, under the influence of this feeling, have been
                    reared up in all the European towns, are at once the splendid monuments of
                    humanity and of high civilization. In Asia the rich and the powerful associate,
                    not to relieve, but to oppress the poor; and throughout its wide extent no
                    asylum for distress, nor any charitable institutions, are to be seen. The
                    miserable are left to their fate, which is generally to die unpitied, either of
                    famine or disease. There is no part of Asia in which intelligence is widely
                    diffused among the people; and hence, while they are to “vice industrious,” they
                    are to “nobler ends timorous and slothful.” Yet in the exterior pomp and show of
                    the Asiatics there is something specious and imposing; and the rich magnificence
                    of their flowing robes, their gorgeous palaces, their splendid mosques and
                    gilded temples, are calculated to raise ideas of high improvement, which a
                    nearer inspection fails to realise; and, after all, what is there in this tinsel
                    glare of oriental luxury that can be compared to the severe simplicity and solid
                    refinements of Europe.</p>
                <p>This degraded state of society seems to be the joint effect of tyranny and
                    superstition. In Asia there is no government which wears even the semblance of
                    freedom. In form, as well as in practice, they are purely despotic, the princes
                    being tyrants, and the people slaves. Nor is the power of the prince controlled
                    by the influence of manners, as in Europe, where the monarch, however absolute,
                    seldom indulges in the licence of despotic sway, and where life and property are
                    fully protected. The manners of Asia favour the exercise of unlimited power; and
                    this vast continent is accordingly one scene of excess and misrule, where the
                    mere will of the monarch is a warrant for the proscription and death of any
                    individual, however powerful, and for the ruin of his family. The people, ruled
                    according to those severe maxims of despotism, live in continual dread of
                    violence and wrong; and they naturally resort, in self-defence, to fraud,
                    falsehood, and treachery, which are the resources of weakness. Thus all sense of
                    independence is at last extinguished; and under the iron rod of their political
                    masters they degenerate into abject slaves, without honour, intelligence, or
                    morality. Despotism in Asia assumes so severe a character, that it invades the
                    security of private life, relaxes all social ties, and re-acting on the people
                    with its pernicious influence, tends still farther to debase them, and to fit
                    them for the endurance of its degrading yoke.</p>
                <p>The prevailing superstitions of Asia have had their due share in corrupting the
                    manners of the people. In Asiatic Turkey, in Arabia, Persia, and partly also in
                    Hindostan and the Asiatic isles, the people have adopted the Mahometan faith; in
                    Hindostan they have followed the religion of Brahma; and in Thibet, and farther
                    eastward among the Burmese, in China, and the isles of Japan, the religion of
                    Buddha or Foe is universally established, which, however corrupted in its
                    various forms and idolatries, is still known to be derived from the Brahminical
                    faith. Now all those different systems enjoin a variety of minute observances,
                    and tedious pilgrimages and penances, a strict compliance with which constitutes
                    the essence of religion. A pilgrimage to Mecca, for example, atones for all the
                    iniquities of a Mahometan life; and the Hindoos and others have their
                    pilgrimages and penances for the expiation of guilt A relaxation of morals is
                    the consequence; and hence in those eastern countries a strict profession of
                    religion is not inconsistent with the most scandalous crimes.</p>
                <p>The sanction given to polygamy by all the systems of religion in the East has
                    also tended to encourage licentiousness. Mahomet found it convenient to allow
                    this indulgence to his followers; and the Hindoos, the Burmese, the Chinese, and
                    most of the other Asiatic nations, follow the same rule. In all Christian
                    countries marriage is respected as a sacred and an honourable tie, equally
                    binding on both parties; and experience proves, that where its obligations are
                    duly fulfilled, it is calculated to produce all the happiness and virtue which
                    can be attained by man in this sublunary state. In the intercourse of a European
                    family the best affections of our nature are called forth. Here, as the poet
                    expresses it,</p>
                <p>Flows the smooth current of domestic joy; and in those scenes the rising
                    generation receive, from the example and tuition of parents, those just and
                    early impressions, which are never erased. How different are the baneful
                    consequences of polygamy, which, being contrary to the order of nature, must be
                    upheld by tyranny, and which degrades the weaker sex, from being the free and
                    equal companions of man, into the slaves of his pleasures. The domestic tyrants
                    of the East rule with absolute power over all the inmates of the harem; any of
                    whom, in a fit of rage or jealousy, they may consign to a cruel death, no eye
                    witnessing the deed. The effect of polygamy in this manner is not merely to
                    taint the morals of society, but the laws and policy of the state. It
                    establishes a tyrant, not on the throne, which would be the lesser evil, but at
                    the head of every family; and on his unruly passions the law imposes no
                    restraint. Hence in Asia domestic comfort, so much prized in Europe, cannot be
                    known. An Asiatic family is not the abode of purity and of domestic peace, but
                    of licentiousness and strife; the husband and father the object of terror rather
                    than affection; the women his abject slaves, leading a life of jealousy and
                    malice, and often conspiring against each other by the most diabolical arts. The
                    institution of polygamy, which in this manner converts one half of the community
                    into tyrants and the other half into slaves, has proved, in every country in
                    which it has been introduced, the bane of morality as well as of social peace.
                    In Europe the purer influence of Christianity, consecrating the marriage union,
                    and impressing on man a just consideration for the other sex, has raised them to
                    the rank in society which properly belongs to them. It has released them for
                    ever from the bondage of tyranny and vice; and under its mild and beneficent
                    maxims the nations of Europe have attained to a degree of morality, refinement,
                    and intelligence, which distinguishes them to their advantage above the most
                    polished nations of antiquity, and presents a decided contrast to the
                    licentiousness and misery of the East.</p>
                <p>But if such be the state of society among the civilized, inhabitants of Asia,
                    what, it may be asked, is the conditioni <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104596"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-4596-0695"/>of its rude tribes? Among those semi-barbarians
                    who have no fixed habitations, but who dwell in tents, migrating periodically
                    with their flocks in quest of pasture, all crimes of violence, such as rapine,
                    revenge, and murder, prevail without any restraint. The pastoral tribes of Asia
                    retain all their Tartar habits of ferocity; robbery is their daily occupation,
                    handed down from father to son; and they are perpetually engaged in predatory
                    inroads, in which they carry off as their lawful prey all that they can
                    seize—corn, cattle, goods, and men and women, who are sold for slaves. If any
                    traveller were to venture within this region of violence, he would be robbed and
                    murdered without mercy; and no merchandise can be transported from one place to
                    another without a sufficient escort. The regular commerce of Asia is in
                    consequence carried on in caravans, or large companies of merchants, who travel
                    together for safety; and even these are not secure from the savage tribes, the
                    remnants of the Tartar population, who inhabit the mountains and central plains,
                    and who frequently emerge from their fastnesses in great force for the purposes
                    of plunder. Such were the shepherds who, under Zenghis Khan and Tamerlane,
                    issued forth in innumerable bands, subverting the great empires of the world,
                    and extending their dominion from sea to sea. But various causes have concurred
                    to circumscribe their power. Among these we may reckon the invention of
                    fire-arms, which in war gives the entire ascendancy to civilized nations. Prior
                    to this invention the weapons used were extremely simple, and could be easily
                    fashioned by the rudest tribes. In archery, or in the use of the sling, the
                    merest savages may excel; and for a close encounter the spear or the sword could
                    be easily procured, and as effectually wielded by a barbarian as by any other
                    arm. But the <hi rend="italic">materiel</hi> of modern war is far more
                    complicated and expensive, and cannot be procured without the aid of wealth, and
                    the nicest mechanical art as well as science; so that it is justly observed by
                    the historian of Rome, that in the present state of the military art, a nation
                    must be civilized before it can conquer other nations. Since the invention of
                    fire-arms the superiority of civilized over barbarous nations has been seen in
                    every encounter which has taken place, and “the reign of independent barbarism
                    has been contracted within a narrow span.”</p>
                <p>The extensive region of Tartary, which occupies the centre of Asia, has never
                    been very distinctly defined; but it is surrounded on all sides by the civilized
                    empires of Asia,— on the north by Asiatic Russia, and on the south by Persia,
                    Hindostan, and China; and as the use of fire-arms has augmented the military
                    strength of these different states, they have gradually extended their sway over
                    the savage tribes on their frontiers. Russia, which was overrun by Tamerlane and
                    other conquerors about the end of the !4th century, was, after about 200 years
                    of obstinate and bloody wars, emancipated from the Tartar yoke; and it has ever
                    since been making reprisals on its barbarous enemies, having reduced the tribes
                    on its frontiers—the Kalmucs, the Bashkirs, the Kirghiscs, who inhabit the banks
                    of the Volga and the country on the shores of the Caspian Sea, besides numerous
                    other Tartar tribes on the Chinese frontier, near the sources of the Irtisch,
                    the Obi, the Yencsei, and the Lena. Her wars with the Turks also, an Asiatic
                    tribe, though of a different origin from the broad-featured race of Tartars,
                    exemplify in a striking manner the warlike superiority of civilized nations. The
                    contests of China with the barbarous hordes of'Mongols, Kalkas, and Eluths, to
                    the west and north-west of her territory, and with the Mantchoo Tartars, who
                    inhabit the country to the north, bordering on the Pacific Ocean, have also
                    terminated in their entire subjection. They have been successively subdued by
                    the Chinese armies; and the missionary Gerbillon, giving an account of a great
                    .victory gained by the Chinese, ascribes it to the superiority of their
                    artillery, which the barbarians had no means of opposing. Persia has been long a
                    feeble power; and the Tartar tribes who range along her northern and eastern
                    frontiers are still extremely powerful, and frequently molest the adjoining
                    countries by their incursions. Independent Tartary may now therefore be
                    comprised within the following boundaries, namely, the Altai Mountains on the
                    north, which form the southern boundary of the Russian empire; the Caspian Sea
                    on the west; Chinese Tartary on the east; and Persia and Hindostan on the south.
                    These boundaries inclose a space of about 1200 miles in length, from the Altai
                    Mountains to Persia; and 900 in breadth, from the Caspian Sea to Chinese
                    Tartary. To this must be added the country between Hindostan and Persia,
                    including Sinde at the mouth of the Indus; and westward the mountainous regions
                    of Belochistan, as well as Afghanistan. In the high district of Balk, which is
                    within this space, and which is situated on the northern declivity of the Hindoo
                    Coosh or Himalaya Mountains, and in Buckharia or Bokhara, on the fertile banks
                    of the Oxus and the Jaxartes, where are the towns of Buckharia, Samarcand,
                    Khyvah, Koukan, Khojund, and Murghelan, &amp;c. some form of civil order is
                    maintained by the independent princes of the country; but with these exceptions
                    the Tartar manners still prevail throughout this extensive region. The towns are
                    thinly scattered, and the pastoral hordes range over the face of the land in all
                    the licence of savage freedom. These consist, not of the Tartars who possessed
                    the country in the time of Tamerlane, but of the Usbecks, a Turkoman tribe, who
                    appear to have descended, with the whole mass of their people, from the
                    inhospitable countries in the north, to the fine plains of the Oxus and the
                    Jaxartes, and to have expelled the Tartars, whose place they now occupy. The
                    Turkoman tribes, who inhabit the Elburz Mountains to the south of the Caspian,
                    and the deserts of Kharasm, which extend eastward from this interior sea about
                    600 miles, are described by Fraser, in his instructive work on Persia, as
                    singularly fierce, cruel, and blood-thirsty in their habits. They pour down from
                    their deserts in great force on the cultivated districts, plundering villages
                    and caravans with every circumstance of atrocious outrage, murdering on the spot
                    the old, the feeble, and the helpless, and carrying into slavery those who are
                    fit for labour, and thus depopulating extensive tracts that were before fertile
                    and well inhabited. On the east of Persia the same ravages are committed by
                    other tribes, who dispose of their captives to slave merchants, by whom they are
                    carried to the markets of Buckharia and Khyvah. On the south the wild
                    inhabitants of Belochistan, so well described by Lieutenant Pöttinger, one of
                    the most judicious and enterprising travellers of modern times, plunder and
                    murder their prisoners, or carry them for sale to some of the great slavemarkets
                    in the East. Numerous tribes of shepherds feed their flocks on the banks of the
                    Oxus and the Jaxartes; and they are found scattered over all the northern and
                    eastern countries of Central Asia, as far as the boundaries of Russia and China.
                    But in the present improved state of the military art they are no longer
                    formidable, and they waste their force in casual inroads, which are easily
                    repelled.</p>
                <p>From the earliest ages the countries of Western Asia,; namely, Asia Minor, the
                    valley of the Euphrates and&lt; Tigris, and Persia, were familiarly known to
                    Europeans;’ but of the northern plains inhabited by the Scythian - tribes, and
                    of the rich and improved countries of Hindostan and China in the east, they were
                    only informed by vague and inaccurate reports, which were slowly corrected by
                    the progress of commerce or of conquest. Of the ancient <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193104609" xml:id="kp-eb0703-4609-0696"/>expedition of Semiramis into
                    India we know nothing more than that her armies were forced to retreat with
                    loss. But the subsequent invasion and conquests of Darius extended the knowledge
                    of the Europeans to the modern provinces of Lahore and Moultan, commonly called
                    the Punjaub, or the country watered by the five head branches of the Indus.
                    Herodotus describes the climate of the country as intensely hot; the inhabitants
                    in some points as little better than barbarians; and with a small grain of truth
                    he mixes the strangest and most absurd fables. He mentions the populousness and
                    wealth of the country, and the staple produce of cotton growing wild on trees;
                    also the story of the white ants turning up the earth and digging up gold, which
                    has been copied by succeeding writers; and, finally, the region of the five
                    rivers as bounded by a barren plain, which must no doubt be the sandy desert
                    that lies between the valley of the Indus and the Ganges. The Scythians or
                    Tartars who wandered over the northern and eastern plains of Asia were only
                    known by their irruptions into Europe. The two tribes of the Massagetae and the
                    Sacae, the former inhabiting the desert plains to the east of the Aral and north
                    of the Jaxartes, and the latter the country to the north-west of India, are
                    mentioned by Herodotus and other ancient writers; and their description is
                    merely a detail of pastoral manners. The expedition of Alexander into India was
                    a great step in the progress of Asiatic geography. This warlike prince was
                    intent not merely on conquest, but on the diffusion of arts, commerce, and
                    science; and, like some modern conquerors, his army was accompanied by a body of
                    men of science, who were instructed to measure each day the distance traversed,
                    to make an accurate table of the various routes, and to observe and describe the
                    countries through which they passed. Science thus followed in the train of arms;
                    and it was by a European army that the remote regions of the East were first
                    explored. Alexander pursuing his victorious march through Asia Minor, passed the
                    limits of European discovery, and entered the eastern country of Bactriana in
                    pursuit of the Persian army. Having passed the Paropamisan range of the Himalaya
                    Mountains, crossed the Oxus, and taken Maracanda, the modern Samarcand, he
                    advanced northward to the Jaxartes, where he pursued the Scythian host into the
                    northern deserts to the eastward of the Aral. Retracing his steps, he again
                    crossed the Paropamisan Mountains, and advancing eastward among hostile tribes,
                    through the modern country of Cabul or Afghanistan, to the south of the Hindoo
                    Coosh range, he crossed the Indus near the mountains, and having defeated the
                    Indian army of Porus, he obtained the command of the country watered by the five
                    tributary streams of the Indus, where his course was arrested by the murmurs of
                    his troops, who refused to follow him across the desert to the Ganges. Still
                    intent on discovery as well as on conquest, he fitted out a large fleet, and
                    sailing down the Indus to its mouth, in the Indian Ocean, he instructed his
                    admiral, Nearchus, to return to Persia by sea, while he took his course through
                    the modern country of Mekran, and was nearly lost with his whole army in its
                    sandy deserts. Nearchus directed his course along the shores of Asia, and
                    triumphing over the perils of unknown seas, arrived safely in the Persian Gulf,
                    which he ascended to the mouth of the Tigris. This is the first great voyage of
                    discovery of which we have any authentic account; and considering the age of the
                    world in which it was accomplished, it must be viewed as a singular display of
                    courage and of nautical skill. Alexander was not equally successful in tracing
                    the connection of the Red Sea with the Indian Ocean, which remained unknown
                    until the reign of the Ptolemies in Egypt.</p>
                <p>Seleucus, the successor of Alexander, carried his arms into India for the purpose
                    of completing its conquest; but he does not appear to have reached the valley of
                    the’ Ganges. He sent, however, to the court of Sandracottus, an Indian prince
                    who reigned over all the countries from Delhi to the mouth of the Ganges, his
                    ambassador Me-gasthenes, who acquired the most important and clear information
                    respecting those unknown regions. He visited the celebrated city of Palibothra,
                    the site of which has so much perplexed modern geographers; and, with some
                    admixture of fable, he accurately describes the countries on the Ganges, and
                    their productions; the amazing size of the rivers; the most remarkable animals
                    which he saw, among others the Bengal tiger; and the manners of the people, and
                    their division into castes, with other singular customs.</p>
                <p>During the reign of the Ptolemies in Egypt the geography of Asia was still
                    farther illustrated, not by conquest, but by commerce. Alexandria was at that
                    time the great emporium of the eastern trade; and India was explored in its most
                    remote parts, for the precious commodities which it was supposed to produce. The
                    Egyptian mariners entering the Indian Ocean from the Red Sea, and coasting along
                    the Arabian shore, stretched across the Persian Gulf by the help of the
                    south-west monsoon, to the mouth of the Indus, whence they sailed southward
                    along the Malabar coast, and doubling Cape Comorin, extended their voyage on the
                    coast of Coromandel as far as the modern city of Masulipatam.</p>
                <p>In the age of Ptolemy the geographer, which was a century later, the knowledge of
                    the Europeans had extended eastward beyond the Ganges to the Burman empire and
                    the Gulf of Siam, though it does not appear that the navigators of antiquity
                    ever reached the Chinese coast. The commerce of India was carried on by land as
                    well as by sea; and regular caravans commenced their route from Byzantium
                    eastward through Asia Minor and Persia, passing through the modern cities of
                    Hamadan and Herat; and journeying northward, and crossing the Oxus and the
                    modern country of Buckharia, they passed the great branch of the Himalaya
                    Mountains which runs northward from the main range under the modern appellation
                    of Beloor Taugh; and descending into the lower plains of Little Thibet, they
                    assembled in great numbers, and, after halting for some time, took their journey
                    to the capital of Serica or China, which occupied a period of seven months. The
                    description given of the Seres as a frugal and mercantile people, averse to all
                    intercourse with strangers, and carrying on their trade at a single station on
                    the frontier, answers entirely to the modern character of the Chinese. The
                    commerce, which during the flourishing era of Rome was carried on between Europe
                    and the eastern parts of Asia, was interrupted by the inroads of the barbarous
                    nations who assailed, and in the end overthrew, the Roman empire; and all
                    knowledge of Asia was for a time lost. It was not till the 6th or 7th century,
                    during the reign of the caliphs at Bagdad, that the Arabian geographers acquired
                    a knowledge of those countries. During this period the country to the west of
                    the Beloor Taugh Mountains, which stretch northward nearly to the frontier of
                    Siberia, consisting of extensive plains, watered by the Oxus and the Jaxartes,
                    was well known to them; and they were imperfectly acquainted with the southern
                    plains of Asia inhabited by the Tartars, though they were as usual the subject
                    of fables. The eastern countries of Hindostan, the beautiful region of Cashmere,
                    the great Asiatic plains, and China, with the island of Sumatra and others, were
                    known to the Arabian geographers, though they seem to have had no correct
                    knowledge of the Asiatic shores. Their accurate description of Chinese manners
                    leaves no doubt of their having reach <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104622"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-4622-0697"/>ed that country. The invasion of the Holy Land by
                    the crusaders tended, among its other consequences, to introduce into Europe a
                    knowledge of those countries in Asia which were famed for wealth and the remains
                    of ancient refinement; and from the camps of the crusading kings, as well as
                    from the pope, some remarkable embassies were sent to the Tartar sovereigns, the
                    descendants of the conqueror Zinghis, the site of whose capital of Karrakorum is
                    now the subject of dispute, though it is generally agreed that it must have been
                    situated far east, in the wilds of Tartary. The object of the embassies
                    dispatched by the pope to the Tartar camp was to divert the storm of barbarian
                    invasion from Europe. The ambassadors were friars, who were carried to the
                    head-quarters of the Tartars, in the eastern wilds of Asia, through countries
                    which had never been explored by any European. Rubruquis, a friar, who was sent
                    ambassador by St Louis to the Tartars, has given a lively and circumstantial
                    account of his adventures. He reached the Tartar capital of Karrakorum after a
                    fatiguing and dangerous journey of more than two months, having traversed a vast
                    tract of unknown country, and brought to the knowledge of the Europeans the
                    immense plains and high lands of Central Asia, Eastern Tartary or the country of
                    the Mongols, Thibet, and Cathay or China, and the eastern shores of the
                    continent. All those countries were afterwards visited by the celebrated
                    Venetian traveller Marco Polo, who, being dazzled by the splendid accounts
                    diffused through Europe of the wealth and luxury of Asia, was inflamed with the
                    desire of exploring those distant countries. He accordingly proceeded through
                    Asia Minor, Persia, the high country of Balk, visited the cities of Cashgar and
                    Yarkund, and skirting the great desert of Shamo or Cobi, he reached the Tartar
                    capital of Karrakorum, and finally entered the Chinese empire, of which his
                    account is circumstantial and correct, and of which some of the magnificent
                    cities, though they have fallen from their ancient importance, are still
                    recognised in his accurate description. He returned to Venice by sea after an
                    absence of twenty-four years, having obtained accounts of the eastern islands of
                    Java, Sumatra, Ceylon, and of Ormus in the Persian Gulf, at that time the great
                    and splendid emporium of the Indian trade. The discovery, in 1498, of the
                    passage to India by the Cape of Good Hope, opened the Indian seas to the
                    European fleets; and shortly after this great event, the southern, and partly
                    also the eastern shores of Asia, were completely explored, as well as that great
                    archipelago which extends from the Malacca peninsula to New Holland. In the
                    interior of the continent the progress of discovery was much slower, and only
                    kept pace with the gradual extension of the Russian dominion over the barbarous
                    tribes in Northern Asia. The Tartars under Tamerlane in 1382 had invaded the
                    east of Europe, had taken Moscow, and overrun all the countries on the Volga and
                    the Dnieper. The rise of the northern empire was for more than two centuries
                    obstructed by the inroads of the barbarians; and it was only after long and
                    obstinate struggles that they yielded to the superiority of the Russian arms.
                    About the middle of the 16th century Russia had extended her conquests to the
                    Obi, and her empire was enlarged northward and eastward, until it reached the
                    frontiers of China and the Pacific Ocean. The general form of the continent,
                    which was exhibited in the maps from mere conjecture, was in this manner laid
                    open to Europeans; and in the course of the last century the eastern and
                    northern shores were surveyed; also Kamtschatka, the Kurile Islands, and Jesso.
                    The islands of Japan had been previously discovered by navigators. The relative
                    limits of the Asiatic and American continents were traced by Behring,
                    Tschirikoff, and other navigators, who also discovered the Aleutian or Fox
                    Islands; and finally by Captain Cook, who advancing into Behring’s Straits as
                    far as the parallel of 70° 44', ascertained the near approach and true bearing
                    of the two continents.</p>
                <p>The interior countries of Asia near the Caspian and Aral Seas have been visited
                    by Russian travellers, who have corrected some errors of long standing in
                    Asiatic geography. Lake Aral was either unknown to the ancients, or they
                    confounded it with the Caspian Sea, of which they supposed it to form a part,
                    and to be the receptacle of the great river Oxus. After the fact of two separate
                    seas was fully known, the Oxus was still supposed to terminate in Lake Aral; and
                    its course was laid down accordingly in all the most approved charts. The
                    Russians having visited those countries, ascertained by actual observation that
                    the Oxus, as well as the Jaxartes, terminates in the Caspian Sea.</p>
                <p>Eastern Asia, namely, the Chinese empire, with the source and termination of all
                    its great rivers; the northern country of the Tartars; the course of the great
                    river Amour; with the high lands of Central Asia, namely, Mongolia, the original
                    seat of the Mongols, were in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries explored
                    by the Romish missionaries, as well as by mercantile travellers. In 1624 Antonio
                    d’Andrada, a; esuit, travelled from the coast of the Great Mogul to China. He
                    passed through the country of Serinagur, and ascending the great Himalaya range,
                    he and his companions endured such incredible hardships that he was forced to
                    return. He afterwards crossed these mountains along with a caravan, and was
                    among the earliest travellers who reached the country of Thibet, which he
                    describes, and also the manners and religion of the people. In 1603 the
                    missionary Goez set out from Lahore, where he resided at the Mogul court on his
                    way to China. He travelled westward, and crossing the Indus, passed through the
                    countries of Cabul or Afghanistan, Cashgar to the north, and the country on the
                    banks of the Oxus; and crossing a ridge of the Himalaya Mountains, he arrived at
                    Yarkund. From this place he journeyed with a caravan across the central country
                    of Mongolia to China. These missionaries were received into high favour by the
                    Chinese emperors, who valued them on account of their science, and gave them
                    access to the public archives, which contained all the Chinese surveys of the
                    empire and of the adjacent countries. By the help of these they exhibited with
                    accuracy the interior geography of Thibet, and also of that extensive country
                    beyond the Ganges which now forms the Burman empire, and which is watered by the
                    great rivers that take their rise in the central mountains and run
                    southward,—the Irrawaddy into the Indian Ocean, the Setang into the Gulf of
                    Martaban, of which it forms the estuary, the Saluen into the same gulf, the
                    Menam into the Gulf of Siam, and the Menam-Kong or the Mekong into the Chinese
                    Sea.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Crauford’s <hi

                    'been generally believed. Grueber, who set out on his travels to the East in
                    1656, traversed the whole country of China, partly by land and partly by water;
                    and his route to Europe was through the Tartar deserts to Lassa, a town in
                    Thibet, and thence through the mountainous country of Nepaul to Battana on the
                    Ganges, Benares, and finally to Agra, which he reached after a journey of more
                    than twelve months. Other journeys equally enterprising were also undertaken by
                    the missionaries. Desideri set out in 1714 from Delhi, and travelled across the
                    Himalaya Mountains through Cashmere into Thibet; and, at a later period, Horace
                    de la Penna, with a body of twelve missionaries, resided in the same country for
                    a number of years. The missionary Gerbillon, who was in great favour at the
                    Chinese court, travelled in 1688 through the Tartar deserts, with a Chinese
                    embassy, to the banks of the Selingha, there to settle with the Russians the
                    respective limits of the two empires; and having been also in the practice of
                    following the emperor in his hunting expeditions into Tartary, he contributed
                    with other travellers to illustrate the geography of these countries and the
                    manners of the people.</p>
                <p>The great extension of the British conquests in Northern India has laid open to
                    Europeans all that portion of Asia which lies on the southern declivity of the
                    Himalaya Mountains, which is interesting not only from its natural grandeur, but
                    also as it contains the sources of the Indus, the Ganges, and the Brahmapootra.
                    The Europeans were indebted for all the knowledge which they possessed of those
                    countries to the Chinese missionaries, who represented the Ganges to rise on the
                    north of the Himalaya chain, from two small streams which pass the town of
                    La-dak. They fixed the source of the Indus in the Beloor Mountains, one of the
                    cross ridges which run north and south from the main Himalaya ridge. The British
                    in India, with all their characteristic ardour in the cause of science, have
                    corrected those errors of the Chinese geographers, having ascertained the source
                    of the Ganges to be not on the north, but on the southern side of the Himalaya
                    Mountains. The extent and bearing, and the vast elevation, of many of the
                    highest peaks of this northern barrier of Hindostan, have also been fixed by the
                    accurate observations of Lieutenant Webb and other officers. From the embassy of
                    Elphinstone into Afghanistan we have received more full details of that country;
                    and the course westward of the great Himalaya chain has been accurately traced,
                    as well as the upper course of the Indus, though the source of that river is
                    still imperfectly known. The missions of Turner into Bootan, of Kirkpatrick and
                    Buchanan into Nepaul, and the embassy of Major Symes and Dr Buchanan to the
                    court of Ava, and of Mr Crauford, who resided in the character of ambassador at
                    that court, and whose works have thrown great light on the commerce and manners
                    of Asia, have contributed materially to illustrate the geography of those
                    countries. Of the vast regions of Tartary to the west of China, and under its
                    dominion, we know nothing except from the earlier travellers and missionaries,
                    and from the accounts published of the journeys of the Russian embassies through
                    these countries; nor is there any immediate prospect of reaching those central
                    districts from the south; for though the inhabitants appear mild and friendly,
                    the Chinese authorities are firm in repressing the slightest intrusion of
                    strangers into the sacred territory.</p>
                <p>Asia, notwithstanding the wars by which it has been desolated, was from an early
                    period the seat of commerce and of wealth. The eastern countries of Hindostan
                    and China appear to have preceded Europe in civilization and industry, and,
                    independent of that diversity of natural productions which is the foundation of
                    trade, they had cultivated many arts and manufactures which were unknown in the
                    western world. Asia accordingly abounded in many precious commodities which
                    could not be produced by the ruder industry of Europe. Thus China had its silk
                    and porcelain; Hindostan its muslins, cotton, precious stones, and aromatics of
                    all sorts; costus, bdellium, spikenard, ivory, tortoise-shell, pepper, &amp;c.
                    These were in general demand throughout Europe, where they could not be
                    produced; and they were procured in exchange chiefly for bullion, which then, as
                    in later times, was the great article of export to India; also for woollen
                    cloths, wine, brass, lead and tin, glass, coral, female slaves, &amp;c., all
                    which commodities met with a ready sale in the markets of Hindostan. The staple
                    commodity of China was silk; and the mode of producing this esteemed luxury
                    being unknown in Europe, it was brought in large quantities, either by the
                    caravans or by the annual fleets, to Alexandria, at that time the great
                    commercial mart of the East, and was thence sent to supply the demand at Rome,
                    where it sold at one time for its weight in gold; but, owing to the high profit,
                    caravans began to travel so regularly to China, that the supply increased with
                    the demand, and the price was reduced. Between the 6th and the 7th centuries
                    Eastern Asia was robbed of this precious monopoly by the art of two Persian
                    monks, who contrived, in a hollow cane, to transport the eggs of the silk-worm
                    from China to Europe, where they were hatched by means of heat, and the race
                    quickly propagated; and one great link of commerce between China and Europe was
                    in this mariner broken. The trade of Asia was interrupted by the irruption of
                    the barbarians, who invaded and finally subverted the Roman empire; but the
                    moment the storm was past, commerce resumed its quiet course. Constantinople,
                    the eastern capital of the empire, was still the centre of luxury and trade; as
                    were also such parts of the Roman territory as had not been swept by barbarian
                    invasion; and with those places the caravans still traded, shaping their course
                    as they best could to avoid the distractions of the interior. Farther to the
                    east the caliphs who reigned at Bagdad encouraged science, commerce, and the
                    arts; and the extensive country through which the Oxus and the Jaxartes flowed
                    was the seat of a flourishing commerce and of many opulent cities. Besides
                    Buckharia, still a great city, Balk, Samarcand, Cosh, and others in the valley
                    of the Oxus and the Jaxartes, numerous splendid cities are enumerated which are
                    scarcely known to Europeans. To the east of the great range of mountains which
                    takes a direction from the main Himalaya ridge, the country of Cashgar contained
                    Cashgar its capital, and Khoten, which were both large, populous, and wealthy.
                    Those countries served as the connecting link between India and Europe, and the
                    resting-place of the caravans, which there collected in great force, and
                    prepared for their journey to China across the great eastern desert, or for a
                    more southerly course through the country of Thibet. The armies of Zinghis Khan
                    in the 13th, and of Tamerlane in the beginning of the 15th century, laid waste
                    this highly cultivated and flourishing region. But those conquerors were not the
                    enemies of commerce, and the surplus produce of India still reached Europe,
                    though by a route rendered more difficult and dangerous from the desolation of
                    the intervening countries. But the effect produced on the trade of Asia in the
                    East by the encroachments of barbarism, and by the disorders in the interior,
                    was more than counterbalanced by the growing civilization of Europe. About the
                    beginning of the 14th century, the darkness which had so long covered the
                    western world began to dispel, and the Italian cities of Venice, Genoa, and
                    others, had already made advances in letters, science, and commerce. The costly
                    articles of Asia, her rich stuffs and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104648"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-4648-0699"/>precious aromatics, were now required to answer
                    the growing demands of luxury and wealth; and the produce of India, imported
                    into Alexandria through the Red Sea, was thence brought into Italy by the nobles
                    of Venice and Genoa, who were all engaged in trade, and was diffused in smaller
                    quantities all over Europe. The Italian states were enriched by this lucrative
                    traffic, which only ceased with the discovery of the maritime route to India by
                    the Cape of Good Hope. From this period the trade between Asia and Europe took a
                    different direction. The commodities of India and China were transported to
                    Europe directly by sea; and neither Alexandria nor the other ports of the Red
                    Sea or of Italy were any longer the depositaries of the eastern trade. The
                    Portuguese, always distinguished by their ardour for maritime discovery, were
                    the first adventurers in the Asiatic seas. In the course of the 16th century the
                    English and Dutch appeared as their competitors; and with the growing wealth of
                    those countries the trade to the East rapidly increased. The commerce of Asia
                    may therefore be distinguished into the following branches :—Isí, The inland
                    trade of China, Hindostan, Burmah, &amp;c. with Turkey, the eastern countries of
                    Europe, and with the intervening countries of Persia, Balk, Buckharia, and the
                    regions of the Oxus; also, by a different route, the trade with Russia and the
                    north of Asia, 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> The maritime trade, including the
                    coasting trade and the trade to the eastern archipelago, and the great trade to
                    Europe and America, in which, from the progress of wealth and luxury, there is a
                    great consumption of Asiatic produce.</p>
                <p>The. inland trade of Asia is carried on by caravans, or large bodies of
                    merchants, who travel together for the sake of security through those parts of
                    the country which are disturbed by predatory tribes. It is only from the
                    southern countries of Asia, such as Hindostan, China, the Burmese countries,
                    Thibet, and the western countries of Persia, Afghanistan, Buckharia, and the
                    regions of the Oxus and the Jaxartes, that Europe can derive any supply of
                    valuable commodities; and all this trade, from whatever quarter it comes, must
                    flow in its progress to Europe through the countries that he between the Persian
                    Gulf and the Caspian Sea; as the caravans could not, without inconvenience and
                    danger from wandering tribes, pass to the north of this sea or the sea of Aral;
                    and accordingly, though an annual caravan is sent from Astracan to Khyvah and
                    the countries on the Oxus, the chief trade with Russia is by sea to the port of
                    Man-galshuck, and thence to Khyvah and Buckharia. The Russians have also begun
                    to trade with Persia from the Caucasian province of Georgia, of which Tiflis,
                    the capital, has, from a wretched collection of wooden huts, been rapidly
                    improved, under the protecting influence of a European government, into a
                    respectable and wealthy town, the future emporium, as may be anticipated, of
                    this growing trade. The caravans from Constantinople and Syria proceed through
                    Asia Minor and the northern or southern provinces of Persia, according as their
                    ulterior route is through Afghanistan and the Punjaub into Hindostan, or to
                    Thibet and China, or the more northern districts of Balk, Buckharia, and the
                    country of the Oxus and the Jaxartes. Buckharia, though reduced to desolation by
                    Zinghis Khan, is still one of the largest towns of the East, and is only
                    exceeded by Peking and other Chinese cities, or by Calcutta. It is also a great
                    commercial mart; and the caravans which come from the west, passing along the
                    southern shore of the Caspian Sea through the Persian province of Astrabad, a
                    most luxuriant and fertile country, arrive successively at Balfröosh, Ashruff,
                    Astrabad, Mushed, Serrukhs, Merve, formerly the capital of the Seljook
                    sovereigns, but now surrounded by deserts, and at Buckharia. From this great
                    centre of commerce they proceed north-eastward about 400 or 500 miles to Khojend
                    and Kokaun, the former a large city, said to contain 30,000 houses; and crossing
                    the Beloor range of the Himalaya Mountains, they arrive in the Mahometan states
                    of Kashgar and Yarkund, 600 miles east of Kokaun, passing some towns on the way,
                    of which Ush is the most important, being a trading and populous town. Those two
                    latter states lie within the precincts of the Chinese authority, where the most
                    exact order is enforced; and they are fertile, rich, and well cultivated. The
                    town of Cashgar is said to contain 20,000 houses, and to be thronged with
                    strangers from all parts of Asia. Yarkund is also wealthy and populous. So
                    strict a police is maintained by the. Chinese authority, that, according to the
                    information given to Fraser,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Narrative of a Journey into
                    Khorassan,</hi> Appendix.</p></note> a single traveller may traverse the whole
                    territory as safely as a large caravan. From Kashgar there is a constant
                    intercourse through Chinese Tartary, along the edge of the great central desert,
                    with China, though we know little of the intervening countries beyond what we
                    learn from the accounts of the early missionaries. Besides this eastern trade,
                    and the trade westward along the southern shore of the Caspian, two caravans,
                    consisting of 4000 or 5000 camels each, proceed to Astracan by Khyvah, round the
                    northern shore of the Caspian Sea. The imports from Russia into Buckharia are
                    iron, steel, copper, brass, quicksilver, vermillion, coral, hardware, plated
                    goods, gold and silver embroidery, copper-wire; furs, the broad cloths and
                    cotton manufactured goods of Britain, Germany, and France; refined sugar,
                    cochineal, paper, and a variety of rich goods, which, from this great commercial
                    depot, are diffused far and wide over Central Asia. Russia receives in exchange
                    black lamb-skins, certain manufactures of cotton and silk imported from Persia,
                    antique gems and coins, lapis lazuli, rubies, and turquoises, which are received
                    from the southern country of Buducksha, where there are famous mines of these
                    precious stones. From Cashgar, Yarkund, and the side of China, Buckharia
                    receives large quantities of tea, the great modern staple of the China trade,
                    porcelain and China ware, and the various manufactures of China; and in return
                    sends turquoises, coral, sheep, lamb, and fox-skins, and furs, &amp;c. From
                    Persia shawls are imported, and woollen goods from Kerman; silk stuffs from the
                    cities of Yezd and Ispahan; gold and silver embroidery, copper-ware, loaf,
                    candy, and raw sugar; Hamadan leather; and turquoises, of which there are mines
                    in Persia; and, in return, black sheep and lambskins are sent, which are in
                    great request, to be manufactured into black caps; camblet made of camel’s hair,
                    coarse coloured silk handkerchiefs, lapis lazuli, indigo from India, cochineal,
                    tobacco, chintzes from Masulipatam, and cotton manufactures. Slaves form a
                    staple article in the commerce of Buckharia, and also of Khyvah. These are made
                    prisoners by the disorderly tribes of Asia, the Koords, Turkomans, &amp;c., in
                    the course of the wars in which they are constantly engaged; and they are
                    carried to the great slave markets of Buckharia and Khyvah, where they are
                    exposed for sale like cattle. The balance of trade is always in favour of
                    Buckharia. Money is consequently in great plenty, and cannot be imported with a
                    profit into this trading city. The Russian caravans, as they journey round the
                    north shore of the Caspian Sea, are frequently attacked by the Kirgeesh and
                    Cossack tribes, and prisoners <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104661"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-4661-0700"/>are carried off and sold into slavery Fraser was
                    assured that the number of Persian slaves in Khyvah and its dependencies
                    exceeded the male population of these countries, and amounted to 150,000; and
                    that, according to inquiries set on foot by the empress Catherine, there were in
                    Buckharia no less than 60,000 Russian slaves.</p>
                <p>The commerce of the west with the southern countries of Asia, namely, Cabul or
                    Afghanistan, Cashmere, and India, passes through Persia by a different and more
                    southerly route, namely, by Cashan, Yezd, which is the seat of rich silk
                    manufactures, a great entrepôt of commerce, and a convenient resting place for
                    all the caravans, both from the east and other quarters; through Furrah, and
                    Herat, on the frontiers of Persia, famed for its rich manufactures of silk
                    stuffs, a great channel of communication between the east and the west, and also
                    an entrepôt of all the richest productions from Cabul, Cashmere, and India on
                    the one side, and from Buckharia, Persia, Arabia, Turkey, and even Europe, on
                    the other. From Herat the route continues through Furrah and across the river
                    Helmund and the ranges of the Paropamisan Mountains, to Candahar, a journey of
                    about 800 miles; thence to Cabul, Peshawer, and the countries on the Indus, and
                    across extensive sandy deserts to the rich valley of the Ganges, whence, by this
                    river, there is an easy access to Bengal and to Central India. There are various
                    other routes by which the commerce of Asia, concentrated within the
                    comparatively narrow boundaries of the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf,
                    diverges in its progress eastward to the north, as well as to the south. From
                    Buckharia there is a mountainous route into Little Thibet, and thence through
                    Thibet into China; besides other more sequestered and difficult roads, through
                    glens and mountains, where the only mode of transport is on the backs of asses
                    and mules.</p>
                <p>Persia, from its central situation between the east and the west, is not only a
                    great entrepôt of Asiatic trade, but, though on the whole rather a poor country,
                    it still contributes some valuable productions to the commerce of the East. It
                    has long been famed for its abundant produce of raw silk, of cotton, and of
                    wool, that of the province of Kerman especially being so valuable for shawls
                    that it rivals in some respects that of Cashmere; of fruits, turquoises,
                    tobacco, grain, &amp;c. Almost all the principal towns of Persia, such as
                    Kashan, Ispahan, Yezd, Tabreez, Kerman, Herat, &amp;c. excel in the manufacture
                    of silks, cottons, woollens, fine carpets, &amp;c.; Kerman also in the

                    its chief exports to other countries, in exchange for their manufactures or

                    tobacco, horses, in which there is a considerable traffic, swords, &amp;c. and
                    specie to make up the deficient balance. The imports from India are cotton
                    goods, as chintzes, sent from Masulipatam by sea to Bushire, whence they reach
                    the interior of Persia, and are thence carried eastward into Cabul and the
                    countries on the Indus; the same article from Moultan, Lucknow, Delhi, &amp;c.;
                    some muslins, indigo, spices, sugar, and sugar-candy, in large quantities; gold
                    and silver stuffs and brocades from Benares; precious stones, Cashmere shawls,

                    spices, indigo, muslins, &amp;c. are carried through Asia Minor by a long land
                    carriage to their final destination in European Turkey, and are found, along
                    with the lamb-skins of the no less distant Buckharia, in the bazaars of Bagdad
                    and Constantinople.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    The Indian cloths, shawls, chintzes, and also the indigo, are exported to
                    Buckharia, from which are imported the broad cloths, cutlery, and hardware of
                    Europe, received from the Russians, and finally consumed in Cabul and the
                    countries of the Indus, loaded with the expenses of a land journey across nearly
                    half the globe.</p>
                <p>In the east of Asia, China has from the earliest times been the seat of wealth
                    and of an extensive trade. The Chinese have been always noted for their
                    industrious habits, and the country has from time immemorial abounded in the
                    most valuable produce and manufactures. These were sentwest-ward in the caravans
                    to AsiaMinor and into Europe, or they were transported by sea to India, and
                    carried thence by the European fleets to the Red Sea. The same commerce is still
                    continued, and China exports its produce of woollens, silk, and satin; tea in
                    small boxes of thin lead; china, porcelain, raw silk, cochineal, crystal, gold
                    dust, golden ingots, and silver with the Chinese stamp. These are sent through
                    Chinese Tartary into the countries on the Oxus, and also to Cashmere, Cabul, and
                    the countries situated on the southern declivity of the Himalaya Mountains.
                    Regular caravans of horses and ponies, no other animal being fit to travel
                    through those mountainous districts, set out from Cashmere, and from Peshawer,
                    the capital of the Afghan country of Cabul, and a considerable commercial
                    resort, to make their way through Chinese Tartary with goods imported from India
                    and Persia. China carries on also an interior trade to a considerable extent
                    with Russia by the frontier town of Maimatchin, in which European goods and furs
                    are received in exchange for tea, silk, and other articles of Chinese produce
                    and manufacture.</p>
                <p>In addition to her internal trade, Asia maintains an extensive intercourse by sea
                    with Europe, America, and with' Egypt and all the countries on the
                    Mediterranean. A great trade is also carried on from Hindostan and China to the
                    Asiatic archipelago, and the trade of the Asiatic islands with each other is of
                    great importance. It appears that those islands were at a very early period the
                    seat of commerce; and the learned researches of Europeans have brought to light,
                    in some of them, the monuments of ancient <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104674"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-4674-0701"/>civilization. Sumatra was the seat of the Malay
                    empire, Java of a Hindoo state; and the Celebes were inhabited by the Bugis, a
                    race of expert navigators and merchants. The productions of these islands, and
                    of the Moluccas and Borneo, namely, spices, aromatics, and gold, entered into
                    the commerce of the ancient world, and were imported into Rome through Egypt. In
                    later times, about the 9th century, the Asiatic archipelago was visited by the
                    Arabs and the Chinese, while the adventurous Malays frequented the coasts of
                    Asia, and even of Africa, and particularly the African island of Madagascar.
                    When these islands were visited by Europeans, about the 15th century, Malacca,
                    Acheen, and Bantam were the great marts of the eastern archipelago, where the
                    rich produce of Sumatra, Borneo, and the Moluccas, conveyed in the small trading
                    craft of the country, was exchanged for that of India and China. The Portuguese
                    fixed on Goa, on the Malabar coast, as the capital of their eastern settlements;
                    and they afterwards selected Malacca as a central station for protecting and
                    extending their intercourse with the neighbouring nations. The Dutch chose
                    Bantam, and afterwards Batavia, situated midway between Hindostan and China, as
                    the centre of their commercial settlements. The situation was most advantageous,
                    and the port was soon frequented by vessels from China and Japan, Tonquin,
                    Malacca, Cochin-China, and the island of Celebes. But the great and flourishing
                    trade of Java was crushed under the colonial monopoly of the Dutch, and under
                    what Sir Stamford Raffles terms “the short-sighted tyranny of a mercantile
                    administration.” The conquest of Java by the British in 1812 put an end to this
                    thraldom, and the great trade of the Asiatic archipelago began to centre in
                    Batavia, which was fast rising into a great commercial emporium; all the
                    articles which were the exclusive produce of the eastern islands being collected
                    at its principal ports for re-exportation to India, China, and Europe. Since
                    Java was restored to the Dutch, the free port of Singapore, established by the
                    British, is the centre of a great trade, and is frequented by the Chinese in
                    their junks, and by all the other navigators of those seas with the produce of
                    their respective islands.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    certain species of bird, which are esteemed a great luxury at their tables, and
                    sell, it is said, for their weight in silver; biche-demer or tripang, a dried
                    sea-slug, also used in Chinese dishes; Malayan camphor, the exclusive produce of
                    Sumatra and Borneo; the tin of Banca, the spices of the Moluccas·, opium, indigo
                    imported from Hindostan; gold and silver, the first collected in Sumatra,
                    Borneo, and some of the other islands. The maritime country trade of the Asiatic
                    islands is carried on chiefly by the Chinese in their junks and brigs, by the
                    Arabs in square-rigged vessels, and by the Bugis, the inhabitants of Celebes,
                    who are all bold and expert navigators.</p>
                <p>From the east the annual fleet of Chinese junks arrives with the favourable
                    monsoon among these islands, from Canton, Amoi, and other provinces, with
                    cargoes of teas, raw silk, silk, piece-goods, and innumerable minor articles,
                    for the use of the Chinese, who are settled in great numbers here, and are
                    distinguished by their shrewd, intelligent, and industrious habits. The Chinese
                    extend their voyages to Sumatra, the Straits of Malacca, and eastward as far as
                    the Moluccas and Timor, collecting edible bird-nests, biche-de-mer, and other
                    articles of which Java is the great entrepôt. Java is also a great depot of
                    European goods; and the people being rather industrious cultivators of their
                    fertile island than mariners or traders, it exports rice, a variety of vetches,
                    salt, oil, tobacco, timber, brass-wire, and its own cloths, and a considerable
                    quantity of European, Indian, and Chinese goods, in exchange for gold dust,
                    diamonds, camphor, benjamin, and other drugs; edible bird-nests, biche-de-mer,
                    rattans, bees-wax, tortoise-shell, and dyeing woods from Borneo and Sumatra. The
                    rice and other productions of Java are exchanged for spices and pungent oils of
                    the Moluccas, and for the tin of Banca. The natives of Celebes are famed for the
                    manufacture of a particular species of fine cloths, of a very strong texture,
                    which are in great request, and, along with spices, wax, and sandal-wood, are
                    exchanged for the produce of Sumatra, Borneo, and Java, whence they are exported
                    to China. The Bugis have a large share of the carrying trade of the Asiatic
                    archipelago; and they bring the produce of the Moluccas, and of Borneo and
                    Sumatra, to Java and the other islands, and receive in exchange tobacco, rice,
                    and salt, from Java, besides opium, iron, steel, European chintzes, and broad
                    cloths and Indian piece goods, with which they return eastward during the
                    southwest monsoon.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The eastern countries of Asia, viz. India and China, as we have already stated,
                    have from time immemorial been famed for certain manufactures, such as silks,
                    cambrics, muslins, &amp;c., as well as for other products peculiar to the
                    climate, viz. spices, precious aromatics, medicinal herbs,&amp;c. These were
                    always in great demand in Europe, while the produce of Europe was not wanted in
                    Asia. From the rude state of industry among the western nations, they had
                    nothing to offer in exchange for the finer manufactures of India, and still less
                    could the soil of Europe yield any equivalent for the more genial produce of
                    eastern climes. Hence the great article of export in those times from Europe to
                    Asia was always bullion, the instrument of exchange all over the world. Bullion
                    could only be procured by an exportation of European produce or manufactures at
                    such low prices as to insure a sale; and the loss on such transactions must have
                    been made up to the merchant by the high price of Asiatic goods. The ancient
                    monopoly of silk secured to Asia a favourable balance of trade with Europe,
                    bullion being the only article with which it could be purchased. Notwithstanding
                    the introduction of the silk manufacture into Europe about the 6th or 7th
                    century, the commercial pre-eminence of Asia still continued, and bullion was
                    the chief article of export to the East. Throughout the interior of Asia this
                    superiority remains to the present day; and a continua^ stream of bullion flows
                    from the Bosphorus eastward through Asia Minor and Persia into Hindostan, and is
                    finally dispersed in the great ocean of the Chinese currency. Bullion is also
                    the principal article sent from Arabia to India in exchange for Indian
                    goods.</p>
                <p>But a great revolution has taken place in the trade between Asia and Europe, and
                    especially with Great Britain. Europe is now in a condition to offer an
                    equivalent in manufactures for the produce of Asia; goods of various kinds are
                    sent in exchange for those of India; and from Great Britain remittances in
                    bullion have nearly ceased. So prodigiously has the price of goods been lowered
                    by the use of machinery, that the cotton wool of India is now imported into
                    Britain, and, after being manufactured, is re-exported to the place of its
                    growth, and sold at a lower price than the same goods from the loom of the
                    Indian workman, though it is loaded with the expense of a double voyage across
                    half the globe. The goods of the European<pb break="no" facs="nls:193104687"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-4687-0702"/> manufacturers are poured into Asia through all
                    its seaports, and reaching the interior on the backs of mules and asses, often
                    after a journey of several thousand miles over deserts and mountains covered
                    with perpetual snow, they are sold cheaper than the same articles by the native
                    workmen. The woollen manufactures of Yorkshire, the cotton goods of Manchester
                    and Glasgow, French cloths, and German linens, are dispersed all over Hindostan,
                    and even partially in China; they are found in the bazaars of Buckharia,
                    Samarcand, and Cashgar, and are carried eastward by the caravans into the wilds
                    of Tartary.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr J.

                    manufactures, and a proportional increase in that of the raw materials, such as
                    silk, cotton, indigo, &amp;c. From India and China the annual value of the
                    imports amounts to about L.10,000,000. In 1829 they amounted in value to
                    L.10,627,441; of which the sum of L.8,561,345 is made up of four articles, viz.
                    cotton wool, indigo, raw silk, and tea.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the cotton manufactures exported, which amounted in 1814 to L.l 1,341, had
                    increased in 1828 to L.754,098. The natural productions of Asia, namely, spices,
                    rich aromatics, dyes, and other rare luxuries of tropical climates, will always
                    be in demand in Europe; and the monopoly of tea by the Chinese gives them the
                    command of the European markets. Tea has now almost become one of the
                    necessaries of life, and it travels for a market across half the globe. It is
                    the great commercial link between Europe and China, from which, like the
                    precious produce of silk in ancient times, it can only be procured. But the
                    improved industry of Europe supplies, as already observed, an equivalent in
                    woollen and cotton goods for this highly prized luxury; and there can be no
                    doubt that if the trade were not obstructed by the East India Company’s
                    monopoly, it would gradually extend with the growing demand of the Chinese
                    market. The charter of the East India Company expires in 1834; and if the trade
                    is thrown open, it is certain that British produce will make its way into all
                    the most distant markets of the East. Such an intercourse would not only benefit
                    commerce, but would promote the higher interests of civilization, as it would
                    extend to the benighted countries of Asia the literature and science, and all
                    the other improvements, of Europe.</p>
