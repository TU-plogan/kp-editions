                <p><label type="entry">ANTIGONUS I</label>., one of the captains of Alexander the
                    Great, was the son of Philip, a Macedonian nobleman. After Alexander’s death, a
                    division of the provinces taking place, Pamphylia, Lycia, and Phrygia Major fell
                    tohis share. But Perdiccas, well acquainted with his ambitious spirit and great
                    abilities, determined to divest him of his government, and laid plans for his
                    life, by bringing various accusations against him. Antigonus, aware of the
                    danger, retired with his son Demetrius into Greece, where he obtained the favour
                    and protection of Antipater; and in a short time Perdiccas dying, a new division
                    took place, when he was invested not only with the government of the former
                    provinces, but also with that of Lycaonia. He was likewise intrusted with the
                    command of the Macedonian household troops; and upon Eumenes being declared a
                    public enemy, he received orders to prosecute the war against him with the
                    utmost vigour. On the commencement of this war, Eumenes suffered a total
                    overthrow, and was obliged to retire with only 600 brave followers to a castle
                    situated on an inaccessible rock, where he might rest in safety from all the
                    assaults of Antigonus. In the interval, his friends assembled a new army for his
                    relief, which was routed by Antigonus, who now began to exhibit the great
                    projects of his ambition. Polyperchon succeeding to the tutorship of the young
                    king of Macedon after Antipater’s death, Antigonus resolved to set himself up as
                    lord of all Asia. On account of the great power of Eumenes, he greatly desired
                    to gain him over to his interest; but that faithful commander, effecting his
                    escape from the fortress where he was closely blockaded, raised an army, and was
                    appointed the royal general in Asia. The governors in Upper Asia co-operating
                    with him, he succeeded in several engagements against Antigonus; but was at last
                    delivered up to him through treachery, and put to death. Upon this the governor
                    of Upper Asia yielded to Antigonus. Those whom he suspected, he either
                    sacrificed to his resentment or displaced from their offices. Then seizing upon
                    all the treasures at Susa, he directed his march towards Babylon, of which city
                    Seleucus was governor. Seleucus fled to Ptolemy, and entered into a league with
                    him, together with Lysimachus and Cassander, with the intention of giving a
                    check to the exorbitant power of Antigonus, who, notwithstanding this, made a
                    successful attempt upon the provinces of Syria and Phoenicia. But these
                    provinces were soon after recovered by Ptolemy, who defeated his son Demetrius,
                    while he himself was employed in repelling Cassander, who had made rapid
                    progress in Lesser Asia. They were again taken by Antigonus, who, being flushed
                    with his success, planned an expedi·ion against the Nabathaean Arabs, dwelling
                    in the deserts adjacent to Judea; but on the first enterprise against the town
                    of Petra, his general Athenaeus, with almost all his troops, was cut to pieces
                    by the Arabs. Antigonus then sent his son against them, who returned after
                    forcing them to reasonable terms. Demetrius then expelled Şeleucus from Babylon;
                    and success attending his arms wherever he went, the confederates were obliged
                    to make a treaty with Antigonus, in which it was stipulated that he should
                    remain in possession of all Asia, but that the Greek cities should continue in
                    possession of their liberty. This agreement was soon violated, under the
                    pretence that garrisons had been placed in some of these cities by Antigonus. At
                    first Ptolemy made a successful descent into Lesser Asia, and on several of the
                    islands of the Archipelago; but he was at length defeated by the successful arms
                    of Demetrius in a sea-fight, who also took the island of Cyprus, with many
                    prisoners. On this victory Antigonus was so elated that he assumed the title of
                    king, and bestowed the same upon his son; and from that time, B. c. 306, his
                    reign in Asia, and that of Ptolemy in Egypt, and of the other captains of
                    Alexander in their respective governments, properly commence.</p>
                <p>Irritated at the hostile conduct of Ptolemy, Antigonus prepared a numerous army
                    and a formidable fleet; and having taken the command of the army, he gave the
                    com· mand of the fleet to Demetrius, and hastened to attack him in his own
                    dominions. After enduring the severest hardships, they met in the vicinity <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> of Mount Cassius; but Ptolemy acted with such valour
                    and address that Demetrius could gain no advantage over him; and after several
                    fruitless attempts, he abandoned the undertaking. He next attempted the
                    reduction of Rhodes; but meeting with obstinate resistance, he was obliged to
                    make a treaty upon the best terms that he could, having been called to join
                    Antigonus against Cassander, who at this time had formed a confederacy with
                    Seleucus and Lysimachus. When Demetrius united his forces with those of
                    Antigonus, they advanced to Phrygia, and having met the enemy at Ipsus, a
                    decisive battle was fought, in which Antigonus fell, in the 84th year of his
                    age, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 301.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Antigonus</hi><hi rend="italic">Gonatas,</hi> son of
                    Demetrius Poliorcetes, was the grandson of the former Antigonus. His character
                    was eminently distinguished by humanity and mildness of disposition. When he
                    besieged Thebes under the command of his father, he strongly remonstrated
                    against the loss of so many lives for such an insignificant object. Filial
                    affection was so powerful in his mind, that when his father was taken prisoner
                    by Seleucus, he generously offered himself in his stead; and being rejected, he
                    wore deep mourning, and refrained from all festivals and amusements during his
                    father’s imprisonment. Informed of his death, all the floods of sorrow burst
                    from his tender heart, and sailing with a fleet to meet his ashes, he received
                    them with all the demonstrations of filial sensibility and dutiful respect. By
                    the death of his father he became master of all the European dominions of
                    Demetrius, together with the kingdom of Macedon, and various other cities in
                    Greece. The Gauls invading his country, he defeated and expelled them; but was
                    soon after routed by Pyrrhus, king of Epirus. Some time after, however, Pyrrhus
                    was slain at Argos; and when his head was brought to him by his son, he
                    expressed the highest displeasure, and throwing his robe over it, he gave orders
                    to search for his body, and to inter the same with all funeral honours. ∙</p>
                <p>In the evening of his reign he so cultivated the arts of peace, and so
                    conciliated the minds of his subjects, that he secured their affections both to
                    himself and his descendants. The taking of the citadel of Corinth by intrigue
                    was the meanest action of his reign; but he improved that event in maintaining
                    the freedom of the small estates of Greece, and in increasing his own dominions.
                    The Achaeans, and Aratus their famous chief, vigorously opposed his measures,
                    and at length recovered Corinth; but Antigonus was so inclined to peace, that
                    notwithstanding this event, he pursued his wonted plan, and left his kingdom in
                    peace about the 80th year of his life and the 44th of his reign, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 243; and Demetrius II. his son, next ascended the
                    throne.</p>
