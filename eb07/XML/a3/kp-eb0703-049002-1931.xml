                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> power of philosophy in fixing an impression of
                    itself on the world, appears, when attentively viewed, no less than that
                    evidenced in successful exertions of civil or military talents. But there is a
                    striking difference in the comparative interest excited by the philosopher
                    himself, and the distinguished statesman or general. The personal fortunes of
                    the philosopher are not connected with the effects of his philosophy. He has
                    passed away from the eyes of men, when his powerful agency begins to be
                    perceived; whereas the statesman and the commander of armies are implicated in
                    the very effects which they produce on the world, and the history which tells of
                    their policy or their conquests assumes almost the character of their
                    biographies.</p>
                <p>This contrast is strongly displayed in the instance of the particular philosopher
                    whose life we would now retrace. At this day, alter the lapse of twenty-one
                    centuries from its first appearance, we are experiencing the power of
                    Aristotle’s philosophy, in. its effects on language and literature, and even on
                    theology; and yet little satisfactory information can be obtained from antiquity
                    respecting tĥe philosopher himself. No account of him appears to have been given
                    until his celebrity had attracted envy as well as admiration; so that we are
                    compelled to receive with suspicion every thing beyond the simple detail of a
                    few facts.</p>

                    of Macedonia; his mother Phaestis; both being of Chalcidian descent. His family
                    referred its origin to Machaon, son of Esculapius; probably from the hereditary
                    profession of medicine by which it was distinguished.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Being left an orphan in early youth, Aristotle quitted Stageirus for Atarneus in
                    Mysia, the residence of Proxenus, the friend to whose guardianship he was
                    committed. Here he continued until his seventeenth year, when he repaired to the
                    great university of the world at that time —the school of Plato at Athens.
                    Different accounts are given of the commencement of his application to
                    philosophy. By one it is ascribed to a direction of the Pythian oracle.<note

                    >Arìstot</hi></p></note> Others state that philosophy was a last resource with
                    him, when other schemes of life had failed; that, having exhausted a' large
                    patrimony, he became a military adventurer, and after that a seller of drugs;
                    until at length, on accidentally entering the school of Plato, he received a
                    sudden impulse to the studies of his future life. These last statements,
                    however, are not reconcilable with the period of youth at which his discipleship
                    to Plato began; nor are they quite consistent with the alleged fact, that his
                    mind had been from the first trained to philosophical pursuits by his father
                    Nicoachus.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>His rather

                <p>We can readily suppose that the extraordinary talent for science, and laborious
                    devotion to it, which his mature age developed, would give some indications of
                    themselves in his earlier years. Hence the expressions attributed to Plato,
                    complimenting him as “the intellect of the school,” and “the reader,” and
                    comparing his ardour and forwardness to the spirit of a restive colt.<note

                    death of that philosopher, B. c. 348, and then returning to Atarneus.
                    Disappointment at not succeeding to the chair of Plato in the academy, has been
                    assigned as the reason of his departure.</p>

                <p>All that appears, however, is,' that he left Athens in com-pliance with an
                    invitation from Hermeias,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Commonly called Hermeias the eunuch.</p></note> who, having been his
                    fellow-disciple in the school of Plato, had established himself at that time in
                    independence against the king of Persia, as tyrant of Atarneus and its
                    neighbourhood. Here he spent the following three years of his life,'when the
                    unhappy end of his friend Hermeias, who fell a sacrifice to his ambition, and
                    was executed as a rebel against Persia, compelled him to seek a refuge for
                    himself by flight to Mitylene. Nor did he in this extremity forget the ties of
                    friendship which had connected him with the unfortunate tyrant of Atarneus. To
                    support the fallen family, he married Pythias, the adopted daughter, but
                    variously described both as the sister and as the niece,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Aristippus, according to Laertius, says it
                    was the mistress of Hermeias that Aristotle married.</p></note> of Hermeias.</p>
                <p>From Mitylene he proceeded into Macedonia to the court of Philip, and entered on
                    a new scene of exertion, as the preceptor of the future sovereign of the
                    mightiest kingdom of the world—Alexander the Great, at that time a youth of
                    fourteen years of age. The call to such an office argues the high reputation
                    already attained by Aristotle for philosophy, though it is not improbable that
                    his first introduction to the Macedonian court was through the interest and
                    favour enjoyed there by his father Nicoachus. At what time, indeed, his care of
                    the youthful prince commenced, it is not possible exactly to determine. A letter
                    is extant, addressed by Philip to Aristotle, which would imply that the charge
                    of the prince’s education had been committed to the philosopher from the birth
                    of Alexander. This is also far more probable than that the charge should have
                    been postponed until the prince had reached his fourteenth year, the period at
                    which the actual residence of Aristotle at Pella is dated. Philip states in that
                    letter that “a son is born to him; that he is grateful to the gods, but not so
                    much for the birth of the boy, as that he was born in the time of Aristotle;
                    trusting that, being nurtured and trained up by the philosopher, he would be a
                    worthy successor to his father’s glory and the conduct of affairs.”<note

                    certainly very possible that a plan of education proposed by Aristotle may have
                    been carried on by others, until the more especial care of the intellectual
                    powers demanded his personal instructions. The reception of the philosopher by
                    the royal family was most friendly and honourable to him. The high estimation in
                    which he was held was shown in the influence he possessed at the Macedonian
                    court. Philip, it is said, gave him liberal supplies of money to enable him to
                    pursue his philosophical labours.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    most happy in the admiration and affection of his pupil. Alexander valued his
                    instructions as those of a second parent, observing that “he was no less
                    indebted to Aristotle than to his father, since it was through his father indeed
                    that he lived, but through Aristotle that he lived well.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>It would be interesting to know what particular method was pursued by Aristotle
                    in the education of Alexander; but we have no exact information on this point.
                    It appears certain, however, that he made the cultivation of a taste for
                    literature the great principle of his instructions; and this would be in
                    conformity with the plan of education proposed in his treatise of politics. He
                    is known, indeed, to have made a new collection of the Iliad expressly for the
                    use of Alexander, and to have composed for him a treatise <hi rend="italic">On a
                    Kingdom,</hi> not extant among his works. And how deeply the youthful king had
                    imbibed the Homeric spirit in the discipline of his early years, was evidenced
                    in his after-life, by the heroism with which his actions were conceived, and the
                    poetry, if we may so express it, which mingled with the realities of his
                    eventful history. The circumstances alone, that the Iliad was constantly at the
                    pillow of Alexander during his expeditions, and was treasured by him with
                    extraordinary care in the precious casket of the spoils of Darius,<note

                    the tone of mind which his preceptor’s instructions had; if not formed, at least
                    strengthened and improved. Nor is it inconsistent with this ultimate effect,
                    that Aristotle should have communicated to his royal pupil the abstruse
                    doctrines of his philosophy. And that he did so, we have evidence in Alexander’s
                    complaint, in a letter to Aristotle, of the publication of the secret wisdom in
                    which he had himself been disciplined; and in the reply from Aristotle, “that
                    the books alluded to were as if they had not been published, since without his
                    oral instruction they would be unintelligible.”<note anchored="true"

                    on the part of Alexander appears also from a passage of Aristotle, where,
                    writing to Alexander <hi rend="italic">(Rhet. ad Alex.</hi> 1), he says, “you
                    have charged me in your letter that no other person should receive this
                    book.”</p></note> Plutarch, indeed, attributes to Aristotle’s instructions the
                    fondness for medical study and practice remarkable in Alexander.<note

                    >Alex.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>A life of such premature exertion as that of Alexander left comparatively little
                    time for the mere business of philosophical instruction. Succeeding to the
                    throne of his father at the age of 20, he was from that time immersed in affairs
                    of policy and war; and even previously, he had been forwardly engaged in the
                    services of the field, as also for a short interval in the conduct of the
                    government. Still the society of Aristotle appears to have been cherished by
                    him, so that the philosopher continued a resident at the court for two years
                    after the accession of Alexander; leaving Macedonia only on the occasion of
                    Alexander’s setting out on his Asiatic campaigns, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.

                    composed “the two hundred and fiftv Polities.” How much credit may be attached
                    to this author, appears from his making Aristotle a disciple of Socrates for
                    three years, whereas Socrates had been dead sixteen years before the birth of
                    Aristotle.</p></note> It is probable that Aristotle was indisposed to the hurry
                    and restlessness of military expeditions, and longed for a repose more congenial
                    to his taste in the philosophic bowers of the suburbs of Athens; and
                    circumstances had prepared the way for the separation. For though Alexander, it
                    seems, never entirely lost his respect for his preceptor, the cordiality of
                    their intercourse had in some measure abated. A commencement of alienation in
                    the feelings of Alexander had been evidenced.<note anchored="true"

                    offered of returning to Athens; and Callisthenes of Olynthus, his relative and
                    pupil, supplied his place among the party of philosophers by whom the king was
                    accompanied in the Asiatic expedition.</p>

                    was not broken off by their separation. The conquests of Alexander presented
                    singular opportunities for a collection of observations on natural history.
                    Under the superintendence, accordingly, of Aristotle, some thousands of persons,
                    it is said, were employed in making inquiries on the subject throughout Asia and
                    in Greece: and we have still valuable fruits of these inquiries, in a <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Animals,</hi> in ten books, extant among the works of
                    Aristotle; though this history must be but a small part of the fifty volumes to

                    type="authorial"><p>Plin. viii. 16.</p></note></p>
                <p>In the absence, however, of Aristotle, an event occurred which had the effect of
                    exciting most unjust surmises against him, and involving him in unmerited
                    disgrace with Alexander. A conspiracy was formed against the life of the king by
                    some noble youths who attended on his person. The conspirators were detected and
                    punished; but the chief blame of the whole affair rested on Callisthenes, to
                    whom the education of the young men had been especially committed, and under
                    whose sanction, accordingly, they were conceived to have acted in their
                    traitorous designs. The imputation was the more credible,' as Callisthenes had
                    distinguished himself for his opposition to the adulation of the courtiers, and

                    connection with Aristotle gave a plea for extending the charge to Aristotle
                    himself; who, it is represented, became so fearful of the result to himself,

                    sufficiently refuted by the real state of the case, which shows that Alexander
                    fell a sacrifice to his intense exertions in an unhealthy climate. It was
                    probably propagated by the rival sophists who surrounded the person of
                    Alexander; and to the same source may be ascribed the first estrangement of the
                    king, and his increased aversion to the philosopher in consequence of the affair
                    of Callisthenes. Alexander pointedly showed his increased dislike, by sending a
                    present of money to Xenocrates; thus placing that philosopher, as well as
                    Anaximenes, whom he also now more particularly noticed, in triumphant contrast
                    with Aristotle, as the objects of his patronage.<note anchored="true"

                <p>In the mean time Aristotle was pursuing his proper path of exertion at Athens as
                    a lecturer in philosophy, in his own school of the Lyceum. There is no good
                    reason for supposing that he was actuated in forming a separate school, as some
                    have asserted, by contemptuous opposition to Xenocrates, or jealousy of the
                    rhetorical fame of Isocrates.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    resorted to him for instruction. In the morning and evening of each day he was
                    thronged with hearers; the morning class consisting of his more intimate and
                    peculiar disciples, the evening class of hearers of a more general description.
                    The distinction of these two classes corresponds with the difference between his
                    “acroamatic” and his “exoteric” philosophy. The application of these terms to
                    the writings of Aristotle has been much controverted. The most simple account of
                    their difference appears to be, that the acroamatic or esoteric were more of
                    text-books, notices of various points of philosophy to be filled up by the
                    previous knowledge of the learner and the explanations of the philosopher, as
                    lectures addressed to his own proper class; the exoteric were more elaborate and
                    popular disquisitions, more expanded in the reasonings, more diffuse in the
                    matter.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Aulus Gellius,

                <p>The reputation of Aristotle at length rose to a dangerous popularity. The
                    intolerant spirit of paganism viewed with suspicion the spread of philosophical
                    doctrines, as tending to unsettle the existing government through their effect
                    on the vulgar superstition. This had been strikingly shown at Athens not long
                    before the birth of Aristotle in the fate of Socrates.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>B.C. 400.</p></note> In the case of Aristotle
                    there were enemies watching to apply the policy of the state to the cruel
                    purposes which their envy had suggested. For twelve years, it seems, no
                    opportunity of attack presented itself; since he continued his philosophical
                    labours at Athens for that time. Probably the name of Alexander had been itself
                    a shelter to him against their malice. But the alienation of the royal favour
                    gave an opening to their designs; and, on the death of Alexander, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 323, he became the marked object of persecution.
                    Through the agency of the hierophant Eurymedon, with whom was associated a
                    powerful citizen, by name Demophilus, a direct accusation of impiety was brought
                    against him before the court of Areopagus. He was charged with introducing
                    doctrines adverse to the religion of Greece.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    year. He was then advanced in life, and broken with bodily infirmities as well
                    as with dejection of spirit. On the approach of death, he declared his wish, it
                    is said, with regard to his successor at the Lyceum. Theophrastus of Lesbos and
                    Menedemus of Rhodes were the most conspicuous candidates for that honour; but
                    the dying philosopher, avoiding a pointed rejection of either, delicately
                    intimated his preference of Theophrastus by calling for cups of Lesbian and
                    Rhodian wine, and, when he had tasted them, simply observing, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The fondness of the Greeks for apophthegm has handed down some reputed sayings of
                    the philosopher, the genuineness of which, however, is extremely questionable,
                    from their want either of spirit or of originality. The following, if true,
                    would throw some light on his character. On being reproached for giving alms to
                    a worthless person, his answer is said to have been, “It was not the
                    disposition, but the man, that I pitied;” on hearing that he had been reviled by
                    some one, “When I am absent, he may even scourge me ;” to a talkative person,
                    asking him whether he had not exhausted him with trifling, “No, indeed, for I
                    have not been attending to you.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    characterized certain philosophers, such as calling Socrates a shortlived
                    tyranny.” The point of these passages, at any rate, escapes the modern

                <p>In body, Aristotle, if we may believe the accounts of his person, was deficient
                    in the requisite symmetry. He is described as having slender legs and little

                    held up to admiration. By others, again, no crime has been thought too bad to be
                    imputed to him. He has been stigmatized as a parasite, as gluttonous,

                    ungrateful, impious. Among his faults, too, have been mentioned a sneering cast
                    of countenance, and an impertinent loquacity. In particular, he has been accused
                    of assailing Plato with captious questions, and forcing the old man, then in his
                    80th year, to retire to the privacy of his garden.<note anchored="true"

                    have a more decisive evidence to the truth of the favourable representations of
                    his character in the temper and spirit of his extant writings. Throughout these,
                    there is a candour, and manliness, and love of truth, strikingly discernible;
                    not professedly set forth, but interwoven with the texture of his discussions,
                    and rather betrayed unconsciously than demanding to be recognized. His ethical
                    writings, especially, breathe a pure morality, such as we find in no antecedent
                    philosopher; a morality also avowedly practical, and by which he would have
                    stood self-condemned had his own conduct been at variance with it.</p>
