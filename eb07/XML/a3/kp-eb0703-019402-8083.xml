                <p><label type="entry">ANNA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Ana, oγ'Anah</hi></label>, a town
                    of Arabian Irac, or pachalic of Bagdad, which extends five or six miles along
                    the western bank of the Euphrates. It consists of a single street built on both
                    sides. The houses are of stone, two stories high, and separated from each other,
                    as in other eastern towns, by beautiful gardens, filled with fruit-trees,
                    bearing lemons, oranges, citrons, quinces, figs, dates, pomegranates, and
                    olives. It is an open and defenceless place; and in 1807 it was attacked by the
                    Wahabees,.who gave it up to plunder, and perpetrated the most horrible
                    cruelties, massacring the greater part of the inhabitants, and setting the town
                    on fire; after which they retreated with their plunder, carrying into captivity
                    many women and children. The inhabitants are said, previous to this calamity, to
                    have been more polished than those in the neighbourhood, and to have consisted
                    chiefly of Arabians, who were, however, addicted to their usual vocation of
                    robbery when any opportunity offered. Population about 3000. 260 miles east of
                    Damascus; 220 south-east of Aleppo. Long. 41. 15. E. Lat. 34. N.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Anna</hi><hi rend="italic">Comnena,</hi> daughter of the
                    emperor Alexius Comnenus I., was not less distinguished by her elevated rank
                    than by her mental qualifications. Her superiority of mind began early to
                    display itself. Despising the effeminacy and voluptuousness of the court in
                    which she was educated, she directed her attention to literary pursuits.
                    Indulging her favourite studies, she solicited the acquaintance of the more
                    eminent philosophers of that period.</p>
                <p>But the pursuits of literature did not induce her entirely to abandon society;
                    she gave her hand to Nicephorus Briennius, a young nobleman of a respectable
                    family. This accomplished woman was, however, actuated with unjustifiable
                    ambition; and, during the last illness of her father, she united with the
                    empress Irene in attempting to prevail upon that monarch to disinherit his own
                    son, and give the crown to her husband. The affection and virtue of the father
                    prevailed over female address and intrigue. But the ambition of Comnena was not
                    diminished; for she entered into a conspiracy to depose her brother; and when
                    her husband displayed a timidity and hesitation in this unjust enterprise, she
                    exclaimed that “nature had mistaken their sexes, for he ought to have been the
                    woman.”</p>
                <p>Either through the vigilance of her brother, or the timidity of her husband, the
                    treasonable plot was discovered, and Anna punished with the confiscation of all
                    her property. But generosity has an opportunity of displaying its real nature
                    when an enemy is vanquished; thus was the -generosity of her brother displayed
                    on the present occasion, by returning all her property. Ashamed, however, of her
                    base conduct, she retired from court, and never more possessed any influence
                    there. Disappointed ambition took shelter among the walks of literature, and she
                    employed herself in her solitude in writing the history of her father’s reign.
                    This production of her pen is still extant, and composes a part of the
                    celebrated collection of the <hi rend="italic">Byzantine Historians.</hi> The
                    stores of rhetoric are ransacked to embellish this work, and every effort made
                    to enrich it with science; but the general complexion of it is rather like an
                    apology than an impartial narrative. It must, however, be acknowledged that she
                    is not more partial than many other Latin historians, and that her history
                    contains many valuable facts and observations.</p>
