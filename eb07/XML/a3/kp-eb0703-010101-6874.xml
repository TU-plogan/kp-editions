                <p><label type="entry">ANAXAGORAS</label>, an eminent philosopher of antiquity, was
                    born in the first year of the 70th Olympiad, or 500 years before Christ. Leaving
                    his lands to be cultivated and enjoyed by his friends, Anaxagoras placed himself
                    under the care of Anaximenes the Milesian. About the age of twenty he went to
                    Athens and entered upon the study of philosophy, where he continued thirty
                    years. Some suppose that he was the first disciple of the Ionian school, founded
                    by Thales, a teacher of philosophy in Athens. When Anaxagoras assumed the
                    character of a public teacher of philosophy, he quickly rose to high eminence,
                    and produced many famous scholars, among whom were Euripides, Pericles, and
                    Socrates. This philosopher contented, himself with serving the republic in his
                    own station, without interfering in any of the public affairs of the state. Both
                    by the principles of wisdom which he inspired into the minds of the Athenian
                    youth, and also by his daily advice in the most important affairs, particularly
                    in the case of Pericles, he was of singular service to his country. But neither
                    the friendship of Pericles, nor his own general disinterestedness of character,
                    nor his immense stores of learning, could ward off the shafts of persecution.
                    Cleo accused him of impiety, and the introduction of new opinions concerning the
                    gods, because he taught that the sun was a burning mass of stone, or an
                    inanimate fiery substance. By this opinion he was said to rob the sun of his
                    divinity, because in the popular opinion he was deemed Apollo, one of the
                    greatest deities. But although Cleo made religion the avowed cause of the
                    accusation of Anaxagoras, it is highly probable that civil causes chiefly
                    operated towards his condemnation. It is, however, abundantly evident that he
                    did not hesitate to expose the vulgar superstitions on several occasions; but
                    the evidence is not sufficient which pretends to prove <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096887" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6887-0102"/>that he was condemned for
                    teaching the doctrine of a supreme intelligence, the creator of this world. His
                    judges condemned him to death; but Pericles appearing in his defence, the
                    sentence was changed from that of death to banishment and a pecuniary fine.</p>
                <p>Expelled from Athens, Anaxagoras passed the remainder of his days at Lampsacus,
                    teaching philosophy in the school of his deceased master Anaximenes, until the
                    infirmities of nature terminated his life in the year 428 before Christ.
                    Diogenes Laertius has collected, with little care and judgment, the details
                    concerning this philosopher, which were scattered through various writings. It
                    appears, that in the midst of some extravagant conceptions, Anaxagoras held
                    opinions which indicate a considerable acquaintance with the laws of nature. His
                    idea of the heavens seems to have been, that they were a solid vault, originally
                    composed of stones, elevated from the earth by the violent motion of the ambient
                    ether, inflamed by its heat, and by the circular motion of the heavens fixed in
                    their respective places. The testimonies of several writers, among which is that
                    of Xenophon, unite in proving that he considered the sun to be a large fiery
                    stone; and Xenophon introduces Socrates as refuting that doctrine, and
                    delivering an unfavourable opinion concerning his other writings. From his
                    perceiving that the rainbow is the effect of the reflection of the solar rays
                    from a dark cloud, and that wind is produced by the rarefaction, and sound by
                    the percussion, of the air, he seems to have paid considerable attention to the
                    phenomena of nature.</p>
                <p>Our information is more correct concerning his opinions of the principles of
                    nature and the origin of things. He imagined that in nature there are as many
                    kinds of principles as there are species of compound bodies; and that the
                    peculiar form of the primary particles of which any body is composed is the same
                    with the quality of the compound body itself. For instance, he supposed that a
                    piece of gold is composed of small particles which are themselves gold, and a
                    bone of a great number of small bones: thus, according to Anaxagoras, bodies of
                    every kind are generated from similar particles. That part of his system is more
                    agreeable to reason which explains the active principle in nature. According to
                    Diogenes Laertius, Anaxagoras taught that “the, universe consists of small
                    bodies composed of similar parts, and that mind is the beginning of motion.” “He
                    was the first,” says the same writer, “who superadded mind to matter, opening
                    his work in this pleasing and sublime language: <hi rend="superscript"> ζ</hi>
                    All things were confused; then came mind and disposed them in order.’” Plato
                    informs us that this philosopher taught the existence of a disposing mind, the
                    cause of all things. Anaxagoras, according to Aristotle, taught that mind was
                    “the cause of the world, and of all order; and that while all things else are
                    compounded, this alone is pure and unmixed ;” and that “he ascribes to this
                    principle two powers—to know and „to move—saying that mind put the universe in
                    motion.” Cicero expressly asserts that Anaxagoras was the first who taught that
                    “the arrangement and order of all things was contrived and accomplished by the
                    understanding and power of an infinite mind.”</p>
