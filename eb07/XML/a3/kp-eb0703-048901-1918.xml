                <p><label type="entry">ARISTIPPUS</label>, the founder of the Cyrenaic sect of
                    philosophy, was the son of Aretades, and born at Cyrene in Libya. He flourished
                    about the 96th Olympiad. The great reputation of Socrates induced him to leave
                    his own country and remove to Athens, that he might have the satisfaction of
                    hearing his discourses. He was chiefly delighted with those discourses of
                    Socrates that related the most to pleasure, which he asserted to be the ultimate
                    end in which all happiness consists. His manner of life was agreeable to his
                    opinion, for he indulged himself extremely in all sorts of luxuries. Though he
                    had a good estate, yet he was the only one of the disciples of Socrates who took
                    money for teaching. Upon his leaving Socrates he went to Aegina, as Athenaeus
                    informs us, where he lived with more freedom and luxury than before. Socrates
                    sent frequent exhortations to him in order to reclaim him, but all in vain; and
                    with the same view he wrote that discourse which we find in Xenophon. Here
                    Aristippus became acquainted with Laïs, the famous courtesan of Corinth, for
                    whose sake he took a voyage to that city. He continued at Aegina till the death
                    of Socrates, as appears from Plato’s <hi rend="italic">Phaedo,</hi> and the
                    epistle which he wrote upon that occasion. He returned at last into his own
                    country, Cyrene, where he professed philosophy, and instituted a sect which, as
                    we observed above, was called the <hi rend="italic">Cyrenaic,</hi> from the
                    place, and by some writers the <hi rend="italic">Hedonic</hi> or voluptuous,
                    from its doctrines.</p>
                <p>We have many apophthegms of his preserved. To one who asked him, what his son
                    would be the better for being a scholar, “If for nothing else,” said he, “yet
                    for this alone, that when he comes into the theatre one stone will not sit upon
                    another.” When a certain person recommended his son to him, he demanded 500
                    drachmas; and upon the father’s replying that he could buy a slave for that sum,
                    “Do so,” said he, “and then you will be master of a couple.” Being reproached
                    because, having a suit of law depending, he fee’d a lawyer to plead for him,
                    “Just so,” said he, “when I have a great supper to make I always hire a cook.”
                    Being asked what was the difference between a wise man and a fool, he replied,
                    “Send both of them together naked to those who are acquainted with neither of
                    them, and then you will know.” Being reproached for going from Socrates to
                    Dionysius, he replied, “That he went to Socrates when he wanted serious
                    instruction, and to Dionysius for diversion.” Having received money of
                    Dionysius, at the same time that Plato accepted a book only, and being
                    reproached for it, “The reason is plain,” says he, “I want money and Plato wants
                    books.” Being cast by shipwreck ashore on the island of Rhodes, and perceiving
                    mathematical schemes and diagrams drawn upon the ground, he said, “Courage,
                    friends; for I see the footsteps of men.”</p>
                <p>Having visited Dionysius the Sicilian tyrant, and lived a long time at his court,
                    his daughter Arete sent to him to desire his presence at Cyrene in order to take
                    care of her affairs, since she was in danger of being oppressed by the
                    magistrates; but he fell sick in his return home, and died at Lipara. With
                    regard to his principal opinions, like Socrates, he rejected the sciences as
                    they were then taught, and pretended that logic alone was sufficient to teach
                    truth and fix its bounds. He asserted that pleasure and pain were the criterions
                    by which we were to be determined; that these alone made up all our passions;
                    that the first produced all the soft emotions, and the latter all the violent
                    ones. The assemblage of all pleasures, he asserted, made true happiness, and
                    that the best way to attain this was to enjoy the present moments. He wrote a
                    great many books, but none of them has been preserved. It has been shown by Μ.
                    Luzac, in his <hi rend="italic">Lectiones</hi><hi rend="italic">Atticae,</hi>
                    that he was not the author of the treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Luxury of
                    the Ancients,</hi> frequently ascribed to him; nor of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epistles</hi> given as his in the Socratic collection of Leo Allatius.</p>
