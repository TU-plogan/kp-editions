                <p><label type="entry">ARKWRIGHT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Richard</hi></label>,
                    famous for his inventions in cotton spinning, was born at Preston in Lancashire,
                    in 1732, of parents in humble circumstances. He was the youngest of thirteen
                    children, received but a very indifferent education, and was bred to the trade
                    of a barber. But the <hi rend="italic">res angu,sta domi</hi> could not repress
                    the native vigour of his mind, or extinguish the desire he felt to emerge from
                    his low situation. In the year 1760 he had established himself in
                    Bθlton-le-Moor, where he exchanged the trade of a barber for that of an
                    itinerant hair-merchant; and having discovered a valuable chemical process for
                    dying hair, he was in consequence enabled to amass a little property. It is
                    unfortunate that very little is known of the steps by which he was led to those
                    inventions that raised him to distinction, and have immortalized his name. His
                    residence in a district where a considerable manufacture of linen goods, and of
                    linen and cotton mixed, was carried on, must have given him ample opportunities
                    of becoming acquainted with the various processes that were in use in the cotton
                    manufacture, and of the attempts that had been made and were then making to
                    improve them. His attention was thus naturally drawn to this peculiar
                    department; and, while he saw reason to conclude that it was likely to prove the
                    most advantageous in which he could engage, he had sagacity and good fortune to
                    invent and improve those extraordinary machines by which, unlike most inventors,
                    he amassed vast wealth, at the same time that he added prodigiously to the
                    demand for labour, and to the riches and comfort of the civilized world.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">spinning-fenny,</hi> invented in 1767 by Hargraves, a
                    carpenter at Blackburn in Lancashire, gave the means of spinning twenty or
                    thirty threads at once with no more labour than had previously been required to
                    spin a single thread. The thread spun by the jenny could not, however, be used,
                    except as weft, being destitute of the firmness or hardness required in the
                    longitudinal threads or warp. But Mr Arkwright supplied this deficiency by the
                    invention of the <hi rend="italic">spinning-frame</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    that wonderful piece of machinery, which spins a vast number of threads of any
                    degree of fineness and hardness, leaving to man merely to feed the machine with
                    cotton, and to join the threads when they happen to break. It is not difficult
                    to understand the principle on which this machine is constructed, and the mode
                    of its operation. It consists of two pairs of rollers, turned by means of
                    machinery. The lower roller of each pair is furrowed or fluted longitudinally,
                    and the upper one is covered with leather, to make them take a hold of the
                    cotton. If there were only one pair of rollers, it is clear that a carding of
                    cotton, passed between them, would be drawn forward by the revolution of the
                    rollers; but it would merely undergo a certain degree of compression from their
                    action. No sooner, however, has the carding, or <hi rend="italic">roving</hi> as
                    it is technically termed, begun to pass through the first pair of rollers, than
                    it is received by the second pair, which are made to revolve with (as the case
                    may be) three, four, or five times the velocity of the first pair. By this
                    admirable contrivance, the roving is drawn out into a thread of the desired
                    degree of tenuity, a twist being given to it by the adaptation of the spindle
                    and fly of the common flax wheel to the machinery.</p>
                <p>Such is the principle on which Mr Arkwright constructed his famous
                    spinning-frame. It is obvious that it is radically different from the previous
                    methods of spinning either by the common hand-wheel or distaff, or by the jenny,
                    which is only a modification of the common wheel. Spinning by rollers was an
                    entirely original idea; and it is difficult to determine which is most worthy of
                    admiration—the genius which led to so great a discovery, or the consummate skill
                    and address by which it was so speedily perfected and reduced to practice. Mr
                    Arkwright stated that he accidentally derived the first hint of his great
                    invention from seeing a red-hot iron bar elongated by being made to pass between
                    rollers<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the account
                    of Mr Arkwright, in the article Derbyshire, in the <hi rend="italic">Beauties of
                    England and Wales,</hi> vol. iii. p∙ 518. The statements in this account are of
                    the highest authority, inasmuch as we have reason to believe it was furnished by
                    Mr Strutt, the son of Mr Arkwright’s first partner.</p></note> and though <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193102958" xml:id="kp-eb0703-2958-0569"/> there is no
                    mechanical analogy between that operation and his process of spinning, it is not
                    difficult to imagine, that by reflecting upon it, and placing the subject in
                    different points of view, it might lead him to his invention. The precise era of
                    the discovery is not known; but it is most probable that the felicitous idea of
                    spinning by rollers had occurred to his mind as early as the period when
                    Hargraves was engaged in the invention of the jenny, or almost immediately
                    after. Not being himself a practical mechanic, Arkwright employed a person of
                    the name of John Kay, a watchmaker at Warrington, to whom we shall afterwards
                    have to refer, to assist him in the prépara* tionofthe parts of his machine.
                    Having made some progress towards the completion of his inventions, he applied
                    in 1767 to Mr Atherton of Liverpool for pecuniary assistance to enable him to
                    carry them into effect; but this gentleman declined embarking his property in
                    what appeared so hazardous a speculation, though he is said to have sent him
                    some workmen to assist in the construction of his machine; the first model of
                    which was set up in the parlour of the house belonging to the free grammar
                    school at Preston.</p>
                <p>His inventions being at length brought into a ’pretty advanced state, Arkwright,
                    accompanied by Kay, and a Mr Smalley of Preston, removed to Nottingham in 1768,
                    in order to avoid the attacks of the same lawless rabble that had driven
                    Hargraves out of Lancashire. Here his operations were at first greatly fettered
                    by a want of capital. But Mr Strutt<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This was the justly celebrated Mr Jedediah Strutt. He was
                    the son of a farmer, and was born in 1726. His father paid little attention to
                    his education; but, under every disadvantage, he acquired an extensive knowledge
                    of science and literature. He was the first individual who succeeded in adapting
                    the stocking-frame to the manufacture of <hi rend="italic">ribbed</hi>
                    stockings. The manufacture of these stockings, which he established at Derby,
                    was conducted on a very large scale, first by himself and his partner Mr Need,
                    and subsequently by his sons, until about 1805, when they withdrew from this
                    branch of business.</p></note> of Derby, a gentleman of great mechanical skill,
                    and largely engaged in the stocking manufacture, having seen Arkwright’s
                    inventions, and satisfied himself of their extraordinary value, immediately
                    entered, conjointly with his partner Mr Need, into partnership with him. The
                    command of the necessary funds being thus obtained, Mr Arkwright erected his
                    first mill, which was driven by horses, at Nottingham, and took out a patent for
                    spinning by rollers, in 1769. But as the mode of working the machinery by
                    horse-power was found too expensive, he built a second factory, on a much larger
                    scale, at Cromford in Derbyshire, in 1771, the machinery of which was turned by
                    a water-wheel, after the manner of the famous silk-mill erected by Sir Thomas
                    Lombe. Having made several additional discoveries and improvements in the
                    processes of carding, roving, and spinning, he took out a fresh patent for the
                    whole in 1775; and thus completed a series of machinery so various and
                    complicated, yet so admirably combined, and well adapted to produce the intended
                    effect, in its most perfect form, as to excite the astonishment and admiration
                    of every one capable of appreciating the ingenuity displayed and the
                    difficulties overcome.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>When the vast importance of these discoveries became known, it is not surprising
                    that every effort should have been made to have the patents set aside, and Mr
                    Arkwright deprived of the profit and honour to be derived from them. But after a
                    pretty attentive consideration of the various proceedings relative to this
                    subject, we have no hesitation in saying, that we see no good grounds for
                    crediting the statement made in the court of king’s bench in 1785, and recently
                    repeated by Mr Guest in his work on the cotton manufacture, which ascribes the
                    invention of spinning by rollers to Highs or Hayes, from whom Arkwright is said
                    to have learned it; and we shall now briefly state our reasons for holding this
                    opinion.</p>
                <p>Mr Arkwright’s <hi rend="italic">first</hi> patent for spinning by rollers, which
                    is by far the most important, or rather, indeed, the essential part of his
                    inventions, was obtained, as we have previously stated, in 1769; and its value
                    and importance were no longer doubtful after the establishment of the factory at
                    Cromford in 1771. The success which attended this novel method of spinning
                    naturally excited the strongest desire on the part of the Lancashire
                    manufacturers to participate in the advantages to be derived from it; and the
                    fair presumption is, that instead of attempting clandestinely to pirate the
                    invention, they would, had they conceived there were any good grounds to go
                    upon, have at once contested the validity of the patent. But no such attempt was
                    made till 1781, <hi rend="italic">twelve</hi> years after the date of the first
                    patent, and <hi rend="italic">six</hi> years after the date of the second. And,
                    even at that late period, Mr Arkwright’s opponents came forward only in
                    consequence of his having resolved to vindicate his rights, which had begun to
                    be invaded on all sides, by raising an action against Colonel Mordaunt for an
                    infringement of his patent. Mordaunt was supported by a combination of
                    manufacturers; and, as they felt the question to be of the greatest importance,
                    it is all but impossible to suppose that any thing would be omitted on their
                    part which was conceived likely to contribute to their success. The case having
                    been tried in the court of king’s bench, after Trinity term, ,July 1781, the
                    decision was unfavourable to Mr Arkwright. But it is of importance to observe,
                    that no attempt was made at the trial to charge him with having purloined the
                    inventions of others, and that the verdict was given on the sole ground of the
                    <hi rend="italic">description of the machinery in the specification being
                    obscure and indistinct.</hi> Mr Arkwright admitted that such was partly the
                    case; adding, however, that the obscurity charged against the specification had
                    been intended only to prevent foreigners from pirating his inventions. On any
                    other principle, indeed, his conduct would be inexplicable; for, as his
                    inventions were fully known to hundreds of workmen in his own employment, and as
                    he had sold the privilege of using them to great numbers of individuals in
                    different parts of the country, it is impossible to suppose that he could either
                    have expected or intended to conceal his inventions after the expiration of his
                    patent.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It was
                    erroneously stated, in an article in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>
                    (No. 91), from which this sketch is principally abstracted, on the authority of
                    the article “Cotton Manufacture,” in the Supplement to this work. (vol. iii. p.
                    394), that a trial had been instituted ⅛ 1772, in which Mr Arkwright proved
                    successful, to have the original patent set aside. But the first trial did not
                    really take place, as above stated, till 1781.</p></note> In consequence of the
                    result of this trial, Mr Arkwright and his partners prepared a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Case,</hi> setting forth the value of the inventions, and the circumstances
                    which had led to the indistinctness complained of in the specification, which
                    they' at one time intended to lay before parliament, as the foundation of an
                    application for an act for their relief. But this intention was subsequently
                    abandoned; and in a new trial (Arkwright <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Nightingale),
                    which took place in the court of common pleas on the 17th of February 1785, Lord
                    Loughborough, the presiding judge, having expressed himself favourably with
                    respect to the sufficiency <pb break="no" facs="nls:193102971"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-2971-0570"/>of the specification, a verdict was given for Mr
                    Arkwright. On this, as on the former trial, nothing was stated against the
                    originality of the invention.</p>
                <p>In consequence of these conflicting verdicts, the whole matter was brought, by a
                    writ of <hi rend="italic">scire facias,</hi> before the court of king’s bench,
                    to have the validity of the patent finally settled. And it was not till this
                    third trial, which took place before Mr Justice Buller and a special jury, on
                    the 25th of June 1785, that Mr Arkwright’s claim to the inventions which formed
                    the subject of the patent was disputed. To support this new allegation, Mr
                    Arkwright’s opponents brought forward, for the first time, Highs or Hayes, a
                    reed-maker at Bolton. He stated that he had invented a machine for spinning by
                    rollers previously to 1768; that he had employed the watchmaker Kay, to whom we
                    have already referred, to make a model of that machine; and Kay was produced to
                    prove that he had communicated that model to Mr Arkwright, and that that was the
                    real source of all his pretended inventions. Having no idea that any attempt was
                    to be made at so late a period to overturn the patent on this new ground, Mr
                    Arkwright’s counsel were not prepared with evidence to repel this statement; but
                    it was stated by Mr Sergeant Adair, on a motion for a new trial on the 10th of
                    November of the same year, that he was furnished with affidavits contradicting,
                    in the most pointed manner, the evidence that had been given by Kay and others
                    with respect to the originality of the invention. The court, however, refused to
                    grant a new trial, on the ground, that whatever might be the fact as to the
                    question of originality, the deficiency in the specification was enough to
                    sustain the verdict.</p>
                <p>But, independently altogether of the statements made on the motion for a new
                    trial, the improbability of the story told by Highs and Kay seems glaring and
                    obvious. Highs states in his evidence that he had accused Arkwright of getting
                    possession of his invention by means of Kay so early as 1769, or about that
                    period. Where, then, it may be asked, was this Mr Highs ever since that period,
                    and particularly during the first trial in July 1781, and the second in February
                    1785? Living in Lancashire, associating with manufacturers, and in the habit, as
                    he declares in his evidence, of making machines for them, he could not fail to
                    be speedily informed with respect to the vast importance and value of the
                    invention Mr Arkwright had purloined from him. It is impossible but he must have
                    been acquainted with the efforts that were making by the Lancashire
                    manufacturers to set aside the patents; and is it to be supposed, had he really
                    been the inventor, that he would have remained for <hi rend="italic"
                    >sixteen</hi> years a passive spectator of what was going forward? that he would
                    have allowed Mr Arkwright to accumulate a princely fortune by means of <hi
                    rend="italic">his</hi> inventions, while he remained in a state of poverty? or
                    that he would have withheld his evidence when the manufacturers attempted to
                    wrest from Mr Arkwright what he had so unjustly appropriated? A single hint from
                    Highs or Kay would, had their story been well founded, have sufficed to force Mr
                    Arkwright to give them a share of his profits, or would have furnished the
                    manufacturers with the means they were so anxious to obtain, of procuring the
                    immediate dissolution of the patents. But it has never been alleged that Mr
                    Arkwright took any pains to conciliate these persons: on the contrary, he
                    treated Highs with the most perfect indifference, and not only dismissed Kay
                    from his service, but even threatened to prosecute him on a charge of felony.
                    And can any one imagine for a moment, that persons with so many and such
                    overpowering temptations to speak out, and with no inducement of any sort to be
                    silent, should have gone about for more than twice the period of a Pythagorean
                    noviciate, with so important <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> secret closely pent up
                    in their bosoms? We confess that such a supposition seems to us altogether
                    absurd and incredible; and we believe our readers will agree with us in
                    thinking, that it is infinitely more consistent wi⅛ probability to suppose that
                    the story of Highs and Kay had been manufactured for the occasion, than that it
                    was really true.</p>
                <p>The improbability of the statements made on this subject by Guest, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Cotton Manufacture,</hi> appear still more obvious,
                    from his attributing to Highs the invention, not only of the spinning frame, but
                    also of the jenny, which had been universally ascribed to Hargraves. But no
                    weight can be attached to such rash and ill-considered statements. It would be
                    next to a miracle, had two methods of spinning, both very ingenious, but
                    radically different in their first principles, been invented nearly at the same
                    time by the same individual.</p>
                <p>It appears, from a communication from Mr Charles Wyatt to his brother, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Repertory of Arts</hi> for 1817, and which has been reprinted by
                    Mr Kennedy, in an interesting article on the Rise and Progress of the Cotton
                    Trade, in the <hi rend="italic">Manchester</hi><hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>
                    (2d series, vol. iii. p. 135), as well as from the distinct reference to them in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Case</hi> printed by Mr Arkwright in 1782, that attempts
                    had been made in the early part of last century to spin cotton by means of
                    machinery. But these attempts proved ruinous to the parties by whom they were
                    made; and all knowledge of the machinery by which they attempted to effect their
                    purpose has been long since lost. Mr Kennedy says he had seen a specimen of yarn
                    spun about 1741, by the late Mr Wyatt of Birmingham; but he expresses his
                    Opinion that no competent judge would say that it was spun by a similar machine
                    to that of Mr Arkwright. It was not indeed alleged at any of the trials that
                    took place with respect to the validity of his patent, nor has it ever been
                    alleged since, that he had borrowed anything whatever from these remote
                    attempts. If he was really indebted to them, it must have been merely for the
                    knowledge of the fact that such attempts had been made; and this might have
                    stimulated him to turn his attention to the subject.</p>
                <p>We have access to know that none of Mr Arkwright’s most intimate friends, and who
                    were best acquainted with his character, ever had the slightest doubt with
                    respect to the originality of his invention. Some of them, indeed, could speak
                    to the circumstances from their own personal knowledge; and their testimony was
                    uniform and consistent. Such also seems to be the opinion now generally
                    entertained among the principal manufacturers of Manchester. In proof of this,
                    we may again refer to Mr Kennedy’s valuable paper in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Manchester Memoirs.</hi> Mr Kennedy is one of the most eminent and intelligent
                    cotton manufacturers in the empire, and it is of importance to remark, that,
                    although he was resident in Manchester in 1785, when the last trial for setting
                    aside Mr Arkwright’s patent took place, and must, therefore, have been well
                    acquainted with all the circumstances connected with it, he does not insinuate
                    the smallest doubt as to his being the real inventor of the spinning frame, nor
                    even so much as once alludes to Highs.</p>
                <p>On their first introduction, Mr Arkwright’s machines were reckoned by the lower
                    classes as even more adverse to their interests than those of Hargraves; and
                    reiterated attacks were made on the factories built for them.<note

                    amongst the manufacturers that the greatest animosity existed against Mr
                    Arktvright; and it required all the prudence for which he was so remarkable to
                    enable him to triumph over the powerful combination that was formed against him.
                    At the outset of the business, they unanimously refused to purchase his yarn;
                    and when his partners, Messrs Strutt and Need, had commenced a manufacture of
                    calicoes, the manufacturers strenuously opposed a bill to exempt calicoes from a
                    discriminating duty of 3d a yard laid on them, over and above the ordinary duty
                    of 3d by an old act of parliament. Luckily, however, the manufacturers failed of
                    their object; and, in 1774, an act of parliament was obtained (14th Geo. III.
                    cap. 72), for the encouragement of the cotton manufacture, in which fabrics made
                    of cotton are declared to have been <hi rend="italic">lately</hi> introduced,
                    and are allowed to be used as “a lawful and laudable manufacture the duty of 6d
                    the square yard on such cottons as are printed or stained being at the same time
                    reduced to 3d. But this disgraceful spirit of animosity, which must, had it been
                    successful, have proved as injurious to the interests of the manufacturers as to
                    those of Mr Arkwright, did not content itself with actions in the courts of law,
                    or a factious opposition to useful measures in parliament, but displayed itself
                    in a still more striking and unjustifiable manner; for it is a fact, that a
                    large factory, erected by Mr Arkwright at Birkacre, near Chorley, in Lancashire,
                    was destroyed by a mob collected from the adjacent country, in the presence of a
                    powerful body of police and military, without any one of the civil authorities
                    requiring them to interfere to prevent so scandalous an outrage.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, however, not for himself only, but for bis country and the world,
                    every corner of which has been benefited by his inventions, Mr Arkwright
                    triumphed over every opposition. The same ingenuity, skill, and good sense,
                    which had originally enabled him to invent his machine and get it introduced,
                    enabled him to overcome the various combinations and difficulties with which he
                    had subsequently to contend.</p>
                <p>Though a man of great personal strength, which he is said to have displayed when
                    young, in election riots at Preston, Mr Arkwright never enjoyed good health.
                    During the whole of his splendid and ever memorable career of invention and
                    discovery, he was labouring under a very severe asthmatic affection. A
                    complication of disorders at length terminated his truly useful life in 1792, at
                    his works at Cromford, in the sixtieth year of his age. He was high sheriff of
                    Derbyshire in 1786; and, having presented a congratulatory address from the
                    wapentake of Wirksworth to his majesty George III., on his escape from the
                    attempt on his life by Margaret Nicholson, received the honour of knighthood. No
                    man ever better deserved his good fortune, or has a stronger claim on the
                    respect and gratitude of posterity. His inventions have opened a new and
                    boundless field of employment; and while they have conferred infinitely more
                    real benefit on his native country than she could have derived from the absolute
                    dominion of Mexicoand Peru, they have been <hi rend="italic">universally</hi>
                    productive of wealth and enjoyments.</p>
                <p>“The originality and comprehensiveness of Sir Richard Arkwright’s mind,” says Mr
                    Bannatyne, “was perhaps marked by nothing more strongly than the judgment with
                    which, although' new to business, he conducted the great concerns his discovery
                    gave rise to, and the systematic order and arrangement which he introduced into
                    every department of his extensive works. His plans of management, which must
                    have been entirely his own, as no establishment of a similar nature then
                    existed, were universally adopted by others; and, after long experience, they
                    have not yet, in any material point, been altered or improved.”</p>
                <p>Mr Arkwright was twice married. By his first marriage he had a son, the present
                    Richard Arkwright, Esq. of Willersley Castle, near Cromford; by his second
                    marriage he had a daughter, now Mrs Charles Hurt of Wirksworth, Derbyshire. Both
                    have numerous descendants, (c. c.) ∙</p>
