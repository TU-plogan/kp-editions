                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">ARIANS</label>, followers of Arius, a presbyter of the church
                    of Alexandria about the year 315, who maintained that the Son of God was totally
                    and essentially distinct from the Father; that he was the first and noblest of
                    those beings whom God had created, the instrument by whose <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193101879" xml:id="kp-eb0703-1879-0486"/>subordinate operation he
                    formed the universe, and therefore inferior to the Father both in nature and
                    dignity; also, that the Holy Ghost was not God, but created by the power of the
                    Son. The Arians owned that the Son was the <hi rend="italic">Word,</hi> but
                    denied that the <hi rend="italic">Word</hi> was eternal. They held that Christ
                    had nothing of man in him but the flesh, to which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aογος</hi> or Word was joined, which was the same as the soul in us. The
                    appellation of <hi rend="italic">Arian</hi> has been indiscriminately applied in
                    more modern times to all those who consider Jesus Christ as inferior and
                    subordinate to the Father, and whose sentiments cannot be supposed to coincide
                    exactly with those of the ancient Arians. Mr Whiston was one of the first
                    divines who revived this controversy in the beginning of the 18th century. He
                    was followed by Dr Clarke, who published his famous book entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity,</hi> in consequence of
                    which he was reproached with the title of <hi rend="italic">Semi-Arian.</hi> Dr
                    Waterland, who has been charged with verging towards Tritheism, was one of his
                    principal adversaries. The history of this controversy may be found in a work
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">An Account of all the considerable Dooks and
                    Pamphlets that have been wrote on either side, in the Controversy concerning the
                    Trinity, from the Year</hi> 1712,· <hi rend="italic">in which also is contained
                    an Account of the Pamphlets written this last year on each side by the
                    Dissenters, to the end of the year</hi> 1719; published in London in 1720.</p>
