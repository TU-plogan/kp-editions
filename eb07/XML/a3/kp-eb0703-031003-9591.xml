                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">APPRENTICESHIP</label>, the servitude of an apprentice, or
                    the duration of his indenture.</p>
                <p>Seven years seem anciently to have been, all over Europe, the usual term
                    established for the duration of apprenticeships in the greater part of
                    incorporated trades. All such incorporations were anciently called <hi
                    rend="italic">universities</hi> which indeed is the proper Latin name for any
                    incorporation whatever. The university of smiths, the university of tailors,
                    &amp;c. are expressions which we commonly meet with in the old charters of
                    ancient towns. When those particular incorporations which are now peculiarly
                    called <hi rend="italic">universities</hi> were first established, the term of
                    years which it was necessary to study in order to obtain the degree of master of
                    arts, appears evidently to have been copied from the term of apprenticeship in
                    common trades, of which the incorporations were much more ancient. As to have
                    wrought seven years under a master properly qualified was necessary in order to
                    entitle any person to become a master, and to have himself apprentices in a
                    common trade; so to have studied seven years under a master properly qualified
                    was necessary to entitle him to become a master, teacher, or doctor (words
                    anciently synonymous) in the liberal arts, and to have scholars or apprentices
                    (words likewise originally synonymous) to study under him.</p>
                <p>Apprenticeships were altogether unknown to the ancients. The reciprocal duties of
                    master and apprentice make a considerable article in every modern code. The
                    Roman law is perfectly silent with regard to them. There is no Greek or Latin
                    word which expresses the idea we now annex to the word apprentice—a servant
                    bound to work at a particular trade for the benefit of a master during a term of
                    years, upon condition that the master shall teach him that trade.</p>
                <p>Dr Smith considers the institution of apprenticeships as a device, by which
                    trading corporations endeavour to confine to as few hands as possible the
                    mystery of their craft, and by which, keeping the market always understocked
                    with their particular sort of labour, they expect to regulate according to their
                    discretion the price of such manufactures as they bring to market. He
                    accordingly condemns all those laws which limit the number of apprentices to be
                    taken by each master in particular trades, or which prescribe to apprentices a
                    certain term of service before they are permitted to work as journeymen. The
                    tendency of such laws, he observes, is to restrain the competition to a much
                    smaller number than might otherwise be disposed to enter into the trade; the
                    limitations of the number of apprentices restraining it <hi rend="italic"
                    >directly,</hi> and a long apprenticeship restraining it <hi rend="italic"
                    >indirectly,</hi> but as effectually, by increasing the expense of education.
                    Long apprenticeships, or indeed any apprenticeship, for however short a term, Dr
                    Smith considers quite unnecessary, as the nicest mechanical arts, such as the
                    making of clocks and watches, contain, according to his theory, no such mystery
                    as to require a long course of instruction. A few weeks, he calculates, or even
                    a few days, would be sufficient to enable a mechanic to set to work in any of
                    those trades; and if he were paid the full price for his work, he paying of
                    course for such materials as he might spoil through awkwardness and
                    inexperience, he imagines that he would learn his business more effectually, and
                    be more apt to acquire habits of attention and industry, than when he works
                    under a master who has a right to share in the produce of his labour.</p>
                <p>It may be generally remarked, however, that, in his reasonings on these subjects,
                    Dr Smith seems uniformly <pb break="no" facs="nls:193099604"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-9604-0311"/>disposed to overrate the practical effect of those
                    expedients by which corporations have been always endeavouring to secure special
                    advantages for particular trades; and that his theory respecting apprenticeships
                    is only a part of that more general theory, by which he endeavours to show that
                    the policy of Europe has always been to encourage the industry of the towns at
                    the expense of that of the country and that the effect of this policy has been
                    to enable the merchants and manufacturers of the town, in bartering their
                    produce for that of the country, to levy, for several centuries, an unjust and
                    oppressive tax on the agricultural classes of the community. We know, however,
                    that, according to the nature of human society, as it is so admirably explained
                    in Dr Smith’s work, monopoly can never succeed on so great a scale; and, on the
                    same principle, we may rationally question, if the contract between the
                    apprentice and his master were merely the device of corporations, whether it
                    ever could have come into such universal use throughout Europe. The engagement
                    by which the apprentice is bound to his master is his own voluntary act. He
                    agrees to bind himself to work to his master at an inferior rate, on condition
                    of receiving from his master the necessary instruction in his business. This
                    instruction, Dr Smith asserts, may be given him in the course of a few days or
                    weeks. It is well known, however, to every practical tradesman, or to any one
                    acquainted with the nature of mechanical employments, that the instruction of
                    three days or weeks would scarcely teach an apprentice the name of his tools,
                    and that almost all the mechanical trades require throughout their various
                    operations such nicety and exactness, that the necessary habits are not formed
                    by the training of years, in place of weeks or days. It is for the troublesome
                    superintendence of the apprentice during this period that the master exacts
                    compensation, without which he would employ none but finished workmen. But he
                    puts up with the awkwardness of his apprentice because he expects to be
                    benefited by his labour after he shall he better instructed in his business; on
                    the same principle that the farmer lays out his capital on the improvement of
                    his land, in expectation of a future increase bf produce. The contract of
                    apprenticeship is thus a voluntary agreement between two parties for their
                    mutual benefit, the result neither of law nor of the usages of petty
                    corporations, but of circumstances. The law, indeed, takes cognizance of the
                    contract, and enforces its fulfilment; and it may also have encumbered it with
                    absurd regulations: but the contract itself stands independent both of law and
                    usage, having its origin in the plainest principles of reciprocal expediency.
                    There seems no reason, therefore, to class it with those artificial expedients
                    which originate in the exclusive spirit of trading corporations.</p>
                <p>Dr Smith appears also to have greatly overrated the effects of those laws, the
                    object of which is to limit the number of apprentices who shall be reared to
                    particular trades. No law of any corporation will ever be found in practice to
                    impose any limitation on the number of apprentices who may be trained to a
                    business. It will depend on the state of the business, whether it is advancing,
                    stationary, or declining, what number of apprentices will be bred to it; and if,
                    while a flourishing trade called for a continual supply of new hands, any
                    corporation were to enact a law limiting the masters to such a number of
                    apprentices as would barely keep up thair present stock, a scarcity of hands
                    would soon be felt, wages would rise, and the masters would soon be induced, by
                    regard to their own interest, to rescind the law which imposed so great an
                    inconvenience on themselves. But if the law is thus modified and accommodated to
                    the state of the trade, it is a mere form. It imposes in reality no restraint,
                    since it is always in the power of the masters to alter it whenever they feel
                    that it interferes with their arrangements.</p>
                <p>But though the law were even rigidly persisted in, it is evident that it would
                    not permanently diminish the number of apprentices who would be bred to a
                    business, since the consequence would be, that the workmen would turn masters,
                    and each taking the full allowance of apprentices which the law permits, would
                    soon train up an ample supply of hands. All those petty contrivances of
                    corporations, therefore, though they may originate in the lowest mercantile
                    jealousy, and though they may be exceedingly absurd, cannot materially disturb
                    the general progress of things; and, though they may harass individuals, their
                    effect on the industry of a great country hardly deserves notice; their bad
                    effects being corrected by those general causes on which society depends for
                    completing its arrangements, in spite of the obstacles arising from the mistaken
                    policy of legislators. See Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Wealth of Nations,</hi>
