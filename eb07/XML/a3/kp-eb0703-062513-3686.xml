                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">ARRACAN</label>. This was formerly an independent kingdom; in
                    1783 it became a maritime province of the Burman empire, and was added to the
                    British possessions in that quarter by the treaty of 1826, dictated by a British
                    army at the gates of the Burmese capital. It is bounded by the Chittagong
                    district on the north, from which it is separated by the small river Nauf; by
                    Pegue on the south, in lat. 18. N.; on the west by the Indian Ocean; and on the
                    east, at the distance of about 50 miles, it is divided from Ava by a range of
                    mountains, through which there are very few passes. It may be estimated at 230
                    miles in extreme length, and in breadth 50; and the coast is studded with
                    several fertile islands, viz. Ramree, Cheduba, &amp;c. The mountains rise to the
                    elevation of from 3000 to 5000 feet, and decline gradually towards the east in a
                    succession of ranges. They were crossed in 1826 by Lieutenant Trant and a
                    detachment of sepoys, and were found to abound in springs; and it appeared that
                    a considerable commerce had been carried on to the eastward by this route
                    previous to the British invasion. They were crossed farther to the south by
                    Lieutenant Browne and a party of sepoys, and the country was found perfectly
                    wild, and one continued succession of hills, jungles, and ravines. They extend
                    northward as far as the southern bank of the Brahmaputra. The inhabitants of
                    these mountains are averse to mix with the natives of the plains, although the
                    Burmans, after their conquest of Arracan, compelled many, and allowed a few
                    settlers from their native hills, to settle in the villages, where they are
                    treated with humanity, in order to reconcile them to the restraints of
                    civilization. A large proportion of these mountaineers are still independent,
                    and have uniformly rejected a foreign yoke. A range of hills, very inferior in
                    height, skirts the shore; and the valley which lies between them is covered with
                    thick jungles and impenetrable woods, and filled with wild animals, such as the
                    elephant, the tiger, &amp;c. Owing to the moist temperature (the periodical
                    rains continuing from June to November, and often to December, besides
                    occasional showers), this tract of country is frequently flooded, and is at all
                    times intersected with rivers, lakes, and inlets of the sea; so that the
                    communication between the villages must be maintained by means of boats. The
                    soil is fertile, especially in the vicinity of the mountains; but the frequent
                    rains and exhalations under the burning sun of the tropics are adverse to
                    European constitutions. The staple produce is rice, for which the country is
                    well adapted, from its moist and hot climate. The other productions are sugar,
                    hemp, indigo, onions, garlic, turmeric. The fruits are abundant and of a
                    superior quality, viz. pineapples and plantains, mangoes, jacks, sweet limes,
                    cocoa nuts, and other tropical fruits. The forests produce excellent timber; and
                    the teak tree is found, but in such inaccessible parts, that it is usually
                    imported from Rangoon. The rivers wash down from the mountains gold and silver
                    particles, for the liberty of collecting which a certain rent is paid. Salt is
                    produced in great abundance. Limestone is also procured from the islands that he
                    along the shore. The greater portion of the country is in a state of nature; and
                    it is estimated by Hamilton, the accurate and well-informed<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193103699" xml:id="kp-eb0703-3699-0626"/> writer of the <hi
                    rend="italic">East India Gazetteer,</hi> that not above 400 square miles of this
                    extensive territory are under cultivation. The inhabitants do not exceed
                    100,000, consisting chiefly of a rude and filthy race called the Mughs, about
                    one third being Mahometans, and not more than one tenth Burmese. They speak
                    their own language, which is different from the Burmese tongue; the principal
                    Mahometans use the language of Hindostan, and the lower orders a mixed
                    dialect.</p>
                <p>The Mughs appear in their habits to be not far removed from the savage state.
                    They give no attention to agriculture, but live by hunting, fishing, traffic,
                    and rapine. They follow in their religion the Buddhist doctrines, with many
                    Hindoo superstitions, and offer bloody sacrifices to the deities of the rivers,
                    woods, and mountains. They are barbarous in their domestic manners, trafficking
                    without restraint in slaves, and even pawning their wives when they are in want
                    of money. Some bury their dead in coffins richly gilt, and others burn them.
                    They are of a middling stature, but of a robust make, with broad faces, high and
                    wide cheek-bones, flat noses, and, in the obliquity of their eyes, resembling
                    the Chinese. They are so far addicted to the notions of the Hindoos that they
                    scruple about taking the life of an animal; but when dead they 'eat every
                    species of animal without restraint, and are of the most disgusting and filthy
                    habits in their eating as well as in their persons. Besides the tribes on the
                    seacoast, there are many rude tribes scattered in the interior, and beyond its
                    limits to the east, as well as those of Chittagong. These different tribes are
                    frequently engaged in mutual hostilities. It has been from time immemorial the
                    practice of these Mughs, like most of the other barbarous nations of Asia, to
                    make predatory inroads on the southern parts of Bengal, and to carry off all the
                    booty which they could collect, including men, women, and children, who are sold
                    for slaves. They have even had the boldness to descend on the coast of
                    Chittagong, to proceed into the country, plunder and burn the villages, destroy
                    what they could not carry away, and make slaves of the inhabitants. It was to an
                    incursion of this sort in 1777 that we owe our first knowledge of this country.
                    In February 1776 it is mentioned by Major R. E. Roberts,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Asiatic Annual
                    Register,</hi> vol. i.</p></note> who was residing at Islaamabad, that a body of
                    them made an inroad on the southern parts of Bengal, and carried off about 1800
                    men, women, and children, who were brought to Arracan, where the rajah was
                    allowed his choice from the female captives; after which the remainder were
                    conducted with ropes about their necks to the market-place, and being there
                    sold, were employed in the cultivation of the lands and other laborious
                    employments. It was from some of those captives who escaped that any information
                    was obtained of this eastern country.</p>
                <p>Before the province of Chittagong was ceded to the company, the British
                    territories were frequently exposed to the inroads of these plunderers, and an
                    immense expense was incurred in maintaining a sea and land force to repel them;
                    and there are still vestiges of a fortification round the town of Islaamabad,
                    which was raised up by the inhabitants as a defence against their inroads. Even
                    the possession of the province of Chittagong, owing to the extent of its coast,
                    did not wholly prevent their attacks; and a considerable force was still found
                    necessary for the protection of the company’s territories, which were from time
                    to time molested by their hostile incursions; and Major R. Ľ. Roberts, in an
                    account of Arracan, published in the <hi rend="italic">Asiatic Miscellany</hi>
                    at Calcutta in 1777, observes, with a singularly penetrating and almost
                    prophetic spirit, when he is pointing out the impolicy of merely acting on the
                    defensive against these marauders, “The longer they continue unattacked the more
                    powerful and outrageous they will become, till at last it will be found
                    necessary, for the immediate preservation of all the southern parts of Bengal,
                    to enter into an expensive and perhaps bloody war with them.”</p>
                <p>Arracan, from the character of its inhabitants, who are rude and indolent,
                    possesses no surplus produce with which to trade to other countries; and salt is
                    the only article of export. This country was formerly the medium of commercial
                    intercourse between Asia and Hindostan, exporting to the former European goods,
                    such as velvet, broad cloths, piece goods, silks, muslins, betel-nut, salt,
                    &amp;c., and receiving in return ivory, silver, copper, sugar, tobacco, oil, and
                    lacquered ware. The country being so poor and unproductive, produces only about
                    220 rupees of revenue, which will hardly defray the expense of its civil and
                    military establishments; and it is retained, not for profit, but as an outpost
                    of defence against the incursions and growing power of the Burmese empire.</p>
                <p>The natives of Arracan trace their history as far back as <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.</hi> D. 701, and give a lineal succession of 120 native princes down to
                    modern times. According to them their empire had at one time far wider limits,
                    and extended over Ava, part of China, and the Bengal territories. This extension
                    of their empire does not agree with any known facts in history. At different
                    times the Moguls and Pe∙ guers carried their arms into the heart of the country.
                    The Portuguese, during the era of their greatness in Asia, gained a temporary
                    establishment in Arracan. But in 1783 the province, with all its dependencies,
                    was finally conquered by the Burmese; and though the inhabitants made desperate
                    efforts to recover their independence, they were always foiled by the discipline
                    and numbers of their enemies, who contrived to extract from this ill-cultivated
                    tract a surplus revenue of 18,000 rupees. In 1825 the British army in Arracan
                    became a prey to the destructive climate, and died in great numbers; and it has
                    since proved equally injurious to the native regiments stationed on the
                    coast.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Arracan,</hi> the capital of the above province, situated on
                    a river of the same name, about 40 miles from the sea. The town is chiefly built
                    of bamboo huts, and stands in a valley surrounded by hills, and covered with
                    marshes and canals, communicating with a number of small streams, running
                    between low muddy banks. The tide overflows to a considerable extent the flat
                    borders of the river Arracan, and by its reflux converts these into a
                    pestilential swamp, on which a great part of the town of Arracan is built. In
                    such an unfavourable situation, it is necessary to drive wooden posts into the
                    ground to obtain a foundation for the houses, under which the water flows. We
                    need not wonder that a place so situated should be unhealthy for Europeans. The
                    town is perpetually involved in the putrid exhalations from these swamps, which
                    are a perpetual source of disease. Where the ground is not swampy it consists of
                    a soft species of rock. The surrounding ground is irregularly diversified by
                    hills, connected by narrow ridges, and separated by ravines, either occupied by
                    a stream or a marsh. The houses are connected by wooden bridges; and in its
                    centre is a square surrounded by a wall containing pagodas and images of Gaudma,
                    of all sizes, from an inch to 20 feet in height. The town and fort were taken by
                    the Burmese in 1783.</p>

                    condition, and the air most pestilential.</p>
