                <p><label type="entry">AQUEDUCT</label>, a conduit or channel for the conveyance of
                    water. It is derived from <hi rend="italic">aqua,</hi> water, and <hi
                    rend="italic">ductus,</hi> a conduit. It is applied more particularly to those
                    structures of masonry which have been erected for the conveyance of water across
                    valleys, to which, however, we would rather give the name of aqueduct bridges,
                    extending the term aqueduct to the whole conduit or channel by which the water
                    is conveyed from one place to another. The conveyance of water for the supply of
                    large cities has in all ages formed a very important object of public economy;
                    and aqueducts of various kinds have been in use for this purpose from the
                    earliest times, the remains of which have been examined by travellers in
                    different parts of the East. Pococke describes a work of this kind erected by
                    Solomon, for conveying water from the pools and fountains near Bethlehem to
                    Jerusalem. “The aqueduct,” he says, “is built on a foundation of stone; the
                    water runs in round earthen pipes about 10 inches diameter, which are cased with
                    two stones, hevzn out so as to fit them, and they are covered over with rough
                    stones well cemented together; and the whole is so sunk into the ground on the
                    side of the hills, that in many places nothing is to be seen of it.” But it was
                    in the luxurious capital of Rome that the system of aqueducts was brought to the
                    greatest perfection, and carried to an extent which has never been equalled even
                    in modern times, and has justly excited admiration both from the number and
                    magnificence of the works themselves, and the prodigious quantities of water
                    which by these means were continually poured into the city. These aqueducts
                    extended, some of them 30, 40, and even 60 miles from the city, in one continued
                    covered channel of stone, carried by arcades over the widest and deepest
                    valleys, and by tunnels running in many parts for miles through mountains and
                    through the solid rock. “If we consider attentively,” says Pliny, “the
                    quantities of water brought into the city for the use of the public, for baths,
                    for fish-ponds, for private houses, for artificial lakes, for gardens in the
                    neighbourhood of the city, and for villas; if we look also at the works which
                    have been constructed for forming a regular channel for the waters—arches raised
                    up, mountains pierced with tunnels, and valleys filled up to a level; it must be
                    acknowledged that there is nothing in the whole world more wonderful.”</p>
                <p>lor about 400 years after the building of the city the Romans were contented with
                    the waters of the Tiber, or what was drawn from wells or from fountains in the
                    city and its neighbourhood. But the great increase of the population rendering a
                    more ample supply desirable, the censor Appius Claudius was the first to
                    introduce an aqueduct to convey the waters of distant springs into the city.
                    About thirty-nine years after this, Μ. Curius Dentatus, brought in an additional
                    supply from the neighbourhood' of Tibur. These examples were afterwards followed
                    by various other public men, as the wants of the city rendered new supplies
                    necessary. Among these were Papirius, Crassus, Marcius, Agrippa, and Augustus;
                    and most of the succeeding emperors, even Tiberius, Claudius, Caligula, Nero,
                    and Caracalla, esteemed it an honour to connect their names with such great and
                    useful works.</p>
                <p>Frontinus, who was appointed curator of the aqueducts by the emperor Nerva, has
                    left the most ample account of them. According to him, there were nine great
                    aqueducts by which the city was supplied. Five more were added by Nerva, and the
                    number was afterwards augmented by succeeding emperors to twenty. Of these, the
                    most remarkable were the Aqua Appia; the Old and New Anio; the Aqua Martia,
                    which also conveyed the Aqua Julia and the Aqua Tepula; the Aqua Virginia; and
                    the Aqua Claudia. The <hi rend="italic">Aqua</hi><hi rend="italic">Appia</hi>
                    was so named from the censor Appius Claudius, by whom it was constructed in the
                    442d year of Rome. It commenced in a field near the Via Praenestina, between the
                    6th and 8th mile-stones, made a circuit of 780 paces-to the left, and then
                    proceeding by a deep subterranean channel of more than 11 miles, entered the
                    city at the Appian Way by the Porta Capena, and delivered the main body of its
                    waters into the Campus Martius. The <hi rend="italic">Old</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">New Anio</hi> were so called from their bringing into Rome the
                    waters of that river. The former began above the Tiber, at the 30th mile-stone,
                    and consisted mostly of a winding channel, carried through an extent of about 43
                    miles. The latter, constructed under Nero, took a higher level, running 7543
                    paces above ground, and then through <hi rend="italic">a</hi> subterranean
                    passage of 54,267 paces in length. The <hi rend="italic">Aqua</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Martia,</hi> which owed its formation to Quintus Martius, rose
                    from a spring distant 33 miles from Rome, made a circuit of three miles, and
                    afterwards forming a vault of 16 feet diameter, it ran 38 miles along a series
                    of arcades at an elevation of 70 feet. It had openings perforated at certain
                    distances for discharging the collected air, and at different places deep
                    cisterns, in which the water settled and deposited its sediment. On this account
                    it was remarkable for its clear green colour, and is celebrated by Pliny for its
                    coolness and salubrity. The <hi rend="italic">Aqua Julia</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aqua Tcoula</hi> were brought to Rome by the same aqueduct as the
                    <hi rend="italic">Aqua</hi><hi rend="italic">Martia,</hi> but on higher levels.
                    The whole aqueduct above the arcades was divided into three stories or channels.
                    In the uppermost flowed the Aqua Julia, in the second the Aqua Teþula, and in
                    the lowest the Aqua Martia. From the ruins of this combined fabric, which still
                    subsist, it appears to have been a very superb structure. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aqua Virginia</hi> was constructed by Agrippa, who laboured to improve and
                    beautify Rome, and who, according to Pliny, formed in one year 70 pools, 105
                    fountains, and 130 reservoirs. It commenced at a very copious spring, in the
                    middle of . a marsh, at the distance of eight miles from the city, and ran about
                    12 miles, passing through a tunnel of 800 paces in length. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aqua Claudia,</hi> begun by Nero and completed by Claudius, took its rise 38
                    miles from Rome. It formed a subterranean stream 36ļ miles in length, ran 10^
                    miles along the surface of the ground, was vaulted for the space of three miles,
                    and supported on arcades through the extent of seven miles, being carried along
                    as high a level as to supply all the hills of Rome. It was built of hewn stone,
                    and still continues to furnish the modern city with water of the best quality,
                    which has hence procured it the name of <hi rend="italic">Aqua Felice.</hi></p>
                <p>In all these aqueducts the channel for the waters was carried with a regular
                    declivity from the one end to the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193099695"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-9695-0318"/>other of the aqueduct, and such as was sufficient
                    to carry the water easily along. In some cases the declivity, had the line been
                    carried straight forward, would have been too great; it was therefore made to
                    take a circuitous route, winding along the sides of the hills, and prolonging
                    the length of the channel so as to reduce the degree of descent, and cause the
                    water to run gently along. The whole of the channel was regularly built of stone
                    or brick, and arched above to cover in the channel, excepting in those places
                    where it was cut out of the solid rock. Along all the valleys and water-courses
                    which lay in the way it was elevated by a series of arches, all raised to the
                    level of the conduit, resting on massy pillars, and all built in the most solid
                    and substantial manner, with brick, and often with hewn stone. The sketches of
                    Roman aqueducts in Plate XLVIIL, taken from Fabrettus, will give a better idea
                    than any description, of the manner in which the work was executed. Sometimes
                    there was only a single arch, as in the two middle figures; sometimes, again,
                    where the conduit was to be elevated higher, as in the right-hand figure, a
                    double row of arches was raised, one above the other, for greater strength and
                    security. The figure on the left hand shows two conduits or aqueducts carried in
                    different levels along the same building. The upper one is the New Anio, the
                    lower is the Aqua Claudia. When we consider the labour and difficulties
                    attending the construction of such arches and arched channels of masonry, the
                    spirit and enterprise which could have undertaken such works as are above
                    enumerated, undaunted by the expense, or any of the other obstacles which lay in
                    the way, appear astonishing. In this country, where bridges, canals, and other
                    water-works have been carried to a great extent and perfection, we consider an
                    aqueduct of six or eight arches a work of no small extent and importance. What
                    would we think, then, of the aqueduct of the New Anio, extending 6⅜ miles in one
                    continued series of arches, many of them upwards of 100 feet high 1 If we allow
                    a similar number of arches in the length, we shall have in all more than 600;
                    arid yet this is nothing compared with the aqueduct of the Aqua Martia,
                    extending 38 miles, and containing in all nearly 7000 arches. Even an aqueduct
                    bridge of five or six miles in length appears incredible; and yet how can we
                    otherwise translate Frontinus, where he states the lengths of all the aqueducts,
                    and how much was above or under ground, and how much was built in arches? Of the
                    New Anio, for instance, he says its conduit was 63 miles 700 paces in length. Of
                    this 49 miles 200‘paces consisted of a subterranean stream, and 9 miles 400
                    paces were above ground, of which last the higher part consisted of
                    “substructionibus aut opere arcuato,” in several places of great length; and
                    nearer the city, at the 7th mile-stone, consisted of “substructione” 609 paces,
                    and “opere arcuato” 6 miles 491 paces; and he adds, “These arches are the
                    highest of any, being raised in some parts 109 feet.” The term <hi rend="italic"
                    >substructio</hi> probably means a conduit built by opening up the surface of
                    the ground and then covering over the building with earth, as we do in such
                    works at this day. But the term <hi rend="italic">opere arcuato</hi> can only
                    refer to a continued series of arches, and certainly conveys a vast idea of the
                    extent and magnitude of such works.</p>
                <p>The total quantity of water delivered into Rome by these aqueducts was altogether
                    astonishing, and quite beyond what we have any conception of now, for either
                    comfort or luxury. Strabo said truly, that whole rivers flowed through the
                    streets of Rome. According to Frontinus, the nine earlier aqueducts delivered
                    daily 14Ό18 quinaria, which corresponds to nearly 28 millions of cubic feet; and
                    when all the aqueducts were in operation, the quantity must have amounted to
                    50,000,000 cubic feet· which, reckoning the population of the city at that time
                    at a million, would give 50 feet daily, or 7 hogsheads to each individual. This
                    is more than ten times the supply <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> f London, which
                    is now reckoned to be quite profuse.</p>
                <p>Of the modern aqueducts in Rome the principal are the Aqua Felice, the Aqua
                    Virginia, and the Aqua Paulina. The first was constructed by Sixtus V. It
                    commences at Palaestrina, about twenty-two miles from the city, and discharges
                    itself at the Fontana di Termini. The Aqua Paulina was repaired by Pope Paul V.
                    in the year 1612. It divides itself into two principal channels, one of which
                    supplies Mont Janiculum, and the other the Vatican and its neighbourhood. It is
                    conveyed from the district of Bracciano, about twenty miles distant; and three
                    of its five streams are not inferior to small rivers. According to the
                    calculation of Prouy, these three aqueducts, with some additional sources,
                    deliver in twenty-four hours 5,305,000 cubic feet. This, among a population of
                    130,000, gives about 40 cubic feet for each individual, which is nearly equal in
                    proportion to the supply of ancient Rome in the period of its utmost
                    splendour.</p>
                <p>But the system of aqueducts was not confined to the capital of Rome. It was
                    gradually extended throughout the provinces of that vast empire; and every city
                    and considerable town had its conduits and aqueducts for supplying it with
                    water, many of which still remain to attest the magnificence with which these
                    works were carried on. In Plates XLVIII. and XLIX. we have given a view of some
                    of these. The first is the remains of one of the principal aqueduct bridges in
                    the aqueduct of Antioch. It is a work of great magnitude and height, but a very
                    rude structure. The lower part consists almost entirely of solid wall, and the
                    upper part of a series of arches with very massy pillars. It appears, however,
                    to be a Roman work; and there are remains of another aqueduct on a lower level,
                    and of an older date. The water to Antioch was brought from a distance of four
                    or five miles, from a place called Battelma, which Pococke thinks was the very
                    spot where Daphne stood. Several springs, one of which was so large as to turn
                    several mills, were conveyed in channels of hewn stone, and united in one main
                    stream, which was thence conveyed along the surface of the ground in a similar
                    channel. Across all the rivulets and valleys it was raised on arches or aqueduct
                    bridges, some of which are very lofty, and the principal is the one exhibited in
                    the plate, extending upwards of 700 feet in length, and upwards of 200 feet high
                    in the deepest part. From the remains of the aqueduct in the island of Mytilene,
                    represented from Pococke in the same plate, this appears to have been also a
                    magnificent work. It was built of gray marble rusticated. It is much superior in
                    point of skill to the aqueduct of Antioch, the arches being carried in two
                    ranges throughout the building. It extended about 500 feet in length, and was
                    about 70 or 80 feet high at the deepest part.</p>
                <p>The aqueduct or aqueduct bridge of Pyrgos, near Constantinople, forms a portion
                    of the extensive hydraulic works with which that capital was supplied with water
                    after it became the seat of empire. They are described by Andreossy in his
                    voyage to the Black Sea, and account of the Thracian Bosphorus. It is a grand
                    work, very remarkable both in design and execution, and affords a fair specimen
                    of the style of such structures among the Romans in the middle ages. It consists
                    of two branches, one of which only is seen in elevation in the plate; the other
                    stood nearly at right angles to this, and is seen partly on the plan; it was
                    hence called the Bended or Crooked Aqueduct, to distinguish it from another
                    termed the Long Aqueduct, which was situated near the sources of the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193099708" xml:id="kp-eb0703-9708-0319"/> waters. The
                    branch seen in elevation extends 670 feet in length, and is 106 feet in height
                    at the deepest part. It is composed of three rows of arches, those in each row
                    increasing in width from the bottom to the top—an arrangement very properly
                    introduced with the view of saving materials without diminishing the strength of
                    the work. The two upper rows consisted of arches of semicircles, the lower of
                    Gothic arches; and this circumstance serves to fix the date of the structure, as
                    these last were not introduced until the 10th century. The breadth of the
                    building at the base was 21 feet, and it diminished with a regular batter on
                    each side to the top, where it was only 11 feet. The base also was protected by
                    strong buttresses or counterforts, erected against each of the pillars. , The
                    other branch of the aqueduct was 300 feet long, and consisted of 12 semicircular
                    arches.</p>
                <p>This aqueduct serves to convey to Constantinople the waters of the valley of
                    Belgrade, one of the principal sources from which the city is supplied. These
                    are situated on the heights of Mount Haemus, the extremity of the Balkan
                    Mountains, which overhangs the Black Sea. The water rises about 15 miles from
                    the city, and between three and four miles west of the village of Belgrade, in
                    three sources, which run in three deep and very confined valleys. These unite a
                    little below the village, and then are collected into a large reservoir. After
                    flowing a mile or two from this reservoir, the waters are augmented by two other
                    streams, and conveyed by a channel of stone to the Crooked Aqueduct. From this
                    they are conveyed to another, which is the Long Aqueduct; and then, with various
                    accessions, into a third, termed the Aqueduct of Justinian. From this they enter
                    a vaulted conduit, which skirts the hills on the left side of the valley, and
                    crosses a broad valley two miles below the Aqueduct of Justinian, by means of an
                    aqueduct with a double row of arcades of a very beautiful construction. The
                    conduit then proceeds onward in a circuitous route, till it reaches the
                    reservoir of Egri Kapan, situated just without and on the walls of the city.
                    From this they are conducted to the various quarters of the city, and also to
                    the reservoir of St Sophia, which supplies the seraglio of the grand signier.
                    The Long Aqueduct is more imposing by its extent than the Crooked one, but is
                    far inferior in the regularity of design and disposition of the materials. It is
                    evidently a work of the Turks. It consists of two rows of arcades, the lower
                    being 48 in number, and the upper 50. The whole length was about 2200 feet, and
                    the height 80 feet. The Aqueduct of Justinian is a very excellent work, and
                    without doubt one of the finest monuments which remain to us of the middle ages.
                    It consists of two rows of large arcades in the pointed style, with four arches
                    in each. Those of the lower story have 52 feet of span, the upper ones 40 feet.
                    The piers are supported by strong buttresses, and at different heights they have
                    little arches passing through them, which relieve the deadness of the solid
                    pillar. The length of this aqueduct is 720 leet, and the height 109 feet. This
                    aqueduct, though it bears the name of Justinian, was probably erected in the
                    time of Constantine.</p>
                <p>Besides the waters of Belgrade, Constantinople was supplied from several other
                    principal sources, one of which took its rise on the heights of the same
                    mountains, three or four miles east of Bèlgrade. This was conveyed in a similar
                    manner by an arched channel, elevated when it was necessary on aqueduct bridges,
                    till it reached the northern parts of the city. It was in the course of this
                    aqueduct that was constructed the contrivance of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >souterasi</hi> or hydraulic obelisks described by Andreossy, and which has
                    excited some attention, as being an improvement on the method of conducting
                    water by aqueduct bridges. “The souterasi,” says Andreośsy, “are masses of
                    masonry, having generally the form of a truncated pyramid or an Egyptian
                    obelisk. To form a conduit with souterasi, we choose sources of water, the level
                    of which is several feet higher than the reservoir by which it is to be
                    distributed over the city. We bring the water from its sources in subterranean
                    canals, slightly declining until we come to the borders of a valley or broken
                    ground. We there raise on each side a souterasi, to which we adapt vertically
                    leaden pipes of determinate diameters, placed parallel to the two opposite sides
                    of the building. These pipes are disjoined at the upper part of the obelisk,
                    which forms a sort of basin, with which the pipes are connected. The one permits
                    the water to rise to the level from whence it had descended; by the other, the
                    water descends from this level to the foot of the souterasi, where it enters
                    another canal under ground, which conducts it to a second and to a third
                    souterasi, where it rises and again descends, as at the last station. Here a
                    reservoir receives it and distributes it in different directions by orifices of
                    which the discharge is known.” Again he says, “it requires but little attention
                    to perceive that this system of conducting tubes is nothing but a series of
                    syphons open at their upper part, and communicating with each other. The expense
                    of a conduit by souterasi is estimated at only one fifth of that of an aqueduct
                    with arcades.” We really cannot perceive any advantage in these pyramids,
                    further than as they serve the purpose of discharging the air which collects in
                    the pipes. For if the water is to be conveyed in pipes across the valley, what
                    other purpose can these columns possibly serve? They are in themselves an
                    evident obstruction, and the water would flow more freely without any
                    interruption of the kind. In regard to the leaden pipes, again, they would have
                    required, with so little head pressure as is stated, to be used of very
                    extraordinary dimensions to pass the same quantity of water as was discharged
                    along the arched conduits. There is something, therefore, which would require
                    explanation in this account of Andreossy regarding these pyramids, or else he
                    has misunderstood the nature of them when he says that they supply
                    advantageously the place of the aqueducts or arches. A train of pipes properly
                    laid, and of proper dimensions, might do this; but what advantage the pyramids
                    possess further than to answer the purpose of air-cocks, is not very
                    apparent.</p>
                <p>The other principal source from which Constantinople is supplied, is from the
                    high grounds six or eight miles west of the town, from which it is conducted by
                    conduits and arches, in the same manner as the others. The supply drawn from all
                    these sources amounts, according to Andreossy, to 400,000 cubic feet per day;
                    about two thirds of a foot to each person of a population of 600,000. The charge
                    of the water-works at Constantinople belongs to a body of 300 Turks and 100
                    Albanese Greeks, who form almost an hereditary profession.</p>
                <p>Of the aqueducts which still remain as relics of Roman grandeur, the most
                    remarkable are, the aqueduct of Metz; the aqueduct of Nismes, or the Pont du
                    Gard; and the aqueduct of Segovia in Spain. “The aqueducts of Rome,” says
                    Montfaucon, “were without doubt wonderful on account of their great
                    length—arcades continued over the space of 40 or 50 miles; their great number,
                    with which the Campagna of Rome was filled on every side: all this surprises us.
                    But it must be confessed that if, without considering the total extent, we only
                    look at any of the parts which remain round Rome, there is nothing that
                    approached the aqueducts of Metz, of Nismes, or of Segovia.” The aqueduct of
                    Metz is represented in Plate XLIX. Nearly the half of it, it will be observed,
                    has been carried away; but there still remain a great num- <pb break="no"

                <p>Aqueduct, ber of arches, and enough to give an idea of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ex</hi> tent of the whole. It extended across the Moselle, a very considerable
                    river, and very broad in this place; and served to convey the delicious waters
                    of the Gorse to the city of Metz. These waters, according to Meuripe, in his
                    history of the bishops of Metz, printed in 1634, were so abundant that they
                    furnished water for floating the vessels every time that a naval fight was to be
                    exhibited. They were collected into a reservoir, and from thence conducted by
                    subterraneous canals constructed of hewn stone, and so spacious that a man could
                    easily walk in them upright. They then passed the Moselle by means of the
                    aqueduct, which was situated about six miles from Metz, and from thence were
                    conducted under ground in stone channels, similar to the others, to the city, to
                    the baths, to the place of the sea-fight, and all over the city. Judging from
                    the drawing, this aqueduct seems to have been nearly 1000 feet in length, the
                    arches 50 feet high at the deepest part, and 50 in number. They formed only one
                    series, the height not requiring a double row. They were so well built and
                    cemented together, that, excepting the middle part, which the descent of ice
                    down the river has in the lapse of ages carried away, they have resisted, and
                    will continue to resist, the effects of time and of the most violent
                    seasons.</p>
                <p>The Pont du Gard was executed by the Romans in the reign of Augustus, and was
                    then merely an aqueduct for bringing the waters of the fountain of Hure to
                    Nismes. It was composed of three row s of arches filling up the valley between
                    two mountains, between which rah the river Gardon. The first row comprehended
                    six arches, each 60 feet span, excepting one, which was the largest, and was 75
                    feet span; the second row contained 12 arches of the same span as the first; and
                    the third had 36 little arches, on the top of which was the channel for
                    conducting the water. This bridge exhibits a decided improvement and superiority
                    over all the other Roman aqueducts, in the lightness and striking boldness of
                    its design. The arches are wider, and the piers in proportion lighter, than any
                    other structure of the kind previously constructed; and had the same principle
                    been extended so as to have formed only a single row from top to bottom, it
                    would have equalled in the skill and disposition of its materials (circumstances
                    in which the Roman works were almost universally wanting) any of the more
                    judicious and elegant structures of modern times. About the year 1740, this
                    bridge, being of no more use as an aqueduct, was converted into a road-way, by
                    widening it, or rather building in a manner another bridge to the side of it,
                    having all the arches of the same span and dimensions. The execution of the work
                    was attended with considerable difficulties, but these were all successfully
                    overcome by the French engineer Pitot.</p>
                <p>The aqueduct of Segovia, according to Culmenares, who travelled in Spain, and has
                    written the history of Segovia, may be compared with the most wonderful works
                    which antiquity has transmitted to us. There still remain of it 159 arches, all
                    built with large stones, and without any cement. There are two rows of arches,
                    one above the other, and the whole height of the edifice is 102 feet. It runs
                    quite across the town, and passes over the greater part of the houses which lie
                    in the hollow.</p>
                <p>In modern times various aqueducts have been formed after the manner of the
                    Romans, particularly in France; and the most remarkable are those which have
                    been constructed by Louis XIV., at vast expense, for conducting water from
                    Versailles to Marli. Of these the famous aqueduct bridge of Maintenon, which was
                    erected for conveying the waters of the river Eure to Versailles, is without
                    doubt, -in point of magnitude and height, the most magnificent</p>
                <p>D U C T.</p>
                <p>structure of the kind in the world. In Plate XLIX, we∆q⅛ have given a view of a
                    portion of this work, on the same&lt;*^ ', scale as the other aqueducts here
                    represented. Had the whole been delineated on the same scale, it would have
                    extended to four times the breadth of the plate. It extends about 4400 feet in
                    length, being nearly seven eighths of a mile, and upwards of 200 feet in height,
                    and contains 242 arcades, each divided into three rows, forming in all 726
                    arches about 50 feet span. Of the subterranean aqueducts in France the finest is
                    that of Arcueil, which serves to conduct water to that village. It is 44,300
                    feet in length, or upwards of eight miles, extending from the valley of Areueil
                    to the castle at the gate of St Jaques, all built of hewn stone. It is about six
                    feet in height, and has on each side a foot-path 18 inches wide; it has a
                    declivity of one foot in 1300. Another aqueduct of this kind is that of
                    Roequancourt, part of the system which brings water to Versailles; it is 11,760
                    feet in length, or upwards of two miles, and a dcelivity in its whole course i
                    of only three feet. In some parts of its course it was necessary to make
                    excavations 80 or 90 feet deep, which rendered the execution very difficult.</p>
                <p>But in modern times, at least within the last century, the invention and
                    improvement of the manufacture of east iron has completely changed the mode of
                    conducting water into cities, by the introduction of east-iron pipes instead of
                    the stone conduits of former times. These pipes can now be formed of almost any
                    dimensions, and united together into a continued series, so closely as to
                    prevent the escape of the water, even under a violent pressure arising from the
                    altitude of the fountain-head. They enable us, therefore, to take advantage of
                    and give effect to that grand principle in hydrostatics, that the fluid clement
                    tends continually to a level, even though it be confined in the smallest or most
                    complicated system of pipes; so that however low it be carried in any valley, or
                    to whatever distance, still it will rise on the opposite side to the original
                    altitude of the fountain-head—a principle which is most important indeed in such
                    works, seeing that by it we are not restricted, as the Romans were, almost to a
                    perfect level in the line of the conduit. We have seen that, for the purpose of
                    attaining this level or very gentle dcelivity all along the conduit, they were
                    under the necessity of raising it by arcades continued in one unbroken series,
                    frequently thirty or forty miles in extent; and, in addition to this, often
                    prolonging the length of the track by a circuitous route, turning and winding
                    for miles out of its course, for the very purpose of increasing its length.</p>
                <p>But the use of pipes enables us to dispense with these long arcades all raised
                    nearly to the same level with the fountain-head; because the conduit may be
                    varied in its level to any extent, and still will rise at last to its original
                    altitude. The pipes, therefore, are merely laid all along the surface of the
                    ground, with a cover of two or three feet of soil to place them beyond the reach
                    of frost. To prevent, however, the frequent or abrupt alternations of rise and
                    fall, any sudden inequalities in the ground are equalised by cuttings and
                    embankments, but not to any thing like the extent that would be required to
                    raise the whole to a level. This, therefore, forms a capital improvement in the
                    method of conducting water, and the greatest indeed which has ever been made in
                    this important branch of practical mechanics. That it was not introduced by the
                    Romans, is not to be ascribed, as many have done, to their ignorance of the
                    hydrostatic principle, that the fluid would rise to a level in the opposite
                    branches of the same train of pipes. Professor Leslie has shown that they were
                    well acquainted with this principle, and has moreover obtained from Italy a
                    portion of a leaden pipe supposed to have been used in the baths of Caracalla,
                    which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193099734" xml:id="kp-eb0703-9734-0321"/>sets
                    this matter at rest. But, from the low state of the arts at that period, they
                    were unable to give effect to the principle. They had not the means of
                    fabricating pipes of such a magnitude as would have been required for the
                    enormous quantities of water consumed in Home, and at the same time of strength
                    sufficient to withstand the pressure from the fountain-head. Lead was the only
                    material that couldbe used by them for the purpose; and besides the enormous
                    thickness that so weak a material would have required, and the impracticability
                    of their forming them, and uniting them together endwise, they had a decided
                    aversion to lead, as tending to make the water unwholesome by its poisonous
                    impregnation. The use of cast iron was quite unknown. There remained, therefore,
                    no resource but in the aqueducts, which, though attended no doubt with vast
                    expense, and requiring great enterprise, as well as both skill and patience,
                    were yet attainable by these means, and formed when completed a simple and very
                    perfect mode of effecting the object. Hence arose all those works above
                    described which have since excited such astonishment. Now, however, when the
                    manufacture of east iron has been brought to such perfection, and methods
                    contrived for uniting perfectly together all the pipes into one connected train,
                    this improved system has been universally adopted.</p>
                <p>The most complete and perfect works of the kind are 'those some time ago
                    undertaken for the supply of Edinburgh, which, by the contrivance and direction
                    of Mr 'Jardine, the company’s engineer, have been executed in a style quite
                    worthy of the eitÿ, as well as of the present advanced state of science and the
                    arts; offering, both in the general design and in all the details, a model of
                    propriety and skill in this species of hydraulic architecture. The Crawley
                    Spring, from which the new supply has been derived, issues from the side of a
                    rising ground on the southern base of one of the Pentland Hills. It is scarcely
                    seven miles distant from Edinburgh in a straight line, but eight and three
                    fourths in the line of the pipes, these having been carried round a considerable
                    way to the eastward to avoid the Pentland ridge, the eastern extremity of which
                    lies in the direct line to the city. The spring is elevated 564 feet above the
                    level of the sea, and 360 above the level of Princes Street. There is therefore
                    ample height to carry it over the highest parts of the town. The original issue
                    of the spring was greatly augmented by a drain, which was carried for about half
                    a mile above the spring, up the valley in which it is situated. 1he soil of this
                    valley, consisting of an immense bed of gravel, in many parts 40 feet deep,
                    constitutes a vast natural filter, through which the water, descending from the
                    high grounds on each side of the valley, percolates in a high degree of purity,
                    and being all intercepted by the drain, is by it conducted, along with all the
                    original discharge of the spring, into a reservoir or water-house, from which
                    the pipes take their rise, and continue in one eon-ιected train all the way to
                    the city. In the first three Ωiles they, vary from 18 to 20 inches diameter, and
                    descend 65 feet in a pretty regular series. In the remain- 1er of the track they
                    are 15 inches diameter, and descend •86 feet. The descent is not perfectly
                    regular, being in íome parts steeper than in others, according to the natu-al
                    declivity of the country. In one or two instances uso they undulate slightly.
                    Near Burdichouse, four miles mm the city, they ascend a little; and, after
                    descending apmly to Libberton Dams, they again ascend 20 or 30 feet θ the high
                    ground on the south side of the Meadows, here are, however, no sudden
                    inequalities, all such having 3cen carefully avoided by levelling; for which
                    purpose .considerable embankments and cuttings of the ground <hi
                    rend="superscript"> av e</hi> ŋ <hi rend="superscript"> cen</hi> undertaken
                    without scruple; and as the line approaches the city, it has been carried
                    through a tunnel 2160 feet in length under Heriot’s Green, about 70 or 80 feet
                    below the surface, and another under the Castlehill 740 feet through the solid
                    rock, and 120 feet under the reservoir. From this main line of aqueduct a branch
                    pipe leads off on the south side of the town to the Reservoir at Heriot’s Green,
                    near Heriot’s Hospital, which aids the former source in supplying fully the
                    southern districts; a second leads off from the same place to the eastward, and
                    affords an additional supply to the south side of the town, directly from the
                    pipes; and a third leads off to, the Reservoir on the Castlehill, and aids it in
                    supplying the rest of the old town. The main body of the water, however,
                    proceeds onwards to Princes Street, along Hanover Street, and across Queen
                    Street; and from thence branch pipes are laid through all the other streets in
                    the new town, and from these again" service pipes to each house or floor of a
                    house. Each pipe in this aqueduct is about nine feet in length, the metal being
                    about half an inch thick. After being east, their soundness was proved by a
                    forcing pump applied to each separately, and with a ģage-valve loaded with a
                    weight equivalent to a pressure of 800 feet; and if under this they betrayed the
                    smallest flaw, they were rejected. They are all joined together with what is
                    termed spigot and faucet joint, the end of the one being let several inches into
                    a swelled part or socket at the extremity of the other. This forms a much more
                    perfect joint than by flanches and bolts, as it admits of a slight degree of
                    expansion in the pipes without opening the joining. After being entered, a ring
                    of hemp or rope-yarn is wrapped round the end of the pipe, and beat into the
                    socket of the other, and then a mass of lead run in to fill up the opening,
                    which the yarn prevents from running into the pipe: the lead being hard rammed,
                    and stoved with a chisel, forms a joining completely water-tight. Air-cocks are
                    placed at intervals all along the pipes to let off the accumulated air, which is
                    done by the hand at regular intervals, perhaps every three or four days. The
                    supply of water now conveyed by this aqueduct amounts to 180 or 200 cubic feet
                    per minute at an average. This is about five times the quantity formerly
                    delivered into the town by all the different ponds and reservoirs from which it
                    was then supplied, and which was besides often of a very impure and unwholesome
                    quality. The introduction of this spring therefore gave, as may easily be
                    conceived, wonderful relief to the inhabitants, and is now found, along with the
                    former sources, amply sufficient for every purpose of comfort or luxury. The
                    Crawley aqueduct, however, is capable of conveying double this quantity whenever
                    the wants of the city shall render necessary a new supply, which it is in that
                    ease intended by the present company to draw from another excellent and copious
                    spring termed the Black Spring, situated on the north side of the Pentland
                    Hills. The whole expense incurred by the Joint-Stock Water Company in bringing
                    in the Crawley water, including the expense of the great compensation reservoir
                    for supplying the deficiency to the mills on the stream from which the Crawley
                    was diverted, amounted to about L.145,000, and the company draw an assessment on
                    every consumer of five per cent. on the rcntal of his premises, which is
                    understood to yield L.6000 or L.7000 a year. They are allowed to divide to the
                    amount of six and a half per cent, on their capital, but not more.</p>
                <p>The water from the Crawley Spring is naturally of the finest quality; and issuing
                    continually from a source deeply seated in the ground, and also at so great an
                    altitude, is always fresh and cool, even in the heat of summer, provided it is
                    not allowed to stagnate in our cisterns. In this respect the supply of Edinburgh
                    is far superior to that of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193099747"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-9747-0322"/>most other towns of the same magnitude. In
                    Glasgow, for example, the supply is sufficiently ample; but being derived all
                    from the Clyde, it is liable to become warm and unpleasant in summer. In
                    Liverpool, Manchester, and even in London, the supplies, though abundant, are
                    liable to the same defects. So that on the whole we have reason to congratulate
                    ourselves that the elevated nature of the country round our city affords sources
                    for a supply so copious, so pure, and capable of reaching so easily, and without
                    the aid of any machinery, the highest parts of the town.</p>
                <p>In all places such as the above, where there is a deficiency of level to carry
                    the water naturally to the highest parts of the town, there is no resource but
                    in the employment of machinery. A steam-engine or other agent is applied to the
                    working of pumps, which both draw the water from the rivers or from wells, and
                    then propel it by force through a train of pipes to all the different parts of
                    the town, and elevate it by branches to the highest parts that may be necessary;
                    a plan which we believe is now executing at Aberdeen, and also at Perth.</p>
                <p>But though the system of pipes has thus superseded the use of stone channels all
                    raised to a level in the conveyance of water, there are still cases, such as
                    those of canals, where the water must be kept on a perfect level, and. where,
                    therefore, aqueduct bridges are still necessary in conveying it over the
                    valleys; and of these we have Jong had examples in France, on the Languedoc
                    canal. The first aqueduct bridges for canals in this country were those made by
                    the Duke of Bridgewater, under the direction of the celebrated Brindley, and
                    which, being quite new here, excited no small degree of astonishment. The first
                    and largest was the aqueduct at Barton Bridge for conveying the canal across the
                    Irwell, 39 feet above the surface of the water. It consisted of three arches,
                    the middle one 63 feet span, and admitting under it the largest barges
                    navigating the Irwell with sails set. It was commenced in September 1760; and in
                    July of the following year the spectacle was first presented in this country, of
                    vessels floating and sailing across the course of the river, while others in the
                    river itself were passing under them. Since that period canal aqueducts have
                    become more common; and many excellent examples are to be found both" in England
                    and Scotland. Of these are the aqueducts over the river Lune, on the Lancaster
                    canal, designed by Rennie, a very excellent and splendid work of five arches,
                    each 72 feet span, and rising 65 feet above the level of the river; and the
                    Kelvin aqueduct, near Glasgow, which conveys the Forth and Clyde canal over the
                    valley of Kelvin, consisting of four arches, each 70 feet span, and rising 70
                    feet above the level of the river. In Plate XLIX. we have given views of three
                    other principal aqueducts, viz. the aqueducts of Pont Cysylte, of Chirk, and of
                    Slateford near Edinburgh. Of these the Pont Cysylte by Mr Telford is justly
                    celebrated for its magnitude, for the simplicity of the design, and the skilful
                    disposition of the parts, combining lightness with strength in a degree seldom
                    attempted. This aqueduct serves to convey the waters of the Ellesmere canal
                    across the Dee and the vale of Llangollen, which it traverses. The channel for
                    the water is made of cast iron, supported on cast iron ribs or arches, and these
                    resting on pillars of stone. The iron being much lighter than stone arches, this
                    is one reason why the pillars have been reduced apparently to such slender
                    dimensions. They are quite strong enough, however, as experience has proved. The
                    whole length of the aqueduct is about 1000 feet, and consists of 19 arches, each
                    45 feet span. The breadth of the pillars at the top is 8 feet, and the height of
                    the four middle ones is 115 feet to the springing. The pillars have a slight
                    taper, the breadth of the middle ones at the base being 15 feet.</p>
                <p>The height from the surface of the water in the Dee to that in the canal was to
                    be 126 feet eight inches. The’ channel for the water consists of cast iron
                    plates, cast with flanches, and these screwed together with bolts; they are
                    represented in the drawing, between the arched ribs and the railing. The lines
                    there show the joinings of the different plates. In order to preserve as much
                    water-way as possible, the channel is made the full width of th <hi
                    rend="subscript"> e</hi> canal and towing path, and the latter projected over
                    one side, and supported inside by posts resting on the bottom of the canal. The
                    aqueduct of Chirk was designed by the same able engineer, and serves also to
                    convey across a valley the waters of the same canal. This aqueduct was the first
                    in which any iron was employed. Hitherto the channel for the waters had been
                    constructed of stone, or partly of stone and partly of clay puddle, which it was
                    generally found very difficult to keep water-tight for a length of time. It was
                    determined, therefore, by Mr Telford to try the effect of cast iron, and to lay
                    it at first only in the bottom. The plates were accordingly laid directly over
                    the sprandril walls, which they served to bind together, and united by flanches
                    and screws. The sides of the channel were built with stone facings and brick
                    hearting laid in water-lime mortar. This plan has succeeded completely, and the
                    quantity of masonry in the aqueduct was thereby greatly reduced. The aqueduct
                    itself is 600 feet long, and 65 feet high above the river, consisting of ten
                    arches, each 42 feet span. The piers are ten feet thick.</p>
                <p>The aqueduct of Slateford serves for conveying the waters of the Edinburgh and
                    Glasgow Union Canal across the valley of the Water of Leith at Slateford. It is
                    an elegant structure, and very similar in the plan to that of Chirk, only that
                    the water-channel is composed entirely, the sides as well as the bottom, of cast
                    iron, which is moreover built in with masonry. It is about 500 feet in length,
                    and consists of eight arches, each 45 feet span; and the height of the canal is
                    about 70 feet above the level of the river. On this canal another aqueduct of
                    the very same construction occurs in crossing the valley of the Almond, and
                    having several more arches. There are, in different parts of the country,
                    various other aqueducts, which might be described; but our limits preclude our
                    enlarging upon them; and it is the less necessary, as, excepting the formation
                    of the water-way, these structures differ nothing in their design or the
                    principle of their construction from ordinary bridges, particularly those that
                    are undertaken not so much with the view of crossing rivers as of raising up the
                    level of the road itself entirely out of the valley,—an object now become of
                    great importance, from the improvements which have taken place within the last
                    half-century on all our roads, and the refined notions which have in consequence
                    begun to prevail as to the rates of travelling, and, what conduces most
                    essentially to this object, the levels of the road. Formerly people were content
                    to traverse slowly all the inequalities of the country through which the road
                    might pass, descending into the valleys, and mounting the steepest acclivities.
                    Now, however, a road is thought imperfect, and quite behind the standard of
                    improvement, unless every rise greater than 1 in 15 or 1 in 20 feet be cut down.
                    In crossing-the valleys, therefore, it is not enough now that we build a bridge
                    in all respects sufficient for crossing the stream itself; we must raise it
                    nearly to a level with the ground on each side of the valley; and this
                    circumstance gives rise to new and very extensive works of this kind, which
                    formerly never would have been thought of. Of these we may just instance the
                    splendid bridge of one arch of 140 feet span, built over the Den Burn at
                    Aberdeen, to form a new access into that t&lt;&gt; <hi rend="superscript">

                    />also the beautiful bridge of Cartland Craigs, built by Mr Telford, over the
                    little stream of the Mouse, on the new road from Glasgow to Carlisle, consisting
                    of three arches 50 feet span, and elevated 130 feet above the bed of the stream.
                    More recently (for in this important department of our domestic economy, which
                    regards the perfecting of the interior communications of the country,
                    improvements seem to be going on, not merely with rapidity, but with an
                    accelerated progression which it is quite wonderful to contemplate) the
                    introduction of railways opens a new and still wider field for the skill and
                    talents of the engineer in the erection of such works. This new and improved
                    species of road, it is well known, must be kept still more nearly on a level
                    than any of the roads of the ordinary construction. Considerable inequalities in
                    these may still be tolerated, but in the railroad they are quite inadmissible,
                    and would defeat the very object of the improvement. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Railway.)</hi> In this respect the railway is somewhat similar to the old Roman
                    aqueducts, and, where the country is low, must in like manner be elevated on a
                    series of arcades. These sort of bridges have received the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Viaducts</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and already we have an
                    extensive one on the Liverpool and Manchester railway, termed the Sankey
                    Viaduct, of nine arches; and numerous others will no doubt be speedily required.
                    But for the principles and mode of construction of these works, as well as of
                    the aqueduct bridges, so far as the arch is concerned, we refer to the articles
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Arch</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Bridge</hi>; and for
