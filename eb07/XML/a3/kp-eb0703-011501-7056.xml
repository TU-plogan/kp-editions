                <p><label type="entry">ANDES</label>. The Andes are distinguished above all. the
                    known mountain chains by their immense extent and their prodigious altitude.
                    They run almost parallel to the west coast of the southern continent of America,
                    at a mean distance of between 100 and 200 miles, rising in some places to the
                    enormous height of 25,000 feet; and stretch from the mouth of the river Atrato,
                    on the isthmus of Darien, in the latitude of 8 degrees north, as far as Cape
                    Pilares, at the outlet of the Straits of Magellan, in the 53d degree of south
                    latitude, a range of at least 4200 miles. They send out, nearly at right angles
                    from their colossal ridge, between the latitudes of 14° and 20° south, three
                    dependent branches, called by the Spaniards <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cordilleras.</hi></p>
                <p>Of these secondary chains, the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> and most northern is
                    that of the coast of Venezuela, which is likewise the highest and narrowest.
                    With an irregular altitude, it bends eastwards from the Atrato, forming the
                    Sierra of Abibé, the mountains of Cauca, and the high Savannahs of Folu, till it
                    reaches the stream of Magdalena, in the province of St Martha. It contracts as
                    it approaches the Gulf of Mexico at Cape Vela; and thence extends to the
                    mountain of Paria, or rather the Galley Point, in the island of Trinidad, where
                    it terminates. This secondary chain attains its greatest known elevation where
                    it rears the snowy summit, or Sierra Nevada, of St Martha and of Merida, the
                    former being nearly 14,000 and the latter above 15,000 feet in altitude. These
                    insulated mountains, covered so near the equator with eternal snow, yet
                    discharging boiling sulphurous water from their sides, are higher than the Peak
                    of Tenerifte, and can be compared only with Mont Blanc. In their descent they
                    leave the Paramo or lofty desert of Rosa and of Mucachi; and on the west side of
                    the lake Maracaibo they form long and very narrow vales, running from south to
                    north, and covered with forests. At Cape Vela the mountain chain divides into
                    two parallel ridges, which form three confined valleys ranging from east to
                    west, and having all the appearance of being the beds of ancient lakes. These
                    ridges, of which the northern is the continuation of the Sierra Nevada of St
                    Martha, and the southern the extension of the snowy summits of Merida, are
                    united again by two arms which seem to have been placed by the hand of nature as
                    dikes to confine the primeval collections of water. The three valleys thus
                    inclosed are remarkable for their elevation above the sea, rising like steps one
                    above another, the eastmost, or that of the Caraccas, being the highest. This
                    plain was found by Humboldt to be elevated 2660 feet, while the basin of Aragua
                    has only 1350 feet in height, and the Llanos, or reedy plains of Monai, spread
                    within 500 or 600 feet above the level of the shore. The lake of the Caraccas
                    appears to have forced a passage for itself through the <hi rend="italic"
                    >quebrada</hi> or cleft of Tipé, while that of Aragua has been gradually
                    dissipated by a slow process of evaporation, leaving some vestiges of its former
                    existence in pools charged with muriate of lime, and in the low islets called
                    <hi rend="italic">Aparecidas.</hi> The medium height of the Cordillera of the
                    coast is about 4000 or 5000 feet; but its loftiest summit, next to the Sierra
                    Nevada of Merida, is the <hi rend="italic">Silla</hi> (or saddle) of the
                    Caraccas, which was visited by Humboldt, and ascertained from barometrical
                    measurement to have an elevation of 8420 feet.. Farther to the eastward the
                    mountain chain becomes suddenly depressed, especially its primitive rocks; the
                    beds of gneiss and mica slate meeting as they advance with accumulations of
                    secondary calcareous substances, which envelope them completely, and rise to <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> a great elevation. The incumbent mass of sandstone,
                    with a calcareous base, extending from <pb break="no" facs="nls:193097069"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-7069-0116"/>Capelluari, forms a detached range of mountains,
                    in which 'no trace of primitive rock is found.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">second</hi> branch, which stretches from the Andes across
                    the American continent, and exhibits a chain of primitive mountains, is named by
                    Humboldt the <hi rend="italic">Cordillera of the Cataracts of Orinoco.</hi> This
                    very enterprising traveller surveyed it over an extent of upwards of 600 miles,
                    from the Black River to the frontiers of the Great Bara; but the rest of the
                    chain is very little known, running through unexplored wilds and regions almost
                    inaccessible, occupied by fierce and independent tribes of savages. It leaves
                    the great trunk between the 3d and 6th degree of southern latitude, and runs
                    eastward from the <hi rend="italic">Paramo</hi> or high desert of Tuquillo and
                    St Martin, and the sources of the Guaviari, rearing the lofty summits of Umama
                    and Ca-navami, and pouring forth the large rivers Meta, Zama, and Ymerida, which
                    form the <hi rend="italic">roudals</hi> or tremendous rapids of Aturé and
                    Maypuré, the only openings existing at present between the interior of the
                    continent and the plain of the Amazons. Beyond these cataracts the chain of
                    mountains again acquires greater elevation and breadth, occupying the vast tract
                    inclosed between the rivers Caura, Cavony, and Padamo, and stretching southward
                    to the boundless forests where the Portuguese settlers gather that potent drug
                    the <hi rend="italic">sarsaparilla.</hi> Farther eastward this chain is not
                    traced, no European or civilized Indian having ever explored the sources of the
                    Orinoco; all access in that quarter being prevented by the ferocity of the
                    Guaicas, a dwarfish but very fair and warlike race, and by the valour of the
                    Guajaribos, a most desperate tribe of cannibals. Beyond these recesses, however,
                    we are made acquainted with the continuation of the chain of the cataracts, by
                    the astonishing journey performed by Don Antonio Santos, who, disguised like a
                    savage, his body naked, and his skin stained of a copper colour, and speaking
                    fluently the several Indian dialects, penetrated from the mouth of the Rio
                    Caronis to the'Lake of Parimé and the Amazons. The range of mountains sinks
                    lower, and contracts its breadth to 200 miles, where it assumes the name of
                    Serrania de Quimeropaca and Pacaraimo. A few degrees farther eastward it spreads
                    out again, and bends south to the Canno Pirara along the Mao, near whose banks
                    appears the Cerro or hill of Ucucuamo, consisting entirely of a very shining and
                    yellow mica slate, which has therefore procured from the credulity of early
                    travellers the magnificent appellation of <hi rend="italic">Dorado</hi> or
                    Golden Mountain. East from the river Essequibo this Cordillera stretches to meet
                    the granitic or gneiss mountains of Dutch and French Guiana, inhabited by
                    confederated bands of negroes and Caribs, but giving birth to the commercial
                    streams of Berbice, Surinam, and Maroni.</p>
                <p>The chain of the cataracts of Orinoco has only a mean height of about 4000 feet
                    above the level of the sea. The greatest elevation occurs where the mountain of
                    Duida rears its enormous mass from the midst of a luxuriant plain, clothed with
                    the tropical productions of palms and ananas, and discharges from its steep
                    sides, about the close of the rainy season, volumes of incessant flames. No one
                    has yet had the resolution or perseverance to climb through the tangling and
                    rampant bushes to its peak, which, measured trigonometrically, gives an altitude
                    of 8465 feet above the sea. The whole mountain group which forms this Cordillera
                    is distinguished by the abrupt descent of its south flank; nor is it less
                    remarkable for containing no rock of secondary formation, or exhibiting any
                    vestige of petrifactions and organic remains. It contains only granite, gneiss,
                    mica slate, and hornblende, without any casing or admixture of sandstone or
                    calcareous matter. <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">third</hi> great branch sent out from the trunk of the
                    Andes is that of the <hi rend="italic">Chiquitos,</hi> which province it
                    traverses, making a sort of semicircular sweep between the parallels of 15 and
                    20 degrees south latitude, and appearing to connect the colossal heights of Peru
                    and Chili with the mountains of Brazil and Paraguay. It supplies the rivers that
                    feed the Maranon on the one side, and the Plata on the other. The structure and
                    disposition, however, of the Cordillera of the Chiquitos still remain almost
                    unknown.</p>
                <p>These grand chains of mountains divide the southern continent of America, from
                    the latitude of 19 to that of 52 degrees, into three immense plains, which on
                    the west side are shut up by the enormous ridge of the Andes, but are all open
                    on the east, and towards the Atlantic Ocean. The most northern is the valley of
                    the Orinoco, consisting of savannahs or level tracts covered with reedy herbage
                    and scattered palms. The next is the plain of the Maranon, which is entirely
                    covered with dense, impenetrable forests. The third and southmost valley is the
                    Pampas, a dead flat of most prodigious expanse, clothed, like that of .the
                    Orinoco, with a coarse, rank herbage, and abandoned to the occupation of
                    countless herds of wild cattle.</p>
                <p>Of these immense plains, the subsoil resembles the composition of the
                    neighbouring mountains. In the valley of the Orinoco, the primitive rock is
                    generally wrapt in a coat of sandstone, with calcareous cement, or covered with
                    calcareous concretions, which betray the vestiges of recent organic remains, but
                    show none of the older impressions, such as the belemnites and ammonites, so
                    common in Europe. The woody plain of Maranon is distinguished by the thinness of
                    its soil, and the total absence of any calcareous ingredients, the granite
                    approaching close to the surface, which is in some places left quite bare over
                    an extent of many furlongs. But the Pampas of Buenos Ayres are covered to a
                    great depth with beds of alluvial depositee, in which the powers of vegetation,
                    fomented by the rays of a burning sun, luxuriate in wanton profusion.</p>
                <p>The lake of Titicaca covers a surface of 16,000 square miles, being in some
                    places 70 or 80’fathoms deep. It has an elevation of 12,800 feet above the sea,
                    and terminates at the mountain Potosi, which rises to 16,000 feet, and is yet
                    covered with the ruins of the ancient Peruvian civilization. Near this centre
                    the volcano of Antiquipa stands, at the height of 17,800 feet, while the double
                    peak of the <hi rend="italic">Nevados,</hi> or snowy Illimani, tower to the
                    enormous elevations of 24,200 and 24,450 feet, or about 3000 feet above the
                    summit of Chimborazo, which was long regarded as the loftiest pinnacle of our
                    globe. But, in the northern extension of the Cordillera, Mount Sorata rears its
                    snowy head, at the stupendous elevation of 25,000 feet.</p>
                <p>In those tropical regions cultivation ascends to very near the limits of
                    perpetual snow. Various prolific crops, and particularly wheat and potatoes, are
                    grown at the height of 14,000 feet above the level of the sea. A considerable
                    population, dispersed in towns or villages, occupy tracts about 1000 feet
                    higher, and enjoy health and vigour in a keen atmosphere, twice as rare as at
                    the level of the sea. The ancient Peruvians had worked some gold mines at the
                    vast altitude of 17,000 feet.</p>
                <p>The disciple of Werner traces with delight, in the majestic features of the
                    American continent, the same order and succession of rocks which the sagacity of
                    that illustrious geologist had discovered in the mountains of Saxony. Granite
                    appears still the oldest material of our globe: to it succeeds the laminated
                    species, or gneiss; then mica slate, containing garnets; next primitive slate,
                    with beds or native alum; now slate mixed with hornblende; above this greenstone
                    or primitive trap, followed by amygdaloid; and last of the series, porphyry
                    slate. Resting or flanked against those primary rocks, beds of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193097082" xml:id="kp-eb0703-7082-0117"/>the older limestone begin to
                    appear, followed by a suite of minerals bearing indications of organic
                    remains—mica slate, hornblende, gypsum, and calcareous sandstone. The only
                    formations which Humboldt did not meet withjn his extensive travels, were those
                    of chalk, roestone, graywacke, topaz rock, and the compound of serpentine with
                    granular limestone which occurs in Asia Minor. The grand ridge of the Andes is
                    everywhere covered with porphyry, basalt, phonolite, and greenstone; which being
                    often broken into columns, appear at a distance like ruined castles, and produce
                    a very striking effect. Near the bottom of that enormous chain, two different
                    sorts of limestone occur; one with a silicious base, inclosing sometimes
                    cinnabar and coal; and another mostly calcareous, and cementing the secondary
                    rocks. These formations are of enormous thickness and elevation. “Beds of coal
                    are found in the neighbourhood of Santa Fé, 8650 feet above the level of the
                    sea; and even at the height of 14,700, near Huanco in Peru. The plains of
                    Bogota, although elevated 9000 feet, are covered with gypsum, sandstone,
                    shell-limestone, and even in some parts with rock salt. Fossil shells, which in
                    the old continent have not been discovered higher than the summits of the
                    Pyrenees, or 11,700 feet above the sea, were observed in Peru, near Micuipampa,
                    at the height of 12,800 feet; and again at that of 14,120, beside Huancavelica,
                    where sandstone also appears. The basalt of Pichincha, near the city of Quito,
                    has an elevation of 15,500 feet, while the top of the Schneckoppe in Silesia is
                    only 4225 feet above the sea—the highest point in Germany where that species of
                    rock occurs. On the other hand, granite, which in Europe crowns the loftiest
                    mountains, is not found in the American continent above the height of 11,500
                    feet. It is scarcely known at all in the provinces of Quito and Peru. The frozen
                    summits of Chimborazo, Cayambé, and Antisana, Consist entirely of porphyry,
                    which, on the flanks of the Andes, forms a mass of 10,000 or 12,000 feet in
                    depth. The sandstone near Cuença has a thickness of 5000 feet, and the
                    stupendous mass of pure quartz on the west of Caxamarca measures perpendicularly
                    9600 feet. It is likewise a remarkable fact, that the porphyry of those
                    mountains very frequently contains hornblende, but never quartz, and seldom
                    mica.</p>
                <p>“The central Andes are rich beyond conception in all the metals, lead only
                    excepted. One of the most curious ones in the bowels of those mountains is the
                    <hi rend="italic">pacos,</hi> a compound of clay, oxyde of iron, and the muriate
                    of silver with native silver. The mines of Mexicoand Peru, so long the objects
                    of-⅛envy and admiration, far from being yet exhausted, promise, under a liberal
                    and improved system, to become more productive than ever. But nature has blended
                    with those hidden treasures the active elements of destruction. The whole chain
                    of the Andes is subject to the most terrible earthquakes. From Cotopaxi to the
                    South Sea no fewer than forty volcanoes are constantly burning; some of them,
                    especially the lower ones, ejecting lava, and others discharging the muriate of
                    ammonia, scorified basalt, and porphyry, enormous quantities of water, and
                    especially <hi rend="italic">moya,</hi> or clay mixed with sulphur and
                    carbonaceous matter. Eternal snow invests their sides, and forms a barrier to
                    the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Near that confine the torpor of vegetation is
                    marked by dreary wastes.” <hi rend="italic">(Edinb. Review,</hi> vol. XV. p.
                    233.)</p>
                <p>We may subjoin that, near Quito, the liquid mud ejected by the volcanoes often
                    involves myriads of small dead fish. In some parts, the mountains, like the
                    fabled cave of Aeolus, seem at times to let out their imprisoned air, and
                    produce such furious gusts of wind as to sweep every thing before them to a vast
                    distance. In other districts, the efforts of the contending éléments are
                    betrayed, especially during the rainy season, by a doleful moaning' noise, or
                    hollow and portentous groans, enough to cast a darker shade on the gloom of
                    superstition, and to fill the imagination of the remotest settler with secret
                    awe and dread.</p>
                <p>A person who for the first time climbs the mountains of Switzerland is astonished
                    to witness, in the space perhaps of a few hours, so rapid a change of climate,
                    and such a wide range of vegetable productions. He may begin his ascent from the
                    midst of warm vineyards, and pass through a succession of chesnuts, oaks, and
                    beeches, till he gains the elevation of the hardy pines and stunted birches, or
                    treads on Alpine pastures, extending to the border of perpetual snow. But within
                    the tropics every thing is formed on a grander scale. The boundary of permanent
                    congelation is 7500 feet higher at the equator than at the mean latitude of 45
                    degrees. Under a burning sun ananas and plantains grow profusely near the shore;
                    oranges and limes occur a little higher; then succeed fields of ιnaize and
                    luxuriant wheat; and the traveller has actually reached the high plain of Mexico
                    or the still loftier vale of Quito, before he finds a climate analogous to that
                    of Bordeaux or of Geneva. Now only commences the series of plants which inhabit
                    the central parts of Europe.</p>
                <p>But the very magnitude of the Andes appears to have the effect of diminishing the
                    impressions of awe and wonder which the sight of them so powerfully excites. The
                    country on which they rest is heaved to such a vast altitude above the sea, that
                    the relative elevation of their summits becomes diminished in comparison with
                    that of the surrounding amphitheatre. The majestic forms of Chimborazo,
                    Cotopaxi, and Antisana, though 6000 feet higher than Mont Blanc, and clothed,
                    like it, with eternal snow, seem to a traveller scarcely more sublime from the
                    plains of Riobomba and Quito, than the celebrated mountain when viewed from the
                    vale of Chamouni. It requires some time for his imagination to expand itself to
                    the new scale of grandeur.</p>
                <p>The central Andes, with all their magnificence, want a feature which, in the
                    higher latitudes, contributes so much to the beauty and sublimity of the Alpine
                    scenery. They have no vestige whatever of <hi rend="italic">glaciers,</hi> those
                    icy belts dropping from the limits of congelation, and spreading in concrete
                    sheets, or hanging in disjointed columns fantastically thrown, which occur alike
                    in the heart of Switzerland and on the northern shores of Norway and Lapland.
                    This defect is evidently owing to the almost uniform temperature which prevails
                    near the equator. In those torrid regions the days are constantly of the same
                    length, and the sun shines through the whole year with very nearly equal force.
                    The limit of perpetual congelation is hence marked on the sides of the mountains
                    of Quito with singular precision. The temperature decreases regularly in
                    proportion as one ascends them, till at a certain altitude it comes to the point
                    of freezing, where the permanent field of snow begins to appear, defined with an
                    almost unvarying border. But in the higher latitudes the sun remains during the
                    summer so long above the horizon, and shines with such augmented force, that the
                    heat of the atmosphere, and consequently of the surface of the ground, suffers a
                    wide alteration in the different seasons. To the general investure of snow is
                    therefore annexed every winter a zone of considerable breadth, which again
                    softens and partly melts away during the continuance of the summer months. This
                    alternate thawing and freezing occasions the production of glaciers, by
                    converting successively the lower detached masses of snow in the precipitous
                    flanks of the mountains, into a collection of broken and intermingled pillars of
                    translucid ice.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193097095" xml:id="kp-eb0703-7095-0118"/>
                <p>For the same reason, the Andes, though torn by flaming 'volcanoes, and convulsed
                    by frequent and terrible earthquakes, are exempt from those <hi rend="italic"
                    >avalanches</hi> and <hi rend="italic">eboulements</hi> which in Switzerland and
                    other mountainous parts of Europe often bury the helpless traveller in a torrent
                    of snow, and batter down whole villages by the sudden discharge of a shower of
                    rocks. Under the equator the variation of temperature throughout the year is so
                    small as not to disturb the solidity of the vast collections of snow; but on the
                    flanks of the Alps or Pyrenees, as the heat of the summer increases, portions of
                    the upper field of snow become loosened, and, sliding down, put other masses
                    likewise in motion, till spreading wider, and gaining accelerated force, the
                    whole tide precipitates itself to the plain, sweeping all before it. Such is the
                    accident of an <hi rend="italic">avalanche</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> °but the
                    occurrence of an <hi rend="italic">eboulement,</hi> though less frequent, is
                    more tremendous. When the alternation of frost and thaw detaches a mass of rock,
                    it rolls down the side of the mountain with resistless fury, shivering into
                    fragments and tearing every thing opposed to it, overwhelming men, cattle, and
                    houses, in one common heap of ruins.</p>
                <p>But the Andes are distinguished from the chains of the European mountains by
                    frightful <hi rend="italic">quebradas</hi> or perpendicular rents, which form
                    very narrow vales of immense depth, whose terrific walls, fringed below with
                    luxuriant trees and shrubs, seem to lift their naked and barren heads to the
                    distant skies. The noted crevices of Chota and Cutaco are nearly a mile deep,
                    the former measuring 4950, and the latter 4300 feet, in a vertical descent. The
                    task of crossing such tremendous gullies is often a work of infinite toil and
                    extreme danger. In those mountainous countries travellers are accustomed to
                    perform their journeys sitting in chairs fastened to the backs of men called <hi
                    rend="italic">cargueros</hi> or <hi rend="italic">carriers.</hi> These porters
                    are mulattoes, and sometimes whites, of great bodily strength and action, who
                    will climb along the face of precipices, bearing loads of twelve and fourteen,
                    or even eighteen stone. The <hi rend="italic">cargueros</hi> lead a vagabond
                    life, exposed to incredible fatigue, but recommended to them by its irregular
                    course. Often those wretched men toil over mountains for the space of eight or
                    nine hours every day, till, like beasts of burthen, they have their backs chafed
                    and made quite raw with the load. In this deplorable condition they are not
                    unfrequently abandoned by unfeeling travellers, and left alone to sicken, pine,
                    or die in the forests. Yet their earnings would appear inadequate to such
                    violent and overpowering exertions, since they receive scarcely three guineas
                    for performing the journey from lbague to Cartago, which requires fifteen, and
                    perhaps twenty-five or thirty days.</p>
                <p>The Icononzo, remarkable for its natural bridges, is a small <hi rend="italic"
                    >quebrada</hi> or cleft of the mountains, through which flows the river of the
                    Summa Paz, descending from the highest upland desert. The rocks consist of two
                    different kinds of sandstone, the one extremely compact, and the other of a
                    slaty texture, divided into their horizontal strata. The rent was probably
                    caused by an earthquake, which the harder portion of the stony mass had
                    resisted, and now connects the upper part of the chasm. This natural arch is 50
                    feet long, 40 broad, and 8 feet thick at the middle. Its height is about 300
                    feet above the surface of the torrent, which has a medium depth of twenty feet.
                    About 60 feet below the natural bridge another smaller arch occurs, composed of
                    three slanting blocks of stone wedged together, which had probably fallen from
                    the roof at the same instant of time, and struck against the sides of the
                    crevice in their descent.</p>
                <p>The natural bridge of Icononzo has perhaps no counterpart in the old world; but
                    the writer of this article had the pleasure of seeing, in early life, a similar
                    phenomenon scarcely inferior to it in the United States of Arne-rica. We allude
                    to the famous arch described by Mr Jefferson, which crosses the Cedar creek in
                    Rockbridge county, about a hundred miles beyônd the Blue Ridge, in the higher
                    district of Virginia. The divided rock is a pure limestone, leaving a chasm
                    about 90 feet wide, of which the walls are 230 feet high, sprinkled with verdant
                    bushes, and enamelled with gay flowers, among which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >aquilegia</hi> is conspicuous. This bridge, viewed from a little distance
                    below, has all the appearance of a Gothic arch; and is of such solidity, that
                    loaded waggons used formerly to pass along it, till a more convenient line of
                    road was formed.</p>
                <p>In some places the natives of Peru connect the clefts of their mountains by
                    pendulous bridges thrown fearlessly across, and suspended from both sides of a
                    gap. They are composed of ropes made of the tough fibres of the <hi
                    rend="italic">agave,</hi> hanging in a gently sloping curve, and covered with
                    reeds or canes, with occasionally a narrow border of basket-work. The intrepid
                    Indian, regardless of the horrors of the unfathomed abyss which yawns from
                    below, commits himself to his frail and floating arch, and swiftly glides along
                    its bending curvature, till he gains the opposite bank.</p>
                <p>The Andes likewise give rise to waterfalls of immense height and amazing force.
                    The cataract of Tequendama, considered in all its circumstances, exceeds any
                    other in the known world. The basin which feeds its streams is the vast plain of
                    Bogota, 7465 feet above the level of the sea, encircled completely with lofty
                    mountains, except where the water, aided probably by the concussion of an
                    earthquake, has cut for itself a narrow passage. The river Funcha, swelled by
                    numerous feeders, gradually contracts its channel to the breadth of about 40
                    feet, and then gathering augmented force, dashes at two bounds from a
                    perpendicular height of near 600 feet into a dark gulf. Owing to the excessive
                    rapidity and depth of its current, it must discharge a prodigious volume of
                    water, which quite stuns the ear by the roar of its crash; while it raises
                    enormous clouds of thick spray and vapour, that continually bedew, and perhaps
                    quicken, the vegetation of the adjacent grounds. Every thing conspire^s to exalt
                    the beauty and grandeur of. the scenery. “Independent of the height and mass of
                    the column of water,” says Humboldt, “the figure of the landscape, and the
                    aspect of the rocks, it is the luxuriant form of the trees and herbaceous
                    plants, their distribution into thickets, the contrast of those craggy
                    precipices, and the freshness of vegetation, which stamp a peculiar character on
                    these great scenes of nature.” The transition from a temperate to a warm climate
                    is rapid and surprising. The plain of Bogota bears rich crops of wheat, then
                    succeed oaks and elms, intermingled with aralias, bigonias, and the yellow-bark
                    trees; but immediately below the cataract a few palms appear, as if it were to
                    mark the advance to a sultry soil.</p>
                <p>A lively idea of the character and grand features of the Andes may be conceived
                    from the account which the celebrated Humboldt has given of his journey across
                    that majestic chain. Our readers will be glad to peruse it in the author’s own
                    words.</p>
                <p>“The mountain of Quindiu, in the latitude of 4° 36', is considered as the most
                    difficult passage in the Cordilleras of the Andes. It is a thick uninhabited
                    forest, which, in the finest season, cannot be traversed in less than ten or
                    twelve days. Not even a hut is to be seen, nor can any means of subsistence be
                    found. Travellers, at all time <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> °f the year,
                    furnish themselves with a month’s provision, since it often happens that, by the
                    melting of the snows, and the sudden swell of the torrents, they find themselves
                    so circumstanced that they can descend neither on the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193097108" xml:id="kp-eb0703-7108-0119"/>side of Cartago nor that of
                    Ibague. The highest point 'of the road, the Garito del Paramo, is 11,500 feet
                    above the level of the sea. As the foot of the mountain, towards the banks of
                    the Cauca, is only 3150 feet, the climate there is generally mild and temperate.
                    The pathway, which forms the passage of the Cordilleras, is only 12 or 15 inches
                    in breadth, and has the appearance, in several places, of a gallery dug and left
                    open to the sky. In this part of the Andes, as almost in every other, the rock
                    is covered with a thick stratum of clay. The streamlets which flow down the
                    mountains have hollowed out gullies about 20 feet deep. Along these crevices,
                    which are full of mud, the traveller is forced to grope his passage, the
                    darkness of which is increased by the thick vegetation that covers the opening
                    above. The oxen, which are the beasts of burden commonly used in this country,
                    can scarcely force their way through these galleries, some of which are more
                    than a mile in length; and if perchance the traveller meets them in one of these
                    passages, he finds no means of avoiding them but by turning back and climbing
                    the earthen wall which borders the crevice, and keeping himself suspended by
                    laying hold of the roots which penetrate to this depth from the surface of the
                    ground.</p>
                <p>“We traversed the mountain of Quindiu in the month of October 1801, on foot,
                    followed by twelve oxen, which carried our collections and instruments, amidst a
                    deluge of rain, to which we were exposed during the last three or four days, in
                    our descent on the western side of the Cordilleras. The road passes through a
                    country full of bogs, and covered with bamboos. Our shoes were so torn by the
                    prickles which shoot out from the' roots of these gigantic gramina, that we were
                    forced, like all other travellers who dislike being carried on men’s backs, to
                    go barefooted. This circumstance, the continual humidity, the length of the
                    passage, the muscular force required to tread in a thick and muddy clay, the
                    necessity of fording deep torrents of icy water, render this journey extremely
                    fatiguing; but, however painful, it is accompanied by none of those dangers with
                    which the credulity of the people alarms travellers. The road is narrow, but the
                    places where it skirts the precipices are very rare.</p>
                <p>“When travellers reach Ibague, and prepare to cross the forests of Quindiu, they
                    pluck, in the neighbouring mountains, several hundred leaves of the vijao, a
                    plant of the family of the bananas, which forms a genus approaching to the
                    Thalia, and which must not be confounded with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heliconia</hi><hi rend="italic">Bibai.</hi> These leaves, which are membranous
                    and silky, like those of the <hi rend="italic">Musa,</hi> are of an oval form,
                    two feet long and 16 inches broad. Their lower surface is a silvery white, and
                    covered with a farinaceous substance, which falls off in scales. This peculiar
                    varnish enables them to resist the rain during a long time. In gathering these
                    leaves, an incision is made in the middle rib, which is the continuation of the
                    foot-stalk; and this serves as a hook to suspend them when the movable roof is
                    formed. On taking it down, they are spread out, and carefully rolled up in a
                    cylindrical bundle. It requires about an hundredweight of leaves to cover a hut
                    large enough to hold six or eight persons. When the travellers reach a spot in
                    the midst of the forests where the ground is dry, and where they propose to pass
                    the night, the cargueros lop a few branches from the trees, with which they make
                    a tent. In a few minutes this slight timber-work is divided into squares, by the
                    stalks of some climbing plant, or the threads of the agave placed in parallel
                    lines 12 or 13 inches from each other. The vijao leaves meanwhile have been
                    unrolled, and are now spread over the above work, <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi>
                    θ <hi rend="superscript"> as</hi>, <hi rend="superscript"> t0 cover</hi> it like
                    ’ the tiles of a house. These huts, us hastily built, are cool and commodious.
                    If,· during the night, the traveller feels the rain, he points out the spot
                    where it enters, and a leaf is sufficient to obviate the inconvenience. We
                    passed several days in the valley of Boquia, under one of those leafy tents,
                    which was perfectly dry amidst violent and incessant rains.”</p>
