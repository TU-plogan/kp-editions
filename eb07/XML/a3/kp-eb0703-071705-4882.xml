                <p><label type="entry">ASSYRIA</label>, an ancient kingdom of Asia, concerning the
                    commencement, duration, and extent of which historians are not agreed. Ctesias
                    and Diodorus Siculus describe the Assyrian monarchy, under Ninus and Semiramis,
                    as of very great extent; but the silence of Homer, and the brief Statements of
                    Herodotus, are not easily reconciled with this opinion; and there is no mention
                    of the greatness of Assyria in the history of the judges and succeeding kings of
                    Israel, though during that period the latter kingdom was oppressed and enslaved
                    by different powers. According to Ptolemy, Assyria was bounded on the north by
                    Armenia Major, on the west by the Tigris, on the south by Susiana, and on the
                    east by Media; but the name is generally used in a more comprehensive sense, so
                    as to include Mesopotamia, and sometimes even Babylonia and Chaldea. The most
                    common account of the origin and revolutions of the Assyrian monarchy is the
                    following:—The founder of it was Ashur, the second son of Shem, who, removing
                    out of Shinar, either by the appointment of Nimrod or to elude the fury of a
                    tyrant, conducted a large body of adventurers into Assyria, and laid the
                    foundation of Nineveh (Gen. X. 11). These events happened not long after Nimrod
                    had established the Chaldean monarchy, and fixed his residence at Babylon. The
                    Persian historians suppose that the kings of Persia of the first dynasty were
                    the same with the kings of Assyria, of whom Zohah or Nimrod was the founder of
                    Babel. It does not, however, appear that Nimrod reigned in Assyria. The kingdoms
                    of Babylon and Assyria were originally distinct and separate (Micah V. 6); and
                    in this state they remained until Ninus conquered Babylon and made it tributary
                    to the Assyrian empire. Ninus, the successor of Ashur (Gen. x. 11. Diod. Sic.
                    lib. 1), seized on Chaldea after the death of Nimrod, and united the kingdoms of
                    Assyria and Babylon. This great prince is said to have subdued Asia, Persia,
                    Media, Egypt, and other countries. If he did so, the effects of his conquests
                    were of no duration; for in the days of Abraham we do not find that any of the
                    neighbouring kingdoms were subject to Assyria. He was succeeded by Semiramis, a
                    princess of a heroic mind; bold, enterprising, fortunate; but of whom many
                    fabulous things have been recorded. It appears, however, that there were two
                    princesses of the same name, who flourished at very different periods. Whether
                    there was an uninterrupted series of kings from Ninus to Sardanapalus or not, is
                    still a question. Some suspicion has arisen that the list which Ctesias has
                    given of the Assyrian kings is not genuine; for many names in it are of Persian,
                    Egyptian, and Grecian, extraction. Nothing memorable has been recorded
                    concerning the successors of Ninus and Semiramis. Of that effeminate race of
                    princes it is barely said that they ascended the throne, lived in indolence, and
                    died in their palace at Nineveh. Diodorus (lib. ii.) relates, that, in the reign
                    of Teutames, the Assyrians, solicited by Priam their vassal, sent to the Trojans
                    a supply of 20,000 foot and 200 chariots, under the command of Memnon, son of
                    Tithonus president of Persia. But the truth of his relation is rendered more
                    than doubtful by the accounts of other writers. Sardanapalus was the last of the
                    ancient Assyrian kings. Contemning his indolent and voluptuous course, of life,
                    Arbaces, governor of Media, withdrew his allegiance, and rose up in rebellion
                    against him. He was encouraged in this revolt by the advice and assistance of
                    Belesis, a Chaldean priest, who engaged the Babylonians to follow the example of
                    the Medes. These powerful provinces, aided by the Persians and other allies, who
                    despised the effeminacy or dreaded the tyranny of their .Assyrian lords,
                    attacked the empire on all sides. Their most vigorous efforts were in the
                    beginning unsuccessful. Firm and determined, however, in their opposition, they
                    at length prevailed, defeated the Assyrian army, besieged Sardanapalus in his
                    capital, which they demolished, and became masters of the empire, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 821.</p>
                <p>After the death of Sardanapalus the Assyrian empire was divided into three
                    kingdoms, viz. the Median, Assyrian, and Babylonian. Arbaces retained the
                    supreme power and authority, and fixed his residence at Ecbatana, in Media. He
                    nominated governors in Assyria and Babylon, who were honoured with the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">kings,</hi> while they remained subject and tributary to the
                    Median monarchs. Belesis received the government of Babylon as the reward of his
                    services, and Pul was intrusted with that of Assyria. The Assyrian governor
                    gradually enlarged the boundaries of his kingdom. He invaded Israel, and
                    compelled the usurper Menahem to relinquish the independency of his kingdom, and
                    pay 1000 talents of silver. It is probable that other nations submitted to the
                    power of his arms. The Syrians were either propitiated by an alliance, or
                    reduced by compulsion, to allow his army to cross their country on his invasion
                    of Israel, for through it he must have marched. On Nabonasser he bestowed the
                    sovereignty of Babylon, and left his elder son Tiglath-pileser heir of his
                    Assyrian dominions. This prince also invaded Israel, and carried more than one
                    of the ten tribes captive to Assyria. The dominions of Ahaz king of Judah being
                    invaded by the confederate hosts of the kings of Israel and Syria, that prince
                    despoiled the ‘temple of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104895"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-4895-0718"/>its gold and silver, and, along with the treasure
                    of his palace, purchased the support of Tiglath-pileser, who, entering the
                    Syrian dominions, vanquished and slew their monarch, and fulfilled the
                    predictions of the prophets Isaiah and Amos, by bringing that ancient kingdom to
                    an end. Tiglath-pileser died in the midst of his career of victory, and was
                    succeeded by Shalmaneser, who carried the war into the dominions of Hoshea king
                    of Israel, whom he reduced to submission, imposing an annual tribute upon the
                    kingdom. Hoshea, in attempting to shake off this yoke, again brought upon
                    himself the vengeance of Shalmaneser, who once more subjected the country, and
                    laid siege to Samaria, which capitulated after a defence of three years. Hoshea
                    was put in chains and thrown into prison, and the inhabitants were led into
                    captivity. Hezekiah, king of Judah, also set at defiance the power of Assyria by
                    refusing tribute; but he chose the time for this revolt with greater judgment
                    than Hoshea. The Assyrians were at that period engaged in an unsuccessful war
                    with the Tyrians, during the prosecution of which Shalmaneser died, and was
                    succeeded by Sennacherib, who invaded Judah; upon which Hezekiah, to purchase
                    peace, sent him all the gold and silver with which the temple, as well as his
                    own house, was decorated. The treaty, however, was no sooner concluded than it
                    was trampled upon by Sennacherib, who sent an army to besiege Jerusalem. But the
                    leaders, while haranguing the people who were upon the walls, blasphemed against
                    God, for which, as the sacred historian informs us, they were signally punished,
                    185,000 of the Assyrians being cut off in one night by the angel of the Lord.
                    This terrible destruction forced him back to his own dominions, where he
                    exercised such tyranny over his subjects that he was assassinated by two of his
                    own sons. Esarhaddon, his third son, ascended the throne, and extended the
                    Assyrian dominions by the conquest of Babylon, Israel, and Syria, and the
                    subjugation of Judah, Egypt and Ethiopia. After the death of Esar-haddon only a
                    few princes appear to have ascended the throne of Assyria, and the kingdom at
                    last was split, and annexed to those of Media and Babylon. Several tributary
                    princes afterwards reigned in Nineveh; but no particular account of them is
                    found in the annals of ancient nations. We hear no more of the kings of Assyria,
                    but of those of Babylon. Cyaxares king of Media assisted Nebuchadnezzar king of
                    Babylon in the siege of Nineveh, which they took and destroyed <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 606. The Chaldean or Babylonish kingdom was
                    transferred to the Medes after the reign of Nabonadius, son of Evilme-rodach,
                    and grandson of Nebuchadnezzar. He is styled Belshazzar in the sacred records,
                    and was conquered by Cyrus <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 538.</p>
