                <p><label type="entry">ANTONINUS</label> Pius, a celebrated Roman emperor, was born
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> D. 86, at Lanuvium in Italy. His family had long
                    maintained the honour of the house of Nismes in Gaul, from whence they had
                    descended. Both his father and grandfather had held the office of consul. Arius
                    Antoninus, his maternal grandfather, by his amiable disposition and love of
                    literature had acquired an eminent character, and was very intimate with Pliny
                    the younger. Under him the young Titus, after his father’s death, completed his
                    education. His character, On arriving at the age of maturity, manifested itself
                    in the most promising manner. To an improved understanding, a virtuous heart, a
                    mild and dignified character, and a noble eloquence, he joined a happy
                    physiognomy. Simple in his taste, and guided by temperance in all his actions
                    and sentiments, he was entirely free from all affectation and pomposity.</p>
                <p>In the year 120, among the many public honours which his birth and connections
                    gave him a claim to, he was elevated to the high post of consul, and was
                    afterwards appointed by Adrian to be one of the four consulars between whom the
                    supreme power of Italy was divided. Becoming in his turn proconsul of Asia, he
                    acquitted himself with such reputation that he even excelled his grandfather
                    Arius, who had formerly enjoyed that high trust. Returning from Asia, he was not
                    only received into the favour, but likewise the confidence and council of
                    Adrian, and was always disposed to act with lenity. He married Annia Faustina,
                    the daughter of Annius Verus, whose character was far from being untaxed with
                    reproach; but his lenient disposition induced him to avoid public scandal, and
                    he behaved towards his aged father-in-law with the most becoming respect. Two
                    sons and two daughters were the fruits of this marriage. The sons died when they
                    were young, and the eldest daughter, who was married to Lamia Sylvanus, died
                    when Titus proceeded towards his Asiatic government. Faustina, the youngest,
                    married Marcus Aurelius, who was afterwards emperor.</p>
                <p>After the death of Verus, Adrian resolving to adopt Antoninus, he was induced to
                    accept of the succession to so important a charge as the Roman empire, although
                    with a considerable degree of reluctance, and was accordingly nominated by
                    Adrian in February 25, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 138, in the presence of
                    the council of the chief senators; and he at the same time created him his
                    colleague in performing the proconsular and tribunitial duties. Extending his
                    plans of adoption still farther, Adrian caused Antoninus to adopt the son of
                    Verus, then seven years of age, and Marcus Annius, afterwards named Aurelius,
                    then seventeen years of age, a relation of Adrian’s, and nephew to his own wife.
                    The dutiful and merited attention which Antoninus bestowed on Adrian during the
                    last months of his illness gives a very high idea of his character. On July 10,
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> D. 138, he succeeded to the empire amidst the
                    universal acclamations of the senate and people, who anticipated in his
                    well-tried virtues that happiness which a good and wise sovereign is able to
                    bestow upon his subjects.</p>
                <p>The Roman world enjoyed such tranquillity under his reign that it affords few
                    materials for history; yet it is to be regretted that Capitolinus is the only
                    historian from whom any direct information can be received concerning this
                    peaceful period, and he is none of the most perspicuous. It however appears that
                    the usual honours and titles, together with the addition of the surname of Pius,
                    which both his conduct and zeal in defending and honou: ing the memory of his
                    predecessor united to suggest, were willingly conferred upon him by the senate.
                    In the beginning of his reign there were several conspiracies formed against
                    him; but this only afforded him an instance of signalizing his clemency, which
                    he did in the most striking manner. Although he was unable to prevent justice
                    from taking its due course against the ringleaders, he prohibited the
                    prosecution of their accom plices, and took the son of Attilius, one of the
                    principal conspirators, under his protection. Various commotions were raised in
                    several parts of the empire; but by the vigilance of his lieutenants these were
                    easily quelled. The incursions of the Brigantes in Britain were restrained, and
                    a new wall which was built to the north of that of Adrian, from the mouth of the
                    Esk to that of Tweed, and which was called the <hi rend="italic">Wall of
                    Antoninus,</hi> was fixed as the boundary of the Roman province in Britain. The
                    reign of Antoninus, upon the whole, was singularly peaceful, and realized a
                    saying of Scipio, that “he preferred saving the life of one citizen, to
                    destroying a thousand enemies.”</p>
                <p>Jurisprudence was to this emperor, as it was to his predecessor, an interesting
                    subject for improvement; and several decrees which he issued display his
                    commendable, spirit of equity. The natural consequence of this equity was, that
                    Antoninus acquired a reputation and fame which no military achievements could
                    have conferred; and his friendship was courted by the neighbouring princes.</p>
                <p>There is scarcely a blot to be found to tarnish his cha-' racter; and frugality,
                    modesty, and harmless amusement continued to employ his private hours. In the
                    managt ment of his complicated business he was exact to such a degree, that it
                    was even ridiculed by some; but he fount the daily advantage of this accuracy.
                    The growing virtue' of Marcus Aurelius soon drew his attention after he ŧs
                    cended the throne, and having given him his daughter ir marriage, he declared
                    him Caesar. Nor was he mistaken in his choice; for Aurelius acted with the
                    utmost fidelity) and affection amid all the honours that he continued to confer
                    upon him. Enjoying this large share of domestic bliss, in the 75th year of his
                    life he was seized with a fever, at his favourite country-seat of Lori.
                    Convinced of his approaching fate, he convened the principal officers of the
                    state, and confirmed his election of Aurelius, and gave him the imperial
                    ensigns. A delirium ensued, in an interval of which he gave the watchword <hi
                    rend="italic">AEquanimiteSì</hi> and calmly resigned his breath in the 23d year
                    of his reign. His ashes were consigned to the tomb of Adrian, and divine honours
                    paid to his memory. He was universally regretted, and succeeding emperors bore
                    his name as a badge of honour. The senate and his successor erected a sculptured
                    pillar to his memory, which is still shown to strangers as one of the chief
                    ornaments of Rome.</p>

                    rend="italic">Alarcus Aurelius,</hi> a very eminent Roman emperor, born at Rome
                    on the 26th of April <pb break="no" facs="nls:193099084?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-9084-0271"/> in the 121st year of the Christian era. He was
                    called by 'several names till he was admitted into the Aurelian family, when he
                    took that of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. Adrian, upon the death of Cejonius
                    Commodus, turned his eyes upon Marcus Aurelius; but, as he was not then 18 years
                    of age, and consequently too young for so important a station, he fixed upon
                    Antoninus Pius, whom he adopted, upon condition that he should likewise adopt
                    Marcus Aurelius. The year after this adoption, Adrian appointed him questor,
                    though he had not yet attained the age prescribed by the law. After the death of
                    Adrian, Aurelius married Faustina, the daughter of Antoninus Pius, by whom he
                    had several children. In the year 139 he was invested with new honours by the
                    emperor Pius, in which he behaved in such a manner as endeared him to that
                    prince and the whole people.</p>
                <p>Upon the death of Pius, which happened in the year 161, he was obliged by the
                    senate to take upon him <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> the government, in the
                    management of which he took Lucius Verus as his colleague. Dion Cassius says
                    that he was induced to do this on account of his ill state of health, and that
                    he might have leisure to pursue his studies; Lucius being of a strong, vigorous
                    constitution, and consequently more fit for the fatigues of war. The same day he
                    took upon him the name of Antoninus, which he gave likewise to Verus his
                    colleague, and betrothed his daughter Lucilla to him. The two emperors went
                    afterwards to the camp, where, after having performed the funeral rites of Pius,
                    they pronounced each of them a panegyric to his memory. They discharged the
                    government in a very amicable manner. It is said that soon after Antoninus had
                    performed the apotheosis of Pius, petitions were presented to him by the pagan
                    priests, philosophers, and governors of provinces, in order to excite him to
                    persecute the Christians, which he rejected with indignation, and interposed his
                    authority for their protection, by writing a letter to the common assembly of
                    Asia, then held at Ephesus. The happiness which the empire began to enjoy under
                    these two emperors was interrupted, in the year 162, by a dreadful inundation of
                    the Tiber, which destroyed a vast number of cattle, and occasioned a famine at
                    Rome. This calamity was followed by the Parthian war; and at the same time the
                    Catti ravaged Germany and Rhaetia. Lucius Verus went in person to oppose the
                    Parthians; and Antoninus remained at Rome, where his presence was necessary.</p>
                <p>During this war with the Parthians, about the year 163 or 164, Antoninus sent his
                    daughter Lucilla to Verus, she having been betrothed to him, and attended her
                    as-far as Brundusium. He intended to conduct her to Syria; but it having been
                    insinuated by some persons that his design of going into the East was to claim
                    the honour of having finished the Parthian war, he returned to Rome. The Romans
                    having gained a victory over the Parthians, who were obliged to abandon
                    Mesopotamia, the two emperors triumphed over them at Rome in the year 166, and
                    were honoured with the title of <hi rend="italic">Fathers of their country.</hi>
                    This year was fatal, on account of a terrible pestilence which spread itself
                    over the whole world, and a famine under which Rome laboured. It was likewise in
                    this year that the Marcomanni, and many other people of Germany, took up arms
                    against the. Romans; but the two emperors, having marched in person against
                    them, obliged the Germans to sue for peace. The war, however, was renewed the
                    year following, and the two emperors marched again in person; but Lucius Verus
                    was seized with an apoplectic fit, and died at Altinum. The Romans were now
                    defeated with great slaughter; and the emperor, not choosing to burden his
                    subjects with new taxes, exposed to sale the furniture of the palace, the gold
                    and silver plate belonging to the crown, and his wife’s rich garments
                    embroidered with gold, and a curious collection of pearls, which Adrian had
                    purchased during his long progress through the provinces of the empire, and was
                    called <hi rend="italic">Adrian’s cabinet.</hi></p>
                <p>In the year 170 Antoninus made vast preparations against the Germans, and carried
                    on the war with great vigour. During this war, in 174, a very extraordinary
                    event is said to have happened, which, according to Dion Cassius, was as
                    follows: Antoninus’s army being blocked up by the Quadi in a very
                    disadvantageous place, where there was no possibility of procuring water, and
                    being worn out with fatigue and wounds, oppressed with heat and thirst, and
                    incapable of retiring or engaging the enemy, in an instant the sky was covered
                    with clouds, and there fell a vast quantity of rain. The Roman army were about
                    to quench their thirst when the enemy came upon them with such fury, that they
                    must certainly have been defeated, had it not been for a shower of hail,
                    accompanied with a storm of thunder and lightning, which fell upon the enemy
                    without the least annoyance to the Romans, who by this means gained the
                    victory.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Pagans, as
                    well as Christians, according to Mr Tiilemont (art. xvi. p. 621), have
                    acknowledged the truth of this prodigy, but have greatly differed as to the
                    cause of such a miraculous event, the former ascribing it, some to one magician
                    and some to another. In.Antoninus’s pillar the glory is ascribed to Jupiter the
                    god of rain and thunder. But the Christians affirmed that God granted this
                    favour at the prayer of the Christian soldiers in the Roman army, who are said
                    to have composed the twelfth or Meli- ⅛ne legion; and, as a mark of distinction,
                    we are told that they received the tit le of the <hi rend="italic">Thundering

                    Thundering Legion, which occasioned Mr Whiston to publish an answer in 1726,
                    entitled, <hi rend="italic">Of the Thundering Legion; or, oĵ tne Miraculous
                    Deliverance of Marcus Antoninus and his Army upon the Prayers of the
                    Christians.</hi></p></note> In 175 Antoninus made a treaty with several nations
                    of Germany. Soon after, Avidius Cassius, governor of Syria, revolted from the
                    emperor. This insurrection, however, was put an end to by the death of Cassius,
                    who was killed by a centurion named Anthony. Antoninus behaved with great lenity
                    towards those who had been engaged in Cassius’s party: he would not put to
                    death, nor imprison, nor even sit in judgment himself upon any of the senators
                    engaged in this revolt; but he referred them to the senate, fixing a day for
                    their appearance, as if it had been only a civil affair. He wrote also to the
                    senate, desiring them to act with indulgence rather than severity; nor to shed
                    the blood of any senator or person of quality, or of any other person whatever;
                    but to allow this honour to his reign, that, even under the misfortune of a
                    rebellion, none had lost their lives except in the first heat of the tumult. In
                    176 Antoninus visited Syria and Egypt. The kings of those countries, and
                    ambassadors also from Parthia, came to visit him. He staid several days at
                    Smyrna; and, after settling the affairs of the East, went to Athens, on which
                    city he conferred several honours, and appointed public professors there. From
                    thence he returned to Rome with his son Commodus, whom he chose consul for the
                    year following, though he was then but 16 years of age, having obtained a
                    dispensation for that purpose. On the 27th of September in the same year he gave
                    him the title of <hi rend="italic">Imperator</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and on
                    the 23d of December he entered Rome in triumph with Commodus, on account of the
                    victories gained over the Germans. Dion Cassius tells us that he remitted all
                    the debts which were due to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193099097?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-9097-0272"/> himself and the public treasury during 4G years,
                    and burnt •the writings relating to these debts. In the year 179 he 'left Rome
                    with his son Commodus, in order to go against the Marcomanni and other barbarous
                    nations; and in the year following he gained a considerable victory over them,
                    and would in all probability have entirely subdued them, had he not been seized
                    with an illness, which carried him off on the 17th of March 180, in the 59th
                    year of his age, and 19th of his reign. The whole empire regretted the loss of
                    so valuable a prince, and almost every person had a statue of him. His book of
                    <hi rend="italic">Meditations</hi> has been much admired. It is the most
                    precious work that has come down to us from the Stoical school. The Oxford
                    edition of 1704, and that of London, published in 1707; are both esteemed. 'An
                    English translation by Drs Moor and Hutcheson was published at Glasgow in 2
                    vols. 12mo, in 1749.</p>
