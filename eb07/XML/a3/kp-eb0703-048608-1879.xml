                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">ARIOSTO, <hi rend="smallcaps">Lodovico</hi></label>, one of
                    the greatest poets of Italy, was born at Reggio in Lombardy, on the 8th day of
                    September 1474. His father was Niccolò Ariosto, commander of the citadel of
                    Reggio, and his mother Daria Malaguzzi of that city, where the family still
                    exists. He showed a strong inclination to poetry from his earliest years, but
                    was obliged by his father to study the law—a pursuit in which he lost five of
                    the best years of his life. Having obtained liberty to follow his inclination,
                    he applied himself to literature; and he intended to peruse the classics under
                    Gregorio da Spoleti. But after having had the benefit of this learned man’s
                    instructions for a short time, during which he read the best Latin authors, he
                    was deprived of it, Gregorio having gone to France as tutor of Prince Sforza;
                    and he thus lost the opportunity of learning Greek, as he intended. His father
                    dying soon after, he was compelled to forego his literary occupations to
                    undertake the management of the family, whose affairs were embarrassed, and to
                    provide for the subsistence and education of his nine brothers and sisters, one
                    of whom was a cripple. He, however, wrote some comedies in prose, and some
                    lyrical pieces, about this time; and was then appointed one of the gentlemen of
                    the cardinal Ippolito of Este. This prince usurped the character of a patron of
                    literature, whilst the only reward which the poet received for having dedicated
                    to him the <hi rend="italic">Orlando Purioso,</hi> was the question, Where did
                    you find so many stories, Master Ludovic? The poet himself tells us that the
                    cardinal was ungrateful; deplores the time which he spent under his yoke; and
                    adds, that if he received some miserable pension, it was not to reward him for
                    his poetry, which that prelate despised, but to make some just compensation for
                    the poet’s running like a messenger, with risk of life, at his eminence’s
                    pleasure. Nor was even this miserable pittance regularly paid during the period
                    that the poet enjoyed it. The cardinal went to Hungary in 1518, and wished
                    Ariosto to accompany him. The poet excused himself, pleading ill health, his
                    love of study, the care of his private affairs, and the age of his mother, whom
                    it would have been disgraceful to leave. His excuses were not received, and even
                    an interview denied to him. Ariosto then boldly said, that if his eminence
                    thought to have bought a slave by assigning him the scanty pension of
                    seventy-five crowns a year, he was mistaken, and that he might withdraw his
                    boon, which it seems that prelate did·</p>

                <p>Alfonso, duke of Ferrara, then received Ariosto among his courtiers, which was an
                    act of pure justice, that poet having distinguished himself as a diplomatist,
                    chiefly on being sent twice to Rome as ambassador to the Pope Giulio II. The
                    fatigue of one of these hurried journeys brought upon him a complaint from which
                    he never recovered; and on his second mission he was nearly killed by orders of
                    that violent pope, at that time much enraged against the duke of Ferrara. On
                    account of the war, his salary of only 84 crowns a year was suspended, and
                    withdrawn altogether after the peace; in consequence of which Ariosto asked the
                    duke either to provide for him, or to allow him to go to seek employment
                    elsewhere. A province belonging to that sovereign, situated on the wildest
                    heights of the Apennines, being then without a governor, Ariosto was sent
                    thither in that character, and remained there for three years. This was not a
                    sinecure. The province was distracted by factions and banditti, the governor had
                    not the requisite means to enforce his authority, and the duke did not support
                    his minister as he ought. Yet it is Said that Ariosto’s government satisfied
                    both his sovereign and the people confided to his care; and a story is added of
                    his having fallen in, when walking out alone, with a party of banditti, whose
                    chief apologized to the governor for not having immediately shown to him that
                    respect which his rank required.</p>
                <p>Although he was dissatisfied with his office, he would not accept an embassy to
                    Pope Clement VIL, which the secretary of the duke offered him; and spent the
                    remainder of his life at Ferrara, writing comedies, superintending their
                    performance, as well as the construction of a theatre, and correcting his <hi
                    rend="italic">Orlando</hi><hi rend="italic">Furioso,</hi> of which the complete
                    edition was published only in 1532. He died of a consumption on the 6th of June
                    1533.</p>
                <p>That he was honoured and respected by the first men of his age is a fact; that
                    most of the princes of Italy showed him great partiality is equally true; but
                    they limited their patronage to kind words. It is not known that he ever
                    received any substantial mark of their love for literature: he lived and died
                    poor. He proudly wrote, on the entrance of a house built by himself,</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> Parva, sed apta mihi, sed nulli obnoxia, sed non </l>
                    <l part="N"> Sordida, parta meo sed tamen aere domus; </l>
                </lg>
                <p>which serves to show the incorrectness of the assertion of flatterers, followed
                    by Tiraboschi, that the duke of Ferrara built that house for him. The only one
                    who seems to have given any thing to Ariosto as a reward for his poetical talent
                    is the marquess del Vasto, who assigned him an annuity of one hundred crowns on
                    the revenues of Casteleone in Lombardy; but it was only paid, if ever, from the
                    end of 1531. That he was crowned as poet by Charles V. seems untrue, although a
                    diploma may have been issued to that effect by the emperor.</p>
                <p>lhe character of Ariosto seems to have been fully and justly delineated by
                    Gabrielle, his brother :—</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> Ornabat pietas et grata modestia Vatem, </l>
                    <l part="N"> Sancta fides, dictique memor, munitaque recto </l>
                    <l part="N"> Justitia, et nullo patientia victa labore, </l>
                    <l part="N"> Et constans virtus animi, et clementia mitis, </l>
                    <l part="N"> Ambitione procul pulsa, fastusque tumore. </l>
                </lg>
                <p>His satires, in which we see him before us such as he was, show that there was no
                    flattery in this portrait, from these compositions (the interest of which is
                    only equalled by the elegance as well as <hi rend="italic">naïveté</hi> of the
                    poetry, and the shrewdness of observation of human nature which the poet
                    displays), we are highly pleased with a noble sentiment of independence
                    displayed by Ariosto. He seems to have been very fond, and even jealous, of his
                    ιberty. ∩ <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> was, moreover, of a changeable
                    disposition, which he very frankly confesses in his Latin verses, as well as in
                    the satires.</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> Hoc olim ingenio vitales hausimus auras </l>
                    <l part="N"> Multa cito ut placeant, displicitura brevi. </l>
                    <l part="N"> Non in amore modo mens haec, sed in omnibus impar </l>
                    <l part="N"> Ipsa sibi longa non retinenda mora. </l>
                </lg>
                <p>Hence he never would bind himself, either by going into orders or marrying, till
                    towards the end of his life, when he married Alessandra, widow of Tito Strozzi.
                    He had no issue by her, although he left two natural sons by different
                    mothers.</p>
                <p>His Latin poems do not perhaps deserve to be noticed, because, in the age of
                    Flaminio, Vida, Fracastoro, and San-nazzaro, and from a poet like Ariosto, we
                    have a right to expect better things. His lyrical compositions show a poet,
                    although they do not sece worthy of Ariosto. His comedies, of which he wrote
                    four, besides one which he left unfinished, arc avowedly imitated from Plautus
                    and Terentius; and although natives may admire in them the elegance of the
                    diction, the liveliness of the dialogue, and the novelty of some scenes, few
                    will feel interest either in the subject or in the characters, and none will
                    approve the immoral passages with which they are disfigured—a fault more to be
                    reproached to the audience and the patrons of theatrical representations in
                    those days than to the poet.</p>
                <p>Of all the works of Ariosto, however, the most sol d and best known monument of
                    his fame is his poem the <hi rend="italic">Orlando</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Furioso,</hi> the extraordinary merits of which have cast into oblivion the
                    numberless romance poems which inundated Italy during the 15th, !6th, and 17th
                    centuries.</p>
                <p>The popularity which a poem, now shamefully neglected, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orlando Innamorato,</hi> by Bojardo, enjoyed in Ariosto’s time, cannot be well
                    conceived, now that the enthusiasm of the Crusades, and the interest which was
                    attached to a war against the Moslems, are no longer felt. Bojardo wrote and
                    read his poem at the court of Ferrara, but died before he was able to finish it.
                    Many poets undertook the difficult task of completing that magnificent work; but
                    it was reserved to Ariosto both to finish and to surpass his original. Bojardo
                    did not perhaps yield to Ariosto either in vigour or in richness of imagination,
                    but he lived in a less refined age, and died before he was able to put a
                    finishing hand to that part of the poem which he had written yielding to the
                    impulse of his exuberant fancy; but Ariosto united to a powerful imagination a
                    refined taste and an elegant mind. He began to write his poem about 1503; and
                    after having consulted the first men of the age of Leo X., he published it in
                    1516, in only 40 cantos; and up to the moment of his death never ceased to
                    correct and improve both the subject and the style. It is in this latter quality
                    that he excels, and for which Italians gave him the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Divino</hi><hi rend="italic">Lodovico</hi> When jesting he never forgets that
                    he was a gentleman; when attempting pathetic descriptions or narratives, he
                    searches the reader’s deepest feelings. In his machinery he displays a vivacity
                    of fancy with which no other poet can vie; but he never lets his fancy carry him
                    so far as to omit to employ, with an art peculiar to him, those simple and
                    natural pencil-strokes with which he gives to the most extraordinary feats a
                    colour of reality which conciliates our reason without undeceiving our
                    bewildered imagination. The death of Zerbino, the complaints of Isabella, the
                    effects of discord among the Saracens, the flight of Astolfo to the moon, the
                    passion which causes Orlando’s madness, teem with beauties of every species. It
                    is to be observed that the supposition that the poem of Ariosto is not connected
                    throughout is utterly unfounded; there is a connection which, with a little
                    attention, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193101905" xml:id="kp-eb0703-1905-0488"
                    />will become evident. The love of Ruggero and Brada-mante forms the main
                    subject of the <hi rend="italic">Eurioso</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and every
                    part of it, except some episodes, depends upon this subject. The poem ends with
                    the marriage of these two personages. (<hi rend="superscript"> g</hi> ∙^ <hi
