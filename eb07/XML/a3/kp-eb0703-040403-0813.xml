                <p><label type="entry">ARCHIMEDES</label>, the most celebrated of the ancient
                    mathematicians, was born at Syracuse, in Sicily, about the year 180 before the
                    Christian era. Hiero, king of Syracuse, deemed it an honour to have this
                    philosopher for his relative and friend. History does not inform us to whom he
                    was indebted for the rudiments of literature, but he flourished about 50 years
                    after Euclid. It is reported that he was indebted to Egypt for much of his
                    knowledge; but other accounts indicate that he conferred more knowledge than he
                    received from that celebrated nation; and, in particular, Diodorus mentions that
                    Egypt was indebted to him for the invention of the screw-pump for drawing off
                    water: and the same author narrates that he was the inventor of several other
                    useful machines, which conveyed his fame to every quarter of the globe. The
                    following passage from Livy proves that he was dexterous both for the inventing
                    of warlike machines, and also for his accurate observation of the heavenly
                    bodies: “Unicus spectator coeli siderumque, mirabilior tamen inventor ac
                    machinator bellicorum tormentorum,” &amp;c. lib. xxiv. cap. 34. It appears also
                    that, in Cicero’s time, he had become proverbial for his skill in solving
                    problems. In a letter to Atticus, he informs him that he is now freed from a
                    difficulty, which he termed an Archimedian problem, lib. xiii. ep. 28.</p>
                <p>Vitruvius mentions a fact which proves Archimedes’s knowledge in the doctrine of
                    specific gravity. Hiero, the king, having given a certain quantity of gold
                    wherewith to make a golden crown, and suspecting that the workmen had stolen
                    part of the gold and substituted silver in its stead, he applied to Archimedes
                    to employ his ingenuity in detecting the fraud. Ruminating upon this subject
                    when he was bathing himself, he observed that he dislodged a quantity of water
                    corresponding to the bulk of his own body; therefore, instantly quitting the
                    bath with all the eagerness natural to an inventive mind upon a new discovery,
                    he ran into the street naked, crying, E⅛jjx <hi rend="subscript"> α</hi> ’
                    E⅛jjκα! <hi rend="italic">I have found it out! I have found it out f</hi> τ; <hi
                    rend="subscript"> len</hi> taking one mass of gold and another of silver, each
                    equal in weight to the crown, he carefully observed the quan- tity of fluid
                    which they alternately displaced, when intro duced in the same vessel full of
                    water. Next he ascer. tained how much water was displaced by the crown when put
                    into the same vessel full of water; and, upon comparing the three quantities
                    together, he ascertained the exact proportions of gold and silver of which the
                    crown was composed.</p>
                <p>Archimedes was well acquainted with the mechanical powers. His celebrated saying
                    with regard to the power of the lever has been often repeated,—“Give me a place
                    to stand upon, and I will move the earth.” In order to show Hiero the effect of
                    mechanical powers, it is said that, aided by ropes and pulleys, he drew towards
                    him a galley which lay on the shore manned and loaded; but the displays of his
                    mechanical skill mentioned by Marcellus at the siege of Syracuse were long
                    deemed almost incredible, until the after-improvements in mechanics have
                    demonstrated them practicable. He harassed the vessels of the besiegers, both
                    when they approached and kept at a distance from the city. When they approached,
                    he sunk them by means of long and huge beams of wood or, by means of grappling
                    hooks placed at the extremit’ of levers, he hoisted up the vessels into the air,
                    and dashed them to pieces either against the walls or the rocks. When the enemy
                    kept at a distance, he employed machines which threw from the walls such a
                    quantity of stones as shattered and destroyed their vessels. In short, his
                    mechanical genius supplied strength and courage to the city, and filled the
                    Romans with astonishment and terror. Until Buffon invented and framed a burning
                    glass, composed of about 400 glass panes, capable of setting fire to wood at the
                    distance of 200 feet, and of melting lead and tin at the distance of 120 feet,
                    and silver at the distance of 50, the account of Archimedes’s instrument for
                    burning ships at a great distance by means of the rays of the sun was deemed
                    fabulous and impossible.</p>
                <p>But, however eminent for mechanical invention, he was still more eminent for the
                    investigation of abstract truths, and the formation of conclusive demonstrations
                    in pure geometry. Plutarch also mentions that Archimedes himself esteemed
                    mechanical inventions greatly inferior in value to those speculations which
                    convey irresistible conviction to the mind. His geometrical works afford
                    numerous proofs of his success in this field of science. It is reported that he
                    was often so deeply engaged in mathematical speculations, as both to neglect his
                    food and the care of his person; and at the bath he would sometimes draw
                    geometrical figures in the ashes, and sometimes upon his own body when it was
                    anointed, according to the custom of that time. He valued himself so much upon
                    the discovery of the ratio between the sphere and the containing cylinder, that,
                    indifferent to all his other inventions, he ordered his friends to engrave upon
                    his tomb a cylinder containing a sphere, with an inscription explanatory of its
                    nature and use.</p>
                <p>It must be extremely painful to every humane mind, but particularly to every
                    lover of philosophic merit, to learn, that when Syracuse was taken by storm,
                    Archimedes, being ignorant of that fact, was run through the body, when engaged
                    in drawing a geometrical figure upon the sand. As Marcellus had given express
                    orders that both his person and his house should be held sacred, this appears to
                    have happened through ignorance, and therefore removes a great part of the odium
                    from the Roman name. This mournful event happened in the 142d Olympiad, or 212
                    years before the Christian era. Marcellus, in the midst of bis <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193100826" xml:id="kp-eb0703-0826-0405"/>triumph, lamented the death
                    of Archimedes, conferred <hi rend="subscript"> u</hi> pon him an honourable
                    burial, and took his surviving relations under his protection; but greater
                    honour was conferred upon him when the philosopher of Arpinum, 140 years after,
                    went in search of his long-neglected tomb. Hence, says Cicero, “I diligently
                    sought to discover the sepulchre of Archimedes, which the Syracusans had totally
                    neglected, and suffered to be overgrown with thorns and briers. Recollecting
                    some verses said to be inscribed on the tomb, which mentioned that on the top
                    was placed a sphere with a cylinder, I looked round me upon every object at the
                    Agrigentine gate, the common receptacle of the dead. At last I observed a little
                    column which just rose above the thorns, upon which was placed the figure of a
                    sphere and cylinder. ‘ This,’ said I to the Syracusan nobles who were with me, ‘
                    this must, I think, be what I am seeking.’ Several persons were immediately
                    employed to clear away the weeds and lay open the spot. As soon as a passage was
                    opened, we drew near, and found on the opposite base the inscription, with
                    nearly half the latter part of the verses worn away. Thus would this most
                    famous, and formerly most learned, city of Greece have remained a stranger to
                    the tomb of one of its most ingenious citizens, had it not been discovered by a
                    man of Arpinum.”</p>
                <p>Several works of this celebrated mathematician have escaped the wreck of time. In
                    abstract geometry we have a treatise on the Sphere and Cylinder, another on the
                    Dimension of the Circle, or the Proportion between the Diameter and the
                    Circumference; on Obtuse Conoids and Spheroids; on Spiral Lines; and on the
                    Quadrature of the Parabola. Of his mechanics we have a treatise on
                    Equiponderants, or Centres of Gravity; and in hydrostatics, a treatise
                    concerning Bodies floating on Fluids.</p>
                <p>The existing works of Archimedes were printed at Basil, in a folio volume, Greek
                    and Latin, in 1544. This is the <hi rend="italic">editio princeps.</hi> Another
                    edition was printed at Paris in 1615. The most complete and best is that printed
                    at Oxford in 1792, in a handsome folio volume, superintended by the late Dr
                    Abraham Roberston. There is a French translation by M. Peyrard, of the works of
                    Archimedes: it was published in 1808, in 2 vols. 8vo.</p>
