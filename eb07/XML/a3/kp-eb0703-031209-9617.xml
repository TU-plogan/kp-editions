                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p>It is to be regretted that Garel] i, who had such an authentic source of
                    information, has not given us some details of the infamous Tofana or Tofania, as
                    the little that we know of her rests upon the authority of travellers, and is
                    evidently exaggerated, and sometimes irreconcilable with established facts. She
                    was a Sicilian by birth, and resided first at Palermo, and then at Naples. When
                    she began to exercise her horrible profession, is nowhere stated; but it will
                    presently appear that it must have been at a very early age, and before 1659.
                    She was extremely liberal of her preparation, chiefly, it is said, to ladies
                    tired of their husbands; and the better to conceal the nature of her gift, it
                    was put up in small flat phials, inscribed <hi rend="italic">Manna of St
                    Nicholas of Pari,</hi> ornamented on one side with an image of the saint, that
                    it might pass for a liquid said to drop from his tomb at Bari, which was in
                    great request on account of the medicinal virtues ascribed to it. Nor is it
                    ascertained how long she carried on her murderous practices with impunity and
                    undiscovered. Labat<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    viceroy of Naples, then Count Daun, made the discovery. It was long before she
                    was secured, as she was extremely cautious, and often changed her abode or
                    retired into convents. At last she was betrayed, and, although in a convent, was
                    seized and carried to the Castel del Uovo, where she was examined. Cardinal
                    Pigna-telli, then archbishop of Naples, indignant at the violation of a
                    religious sanctuary, threatened to excommunicate the whole city if she was not
                    delivered up to him; and the people were ready to rise. But the sagacious
                    viceroy caused a report to be spread that she and her accomplices had determined
                    upon the same day to poison all the springs in the city, the fruits brought to
                    market, and the public granaries. The manoeuvre succeeded. The credulous people
                    were now clamorous for her punishment, and saw with satisfaction the persons
                    whom she accused of having purchased her <hi rend="italic">Aquetta</hi> taken
                    from the churches and monasteries. Some of inferior birth were executed
                    publicly, those of higher rank secretly in prison; and the whole city resounded
                    with the praises of the viceroy, whose energy had saved it from general
                    destruction. A kind of compromise was entered into with the cardinal; m
                    consequence of which, after being strangled, her body was thrown at night into
                    the court of the convent, by way of testifying some respect for the rights of
                    the church. But the reverend traveller must have either been misinformed as to
                    the actual execution of this Medea, or she must have been resuscitated; for
                    Garelli expressly says that she was alive in prison at Naples when he wrote to
                    Hoffmann, not long before 1718; and Keysler, who visited Naples in 1730,<note

                    few strangers left the city without going to see her. He describes her as a
                    little and very old woman.</p>
                <p>The Roman ladies very quickly availed themselves of Tofania’s discovery; for it
                    was remarked in 1659, that many husbands died when they became disagreeable to
                    their wives; and several of the clergy also gave information that, for some time
                    past, various persons had confessed themselves guilty of poisoning. This led to
                    the detection of a society of young married women (who had for their president
                    an old woman of the name of Hiero-nyma Spara, a pretended fortune-teller), as
                    the perpetrators of these murders. On being put to the torture they all
                    confessed except Spara, who seemed to rely upon the protection of powerful
                    individuals whom she had formerly served. But she was left to her fate, and was
                    hanged along with her assistant, one Gratiosa. Others were afterwards hanged, or
                    whipt and banished. Spara, who was a Sicilian, had acquired her knowledge from
                    Tofania at Palermo.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>J∙

                <p>Pope Alexander VII., immediately on the discovery and punishment of those who
                    dealt in poison in his capital, published an edict forbidding the distillation
                    of aqua fortis, or the purchase of any of its ingredients, without the
                    permission of the government; which Gmelin considers as an artifice to mislead
                    the people as to the real composition of the poison, or as originating in the
                    absurd nomenclature of the chemists of former times, who called arsenic concrete
                    aqua fortis. But the prudence of the Pope was rendered fruitless; for we are
                    informed by Gayot di Pitaval <hi rend="italic">{Causes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Celebres,</hi> vol. i. p. 317, Am-sterd. 1764), on what authority he does not
                    state, that Tofania’s fatal secret was disclosed by the indiscretion of the
                    judges at Naples, to whom she had made confession of her crime. The whole city
                    soon knew that she employed in its composition a very common herb, and that its
                    preparation was otherwise easy; and in this way the art of poisoning became very
                    common in Naples, where, Keysler says, it was still secretly practised when he
                    visited Italy; and Archenholz,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    that Aqua Tofana was then in use, although its composition was only known to a
                    few; but Joseph Frank, who was long professor in Pavia, and has written a work
                    on toxicoogy <hi rend="italic">{Handbuch der</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    asserts that it no longer exists or is heard of.</p>
                <p>Aqua Tofana is described as being as limpid as rock water, and without taste, and
                    hence it could be administered without exciting suspicion. The Abbé Gagliani

                    in a phial known only to herself.</p>
                <p>It was generally believed that the effect of this poison was certain death, and
                    that it could be so tempered or managed as to prove fatal in any determinate
                    time, from a few days to a year or upwards. Four or six drops were reckoned a
                    sufficient dose, and they were said to produce no violent symptoms, no vomiting,
                    or but very seldom; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193099643"

                    symptoms, except sometimes inextinguishable thirst: the victim, however, sunk
                    into a languid state, and his weakness increased daily. Disgust at all kinds of
                    food, and weariness of life, succeeded: the nobler organs were then attacked,
                    the lungs were wasted by suppuration, and death closed the miserable scene. This
                    termination was the more certain, that the true cause of these symptoms was not
                    at first suspected, and the remedies commonly prescribed rather aggravated the
                    evil. Indeed, even when known, no treatment was of any avail, although a Dr
                    Branchaletti, according to Keysler, wrote a book on its remedies, until it was
                    discovered by accident that lemonjuice, when very early administered in large
                    doses, sometimes proved effectual (Bertholinus), after which Keysler tells us
                    that the poison fell into some disrepute.</p>
                <p>Various accounts of the composition of this detestable liquor have been given.
                    Abbé Gagliani, and more lately Archenholz, state it to be a preparation of
                    cantharides and opium; but this is perfectly inconsistent both with its
                    appearance and effects. By no preparation can the smell and taste of opium, if
                    the quantity be sufficient to produce any effect, be concealed; and the acrimony
                    of cantharides is equally connected with its activity. The one of these drugs is
                    highly stimulant, the other a sedative, and neither of them capable of remaining
                    latent in the system, or injuring the constitution. Erndtel,<note

                    saliva gathered round the mouth of a person tortured to death. Garelli, on the
                    contrary, positively asserts it to have been nothing but a solution of
                    crystallized arsenic in a large quantity of water, with the addition, for some
                    unknown reason, of a very innocent herb, the <hi rend="italic">Antirrhinum

                    Marchioness Brinvilliers, was suddenly killed by suffocation, as it is said, in
                    consequence of the falling off of a mask of glass, which he wore to protect him
                    from the fumes of certain chemical operations about which he was employed. As he
                    had no known relations, his effects were examined by a public officer, and among
                    them was found a casket, containing many packets of poisonous articles, scaled
                    up in a mysterious manner, together with a kind of last will, directing the
                    whole to be delivered to the marchioness, and, in case of her having predeceased
                    him, to be burnt unopened. This led to the discovery of his having been
                    instructed in the art of preparing poison by an Italian, called Exili, with whom
                    he had become acquainted when confined in the Bastile; and of his having
                    furnished the marchioness with the means of poisoning her father and her two
                    brothers, besides others on whom she tried the effect of her preparations. One
                    of these afterwards was called from her by the name <hi rend="italic">Eau de
                    Brinvilliers.</hi> She is also said to have employed a powder called <hi

                    La Chaussée, who had been valet to Sainte Croix, was convicted of being
                    accessory to these murders, and was broken alive on the wheel. The marchioness
                    herself, who had escaped to Liege, was also seized; and her execution, which
                    took place on the 17th of July 1676, is described with revolting levity by
                    Madame de Sevigné in a letter to her daughter of that date.</p>
                <p>The practice of poisoning, however, did not seem to terminate with the death of
                    this infamous woman; and a particular court called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chambre</hi><hi rend="italic">des Poisons,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Chambre
                    Ardente,</hi> was established in 1679, to endeavour to put an end to it. In
                    consequence of the investigations which took place in it, many persons, some of
                    the highest rank, especially the Duc de Luxembourg, were implicated. More than
                    40 persons were at one time confined in the Bastile; but it was aseertained that
                    almost all of them had been guilty of no crime, but were merely the dupes of a
                    few impostors, who pretended to raise spirits, foretell future events, and to
                    possess many secrets of a similar nature. Two women, La Vigoreux and La Voisin,
                    with the brother of the former, and a priest called Le Sage<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Voltaire, <hi rend="italic">Sièele de Louis

                    fortune-tellers, were convicted of being dealers in poi-j son, and burnt alive
                    on the 22d of February 1680; some others were hanged, and others acquitted. This
                    closed' the proceedings of this inquisitorial court, which has been accused of
                    being a political engine, contrived to serve the purposes of Louvois and the
                    Marchioness de Montespan. Voltaire, however, admits that the crime of poisoning
                    infected Paris from 1670 to 1680.</p>
                <p>Concerning the effects of the <hi rend="italic">Eau de Brinvilliers,</hi> Pitaval
                    tells us (p. 271) that the marchioness’s father experienced violent effects from
                    the poison,—extraordinary <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> vomiting, insupportable
                    pain at the stomach, and great heat in the bowels. He died soon after his return
                    from his country-seat to Paris. The brothers and five other per-, sons were all
                    taken ill, and affected with vomiting, after partaking of a tart at dinner. On
                    their return from the country to Paris, the brothers had the appearance of per
                    sons who had been long ill; and after suffering, the om for two, and the other
                    for three months, from nausea and vomiting, they died extremely emaciated, and
                    as it were dried up, without fever, though experiencing a burning sensation in
                    the stomach. On opening the bodies, the stomach and duodenum were black and
                    tender, and the liver gangrenous and burnt. Madame Sevigné relates that the
                    marchioness often poisoned-her husband, that she might marry Sainte Croix; but
                    that the gallant, having no desire for a wife of her disposition, as often gave
                    the poor husband an antidote. She is also said to have attempted to poison her
                    sister, but did not succeed; and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193099656"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-9656-0315"/>^that she was in the habit of trying the effects
                    of her poisons on the poor, and even on the patients in the Hotel Dieu, under
                    pretence of charitably supplying them with biscuits. But Voltaire positively
                    denies this horrible imputation, and says that she never attempted the life of
                    her husband, who overlooked a connection of which he was the cause.</p>
                <p>The information concerning the nature of the <hi rend="italic">Eau de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Brinvilliers,</hi> derived from the examination of Sainte Croix’s
                    famous casket, is not satisfactory. It contained poisons enough to have killed a
                    whole community; besides opium, lunar caustic, antimony, and vitriol, more than
                    75 lbs. of corrosive sublimate, and two bottles of a liquid like water, with a
                    sediment in one. The clear liquid was probably his real poison; as none of the
                    other substances could have been given so as to produce death, without instantly
                    being detected by their abominable taste; but what this liquid was, we can now
                    only conjecture; for its examination, as reported by Pitaval, shows that the
                    physicians at that time had not the slightest notion of the mode of detecting
                    arsenic even in substance, much less in solution; and accordingly, although both
                    the liquor and powder killed the animals to which they were given, it is
                    candidly admitted that the poison of Sainte Croix surpassed the art and capacity
                    of the physicians, and that it baffled all their experiments to discover its
                    composition. We have, however, no doubt that arsenic was the only active
                    ingredient of all these pretended secret poisons, as it is the only substance
                    capable of explaining all the credible circumstances related of them. From the
                    mode of administering them in small but repeated and perhaps increased doses,
                    there was some foundation for the belief that they could be given so as to kill
                    in any determinate time, while their failing in any instance to produce death
                    was easily accounted for by supposing antidotes to have been administered. But
                    although the progress of knowledge has proved that there is no such thing as
                    such antidotes, it has on the other hand, by rendering the detection of poison
                    easy and certain, put a stop for ever to the trade of <hi rend="italic"
                    >poisoner,</hi> and, what is perhaps of equal importance, to the general alarm
                    and cruel punishment of individuals, which have often resulted from natural
                    deaths being ascribed to poison. It is not because we know less, but because we
                    know ä great deal more than our forefathers, that the art of secret poisoning
                    seems to be lost. (x.)</p>
