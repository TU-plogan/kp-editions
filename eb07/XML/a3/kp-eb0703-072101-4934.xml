                <p>Astronomy, if we dignify by that name the first rude attempts that were made to
                    discover the order and connection of the celestial motions, may probably be
                    regarded as the most ancient of all the sciences. In fact, a certain degree of
                    attention to the heavenly bodies is forced even on the savage who inhabits the
                    forest, and derives his subsistence from the spontaneous productions of the
                    earth. The regular vicissitude of day and night inevitably compels him to
                    observe the diurnal course of the sun; and he cannot fail soon to perceive, that
                    the variety and succession of the seasons is equally dependent on the oblique
                    annual course of the same great luminary. The moon, too, in the absence of the
                    sun, is an object so conspicuous, so consoling, and so useful, that her motions
                    must at all times have been watched with attention and interest; while her
                    various phases, her alternate waxings and wanings, her regular disappearance and
                    return after equal intervals of time, would be contemplated with admiration and
                    delight. Nor are the wonders of the starry firmament less calculated to strike
                    even the most heedless observer of the heavens. The magnificent spectacle of the
                    sky bespangled with brilliant points, and revolving in obedience to eternal and
                    unalterable laws, affords a constant succession of new objects of sublime and
                    exalted contemplation. The occasional recurrence, also, of eclipses and other
                    unusual phenomena, which seem to interrupt the general order and uniformity of
                    the celestial motions, would stimulate to attentive observation; for the vanity
                    of man has in all ages rendered him eager to connect his own destiny with the
                    heavens, while his timidity has prompted him to regard every apparent deviation
                    from the ordinary course of events as an emblem of the wrath, and a precursor of
                    the vengeance, of superior beings.</p>
                <p>But though mankind were probably first impelled by motives of mere curiosity to
                    observe the courses of the stars, no great length of time could elapse ere they
                    perceived that the regular and uniform revolutions of the heavens might be
                    rendered subservient to their own wants and conveniencies. By the help of the
                    stars the shepherd, during the night, could count the hours, the traveller track
                    his course through the uniform wastes of the desert, and the mariner guide his
                    bark over the ocean: the husbandman, also, learned to regulate his labours by
                    the appearance of certain constellations, which gave him warning of the
                    approaching seasons. The indications derived from the simple observation of such
                    phenomena were doubtless extremely vague; but as civilisation advanced, the
                    necessity of determining accurately the length of the solar year and of the
                    lunar month, in order to regulate the calendar and the religious festivals, led
                    to the accumulation and comparison of different observations, whereby errors
                    were gradually diminished, and the foundations laid of a more perfect
                    acquaintance with the heavenly motions.</p>
                <p>Astronomy, presenting so many objects of interesting curiosity, and having so
                    many practical uses, could not fail to be one of the sciences first cultivated
                    by mankind. Its origin is consequently hid amidst the obscurity and traditions
                    of the remotest ages, and is in fact coeval with the origin of society, and the
                    earliest development of the human intellect. The records or traditions of almost
                    every ancient nation furnish some traces of attention to the state of the
                    heavens, and of some rude attempts· to discover the laws, the order, and the
                    period of the most remarkable phenomena,—such as eclipses of the sun and moon,
                    the motions of the planets, and the heliacal risings of the principal stars and
                    constellations. The Chaldeans and Egyptians, Chinese and Indians, Gauls and
                    Peruvians, equally regard themselves as the inventors of astronomy; an honour,
                    however, of which Josephus deprives them all, in order to ascribe it to the
                    antediluvian patriarchs. The fables relating to the two columns of brick and
                    marble which these sages are said to have erected, and on which they engraved
                    the elements of their astronomy, to preserve them from the universal destruction
                    by fire and water to which, they are said to have learned from Adam, the earth
                    was doomed, are not worth the trouble of repetition; nor is there any better
                    próof than the assertion of that credulous historian, of their acquaintance with
                    the <hi rend="italic">annus</hi><hi rend="italic">magnus,</hi> or, as is most
                    probably supposed, the astronomical cycle of 600 years, which brings back the
                    sun and moon to the same points of the heavens so nearly, that its discovery
                    implies a pretty correct knowledge of the solar and lunar motions. Passing over,
                    therefore, those periods that present us only with a scanty detail of
                    traditional observations or unimportant facts, we will proceed to give a brief
                    account of the state of astronomy among some early nations who have undoubtedly
                    contributed to the improvement of the science, or who, at least, have
                    transmitted to future ages some monuments of their <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193104947" xml:id="kp-eb0703-4947-0722"/>astronomical labours, and of
                    their attention to celestial observations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Astronomy of the Chaldeans, Egyptians, Phoenicians, Chinese,
                    and Indians.</hi></p>
                <p>According to the unanimous testimony of the Greek historians, the earliest traces
                    of astronomical science are to be met with among the Chaldeans and Egyptians.
                    The spacious level and unclouded horizon of Chaldea afforded the utmost
                    facilities for observing the celestial phenomena; and its inhabitants, enjoying
                    the leisure afforded by a pastoral life, and stimulated by the vain desire of
                    obtaining a knowledge of the future from the aspects of the stars, assiduously
                    cultivated astronomy and astrology. By a long series of observations of
                    eclipses, extending, according to the testimony of some authors, over nineteen
                    centuries, or even a longer period, they had discovered the cycle of 223
                    “lunations, or eighteen solar years, which, by bringing back the moon to nearly
                    the same position with respect to her nodes, her perigee, and the sun, brings
                    back the eclipses in the same order. This is supposed to be the period which
                    they distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic">Saros.</hi> They had others,
                    to which they gave the names of <hi rend="italic">Sossos</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Neros</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but nothing positive is known
                    with regard to their nature or extent. One thing only is certain, which is, that
                    these Chaldaic periods, whatever they were, were founded on no theoretical
                    knowledge of the celestial motions. They were purely empirical, detected by the
                    comparison of recorded observations, and suppose neither theory nor science,
                    unless, indeed, a simple arithmetical operation is to be considered as such; nor
                    is there any reason to suppose that the Chaldeans employed any process of
                    computation whatever in their predictions of eclipses. Having once established
                    their cycle, they were in possession of a simple means of predicting all those
                    which occurred in the course of it, with as great a degree of accuracy as they
                    considered requisite.</p>
                <p>The knowledge of these lunisolar periods among the Chaldeans is doubtless of
                    great antiquity. Simplicius, the commentator of Aristotle, asserts that
                    Callisthenes transmitted to Aristotle from Babylon a collection of observations
                    of all the eclipses which had happened during the nineteen centuries that
                    preceded the conquest of Alexander. This relation, however, is at variance-with
                    the accounts given by other historians. Epigenes, cited by Seneca and Pliny, who
                    is supposed to have lived shortly before the time of Alexander, mentions
                    observations of 730 years that had been found preserved on columns of brick.
                    Ptolemy also makes mention of certain observations of eclipses that had been
                    brought from Babylon, several of which he had calculated and verified; but the
                    earliest of these ascends only to the year 720 before our era, or to the 26th of
                    Nabonassar; and if either Hipparchus or himself had been acquainted with others
                    of a more ancient date, they would doubtless have employed them in the
                    determination of the mean motion of the moon. From this circumstance it appears
                    probable that the Chaldeans had no observation sufficiently exact to be of any
                    use to astronomy prior to the time of Nabonassar.</p>
                <p>According to Apollonius of Myndus, the Chaldeans supposed the comets to be
                    substances of the same nature as the plarets; that they are visible only during
                    a portion of their revolutions, and that they re-appear after certain intervals.
                    But this statement, which argues some just notions respecting the celestial
                    bodies, is contradicted by Epigenes, who himself studied among the Chaldeans,
                    and who affirms, that instead of regarding the comets as subjected like the
                    planets to the operation of eternal laws, they attributed their formation to
                    vortices of inflamed matter, supposing them to have only a temporary existence,
                    and to move in random directions through the fields of space. Diodorus says,
                    that they regarded the world as eternal and imperishable, and held that its
                    order is due, not to chance, but to a divine providence; that the planets, which
                    have peculiar motions, announce future events by their various aspects and
                    colours; that they portend rains, tempests, excessive heats; sometimes also the
                    appearance of comets, eclipses, earthquakes, and, in short, whatever has a
                    beneficial or hurtful influence on the fortunes of nations or individuals.</p>
                <p>From the few facts that can be gleaned from the vague accounts given by ancient
                    authors of the astronomy of the ancient Chaldeans, it may be inferred that their
                    boasted science was confined to observations of the simplest and rudest kind,
                    neither guided by theory, nor assisted by instruments; for, notwithstanding the
                    assertion of Herodotus, it is doubtful if they were acquainted even with the
                    gnomon, the simplest of all instruments for determining the obliquity of the
                    ecliptic, the altitude of the pole, and the length of the tropical year. If to
                    the knowledge of their lunisolar periods, the result of ages of observation, we
                    add the notion of a spherical revolution about an inclined axis, and an idea of
                    the principal circles of the sphere and the position of the poles, the sum will
                    comprehend all that constituted the science of a people regarded by antiquity as
                    having made the greatest progress in the science of the stars. Astronomy,
                    however, owes some obligations to their humble labours. The observations which
                    they recorded served to correct the theories that were afterwards imagined by
                    the more brilliant genius of the Greeks, and thereby furnished some materials
                    for the edifice of the world.</p>
                <p>The Egyptians were in ancient times the rivals of the Chaldeans in the
                    cultivation of astronomy; and although they have left behind them still fewer
                    monuments of their labours, they have obtained, through the exaggerated
                    statements of the Greeks, even a greater reputation. The Greeks acknowledge
                    themselves indebted to the Egyptians for their science and civilisation; but
                    regarding themselves likewise as descendants of that ancient people, they
                    indulged their vain-glory in magnifying the accounts of the antiquity and
                    knowledge of their supposed ancestors. It is not improbable that some
                    traditional observations of the heavens, along with some arts indispensable to
                    society even in its earliest stages, were carried into Europe by tribes
                    migrating from the banks of the Nile; and it is certain that the early
                    philosophers of Greece travelled into Egypt for the purpose of acquiring a more
                    perfect knowledge of astronomy than could be obtained in their own country. But
                    the facts from which it can be inferred that the Egyptians had much to
                    communicate, are few and ill attested. They are also blended with so much
                    absurdity and fable, that no accurate notions can be formed, from the accounts
                    that have been transmitted to us, of the real advances which that people had
                    made in astronomical science. The priests were the depositaries of the national
                    knowledge; and they carefully concealed it from the vulgar by shrouding it in
                    allegories, traces of which, it has been remarked, may be detected in the
                    institutions even of the present day.</p>
                <p>According to Diogenes Laertius, the Egyptians reckoned 48,853 years from Vulcan
                    to Alexander, during which they had observed 373 eclipses of the sun, and 832 of
                    the moon. These numbers in fact nearly express the relative proportion of the
                    eclipses of the two luminaries; but the enormous length of the period altogether
                    exceeds <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104960" xml:id="kp-eb0703-4960-0723"/>the
                    bounds of credibility; and it has been remarked that 'the same number of
                    eclipses might have been observed within the more probable period of twelve or
                    thirteen centuries. Supposing the numbers to be accurately stated, it will
                    follow that, as the observations terminated with the conquest of Alexander, the
                    Egyptians must have been in the habit of observing eclipses at least 1600 years
                    before the commencement of our era. By attentively observing the heliacal rising
                    of the star Sirius, to which they gave the name of Thaat, or Thoth (the
                    Watch-Dog), because its appearance shortly preceded the overflow of the waters
                    of the Nile, the Egyptians had discovered that the year consists of 365 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 4</hi>- days. This was their religious or sacred year. Their
                    civil year consisted of only 365 days; consequently the sacrifices and feasts,
                    which were regulated by it, successively corresponded to the different seasons.
                    Instead of attempting to obviate this inconvenience by intercalation, they
                    imposed an oath on their kings to maintain the use of the civil year,
                    superstitiously imagining that each of the seasons would be blessed and rendered
                    prosperous by enjoying in its turn the celebration of the feast of Isis. The
                    difference between the lengths of the sacred and civil year suggested to them
                    their famous sothic or canicular period of 1460 solar years, corresponding to
                    1461 civil years of 365 days, and which consequently brings back the months and
                    festivals to the same seasons. Dion Cassius ascribes the week to the Egyptians,
                    and says that they first dedicated a day to each of the planets; but it is
                    sufficiently proved that this short cycle was in use among the Chinese and
                    Indians from the remotest times, and was even known to the Druids of Gaul and
                    Britain. It was more probably suggested to different nations by the phases of
                    the moon. The Egyptians had likewise been attentive to the courses of the
                    planets. Diodorus Siculus affirms that they could explain the phenomena of the
                    stations and retrogradations; and Macrobius ascribes to them the knowledge of
                    the real motions of Mercury and Venus, and says that they regarded these planets
                    as satellites of the sun. This notion would do credit to their philosophy; but
                    it is unfortunately not mentioned by any other author, and for this reason the
                    testimony of Macrobius is suspected. The state of their practical astronomy may
                    in some measure be inferred from the means they employed to determine the
                    magnitude of the sun’s apparent diameter. By comparing the time, observed by
                    means of a clepsydra, which the sun takes to mount above the horizon at the
                    equinox, with that in which he makes a complete revolution of the sky, they
                    estimated his diameter at 28' 48". An observation of this kind is liable to
                    great uncertainty; and as there is no evidence that the Egyptians possessed the
                    slightest knowledge of spherical trigonometry, they would probably make no
                    allowance for the obliquity of the equator to their horizon; and if this
                    correction was left out of the calculation, as it probably was, their diameter,
                    already too small, ought to have been still farther reduced, and to have
                    amounted only to 24'42". It has been conjectured by Goguet, that the obelisks of
                    Egypt were intended to serve the purpose of gnomons; and this conjecture
                    acquires some probability from their needle-shaped form, and the narrowness of
                    their bases relatively to their heights. It has however been proved by MM.
                    Jollois and Devilliers, in their description of Thebes, that the obelisks were
                    connected with the walls of temples and palaces; a disposition which rendered
                    them entirely unfit for the purposes of astronomical observation. Their summits
                    were also of so unfavourable a form, that the Romans were obliged to surmount
                    them with a ball in order to obtain a distinct and well-defined shadow. The
                    pyramids have also been adduced as evidences of the early progress of astronomy
                    among the Egyptians; for the faces of these stupendous masses are turned
                    directly towards the four cardinal points, from which it is evident that the
                    people by whom they were constructed were at least acquainted with the method of
                    tracing a meridional line.</p>
                <p>From this brief account it appears, that the only circumstances with which we are
                    acquainted that imply the knowledge of astronomical methods among the Egyptians,
                    are the length of the year, the doubtful discovery of the true motions of
                    Mercury and Venus, and the position of the pyramids. The Chaldean observations
                    were of use to Hipparchus and Ptolemy in the determination of some important
                    elements; but those of the Egyptians exercised no influence whatever on the
                    future progress of the science.</p>
                <p>The Phoenicians are also generally enumerated among the nations who cultivated
                    astronomy at a very early period, though it does not appear, from any facts
                    mentioned by ancient authors, that they addicted themselves to the observation
                    of the heavens, or made any discoveries relative to the motions of the planets.
                    That they excelled in the art of navigation is certain, from the commercial
                    intercourse which they carried on with many places on the coasts of Africa and
                    Spain, and in the principal islands of the Mediterranean; and it may readily be
                    allowed that in their long voyages they would direct their course during the
                    night by the circumpolar stars. If they had any speculative notions of
                    astronomy, these were probably derived from the Chaldeans or Egyptians.</p>
                <p>In China, astronomy has been cultivated from the remotest ages, and always been
                    considered as a science indispensably necessary to the civil government of the
                    state. The Chinese boast of a series of eclipses, recorded in the annals of the
                    nation, extending over a period of 3858 years, all of which, they pretend, were
                    not only carefully observed, but calculated and figured previous to their
                    occurrence. The same motives which led the Chaldeans and Egyptians to attend to
                    the celestial phenomena, namely, the regulation and division of time, had equal
                    influence among the Chinese; and we accordingly find the care of the calendar
                    occupying the attention of their earliest princes. The emperor Fou-Hi, whose
                    reign commenced about 2857 years before our era, is said to have assiduously
                    studied the motions of the celestial bodies, and laboured to instruct his
                    ignorant subjects in the mysteries of astronomy. But as they were yet in too
                    rude a condition to be able to comprehend his theories, he was obliged to
                    content himself with giving them a rule for the computation of time by means of
                    the numbers 10 and 12, the combination of which produces the cycle of 60 years,
                    which is the standard or unit from which they deduce their hours, days, and
                    months. Tradition is silent with respect to the sources from which Fou-Hi
                    derived his own knowledge. The Chinese attribute to him also the invention of
                    arithmetic and music. In the year 2608 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.,</hi> Hoang-Ti
                    caused an observatory to be built, for the purpose of correcting the calendar,
                    which had already fallen into great confusion, and appointed one set of
                    astronomers to observe the course of the sun, another that of the moon, and a
                    third that of the stars. It was then discovered that the twelve lunar months do
                    not exactly correspond with a solar year; and that, in order to restore the
                    coincidence, it was necessary to intercalate seven lunations in the space of
                    nineteen years. If this fact rested on undoubted evidence, it would follow that
                    the Chinese had anticipated the Greeks by 2000 years in the discovery of the
                    Metonic cycle. The reign of Hoang-Ti is also rendered memorable by the
                    institution of the <hi rend="italic">Mathematical Tribunal,</hi> for promoting
                    the science of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104973" xml:id="kp-eb0703-4973-0724"
                    />astronomy, and regularly predicting eclipses, to which 'an extraordinary
                    importance has always been attached in China. The members of this celebrated
                    tribunal were made responsible with their lives for the accuracy of their
                    predictions, by a law of the empire, which ordained that, “whether the instant
                    of the occurrence of •any celestial phenomenon was erroneously assigned, or the
                    phenomenon itself not foreseen and predicted, either negligence should be
                    punished with death.” In the reign of Tchong-Kang, the two mathematicians of the
                    empire, Ho and Hi, were the victims of this absurd and sanguinary law; an
                    eclipse having taken place which their skill had not enabled them to
                    foresee.</p>
                <p>The emperor Yao, who mounted the throne, according to the Chinese annals, about
                    the year 2317 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.,</hi> gave a new impulse to the study
                    of astronomy, which had begun already to decline. He ordered his astronomers to
                    observe with the utmost care the motions of the sun and moon, of the planets and
                    the stars, and to determine the exact length of each of the four seasons. He
                    sent Hi-Tchong to the east to observe the star situated at the point of the
                    vernal equinox, Hi-Tchou to the south to examine that at the summer solstice,
                    Ho-Tchong to the west, and Ho-Tchou to the north, to observe those situated
                    respectively at the autumnal equinox and winter solstice. These docile observers
                    found stars in the positions assigned by the emperor; but the extraordinary
                    resemblance of their names imparts a fabulous air to the whole relation, and
                    excites a very excusable incredulity even with regard to those statements which
                    involve no improbability. To this emperor are attributed the Chinese division of
                    the zodiac into 28 constellations, called the houses of the moon, and the severe
                    laws already noticed in regard to the erroneous prediction of the celestial
                    phenomena.</p>
                <p>From the time of Yao the Chinese year consisted of 365^ days. They also divided
                    the circle into 365£ degrees, so that the sun daily described in his orbit an
                    arc of one Chinese degree. Their common lunar year consisted of 364¾-^- days;
                    and by combining this number with 365į, they formed the period of 4617 years,
                    after which the sun and moon again occupy the same relative positions.</p>
                <p>The earliest Chinese observations we are acquainted with, sufficiently precise to
                    afford any result useful to astronomy, were made by Tcheou-Kong, whose reign
                    commenced about the year 1100 before our era. Two of these observations are
                    meridional altitudes of the sun, observed with great care at the village of
                    Loyang, at the time of the summer and winter solstices. The obliquity of the
                    ecliptic thus determined at that remote epoch is 23° 54/ 3T5"; a result which
                    perfectly agrees with the theory of universal gravitation. Another observation,
                    made about the same time, relates to the position of the winter solstice in the
                    heavens; and it also corresponds to within a minute of a degree with the
                    calculations of Laplace. Laplace considers this extraordinary conformity as an
                    indubitable proof of the authenticity of those ancient observations.</p>
                <p>The golden age of Chinese astronomy extended from the reign of Fou-Hi to the year
                    480 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi>; that is, over a space of 2500 years. It is
                    only, however, towards the latter part of this long period that the history of
                    China becomes in any degree authentic; and the true date which must be assigned
                    for the commencement of observations on which any reliance can be placed, is the
                    year 722 B. c.; that is, 25 years posterior to the era of Nabonassar. From that
                    period to the year 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> Confucius reckons a
                    series of 36 eclipses, and of these 31 have been verified by modern astronomers,
                    After this the science fell into great neglect, notwithstanding the inveterate
                    tenacity with which the Chinese in general adhere to their ancient customs. The
                    decline of their astronomy is ascribed, whether justly or not, to the barbarous
                    policy of the emperor Tsin-Chi-Hong-Ti, who, in the year 221 B. c., ordered all
                    the books to be destroyed, excepting those only which related to agriculture,
                    medicine, and astrology, the only sciences which he considered as bein°∙ of any
                    use to mankind. His fury, it is true, was princio pally directed against those
                    of Confucius, the stern morality of which he felt to be a censure on his own
                    profligacy; but those of science and astronomy were included in the general
                    destruction. In this manner, it is said, the precious mass of astronomical
                    observations and precepts which had been accumulating forages was irretrievably
                    lost.</p>
                <p>Lieou-Pang, the successor of Tsin-Chi-Hong, endeavoured to repair the disaster,
                    by re-establishing the tribunal of the mathematics, and ordering a new series of
                    observations to be undertaken. About the year 104 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.
                    c.</hi> the astronomer Sse-Ma-Tsien gave some precepts for the calculation of
                    eclipses, the motions of the planets, and the syzygies. He employed instruments
                    of copper, the nature and construction of which are however not very well
                    understood, for measuring the extent of the 28 zodiacal constellations; and he
                    observed the meridional altitudes of the sun, by means of a gnomon 8 feet high.
                    The differences of right ascensions, and the intervals between the risings,
                    settings, and culminations of the stars, were measured by clepsydrae. It would
                    appear that after this period astronomical observations continued for some time
                    to be made in China with considerable regularity. In the 164th year of our era
                    the astronomer Tchang-Heng constructed armillary spheres and a celestial globe.
                    He also formed a catalogue of stars, which is said to have contained 2500, but
                    without either latitudes or longitudes; a circumstance which gives us a very
                    unfavourable idea of the state of practical astronomy at that time. About the
                    eighth century of our era, all knowledge of the science seems to have been again
                    lost. The predictions were erroneous; and the Chinese witnessed, with
                    superstitious terror, eclipses of which their astronomers had given them no
                    intimation. This induced the emperor Hieng-Tsong to call to his court the
                    astronomer Y-Hang, by whose indefatigable activity a reform was speedily
                    effected. With a view to determine the situations of the principal places of the
                    empire, this astronomer constructed gnomons, spheres, astrolabes, quadrants, and
                    other instruments; and sent one company of mathematicians to the south, and
                    another to the north, with directions to observe daily the altitudes of the sun
                    and the polar star. The latitudes of the cities were determined by observing the
                    shadow of the gnomon, and the longitudes by eclipses of the moon. Y-Hang had the
                    mortification of announcing two eclipses which did not take place. On these
                    occasions he alleged the usual excuse, namely, that his calculus was not in
                    error, but that the celestial bodies had deviated from their ordinary courses
                    out of respect to the virtues of the emperor. The fate of Ho and Hi had probably
                    suggested to the Chinese astronomers this ingenious mode of disarming the
                    emperor’s resentment by flattering his vanity.</p>
                <p>On considering attentively the accounts which have been given of the Chinese
                    astronomy', we find that it consisted only in the practice of observations which
                    led to nothing more than the knowledge of a few isolated facts. The missionaries
                    who were sent out by the Jesuits about the end of the seventeenth century, to
                    whom we are indebted for what is known of the early history <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193104986" xml:id="kp-eb0703-4986-0725"/>of China, either seduced by
                    some appearances of truth, or thinking it prudent to conciliate the people whom
                    they were attempting to convert, adopted their marvellous relations regarding
                    the antiquity of their science, and spread them over Europe. As the history of
                    the nation begins to become more authentic, their astronomy shrinks into its
                    real but insignificant dimensions. Superstitiously attached to their ancient
                    usages, and blindly adopting the habits of their ancestors, the Chinese
                    continued to observe the heavens from century to century without making the
                    slightest advances in theoretical knowledge. In later times they have adopted
                    many improvements, for which they are entirely indebted to foreigners. During
                    the time of the caliphs many Mahometans passed into China, carrying with them
                    the astronomical methods and knowledge of the Arabians. The missionaries
                    introduced the science of Europe; and the most that can be said in praise of the
                    Chinese is, that their government sometimes relaxed so far its spirit of
                    jealousy and exclusion, as to afford protection to these strangers, adopt their
                    arts, and place them at the head of the mathematical tribunal.</p>
                <p>The astronomy of the Indians forms one of the most curious problems which the
                    history of science presents to the consideration of the learned, and one which,
                    notwithstanding the numerous dissertations to which it has given rise, still
                    continues involved in great uncertainty. Of the science of the ancient nations,
                    of which we have already spoken, the accounts which have come down to our times
                    are founded on conjecture and tradition; for few monuments remain to confirm or
                    confute the glowing descriptions which authors have given of its high antiquity
                    and great perfection. But the claims of the Indians rest on more solid
                    foundations. We are in possession of the tables from which they compute the
                    eclipses and places of the planets, and of the methods by which they effect the
                    computation: we have, in short, an Indian astronomy committed to writing, which
                    represents the celestial phenomena with considerable exactness, and which,
                    therefore, could only be produced by a people far advanced in science. But the
                    difficulty of the problem consists in determining the sources from which this
                    science originated, and the epoch of its existence; whether it was created by
                    the people who now blindly follow its preeepts without understanding its
                    principles, or was communicated to them by another race of a bolder and more
                    original genius, through channels with which we are unacquainted. Some authors
                    regard India as the cradle of all the sciences, particularly of astronomy, which
                    they suppose to have been cultivated there from the remotest ages; others date
                    the origin of the Indian astronomy from the period when Pythagoras travelled
                    into that country, and carried thither the arts and sciences of the Greeks; a
                    third opinion is, that astronomy was conveyed to India by the Arabians in the
                    ninth century of our era, and that the Brahmins are only entitled to the humble
                    merit of adapting the rules and practices of that people to their own peculiar
                    methods of calculation. We shall endeavour to describe very briefly the existing
                    monuments of the Indian astronomy, which furnish the only data from which a
                    rational conjecture can be formed relative to its antiquity and precision.</p>
                <p>We possess four different sets of tables of Indian astronomy. The first which
                    were known in Europe were brought from Siam by La Loubère, who had resided in
                    that country as ambassador from Louis XIV. They were communicated by him to the
                    celebrated Cassini, who, notwithstanding the difficulties arising from the
                    complicated and useless operations which they directed, succeeded in detecting
                    the principles on which they were constructed, and in explaining their use and
                    signification. The date of these tables corresponds to the 21st of March in the
                    year 638 of our era. They suppose two species of years, the solar tropical year,
                    which they make to consist of 365 days 5 hours 50 min. and 4 sec., and the solar
                    anomalistic year, that is, the period in which the sun returns to its apogee,
                    which they estimate at 365 days 6 hours 12 min. 36 sec. This determination of
                    the length of the solar year is too great only by 1 min. 15 sec. By means of the
                    same tables the longitudes of the sun and moon are determined with considerable
                    accuracy. They contain a correction for the sun’s mean place, which corresponds
                    to the equation of the centre. At 90° from the apogee, where the inequality of
                    the sun’s motion is greatest, they estimate the requisite correction at 2° 12',
                    which is about 16’ too great. This determination deserves to be particularly
                    remarked, because, on account of a secular inequality of the eccentricity of the
                    sun’s orbit, there was once a time when the greatest value of the equation of
                    the centre was nearly 2° 12'; and this fact is adduced as a proof of the remote
                    antiquity of the observations from which the tables in question have been
                    constructed. These tables suppose the apogee to retain always the same position
                    relatively to the fixed stars; in reality it advances or gains on the stars
                    about 10" annually; but the supposition is still much nearer the truth than in
                    the system of Ptolemy, where the apogee is supposed to be absolutely at rest
                    with regard to the plane of the sun’s orbit, and consequently to fall back among
                    the stars by the whole quantity of the precession of the equinoxes, or about 50"
                    annually. With regard to the motions of the moon, they are deduced from a period
                    of 19 years, in whi <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> ch are comprehended nearly 235
                    lunations; so that the cycle of Meton appears to have been known in Siam as well
                    as in China. The moon’s apogee is supposed to have been in the beginning of the
                    movable zodiac 621 days after the epoch of the 21st of March 638, and to make an
                    entire revolution in the heavens in the space of 3232 days. The first of these
                    suppositions agrees with Mayer’s tables to within a degree, and the second
                    differs from them only by 11 hours 14 min. 31 sec. They contain only one
                    correction for the two principal inequalities of the moon’s motion, the equation
                    of the centre and the evection.</p>
                <p>A second set of Indian tables was sent from Chrisnabouram, a town in the
                    Carnatic, by Father Du Champ, to De Lisle, about the year 1750. They are fifteen
                    in number. They give the mean motions of the sun, moon, and planets; equations
                    of the centre for the. sun and moon; and two corrections for each of the
                    planets, one of which corresponds to the apparent, the other to the real
                    inequality. The epoch of these tables is not so ancient as that of the former.
                    It corresponds to the 10th of March, at sunrise, in the year 1491 of our era,
                    when the sun and moon were in conjunction.</p>
                <p>A third set of astronomical tables was sent from India by Father Patonillet, and
                    received by De Lisle about the same time with those of Chrisnabouram. These have
                    not the name of any particular place affixed to them; but being calculated for
                    the latitude of 16° 16', Bailly thinks it probable that they came from
                    Narsapour. Their epoch is midnight, between the 17th and 18th of March 1569.</p>
                <p>The fourth and last set of Indian tables which we possess have been published in
                    the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences. They were communicated by a learned
                    Brahmin of Tirvalore, a small town on the Coromandel coast, to the French
                    astronomer Legentil, who had gone to India to observe the transit of Venus in
                    1769. The tables <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104999"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-4999-0726"/>of Tirvalore, though somewhat different in form,
                    present many points of resemblance with those formerly known in Europe. They
                    suppose the same length of the year, the same inequalities of the sun and moon,
                    and they are adapted nearly to the same meridian. But while they correspond with
                    the other tables in these elements, they differ from them greatly in the
                    antiquity of their epoch, which goes back to the famous era of the Calyougham,
                    that is, the beginning of the year 3102 before Christ.</p>
                <p>Now, the only question to be determined with regard to the antiquity of the
                    Indian astronomy is, whether this epoch is real or fictitious; that is, whether
                    the state of the heavens at the commencement of the Calyougham, as assumed in
                    these tables, was actually determined by observation, or computed backwards from
                    observations of more modern date. The solution to this question can only be
                    obtained from the internal evidence afforded by the tables themselves; by
                    examining whether the elements and precepts which they furnish are of sufficient
                    accuracy to enable the places of the sun, moon, and planets to be calculated
                    through a period of 44 centuries, without involving errors which the refined
                    accuracy of the modern tables furnishes the means of detecting. A comparison of
                    the Indian with the modern tables has been made at great length by Bailly, who
                    imagines that he finds ample evidence of the reality of the era in question, and
                    of the existence of an astronomy prior to that period, hardly yielding in
                    accuracy to that which modern science has built on the theory of universal
                    gravitation. The theory of Bailly has been adopted, and put forth with
                    additional clearness and evidence, by the late Professor Playfair. One of the
                    principal arguments which these illustrious authors bring forward in support of
                    it is founded on the longitudes of the sun and moon. The mean place of the moon
                    at the commencement of the Calyougham, that is, at midnight, between the 17th
                    and 18th of February 3102 B. c., is stated by the Indian tables to be 306°. Her
                    mean place, computed from Mayer’s tables, without taking into account the
                    acceleration, with which the Indians in the 15th century were of course
                    unacquainted, is 300° 51' 16". Hence there would be a discrepancy of 5° 8' 44".
                    But, according to the theory and last tables of Laplace, the moon, in virtue of
                    the acceleration of her mean motion, has passed over an arc of very nearly 6°
                    more than she would have done had her mean motion continued uniform from the
                    period of the Calyougham to the date of Mayer’s tables. This added to 300° 51'
                    16" gives 306° 51' 16" for the mean longitude of the moon at the epoch of the
                    Calyougham, differing from the Indian determination by only 51' 16". Now, it is
                    argued that this is a degree of accuracy which could have been reached only by
                    actual observation, especially since, if the tables had been computed backwards,
                    the error arising from the acceleration alone would have amounted to more than
                    5°. Bailly computes the place of the moon at the same epoch, from all the
                    tables, Greek and Arabian, to which the Indians can be supposed to have had
                    access, and the discrepancies are so great as to render his conclusion almost
                    inevitable, that the Indian tables could not possibly have been drawn from such
                    sources. The tables of Ptolemy make the moon’s longitude at that time 11° 52' 7"
                    greater than the Indian tables; and those of Ulugh-Beigh, constructed at
                    Samarcand in 1437, give a difference of 6° also in excess.</p>
                <p>Similar results are obtained from the consideration of other elements. According
                    to the tables of Tirvalore, the tropical year consists of 365 days 5 hours 50
                    min. 35. sec. Lacaille makes it 365 days 5 hours 48 min. 49 sec. The difference
                    is 1 min. 46 sec. Now the tropical year, being affected by the precession of the
                    equinoxes, is subject to a secular inequality, which, according tc√ the theory
                    of Lagrange, renders it actually shorter by 40∙5 sec. at the present time than
                    it was at the commencement of the Calyougham. The error of the Indian tables is
                    thus reduced to 1 min. 5∙5 sec. In like manner, the obliquity of the ecliptic,
                    which has been gradually diminishing during a great number of centuries, is
                    supposed in the Indian tables to be greater than it is now found to be by
                    observation. The Brahmins estimate it at 24°. The formula of Lagrange makes the
                    variation, in 4800 years, amount to 22' 32". This therefore must be added to its
                    obliquity in 1700, that is, to 23° 28' 41", in order to have the true obliquity
                    at the commencement of the Calyougham. The sum is 23° 51' 13", and falls short
                    of the Indian determination by 8' 47". We shall mention only another element,
                    the equation of the centre of the sun. Bailly calculates that, according to the
                    theory of Lagrange, the equation of the sun’s centre, at the epoch of the
                    tables, was 2° 6' 28". The Indians make it 2° 10 ’ 32". The difference is only
                    about 4', and incomparably less than could have resulted from calculation by any
                    methods which we can suppose the Indians to have possessed.</p>
                <p>These arguments, it must be admitted, are exceedingly specious, but they are not
                    by any means convincing. Even with the best modern tables we could not, as
                    Bailly himself acknowledges, answer for the accuracy of the places of the sun
                    and moon computed for so remote an epoch. The corrections for the secular
                    inequalities amount in that long period to considerable quantities; and these
                    corrections are deduced by theory from elements with respect to which there
                    exists great uncertainty. And if we cannot be sure of the true places by
                    computing backwards from our own tables, with what degree of confidence can we
                    pronounce upon the accuracy of the places assigned in the tables of the Indians?
                    It may be said that comparisons of this kind can never be supposed to give
                    results perfectly alike. Granted: but if the discrepancies are such that the
                    lapse of a thousand years more or less is required to establish a rigorous
                    conformity, what becomes of the famous epoch of the Calyougham? Some of the
                    elements of the Indian tables could not have the values assigned to them but at
                    a long period before that epoch. In order to find their equation of the sun’s
                    centre, for example, it is necessary, according to the results of modern theory,
                    to go back to 6000 years before our era. The argument, therefore, proves too
                    much, and is consequently inconclusive. The different sets of tables of which we
                    have spoken are closely allied with each other, and the most probable
                    supposition is, that they are all derived from those of Chrisnabouram, of which
                    the epoch is 1491. At that era the Indians were acquainted with the instruments,
                    the geometry, and the researches of the Arabians and Greeks. Through this
                    channel the tables seem to have come into their possession. The Brahmins adapted
                    them to their own particular methods of computation, and threw back their epoch
                    to the period when, according to these tables, all the planets were in
                    conjunction with the sun. Every circumstance connected with the science of the
                    Indians conspires to give us the humblest ideas of its value. Their methods of
                    computation are encumbered with the unnecessary multiplications and divisions of
                    enormous numbers, endless additions, subtractions, and reductions, for the
                    purpose of obtaining numbers which could be put into technical verses, and even
                    adapted to songs; so that the astronomer might be enabled to effect hi∙s
                    calculations from memory alone, without its being necessary to have <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193105012" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5012-0727"/> recourse to
                    tables or books. But simple and rude as these methods are, if they were really
                    invented by the Brahmins, the science of that people must have greatly
                    retrograded; for at present they merely follow a blind routine, utterly ignorant
                    of theory, or the principles on which their processes are founded. Their
                    astronomy, whether of ancient or recent origin, has produced no effect whatever
                    on that of Europe; it has no filiation or connection with the science of the
                    present day, and therefore has no other claim on our attention than such as may
                    result from motives of mere curiosity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The origin of astronomy in Greece, as in other early nations, ascends beyond the
                    period of authentic history, and is concealed amidst the fables and traditions
                    of the remotest times. During the darkness of the heroic ages some gleams of an
                    acquaintance with the motions of the stars occasionally burst forth; and some
                    traces appear of astronomical observations, probably derived from Egypt, the
                    country which also furnished Greece with its gods and its arts. The Greeks seem
                    to have divided the heavens into constellations about 13 or 14∣ centuries before
                    the Christian era; for the sphere of Eudoxus, which is probably one of the
                    fruits of the famous voyage of the Argonauts, must be referred to that period.
                    Their early attention to the appearances of the heavens is sufficiently attested
                    by their mythological fables, the greater part of which are only allegories of
                    the celestial motions, and of the operations of nature. The lively fancy and
                    brilliant imagination of this ingenious people strewed flowers in the most
                    rugged paths, and spread agreeable images over the driest and most uninviting
                    subjects: hence the sky was quickly covered with legends of the loves and
                    exploits of gods and heroes. It would be foreign to our present purpose to enter
                    into an enumeration of these fables, or attempt to trace their connection with
                    the first dawnings of astronomy: we shall content ourselves with barely alluding
                    to Uranus, to Atlas and his son Hesperus, who gave his name to the planet Venus;
                    also to his daughters the Atlantides, from whom the Pleiades received their
                    appellation; to Endymion, who, on the summit of Mount Latmos, held nocturnal
                    converse with the chaste Diana; to Hercules; and Chiron the centaur, who taught
                    men the use of the constellations; Musaeus, who imagined the figures of men and
                    animals which cover the celestial sphere; Orpheus and Linus, who explained the
                    théogonies; Atreus, from whose banquet the sun fled back with horror; and
                    Tiresias, who was struck blind for having witnessed some secret of the gods.</p>
                <p>The true foundations of Grecian science were laid by Thales, who was born at
                    Miletus 640 years before our era. He was descended from an illustrious family,
                    which had formerly reigned in Phoenicia, and inherited an ample fortune, which
                    he expended in collecting the expiring embers of oriental science. Instigated by
                    the love of knowledge, he travelled first into Crete, and afterwards into Egypt,
                    where he was initiated into the mysteries of the priests, to whom, in return, he
                    is said to have taught the method of measuring the height of the pyramids by
                    comparing their shadows with those of known objects. Returned to his own
                    country, he publicly taught the truths he had collected during his travels, and
                    formed a sect which has been distinguished by the title of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ionian School.</hi> His doctrines regarding astronomy contain a few truths
                    which do honour to his sagacity and observation, though they are mixed with much
                    error and absurdity. He taught that the stars are formed of fire; that the moon
                    receives her light from the sun, and is invisible at her conjunctions, because
                    she is hid in the sun’s rays. He also taught the sphericity of the earth, which
                    he placed at the centre of the world. He divided the sphere into five zones, by
                    the arctic and antarctic circles, and the two tropics; and held that the equator
                    is cut obliquely by the ecliptic, and perpendicularly by the meridian. He is
                    also said to have observed eclipses; and Herodotus relates that he predicted the
                    famous one which put a stop to the war between the Medes and the Lydians. It
                    does not appear, however, that he ventured to assign either the day or the month
                    of the eclipse, so that his prediction must have been confined to the year.
                    According to Callimachus, he determined the positions of the stars which form
                    the Lesser Bear, by which the Phoenicians guided themselves in their voyages. It
                    is difficult, however, to conceive how Thales, unacquainted with instruments,
                    could determine the positions of stars with so much accuracy as to render any
                    essential assistance to the navigator. It is probable that he only pointed out
                    the configuration, and some of the more brilliant stars of that constellation,
                    among which he might remark that which is nearest the pole of the world.</p>
                <p>Thales was succeeded by Anaximander, to whom is also attributed the invention of
                    the sphere, and the knowledge of the zodiac. According to Diogenes Laertius, he
                    supposed, like his master Thales, the earth to be spherical, and placed at the
                    centre of the universe; but Plutarch ascribes to him the less philosophical
                    opinion of its resemblance to a column. He supposed the sun to be of equal
                    magnitude with the earth. He invented the gnomon, and placed one at Lacedaemon
                    to observe the solstices and equinoxes. But the circumstance which does most
                    honour to Anaximander, and which entitles him to the gratitude of posterity, is
                    the invention of geographical charts. He is said also to have believed in the
                    plurality of worlds,—a sublime idea, which was adopted by almost every
                    succeeding philosopher of Greece.</p>
                <p>Anaximenes succeeded Anaximander in the Ionian school, and maintained nearly the
                    same doctrines. Pliny says he was the first who taught the art of constructing
                    dials,—an invention which, as we have just seen, has also been ascribed to
                    Anaximander. These two philosophers probably revived the knowledge of an
                    instrument the use of which had been forgotten amidst the general rudeness and
                    ignorance of their countrymen. Before their time the Greeks only marked the
                    divisions of the day by the different lengths of the sun’s shadow.</p>
                <p>Anaxagoras was the disciple and successor of Anaximenes. If this philosopher
                    really entertained the ridiculous opinions ascribed to him by Plutarch, the
                    Ionian school must rather have retrograded than advanced in sound philosophy
                    from the time of Thales. He is said to have believed that the sun is a mass of
                    red-hot iron, or of heated stone, somewhat bigger than the Peloponnesus,— that
                    the heaven is a vault of stones, which is prevented from tumbling only by the
                    rapidity of its circular motion,— and that the sun is prevented from advancing
                    beyond the tropics by a thick and dense atmosphere, which forces <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193105025" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5025-0728"/>him to retrace his course.
                    These absurd notions are pro- ' bably greatly exaggerated; but it does not
                    appear that Anaxagoras contributed much to extend the knowledge of the heavens.
                    A melancholy interest is, however, excited in his behalf, on account of the
                    persecution which he suffered in consequence of his liberal opinions and his
                    disregard for the superstitious notions of his age. Having shown the reason of
                    the eclipses of the moon, he was accused of ascribing to natural causes the
                    attributes and power of the gods. Having taught the existence of only one God,
                    he was accused of impiety and treason towards his country. Sentence of death was
                    pronounced on the philosopher and all his family; and it required the powerful
                    interest of his friend and disciple Pericles to obtain a commutation of this
                    iniquitous sentence into one of perpetual banishment.</p>
                <p>While the Ionian sect was so successfully employed in cultivating and propagating
                    a knowledge of nature in Greece, another, still more celebrated, was founded in
                    Italy by Pythagoras. This renowned philosopher was in early youth a disciple of
                    Thales. In quest of knowledge, which in those days could only be obtained by
                    visiting the sages of foreign lands, he travelled into Egypt, Phoenicia,
                    Chaldea, and India, where his memory is said still to subsist. Through the
                    favour of Amadis, king of Egypt, to whom he was recommended by Polycrates, the
                    tyrant of Samos, he was admitted into the sacred college at Memphis, though with
                    great reluctance on the part of the priests. The severe ordeal through which
                    these charlatans compelled him to pass, before they would consent to initiate
                    him into their mysteries, was sufficient to have deterred the most courageous
                    votary of knowledge; and Pythagoras was probably the only stranger who ever
                    succeeded in fully exploring their secrets. After an absence of thirty years he
                    returned to Greece, and began to give instructions in his native island of
                    Samos. Soon after, he passed over to the Grecian colony established at Tarentum
                    in Italy, and settled at Crotona, where he speedily acquired a splendid
                    reputation. He was the first who assumed the modest title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >philosopher,</hi> or lover of wisdom: formerly those who devoted themselves to
                    the acquisition of learning were called <hi rend="italic">sophists</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">sages.</hi></p>
                <p>Pythagoras is said to have acquired in Egypt the knowledge of the obliquity of
                    the ecliptic, and that of the identity of the morning and evening stars. What he
                    chiefly deserves to be commemorated for in the history of astronomy, is his
                    philosophical doctrine regarding the motion of the earth. He taught publicly
                    that the earth is placed at the centre of the universe; but among his chosen
                    disciples he propagated the doctrine that the sun occupies the centre of the
                    planetary world, and that the earth is a planet circulating about the sun. This
                    system, which still retains his name, being called the old or Pythagorean system
                    of the universe, is that which was revived by Copernicus. It is, however, only
                    just to the memory of this last mentioned great man to observe, that there is a
                    vast difference between the bare statement of the possibility of a fact, and the
                    demonstration of its existence by irrefragable arguments. Pythagoras having
                    remarked the relation which subsists between the tone of a musical chord and the
                    rapidity of its vibration, was led by analogy to extend the same relation to the
                    planets, and to suppose that they emit sounds proportional to their respective
                    distances, and form a celestial concert too melodious to affect the gross organs
                    of mankind. Another fancy into which he was led by his passion for analogies was
                    the application of the five geometrical solids to the elements of the world. The
                    cube symbolically represented the earth; the pyramid, fire; the octaedron, air;
                    the icosaedron, or twenty-sided figure, water; and the do-decaedron, or figure
                    with twelve faces, the exterior sphere of the universe. Pythagoras left no
                    writings; and it is doubtful whether he really entertained many of the opinions
                    and reveries which have usually been ascribed to him.</p>
                <p>Philolaus of Crotona, a disciple of Pythagoras, embraced the doctrine of his
                    master with regard to the revolution of the earth about the sun. He supposed the
                    sun to be a disk of glass which reflects the light of the world. He made the
                    lunar month consist of 29∣ days, the lunar year of 354 days, and the solar year
                    of 365∣ days.</p>
                <p>Nicetas of Syracuse seems to have been the first who openly taught the
                    Pythagorean system of the universe. Cicero, on the authority of Theophrastus,
                    the ancient historian of astronomy, gives hirtι the credit of maintaining that
                    the apparent motion of the stars arises from the diurnal motion of the earth
                    about its axis;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Nicetas
                    Syracusius, uţ ait Theophrastus, coelum, solem, lunam, stellas, supera denique

                    circum axem se summa celeritate convertat et torqueat, eadem effici omnia,
                    quasi, stante terra, coelum moveretur.” (Cicero, <hi rend="italic">Acad.

                    greater precision.</p></note> but this’rational doctrine seems to have been
                    first broached by Heraclides of Pontus, and Ecphantus, a disciple of
                    Pythagoras.</p>
                <p>The introduction of the Metonic cycle forms an era in the history of the early
                    astronomy of Greece. The Chaldeans, as we have already stated, established
                    several lunisolar periods; and the difficulty of reconciling the motions of the
                    sun and moon, or of assigning a period at the end of which these two luminaries
                    again occupy the same positions relatively to the stars, had long embarrassed
                    those who had the care of regulating the festivals. Meton and Euctemon had the
                    honour of first obviating this difficulty, at least for a time; for the motions
                    of the sun and moon being incommensurable, no period can be assigned which will
                    bring them back to precisely the same situations. These two astronomers formed a
                    cycle of nineteen lunar years, twelve of which contained each 12 lunations, and
                    the seven others each 13, which they intercalated among the former. It had long
                    been known that the synodic month consisted of 29∣ days nearly; and in order to
                    avoid the fraction, it had been usual to make the twelve synodic months, which
                    compose the solar year, to consist of 29 and 30 days alternately; the former
                    being called <hi rend="italic">deficient</hi> and the latter <hi rend="italic"
                    >full</hi> months. Meton made his period to consist of 125 full and 110
                    deficient months, which gives 6940 days for the 235 lunations, and is nearly
                    equal to 19 solar years. This cycle commenced on the 16th of July in the year
                    433 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> It was received with acclamation by the
                    people assembled at the Olympic games, and adopted in all the cities and
                    colonies of Greece. It was also engraved in golden letters on tables of brass,
                    whence it received the appellation of the <hi rend="italic">golden number,</hi>
                    and has been the basis of the calendars of all the nations of modern Europe. It
                    is still in ecclesiastical use, with such modifications as time has rendered
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>Eudoxus of Cnidus, about the year 370 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi>, obtained;
                    great reputation as an astronomer. According to Pliny,' he introduced the year
                    of 365į-days into Greece. Archimedes says that he supposed the diameter of the
                    sun to be nine times greater than that of the moon, which shows that he had in
                    some degree overcome the illusions <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105038"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5038-0729"/>of sense. The titles of three of his works have
                    been preserved—the <hi rend="italic">Period or Circumference of the Earth,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">Phenomena,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Mirror.</hi> His
                    observatory was still standing at Cnidus in the time of Strabo. His memory
                    deserves to be honoured for the contempt which he evinced for the Chaldean
                    predictions, and for having contributed to separate true astronomy from the
                    reveries of judicial astrology. Eudoxus seems to have been the first who
                    attempted to give a mechanical explanation of the apparent motions of the
                    planets. He supposed each planet to occupy a particular part of the heavens, and
                    that the path which it describes is determined by the combined motion of several
                    spheres performed in different directions. The sun and moon had each three
                    spheres; one revolving round an axis which passes through the poles of the
                    world, and which occasions the diurnal motion; a second revolving round the
                    poles of the ecliptic, in a contrary direction, and causing the annual and
                    monthly revolutions; the third revolving in a direction perpendicular to the
                    first, and causing the changes of declination. Each of the planets had a fourth
                    sphere to explain the stations and retrogradations. As new inequalities and
                    motions were discovered, new spheres were added, till the machinery became so
                    complicated as to be altogether unintelligible.</p>
                <p>Although Plato can hardly be cited as an astronomer, yet the progress of the
                    science was accelerated by means of the lights struck out by his sublime and
                    penetrating genius. He seems to have had just notions of the causes of eclipses;
                    and he imagined that the celestial bodies originally moved in straight lines,
                    but that gravity altered their directions, and compelled them to move in'curves.
                    He proposed to astronomers the problem of representing the courses of the stars
                    and planets by circular and regular motions. Geometry was assiduously cultivated
                    in the school of Plato; and on this account he claims a distinguished place
                    among the promoters of true astronomy.</p>
                <p>Astronomy is also under some obligations to Aristotle. In a treatise which he
                    composed on this science, he recorded a number of observations which he had
                    made; and, among others, mentions an eclipse of Mars by the moon, and the
                    occultation of a star in the constellation Gemini by the planet Jupiter. As such
                    phenomena are of rare occurrence, their observation proves that he had paid
                    considerable attention to the planetary motions.</p>
                <p>A great number of astronomers about this time appear on the stage, whose labours
                    and observations prepared the way for the reformation of the science which was
                    shortly after effected by Hipparchus. Helicon of Cizi-cene is renowned for the
                    prediction of an eclipse, which took place, as Plutarch affirms, at the time
                    announced. History records the names of only three individuals in ancient Greece
                    who predicted eclipses, Thales, Helicon, and Eudcmus. Eudcmus composed a history
                    of astronomy, a fragment of which, consisting of only a few lines, is preserved
                    by Fabricius in the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Groeca.</hi> In this it is
                    mentioned that the axes of the ecliptic and equator arc separated from each
                    other by the side of a pente-decagon, which is equivalent to saying that they
                    contain an angle of 24°. This is the first value which we find assigned by the
                    Greeks to the obliquity of the ecliptic. It is given in round numbers, and may
                    easily be supposed to contain an error of a quarter of a degree.</p>
                <p>Calippus is celebrated for the period which he formed of four Metonic cycles.
                    Having observed, by means of an eclipse of the moon which took place about six
                    years before the death of Alexander, that the Metonic cycle contained an error
                    of a fourth of a day, he introduced the period of 940 lunations, containing four
                    Metonic cycles, diminished by one day. He likewise formed a collection of
                    observations on the heliacal risings of the planets. Theophrastus wrote a
                    history of astronomy, and supposed the milky way to be produced by the imperfect
                    junction of the two hemispheres, which allowed the light to penetrate from the
                    firmament beyond. Autolycus of Pitaneas wrote two books, one on the movable
                    sphere, the other on the risings and settings of the stars. These are the most
                    ancient of the astronomical works of the Greeks which have come down to our
                    times.</p>
                <p>Pytheas of Marseilles, about the time of Alexander the Great, determined the
                    length of the solstitial shadows in various countries by means of the gnomon. He
                    found the shadows equal at Marseilles and Byzantium—a circumstance which does
                    not give a favourable idea of the accuracy of his observations, inasmuch as the
                    difference of the latitudes of the two places amounts to 2∣ degrees. The
                    observation is, however, interesting, as it is the most ancient of the kind
                    which has been preserved after that of Tcheou-Kong, and as it confirms the
                    successive diminution of the obliquity of the ecliptic. Pytheas undertook
                    several voyages for the purpose of obtaining geographical and astronomical
                    information, and advanced northwards as far as Iceland. His relations have been
                    treated as fabulous by Strabo and Polybius, but the accuracy of the greater
                    number of them has been confirmed by modern observation and experience. He was
                    the first who distinguished the climates by the different lengths of the days
                    and nights.</p>

                <p>In the history of the various sects which have hitherto come under our review, we
                    meet only with some useful remarks, with numerous hypotheses and conjectures,
                    but with scarcely any appearance of regular and connected science. Up to this
                    date the astronomical knowledge of the Greeks was confined to a few facts, the
                    discovery of which implies no theory, and scarcely the aid even of the simplest
                    instruments. The order and arrangement of the planets, the causes of eclipses,
                    the identity of the morning and evening stars, the approximate length of the
                    year, that of the lunar month, the obliquity of the ecliptic, and the cycles of
                    Meton and Calippus, were almost the sole results of their astronomical
                    speculations. In the Alexandrian school we meet for the first time with regular
                    and systematic observations. We there find angular distances measured with
                    appropriate instruments, and calculations made according to the rules of
                    trigonometry.</p>
                <p>After the premature death of Alexander, his principal generals shared among
                    themselves his magnificent conquests, and Egypt fell to the lot of Ptolemy
                    Soter. This prince was distinguished by an ardent love of science, and a desire
                    to promote every species of liberal knowledge. He accordingly invited to his
                    court, which he had established at Alexandria, the most eminent philosophers of
                    Greece, and fixed them there by his liberality and munificent protection. His
                    son, Ptolemy Philadelphus, who inherited his throne, also inherited his genius
                    and love of science and learning. A superb edifice, styled the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Museum,</hi> was assigned to the use of the men of science whom he had
                    attracted to his capital, to which he also added an observatory, and the famous
                    library, which had been collected with great care and at a vast expense by
                    Demetrius Phalerius. The prince took great delight in the Museum; he visited it
                    frequently, entered into familiar conversation with its inmates on the subject
                    of their various pursuits, and by his own example stimulated their <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193105051" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5051-0730"/> zeal and
                    encouraged their inquiries. This noble institution, which survived all the
                    vicissitudes of nine centuries, was the means of conferring incalculable
                    benefits on the human race; and the name of its founder, Ptolemy Philadelphus,
                    will be gratefully remembered while science and learning occupy a place in the
                    estimation of mankind.</p>
                <p>The first astronomers of the Alexandrian school were Aristillus and Timocharis,
                    who flourished under the first Ptolemy, about 300 years before Christ. The chief
                    object of their labours was the determination of the relative positions of the
                    principal stars of the zodiac, instead of merely announcing their risings and
                    settings, as had been the practice of the orientals and the ancient Greeks. The
                    observations of these two astronomers conducted Hipparchus to the important
                    discovery of the precession of the equinoxes, and served as the basis of the
                    theory which Ptolemy, some centuries afterwards, gave of that phenomenon.</p>
                <p>Aristarchus of Samos, the next in order of the Alexandrian astronomers, composed
                    a treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Magnitudes</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Distances</hi> of the sun and moon, which has been preserved to our times. In
                    this treatise he describes an ingenious method which he employed to obtain the
                    relative distances of the two luminaries. At the instant when the moon is
                    dichotomized, that is, when the exact half of her disk appears to a spectator on
                    the earth to be illuminated by the sun’s light, the visual ray passing from the
                    centre of the moon to the eye of the observer is perpendicular to the line which
                    joins the centre of the moon and sun. At that instant, therefore, he measured
                    the angular distance of the two bodies, and finding it to be 87 degrees, he
                    concluded, by the resolution of a right-angled triangle, that the distance of
                    the sun is between eighteen and nineteen times greater than that of the moon.
                    This method is perfectly correct in theory, but it is difficult to be assured of
                    the exact instant of the moon’s dichotomy, and in an angle of such magnitude a
                    very small error greatly affects the result. The error of Aristarchus is very
                    considerable, the true angle being about 87° 50'. The estimated distance of the
                    sun is by consequence far too small; yet the determination, faulty as it was,
                    contributed to expand greatly the existing notions relative to the boundaries of
                    the universe, for the Pythagoreans had taught that the sun is only three, or at
                    most three and a half times more distant than the moon. Another delicate
                    observation made by Aristarchus was that of the magnitude of the sun’s diameter,
                    which, as we learn from Archimedes, he determined to be the 720th part of the
                    circumference of the circle which the sun describes in his diurnal revolution.
                    This estimate is not very far from the truth, and the observation is by no means
                    an easy one. He embraced the doctrine of Pythagoras respecting the earth’s
                    motion, and appears to have entertained juster notions than any of the
                    astronomers who preceded him, on the magnitude and extent of the universe. The
                    treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Magnitudes</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Distances</hi> is published in the third volume of the works of Dr Wallis, with
                    a Latin translation by Commandine, and Some notes.</p>
                <p>Eratosthenes, the successor of Aristarchus, was a native of Cyrene, and invited
                    to Alexandria by Ptolemy Evergetes, who appointed him keeper of the royal
                    library. He is supposed to have been the inventor of armillary spheres, a
                    species of instrument extensively used by the ancient astronomers. Byjneans of
                    an instrument of this kind he observed the distance between the tropics to be to
                    the whole circumference of a great circle as 11 to 83; a ratio equivalent to 47°
                    42' 39", half of which gives 23° 51' 19∙5" for the obliquity of the ecliptic.
                    This is a very important observation, and confirms the gradual diminution of the
                    obliquity as indicated by theory. Eratosthenes is Celebrated for being the first
                    who attempted, on correct principles, to determine the magnitude of the earth.
                    Having remarked, by some means with which we are unacquainted, that Syene, the
                    most southern of the cities of ancient Egypt, is situated nearly on the same
                    meridian with Alexandria, he conceived the idea of determining the amplitude of
                    the celestial arch intercepted between the zeniths of the two places, and of
                    measuring at the same time their distance on the ground; operations which would
                    afford data for the determination of the whole length of the terrestrial
                    meridian. Syene was known to be situated exactly under the tropic; for at the
                    summer solstice the gnomon had no shadow, and the sun’s rays illumined the
                    bottom of a deep well in that city. On the day of the solstice he found the
                    meridional distance of the sun from the zenith of Alexandria to be 7° 12', or a
                    fiftieth part of the circumference. It had also been ascertained by the <hi
                    rend="italic">bematists</hi> or surveyors of Alexander and the Ptolemies, that
                    the itinerary distance between Alexandria and Syene was 5000 stadia; therefore
                    5000 × 50 = 250,000 stadia form the circumference of a great circle of the
                    earth, or the length of the terrestrial meridian. Unfortunately, on account of
                    the uncertainty respecting the length of the stadium here employed, we possess
                    no means of estimating the degree of approximation afforded by this rude though
                    ingenious attempt; but the idea does immortal honour to Eratosthenes, and the
                    moderns have added nothing to his method: their better success is owing solely
                    to the progress of the arts and the perfection of astronomical instruments.</p>
                <p>About this time the science of astronomy was enriched by the discoveries of some
                    of the distinguished geometricians whose labours have so greatly extended the
                    glory of the Alexandrian school. Euclid, the celebrated author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements,</hi> lived in the reign of the first Ptolemy. He
                    composed a book on the sphere, which probably served as a model for future works
                    of the same kind, and was the first who treated in a geometrical manner of the
                    phenomena of the different inclinations of the sphere. Conon of Samos, the
                    friend of Archimedes, collected the records of eclipses, which had been observed
                    by the ancient Egyptians; and Callimachus ascribes to him the constellation of
                    Berenice’s hair. Archimedes, whose profound genius and deep knowledge of
                    geometry and mechanics entitle him to the appellation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Newton</hi> of the ancients, also claims a high rank among the cultivators of
                    astronomy. His celebrated planetarium, which represented the motions of the sun,
                    moon, planets, and starry sphere, has been a frequent theme of the admiration
                    and praises of the poets:</p>
                <p>Jura poli, rerumque fidem, legesque deorum, Ecce Syracusius transtulit arte
                    senex.</p>
                <p>Apollonius of Perga solved the important problem of the stations and
                    retrogradations of the planets by means of epicyles and deferents; and he is
                    entitled to the glory of having formed the alliance between the two sciences of
                    geometry and astronomy, which has been productive of the greatest advantages to
                    both.</p>
                <p>Astronomy, which had as yet only consisted of a knowledge of isolated facts,
                    acquired a systematic form, and almost a new existence, from the genius and
                    assiduity of Hipparchus, one of the most astonishing men of antiquity, and
                    perhaps the greatest of all in the sciences which are not purely speculative.
                    This illustrious founder of astronomical science was born at Nice in Bythinia,
                    and observed<pb break="no" facs="nls:193105064" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5064-0731"/>
                    at Rhodes. Flamsteed and Cassini, probably mis-Aed by some ambiguous expressions
                    of Ptolemy, have related that his observations were made at Alexandria; and this
                    opinion seems generally to have been adopted by historians. The question has
                    been examined carefully, and at considerable length, by Delambre <hi
                    rend="italic">(Astronomie Ancienne),</hi> who comes to the conclusion that there
                    is no reason whatever to infer that Hipparchus ever saw Alexandria. Ptolemy, in
                    reporting the observations of Hipparchus, supposed Rhodes and Alexandria to be
                    situated on the same meridian, and consequently does not find it necessary to
                    mention the place at which the observations were made.</p>
                <p>Hipparchus commenced his brilliant career by verifying the determination of the
                    obliquity of the ecliptic made by Eratosthenes. He next directed his attention
                    to the length of the tropical year. By comparing an observation of his own, of
                    the summer solstice, with a similar one made by Aristarchus 140 years before, he
                    found that the anciently received value of 365į days was too great by seven
                    minutes. This leaves the tropical year a value still too great; but it is
                    probable that the error arose from the inaccuracy of the observation of
                    Aristarchus: for the observations of Hipparchus, compared with those of the
                    moderns, make the length of the tropical year amount to 365 days, 5 hours, and
                    49 minutes, which is only 12 seconds greater than the truth. By a careful
                    observation of the solstices and equinoxes, he discovered that the year is not
                    divided by these points into four equal parts, the sun occupying 94⅜ days in
                    passing from the vernal equinox to the summer solstice, and only 92į from the
                    same solstice to the equinox of autumn. The sun, consequently, remained 187 days
                    in that part of the ecliptic which lies between the equator and the north pole,
                    and therefore only about 178 in the other part. This observation led Hipparchus
                    to the great discovery of the eccentricity of the solar orbit. He accounted for
                    the apparent inequality of the sun’s motion, by supposing that the earth is not
                    placed exactly at the centre of the circular orbit of the sun, and that
                    consequently his distance from the earth is subject to variation. When the sun
                    is at his greatest distance, he appears to move more slowly; and when he
                    approaches nearer, his motion becomes more rapid. The distance of the earth from
                    the centre of the orbit is called the <hi rend="italic">eccentricity</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">:</hi> it produces an equation between the real and apparent
                    motions, which is called the <hi rend="italic">equation of the centre.</hi> He
                    determined the magnitude of this equation in terms of the radius of the
                    ecliptic, and fixed the position of the line of the apsides, or that which joins
                    the two opposite points of the orbit which are at the greatest and least
                    distance from the earth. With these data he formed the first tables of the sun
                    which are mentioned in the history of astronomy. The discovery of the
                    eccentricity also led Hipparchus to that of the inequality of the lengths of the
                    solar days at different seasons of the year. In the interval which elapses
                    between the sun’s passage over the meridian and his return to it the following
                    day, the sun advances by his own proper motion towards the east nearly a degree.
                    But the rate of this motion is unequal, varying between 57 and 61 minutes of a
                    degree; and the accumulation of · the inequalities forms what iā called the
                    equation of time, that is, the difference between the true time, as shown by the
                    sun, and the mean time, shown by a well-regulated clock, the motions of which
                    are equal and uniform.</p>
                <p>The attention of Hipparchus was next directed to the motions of the moon; and on
                    this subject his researches were attended with equal success. From the
                    comparison of a great number of the most circumstantial and
                    accurate-observations of eclipses recorded by the Chaldeans, he was enabled to
                    determine the period of the moon’s revolution relatively to the stars, to the
                    sun, to her nodes, and to her apogee. These determinations are among the most
                    precious relics of ancient astronomy, inasmuch as they corroborate the results
                    of theory in one of its finest deductions—the acceleration of the mean lunar
                    motion—and thus furnish one of the most delicate tests of the truth of Newton’s
                    law of gravitation. It was, indeed, by a comparison of the observations of
                    Hipparchus with those of the Arabian and modern astronomers, that Dr Halley was
                    led to the discovery of that curious and important phenomenon. Hipparchus also
                    determined the eccentricity of the lunar orbit, and its inclination to the plane
                    of the ecliptic; and the values which he assigned to these elements, making
                    allowance for the evection and the inequalities of the moon’s motion in
                    latitude, are to a few minutes the same as those which are now observed. He had
                    also an idea of the second inequality of the moon’s motion, namely, the
                    eveetion, and made all the necessary preparations for a discovery which was
                    reserved for Ptolemy. He likewise approximated to the parallax of the moon,
                    which he attempted to deduce from that of the sun, by determining the length of
                    the frustum cut off from the cone of the terrestrial shadow by the moon when she
                    traverses it in her eclipses. From the parallax he concluded that the greatest
                    and least distances of the moon are respectively equal to 78 and 67
                    semi-diameters of the earth, and that the distance of the sun is equal to 1300
                    of the same semi-diameters. The first of these determinations exceeds the truth;
                    the second falls greatly short of it, the distance of the sun being nearly equal
                    to 24,000 terrestrial semi-diameters. It may, however, be remarked that Ptolemy,
                    who undertook to correct Hipparchus with regard to the parallax, deviated still
                    farther from the truth.</p>
                <p>The apparition of a new star in the time of Hipparchus induced him to undertake
                    the formation of a catalogue of all the stars visible above his horizon, to fix
                    their relative positions, and mark their configurations, in order that posterity
                    might have the means of observing any changes which might in future take place
                    in the state of the heavens. This arduous undertaking was rewarded by the
                    important discovery of the precession of the equinoxes, one of the fundamental
                    elements of astronomy. By comparing his own observations with those of
                    Aristillus and Timocharis, he found that the first point of Aries, which, in the
                    time of these astronomers, or 150 years before, corresponded with the vernal
                    equinox, had advanced two degrees, according to the order of the signs, or at
                    the rate of 48 seconds a year. This determination is not very far from the
                    truth; for, according to modern observations, the rate of the precession is
                    about 50T seconds annually. His catalogue contained 1080 stars: it is generally,
                    but erroneously, stated to have contained only 1022, after that of Ptolemy, in
                    which the nebulous and some obscure stars are omitted. He also commenced a
                    series of observations to furnish his successors with the means of forming a
                    theory of the planets. Hipparchus likewise invented the planisphere, or method
                    of representing the starry firmament on a plane surface, which afforded the
                    means of solving the problems of spherical trigonometry in a manner often more
                    exact and more commodious than the globe itself. He was the first who
                    demonstrated the methods of calculating triangles, whether rectilineal or
                    spherical; and he constructed a table of chords, from which he drew nearly the
                    same advantages as we derive at present from the tables of sines. Geography is
                    also indebted to him for the happy idea of fixing the position of places on <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193105077" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5077-0732"/> the earth by
                    means of their latitudes and longitudes; 'and he was the first who determined
                    the longitude by the eclipses of the moon.</p>
                <p>These various labours and brilliant discoveries give a high idea of the industry
                    and genius of Hipparchus. His writings have unfortunately all perished,
                    excepting a commentary on the poem of Aratus; but the principal elements of his
                    theories, together with a few observations, have been preserved in the Almagest
                    of Ptolemy.</p>
                <p>After the death of Hipparchus, nearly three centuries elapsed before any
                    successor arose worthy of the name. During this long period astronomy gained no
                    essential advancement. Some rude observations, scarcely superior to those of the
                    Chaldeans, and a few meagre treatises, are the only monuments which exist to
                    testify that science had not fallen into utter oblivion in an age so fertile of
                    poets and orators. Geminus and Cleomedes wrote treatises, which have been
                    preserved to our times; Agrippa and Menelaus are said to have observed; the
                    Roman calendar was reformed by Julius Caesar and the Egyptian astronomer
                    Sosigenes; and Posidonius measured a degree, and remarked that the laws of the
                    tides depend on the motions of the sun and moon.</p>
                <p>Ptolemy was born at Ptolemais in Egypt, and flourished at Alexandria about the
                    130th year of our era, under the reigns of Adrian and Antoninus. This
                    illustrious ornament of the Alexandrian school is entitled by his own
                    discoveries to the high rank among astronomers which has universally been
                    assigned to him; but the most signal service which he conferred on science was
                    the collection and arrangement of the ancient observations. Out of these
                    materials he formed the Miyaλt; <hi rend="italic">'∑υwaξις,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Great Composition,</hi> a collection which exhibits a complete
                    view of the state of astronomy in the time of Ptolemy, and which contains the
                    germ of most of the methods in use at the present day.</p>
                <p>The hypothesis which Ptolemy adopted for the purpose of explaining the apparent
                    motions, was that which had been followed by Hipparchus. We have already seen
                    that the genius of Pythagoras, soaring above the illusions of sense, had
                    conceived the sun to be situated at the centre of the universe, and the earth to
                    circulate, like the other planets, about the sun; and that the same opinion was
                    entertained and supported by Aristarchus and a few other astronomers. It would
                    seem, however, that this philosophical idea never gained much ground in
                    antiquity, even among the learned. The vulgar prejudice respecting the
                    immobility of the earth continued to prevail; and it had become an inveterate
                    axiom, that all the celestial motions must be circular and uniform. Ptolemy
                    himself, who felt in its full force the difficulty of reconciling the
                    appearances with the notion of a uniform circular motion, adopted the common
                    opinion without scruple as a primordial law of the universe; for, says he, this
                    perfection belongs to the essence of celestial things, which neither admit of
                    disorder nor irregularity. To save this chimera—· the uniform circular
                    motion—Apollonius imagined the ingenious apparatus of epicycles and deferents;
                    and Hipparchus advanced a step farther, by placing the centre of the sun’s
                    circle at a small distance from the earth. Ptolemy adopted both hypotheses, and
                    supposed the planet to describe an epicycle by a uniform revolution in a circle,
                    the centre of which was carried forward uniformly in an eccentric round the
                    earth. By means of these suppositions, and by assigning proper relations between
                    the radii of the epicycle and deferent circle, and also between the velocity of
                    the planet and the centre of its epicycle, he was enabled to represent with
                    tolerable accuracy the apparent motions of the planets, and particularly the
                    phenomena of the stations and retrogradations, which formed the principal object
                    of the researches of the ancient as- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> tronomers.
                    The notions of Apollonius and Hipparchus were thus reduced to a systematic form,
                    and the proportions of the eccentrics and epicycles of all the planets assigned,
                    by Ptolemy; on which account the system has been generally ascribed to him, and
                    obtained the name of the <hi rend="italic">Ptolemaic System</hi> of the
                    universe. As a first attempt to bring the celestial motions within the grasp of
                    geometry, it does infinite honour to the genius of its inventors. It is,
                    however, totally irreconcilable with the precision of modern observations; for
                    it is impossible to represent on this hypothesis the variations of the distances
                    of the planets at the same time with their apparent motions. But this difficulty
                    could scarcely be felt by Ptolemy, inasmuch as it was impossible, before the
                    invention of the telescope and micrometer, to form any accurate estimate of the
                    variations of the apparent diameter of a planet, and consequently of its
                    distance. It must be admitted, however, that the Ptolemaic hypothesis might be
                    sufficient for the wants of practical astronomy, that is, for calculating the
                    places of the planets and forming tables of their motions, were it not for its
                    extreme complication. The discovery of every new irregularity in the planetary
                    motions exacts the addition of a new epicycle; and such was the confusion
                    resulting from this circumstance, that Alphonso X., despairing of being able to
                    comprehend the complicated machinery, was tempted to exclaim, that if the Deity
                    had called him to his counsels at the creation of the world, he could have given
                    good advice. Yet, notwithstanding all its defects, the system of Ptolemy gained
                    a complete ascendency over the minds of mankind, and, so difficult is it to
                    leave the beaten path, continued to be implicitly followed by every astronomer
                    during fourteen centuries, having been only finally exploded by Kepler’s
                    discovery of the elliptic orbit of Mars.</p>
                <p>The most important discovery which astronomy owes to Ptolemy is that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Evection</hi> of tfie moon. Hipparchus had discovered the first
                    lunar inequality, or the equation of the centre, which serves to correct the
                    mean motion at the syzygies, and had also remarked the necessity of another
                    correction for the quadratures. He even undertook a set of observations, with a
                    view to ascertain its amount and its law; but death put a stop to his labours
                    before he had brought them to a successful issue. Ptolemy completed the
                    investigation, and discovered that the eccentricity of the lunar orbit is itself
                    subject to an annual variation, depending on the motion of the line of the
                    apsides. The variation of the position of the apsides produces an inequality of
                    the moon’s motion in her quarters, which has been technically denominated the
                    evection. The equation given by Ptolemy, though of course empirical, is
                    remarkably exact.</p>
                <p>Ptolemy employed a very simple process for determining the moon’s parallax, which
                    was probably suggested to him by the situation of Alexandria, where he observed.
                    He determined the latitude of a place a little to the south of that city, over
                    the zenith of which the moon was observed to pass when her northern declination
                    was the greatest possible. But when the moon is in the zenith, or in the
                    same’straight line with the observer and the centre of the earth, she has no
                    parallax; consequently the obliquity of the ecliptic and the latitude of the
                    station being known, the moon’s greatest northern latitude was also determined.
                    The next step was to observe the moons meridian altitude fifteen days after the
                    first observation, when her southern latitude was necessarily the greatest
                    possible. This observation gave the <hi rend="italic">apparent</hi> altitude of
                    the moon, but her greatest northern and southern decli <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193105090" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5090-0733"/>nations being supposed equal,
                    her <hi rend="italic">true</hi> altitude, as seen from the centre of the earth,
                    was easily computed from the previous observation, and the difference between
                    the true and apparent altitudes gave the amount of the parallax.</p>
                <p>The observations of Hipparchus relative to the motion of the stars in longitude,
                    or the regression of the equinoctial points, were confirmed by Ptolemy, although
                    he mistook its amount, and diminished a quantity which Hipparchus had already
                    estimated too low. According to Hipparchus, the regression is at the rate of two
                    degrees in 150 years. Ptolemy reduced it to one degree in 90 years. This
                    disagreement would seem to indicate an error of more than a degree in the
                    observations, which can with difficulty be admitted, considering the accordance
                    which subsists among the different observations cited by Ptolemy in support of
                    his own determination. For this and some other reasons Ptolemy has been accused
                    of altering the observations of Hipparchus, and accommodating them to his own
                    theory; but there does not appear to be any just ground for the imputation. The
                    error with regard to the regression probably arose from the circumstance, that
                    Hipparchus had assigned too great a value to the length of the year, whence the
                    motion of the sun with regard to the equinoxes would be made too slow, and the
                    longitudes employed by Ptolemy consequently diminished.</p>
                <p>Ptolemy has been called the <hi rend="italic">Prince</hi> of astronomers,—a title
                    which may perhaps be justified by the universal and long-continued prevalence of
                    his system, but to which he has no claim from the number or value of his own
                    observations. After a laborious and minute examination of the Almagest, Delambre
                    doubts whether any thing, saving the author’s declarations, is contained in that
                    great work, from which it can be decisively inferred that Ptolemy ever observed
                    at all. He indeed frequently makes mention of observations made by himself; but
                    his solar tables, rate of the precession, eclipses, determination of the moon’s
                    motion and parallax, and, above all, his catalogue of stars, render it
                    impossible to doubt that the greater part of the results which he has given as
                    observations are merely computed from the tables of Hipparchus. It is therefore
                    difficult to allow to Ptolemy that good faith and “astronomical probity which
                    forms one of the most indispensable qualities of an observer.” He never in any
                    instance cites a single observation more than is just necessary for the object
                    he has immediately in view, and consequently, by precluding all comparison of
                    one observation with another, has deprived us of the means even of guessing at
                    the probable amount of the errors of his solar, lunar, and planetary tables. If
                    an astronomer, as Delambre justly remarks, were to adopt the same course at the
                    present day, he would be certain of forfeiting all claim to confidence; but
                    Ptolemy stood alone; he had neither judges nor rivals; he claimed admiration,
                    and received it; and now no one condescends to calculate the few observations he
                    has left us. (Delambre, <hi rend="italic">Astronomie Ancienne,</hi> tom. i.
                    Discours Préliminaire.) His catalogue contains only 1029 stars, and is therefore
                    less extensive than that of Hipparchus, but it is exceedingly valuable on
                    account of its details.</p>
                <p>The name <hi rend="italic">Almagest (Meγiorn,</hi> with the Arabic prefix) was
                    bestowed on the <hi rend="italic">Syntax</hi> by the Arabians, into whose
                    language it was translated in the ninth century. The first Latin translation was
                    from the Arabic, and published at Venice in 1515. It abounds in Arabic words and
                    idioms, and is very inaccurate and barbarous. The second Latin translation was
                    made from the original Greek by George of Trebizond, and is greatly superior to
                    the first. It was published at Basle in 1541, and in 1551. The Greek text was
                    published at the same time in 1538. Ptolemy was the author of numerous other
                    works connected with astronomy, of which his <hi rend="italic">Geography,</hi> ⅛
                    <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> ight books, is the best known. It contains a list
                    of all the places of which the latitudes and longitudes had at that time been
                    determined. His treatise on <hi rend="italic">Optics</hi> was supposed to be
                    lost, till an imperfect Latin translation, from an Arabic version, was lately
                    discovered in the king’s library at Paris. The last book of this work contains a
                    theory of astronomical refraction, more complete than any which existed before
                    that of Cassini. It would seem that Ptolemy had not discovered the refraction at
                    the time he composed the Almagest, no mention being made of the subject in that
                    work. The explanation which he gives of the phenomenon is natural and
                    satisfactory, indeed entirely conformable with that which is now universally
                    adopted. The idea and explanation remained buried in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Optics</hi> till reproduced by Alhazen; but neither Ptolemy nor Alhazen
                    attempted to estimate the amount of the refraction. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Planisphere</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Analemma,</hi> in which he treats of the
                    stereographic and orthographic projections of the sphere, show a perfect
                    acquaintance with spherical trigonometry. In the last-mentioned work he makes
                    use of the sines, and his constructions comprehend three of the four general
                    theorems in modern use. Divers treatises also on music, dialling, chronology,
                    and mechanics, attest the universality of Ptolemy’s genius, and his unremitting
                    application to the pursuits of science. Like Archimedes, he had a desire to
                    transmit to posterity the history of his labours by a public monument. In the
                    temple of Serapis, at Canopus, he is said to have consecrated a marble pillar,
                    with an inscription containing the principal elements of his astronomy, such as
                    the length of the year, the eccentricity of the solar and lunar orbits, the
                    dimensions and forms of the epicycles of the planets, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>On the death of Ptolemy astronomy ceased to be cultivated among the Greeks. The
                    Alexandrian school subsisted indeed for some centuries after; but genuine
                    science had fled, and its place been usurped by the vain wranglings of
                    theologians and grammarians. During the long period of six or seven centuries,
                    the labours of those who assumed the name of astronomers were confined to
                    needless or trifling commentaries on the works of Hipparchus and Ptolemy, and
                    were productive of no observations, or even remarks, having a tendency to
                    enlarge the boundaries of the science. The genius of the Roman dominion was
                    unfavourable to the development or exercise of the higher faculties of the human
                    intellect; and the natural sciences, with the liberal arts, faded away under the
                    withering influence of military despotism.</p>
                <p>From the brief account which has now been given, it will be easily inferred that
                    the Greeks cultivated astronomy rather as a speculative than a practical
                    science. None of their numerous sects ever evinced any taste for observation or
                    experiment; and hence, while geometry made great and rapid advances in their
                    hands, physics and experimental philosophy were entirely neglected. The
                    prevailing passion for speculation pervaded even their astronomy. They explained
                    the doctrine of the sphere, and the apparent motions of the planets; and framed
                    ingenious theories to account for such phenomena as came immediately under the
                    cognizance of their senses; but if we except the observations of Hipparchus and
                    Ptolemy, and perhaps two solstitial distances of the sun from the zenith,
                    observed by Eratosthenes, we remark among them no observations made with
                    instruments capable of measuring angular distances. Before Hipparchus, no
                    mention is made of the astrolabe; and the recorded determinations do not <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193105103" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5103-0734"/> give us a very
                    favourable idea of the accuracy of that instrument. On casting our eyes over the
                    catalogue of Ptolemy, we scarcely ever meet with a fraction of a degree smaller
                    than one-twelfth, that is to say, less than five minutes; whence we may infer
                    that the astrolabe only measured twelfth parts of a degree. Occasionally,
                    indeed, the fractions one-fourth and three-fourths occur; but these were most
                    probably inserted by estimation. The Greeks of Alexandria committed an error of
                    no less than 15' with regard to the altitude of the pole, one of the most
                    essential elements to an observer; and it does not appear that they were ever
                    able to determine the time to within a quarter of an hour. Yet notwithstanding
                    these circumstances, which indicate that the art of observation was still in its
                    infancy, the science of astronomy is vastly indebted to the labours and
                    speculations of the Greeks. The complicated but ingenious hypotheses of Ptolemy
                    prepared the way for the elliptic orbits and laws of Kepler, which, in their
                    turn, conducted Newton to the great discovery of the law of gravitation.</p>

                <p>While the nations of western Europe were involved in the thickest shades of
                    ignorance and barbarism, the torch of science was rekindled, and blazed forth
                    with extraordinary splendour, among the Saracens. The burst of fanaticism which
                    enabled the followers of Mahomet to carry their religion and their arms over the
                    fairest portion of the ancient world subsided, in a great measure, after a
                    century and a half of uninterrupted conquest, and was succeeded by a period of
                    repose, during which they cultivated the arts of peace and civilisation with the
                    same ardour which had characterized their achievements in arms. Under the
                    enlightened and munificent protection of the caliphs, Bagdat became what
                    Alexandria had been under the Ptolemies, the centre of politeness and
                    knowledge.</p>
                <p>The accounts which we possess of the Saracen literature are imperfect and scanty;
                    but the first of the caliphs who appears to have encouraged the study of
                    astronomy was Abougiafar, surnamed Almansor, or the Victorious, who reigned in
                    the eighth century. His grandson Almarnon, the seventh of the Abassides, and
                    second son of the famous Haroun Al Raschid, who reigned at Bagdat from 813 to
                    833, is celebrated for the protection which he gave to learning, and the zeal
                    with which he laboured to propagate the sciences of the Greeks among his
                    subjects. In granting peace to the emperor Michael HL, he stipulated for liberty
                    to collect in Greece all the writings of the philosophers. These he transported
                    into his own country, and caused to be translated into Arabic. Finding it
                    mentioned in the geography of Ptolemy that a degree of the earth was equivalent
                    to 500 stadia, he resolved to have this fact verified by a new measurement; and
                    in obedience to the commands of the caliph, a company of mathematicians
                    assembled in the spacious plain of Sinaar, where, having observed the altitude
                    of the pole, they separated themselves into two parties, and proceeded in
                    opposite directions along the meridian, measuring the distance they passed over
                    till the altitude of the pole varied one degree. Being unacquainted with the
                    nature of the instruments made use of in these geodetic operations, we cannot
                    estimate the probable accuracy of the result; but as it agreed perfectly with
                    the statement of Ptolemy, we have a right to infer that the measurement was
                    executed in a very inadequate manner, and that the mathematicians of the caliph
                    adopted the ancient determination from want of confidence in their own.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Syntax</hi> of Ptolemy was translated into Arabic under the
                    reign of Almamon, by Isaac Ben Honain. The translation was afterwards revised by
                    Thabet or Thebith Ben Korah, and it was about this time that it received the
                    appellation of Almagest. Astronomical observations, which, as we have had
                    occasion to remark, had been greatly neglected by the successors of Hipparchus,
                    formed a principal object of the attention of the Arabians. By the orders of
                    Almamon, the obliquity of the ecliptic was observed, and found to be 23° 33'.
                    According to the modern tables, the obliquity at that time was 23° 36' 34", so
                    that the error was less than that of Hipparchus and Ptolemy, in their
                    determination of the same element. This observation supposes instruments of some
                    accuracy. Among the astronomers whom Almamon drew to his court, we find the
                    names of Habash of Bagdat, who composed three books of astronomical tables;
                    Ahmed, or Mohammed Ben Cothair, better known by' the name of Alfragan, or
                    Alfranius, who, from his great expertness in computing, was styled the <hi
                    rend="italic">calculator.</hi> He composed an elementary treatise on astronomy,
                    which was only an abridged extract of the works of Ptolemy; and likewise wrote
                    on sun-dials, and gave a description of the astrolabe. The Jew Meshala, whose
                    treatise on the elements was published at Nuremberg in 1549, also lived in the
                    time of Almansor or Almamon.</p>
                <p>The most celebrated of the Arabian astronomers was Albategnius, or Muhammed Ben
                    Geber Albatani, so called from Batan, a city of Mesopotamia, where he was born.
                    He was a prince of Syria, and resided at Aracte or Racha, in Mesopotamia; but
                    many of his observations were made at Antioch. Having studied the <hi
                    rend="italic">Syntax</hi> of Ptolemy, and made himself acquainted with the
                    methods practised by the Greek astronomers, he began to observe, and soon found
                    that the places assigned to many of the stars in Ptolemy’s tables were
                    considerably different from their actual situations, in consequence of the error
                    which that great astronomer had committed with regard to the precession of the
                    equinoxes. Albategnius measured the rate of the precession with greater accuracy
                    than had been done by Ptolemy; and he had still better success in his attempt to
                    determine the eccentricity of the solar orbit, his value of which differs
                    extremely little from that which results from modern observations. In assigning
                    the length of the year, however, he fell into an error of more than two minutes;
                    but this proceeded, as has been shown by Dr Halley, from too great confidence in
                    the observations of Ptolemy. Albategnius also remarked that the place of the
                    sun’s apogee is not immovable, as former astronomers had supposed, but that it
                    advances at a slow rate, according to the order of the signs,—a discovery which
                    has been confirmed by the theory of gravitation. A new set of astronomical
                    tables, more accurate than those of Ptolemy, likewise resulted from the
                    indefatigable labours of Albategnius; and his observations, important in
                    themselves, are doubly interesting on account that they form a link of
                    connection between those of the astronomers of Alexandria and of modern Europe.
                    The works of Albategnius were published in 1537, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Scientia Stellarum.</hi></p>
                <p>Thebith Ben Korah, another Arabian, acquired celebrity by proposing an
                    explanation of the motions of the stars, which, under the name of the “System of
                    Trepidation, was eagerly received by the astronomers of the middle ages, and
                    disfigured the tables of Alphonse, and even those of Copernicus. He ascribed to
                    the <hi rend="italic">eighth</hi> sphere, or that of the fixed stars, two
                    motions; one the diurnal motion, the other that of trepidation, performed in
                    small circles round the first points of Aries and Libra, and. of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193105116" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5116-0735"/>which the radii were 4° 1 S'
                    33". He therefore supposed two ecliptics, one fixed in the ninth sphere, the
                    other movable in the eighth. According to this construction, the motion of the
                    stars is sometimes direct and sometimes retrograde.</p>
                <p>The Arabians have been said to be not only the cultivators but the apostles of
                    the sciences, on account of the activity with which they propagated them among
                    all the nations subjected to their dominion. The Fatimite caliphs, who reigned
                    in Egypt during two centuries, rivalled their predecessors the Ptolemies in the
                    encouragement which they gave to astronomy. Under the caliph Hakem, who reigned
                    from 996 to 1021 of our era, Ebn Jounis acquired a splendid reputation. He
                    constructed a set of tables, and composed a sort of celestial history, in which
                    he has recorded numerous observations of his own and of other astronomers
                    belonging to the same country. This work, imperfectly known through some
                    extracts, long excited the curiosity of astronomers, as it was supposed to
                    contain observations tending to establish the acceleration of the mean motion of
                    the moon. A manuscript copy of it, belonging to the university of Leyden, was,
                    in 1804, transmitted to the French Institute, and translated by Professor
                    Caussin. It contains 28 observations of eclipses from the year 829 to 1004;
                    seven observations of the equinoxes; one of the summer solstice; one of the
                    obliquity of the ecliptic made at Damascus, by which the value of that element
                    is found to be 23° 35'; and likewise a portion of tables of the sun and moon,
                    with some other matter illustrative of the state of astronomy among the
                    Arabians. The observations which regard the acceleration of the mean lunar
                    motion are two eclipses of the sun and one of the moon, observed by Ebn Jounis,
                    near Cairo, in the years 977, 978, and 979, and they agree with theory in
                    confirmiug the existence of that phenomenon.</p>
                <p>The Saracen conquests in Spain were attended with the same happy results as in
                    Egypt, and science flourished in that country while the rest of Europe was
                    involved in the darkest shades of ignorance. Arzachel is supposed to be the
                    author of the <hi rend="italic">Toledo Tables,</hi> constructed about the year
                    1180, but which, on account of the established reputation of those of
                    Albategnius, were never in great estimation. He made some changes in the
                    dimensions which had been assigned by Hipparchus and Ptolemy to the solar orbit,
                    and deserves the praise of having been an exact and attentive observer. Alhazen,
                    who flourished in the same country about the same period, contributed to the
                    progress of astronomy by a treatise on <hi rend="italic">Optics,</hi> in which
                    he clearly indicated the necessity of making an allowance for the celestial
                    refraction in astronomical observations. His treatise contained a theory of
                    reflection and refraction, an explanation of the cause of the twilight, and of
                    the magnitude of the horizontal moon. Averroes, a physician of Cordova, made an
                    abridgement of the Almagest in the twelfth century, and Almansor found the
                    obliquity of the ecliptic to be 23° 33' 30", which proves that practical
                    astronomy had now attained to a tolerable degree of exactness.</p>
                <p>If we inquire what effect the labours of the Arabians and their disciples had on
                    the progress of astronomy, we shall find that their services were confined
                    entirely to the practical part In point of theory they did absolutely nothing.
                    They admitted all the hypotheses of Ptolemy without the slightest alteration,
                    even with timid and superstitious respect, and did not advance a single step
                    towards the discovery of the solar system. But with regard to instruments and
                    methods of calculation, their improvements were numerous and important. They
                    constructed instruments on a larger scale, and divided them with greater care;
                    and, even from the time of Almamon, we remark among them new and more exact
                    determinations of the obliquity of the ecliptic, of the positions of some stars,
                    of the precession, of the length of the year, and of the eccentricity of the
                    sun’s orbit. To these fundamental points they added numerous observations of
                    eclipses and conjunctions; they industriously sought out and corrected the
                    errors of Ptolemy’s tables; they perceived the necessity of marking the instant
                    of each phenomenon with greater care; and their determinations of the
                    commencement and end of eclipses are in general accompanied with the altitude of
                    a star, which afforded them the means of calculating the hour, angle, and the
                    true time. In cases where less precision was wanted, they made use of their
                    clepsydrae and solar dials, to the construction of which they paid particular
                    attention. Trigonometry derived signal advantages from their constant care to
                    facilitate the calculations of spherical astronomy. Albategnius substituted the
                    sines for the chords,—a most important improvement, the idea of which was
                    probably suggested to him by the Analemma of Ptolemy. By this happy substitution
                    the solution of all rectangular spherical triangles was reduced to four general
                    formulae, of which the Greeks had the equivalent in a much less commodious form.
                    The same astronomer also appears to have invented a very remarkable rule for the
                    oblique-angled triangles, perfectly identical with one of the four general
                    formulae now in use. Ebn Jounis, and his contemporary Aboul Wefa, were
                    acquainted with the tangents and secants, and employed them very dexterously in
                    reducing complicated binomial expressions to a single and simpler term. They
                    also employed subsidiary arcs and other artifices in the calculus of the sines,
                    in order to facilitate the labour of computation. These substitutions are now
                    common; but they remained long unknown in Europe; and 700 years after they were
                    employed by the Arabians, we first meet with some examples of their use in the
                    writings of Thomas Simpson.</p>
                <p>The zeal of the Arabians for astronomical observations was communicated by them
                    to the Persians and Tartars. About the year 1072, Omar Cheyam determined the
                    length of the tropical year, and introduced the calendar which has ever since
                    been used in Persia. Holegu-Ilecou-Khan, who conquered that country about the
                    year 1264, caused an observatory to be built at Maragha, near Tauris, where he
                    assembled the most celebrated astronomers who could be found within his
                    dominions, and employed them in forming new astronomical tables. This work was
                    directed by the famous Nassireddin, and brought to a conclusion in the year
                    1269. With the exception of some trifling corrections of the mean motions, the
                    whole of these tables are copied from Ptolemy.</p>
                <p>Ulugh Beigh, a Tartar prince, and grandson of the great Tamerlane, not only
                    encouraged the study of astronomy, but was himself a diligent and successful
                    observer. At Samarcand, the capital of his dominions, he established an academy
                    of astronomers, and caused the most magnificent instruments to be constructed
                    for their use. By means of a gnomon 180 feet in height, he determined the
                    obliquity of the ecliptic to be 23° 30' 20", the precession of the equinoxes at
                    1° in 70 years, and obtained elements for the construction of tables which have
                    been found to be scarcely inferior in accuracy to those of Tycho Brahĕ. The
                    ancient astronomy had produced only one catalogue of the fixed stars, that of
                    Hipparchus. Ulugh Beigh has the honour of having formed a second, after an
                    interval of sixteen centuries. This learned and munificent prince, whose virtue
                    and talents deserved the esteem of mankind, was assassinated by his own son in
                    the 58th year of his age.</p>

                    east. But the seeds of knowledge had now begun to take root in a more propitious
                    soil, and Europe, destined to carry the development of the human energies to its
                    fullest extent, began to awake from the lethargy in which it had continued
                    during so many ages. The first dawnings of returning day appeared in Spain. In
                    spite of the horror inspired by the Moslem religion, the Christians began to
                    perceive and acknowledge the superiority and utility of the science of the
                    Moors; and the schools of Cordova became the resort of all those whom curiosity,
                    or love of knowledge, induced to seek abroad for that information which could
                    not be obtained in their own countries. Geber, afterwards Pope Silvester IL,
                    acquired the knowledge of arithmetic from that source; and John of Halifax,
                    better known by the name of Sacrobosco, after having studied some time in Spain,
                    made an abridgement of the Almagest, which was long famous under the title of a
                    <hi rend="italic">Treatise of the Sphere.</hi></p>
                <p>The emperor Frederick II. is no less celebrated for his protection of the
                    sciences, than for the continual struggles in which he was involved with the
                    popes. He founded the university of Naples, and caused Latin translations to be
                    made of the works of Aristotle and the Almagest of Ptolemy. About the same time
                    astronomy was zealously encouraged and cultivated by Alphonso X., king of
                    Castile. This monarch, whose liberal mind seems to have been far superior to the
                    age in which he lived, formed a college or lyceum at Toledo, the capital of his
                    dominions, whither he assembled the most eminent astronomers that could be
                    found, whether Christians, Moors, or Jews, and engaged them in the task of
                    correcting the errors of the ancient tables. From their united labours were
                    produced the <hi rend="italic">Alphonsine Tables,</hi> which obtained great
                    celebrity, and were, in some respects, superior in accuracy to airy which had
                    preceded them. They are supposed to have been chiefly the work of the Rabbi
                    Isaac Aben Sid, surnamed Hazan, inspector of the synagogue of Toledo. They are
                    said to have cost the king 40,000 ducats,—a sum certainly far exceeding their
                    real value, which is confined to the correction of some epochs, and a more
                    accurate determination of the sun’s motions and the length of the year. The same
                    century gave birth to several other individuals distinguished by their
                    attachment to the sciences. Campanus of Nivari translated Euclid, and left a
                    treatise on the sphere. Vitello, a native of Poland, composed a treatise on
                    optics, in ten books; and Albert, bishop of Ratisbon, whom his contemporaries
                    styled the <hi rend="italic">great,</hi> was the author of some works on
                    arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and mechanics. But the greatest luminary of
                    that age was Roger Bacon, a Franciscan friar, whose numerous works contain many
                    indications of a powerful and inventive genius. He made many important
                    discoveries in optics; but his knowledge of natural philosophy and chemistry,
                    uncommon in those days, had nearly proved fatal to him; for he was suspected of
                    necromancy, and thrown into a dungeon, from which he did not escape till he had
                    satisfied his superiors and the pope that he had never held unlawful intercourse
                    with the devil. He composed a work on the utility of astrology, the places of
                    the stars, and the aspects of the moon; and he had the merit of perceiving the
                    necessity of reforming the calendar.</p>
                <p>The fourteenth century produced no astronomer from whose labours the science
                    gained any accessions. George Purbach, or Beurbach, so named from a small town
                    in Austria, where he was born in 1423, obtained great celebrity as a professor.
                    He studied at Vienna, and after giving proofs of distinguished talents, he
                    travelled into Italy, where he was favourably received by the cardinal of Cusa,
                    who himself cultivated astronomy. On his return to Vienna he undertook a
                    translation of the Almagest; and although ignorant both of Greek and Arabic, his
                    perfect acquaintance with the subject enabled him to correct many errors which
                    had been introduced through the carelessness or ignorance of former translators.
                    He published a table of sines for every ten minutes to a radius of 6,000,000
                    parts, which was afterwards extended by his scholar Regiomontanus to every
                    minute of the quadrant. The most celebrated of his works is his <hi
                    rend="italic">Theoricce Nova</hi><hi rend="italic">Planetarum,</hi> which was
                    published in 1460. He constructed á celestial globe, on which was represented
                    the motion of the stars in longitude from the time of Ptolemy to the year 1450.
                    He also measured the obliquity of the ecliptic, and is considered as the
                    inventor of decimal arithmetic. He died in 1461, having only reached his 38th
                    year, with the reputation of being, at that time, the first astronomer in
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>Purbach had the good fortune to form a disciple who' executed many of the plans
                    which had been interrupted <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> by his premature
                    death. This was the celebrated John' Muller of Königsberg, better known by the
                    name of Regiomontanus. Attracted in his youth to Vienna by the great reputation
                    of Purbach, he continued to study there during ten years, and on the death of
                    his master repaired to Rome for the purpose of acquiring tire Greek language,
                    and of making himself, through it, acquainted with the Almagest. At Rome he
                    continued his observations, and translated into Latin the works of Ptolcmy, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Conics</hi> of Apollonius, and some other treatises of ancient
                    science. In 1471 he retired to Nuremberg, where, with the aid of Bernard
                    Walther, a wealthy burgess, he founded an observatory, and furnished it with
                    excellent instruments, principally of his own invention, by means of which he
                    was enabled to detect many errors in the ancient tables. On the invitation of
                    Pope Sixtus IV., who wished to reform the calendar, he again repaired to Rome;
                    but after a few months’ abode there he died suddenly, according to some
                    accounts, of the plague, according to others, through the effects of poison
                    administered to him by the sons of George of Trebizond, who adopted this
                    execrable method of revenging the exposure which he had made of their father’s
                    errors in the translation of the Almagest. Regiomontanus was a learned and
                    skilful man, but the great expectations which his early labours gave of future
                    services to astronomy were disappointed by his Untimely death. He paid great
                    attention to trigonometrical calculation; and, although he did not reach the
                    point which had been attained by the Arabians, he had the merit of introducing
                    some useful theorems which till then were entirely unknown in Europe. His
                    genius, however, did not enable him to rise above the prejudices of his age, for
                    he was an astrologer as well as an astronomer, and is said to have most lamented
                    the errors of the Alphonsine Tables on account of the uncertainty which they
                    occasioned in the calculation of genitures or horoscopes.</p>
                <p>After the death of Regiomontanus, Walther continued to observe at Nuremberg
                    during thirty years. His observations were collected by order of the senate of
                    Nuremberg, and published by Schoner in 1544, a second time by Snellius, and,
                    lastly, along with those of Tycho Brahé. In 1484 Walther began to make use of
                    clocks, then a recent invention, to measure time in celestial observations. He
                    was also the first who employed the planet Venus as a term of comparison for
                    determining the longitudes of the stars.</p>
                <p>Nuremberg had the honour of producing another astro <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193105142" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5142-0737"/>nomer of some celebrity. John
                    Werner was the first who 'explained the method which was afterwards brought into
                    general use by Maskelyne, of finding the longitude at sea, by observing the
                    distance between a fixed star and the moon. He published some mathematical and
                    geographical treatises, and made a number of observations to determine the
                    obliquity of the ecliptic and the precession of the equinoxes.</p>
                <p>• We are now come down to a period in the history of astro- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> nomy when the science was destined to undergo a
                    totalrenovation, and the system which had been so laboriously established by
                    Ptolemy, and blindly followed as an article of religious belief by
                    Arabs,’Persians, Tartars, and Europeans, during so many centuries, was about to
                    be exploded for ever. In proportion as the observations became more numerous and
                    accurate, the difficulty of representing them by the Ptolemaic system became
                    greater; and astronomers were obliged to have recourse to the most violent and
                    improbable suppositions in order to explain the phenomena, and, in the language
                    of Ptolemy, <hi rend="italic">save</hi> the appearances. We have mentioned that
                    Pythagoras and his disciples entertained an idea very different from that which
                    commonly prevailed, and supposed the sun to be the immovable centre of the
                    celestial motions. It appears, however, from Aristotle, that this opinion was
                    not founded on any analysis of the phenomena, but on certain metaphysical
                    notions respecting the comparative dignity of the several elements. For example,
                    fire, being a nobler substance than earth, ought to occupy the centre or place
                    of honour. But such arguments could have little weight except in the schools,
                    and accordingly were rejected by Ptolemy as too absurd to require a serious
                    refutation. In order to give any probability to the ∙ Pythagorean doctrine, it
                    was necessary to explain the succession of the seasons and the precession of the
                    equinoxes on the hypothesis of the annual revolution of the earth about the sun;
                    to show how the unequal motions of the planets in concentric orbits would give
                    rise to the phenomena of the stations and retrogradations; to account, in short,
                    for all the appearances, and point out their coherence and mutual connection.
                    All this was effected by Copernicus, who had thereby the glory of first making
                    known the true system of the universe, and of leading the way in that career of
                    astronomical discovery in which the genius of the human race has gained its
                    noblest trophies.</p>
                <p>Nicholas Copernicus was born at Thorn, a city of Prussia, on the confines of
                    Poland, according to Junctinus on the 19th of January 1472, and according to
                    others on the 19th February 1473. From his earliest years he displayed a great
                    fondness and aptitude for mathematical studies, and pursued them with
                    corresponding success at the university of Cracow. Stimulated by the desire of
                    acquiring a reputation equal to that of Regiomontanus, he set out for Italy at
                    the age of 23 years, in order to study astronomy at Bologna under the celebrated
                    Dominic Maria. He afterwards removed to Rome, where he employed himself in
                    studying and teaching the mathematics, and where he made several astronomical
                    observations about the year 1500. On his return to his native country he was
                    made a canon of Ermeland by his uncle the bishop of Worms, and took up his
                    residence at Frauenberg, a small Prussian town near the mouth of the Vistula,
                    where he passed 36 years of his life in observing the heavens and meditating on
                    the system of the world. In this retirement he composed his famous work entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Astronomia Restaurata, sive</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Revolutionibus Orbium Cceles-</hi><hi rend="italic">tium,</hi> in
                    which he explained the celestial motions in a manner as simple and connected as
                    the system of Ptolemy was complicated and incoherent. The system which
                    Copernicus adopted in this work is now so familiar to every one, that it is
                    almost unnecessary to describe it. The heaven, composed of stars perfectly at
                    rest, occupies the remotest bounds of space, then the orbit of Saturn, next
                    Jupiter, Mars, the Earth accompanied by its moon, Venus, Mercury, and, lastly,
                    the Sun immovable at the centre. By this arrangement the stations and
                    retrogradations of the planets became simple mathematical corollaries, following
                    from the differences of the radii of their orbits and their unequal motions. The
                    diurnal rotation of the earth explained more simply and rationally the apparent
                    daily revolution of the heavens; and the precession of the equinoxes was
                    referred to a small variation in the inclination of the earth’s axis to the
                    plane of the ecliptic. But the simplicity of the system, and its consequent
                    probability, were the only arguments which Copernicus was able to bring forward
                    in proof of its reality. The motion of the earth can indeed never be made an
                    object of sense; but after Richer’s discovery of the diminution of gravity
                    towards the equator, it was impossible to doubt longer of the existence of its
                    rotatory motion; and when Roemer had measured the velocity of light, and Bradley
                    observed the phenomena of the aberration, the evidences of its annual revolution
                    were rendered equally convincing. Great, however, as were the merits of
                    Copernicus, it must be acknowledged that he left his system in a very imperfect
                    state. After the example of the ancients, he assumed as an axiom the uniform
                    circular motion of the planets; and as the only motions which are observed are
                    in a state of incessant variation, he was obliged, in order to save the
                    inequalities, to suppose a different centre to each of his orbits. The sun was
                    placed <hi rend="italic">within</hi> the orbit of each of the planets, but not
                    in the centre of any of them, consequently he had no other office to perform
                    than to distribute light and heat; and, excluded from any influence on the
                    system, he became as it were a stranger to all the motions. Yet notwithstanding
                    these and other imperfections, the establishment of the doctrine of the earth’s
                    motion, with an evidence which dissipated the illusions of sense, was a great
                    step towards the true knowledge of the planetary system; and when we consider
                    the ignorance and prejudices of the age, and that Copernicus was moreover a
                    priest, we cannot hesitate to admit his claim to a high rank among philosophers.
                    But whether the actual services which he rendered to astronomy are commensurate
                    with the great fame he has obtained, may admit of doubt. He revived an ancient
                    opinion opposed to the prejudices and religious dogmas of his times, and
                    fortified it with new and strong, though not absolutely convincing, proofs. It
                    seldom happens, however, with regard to those sciences which ultimately appeal
                    to experience, that general reasoning, even of the soundest kind, tends much to
                    their real advancement; and there is little reason for thinking that astronomy
                    would have been less perfect, or that any discoveries since made in it would
                    have been retarded a single day, even if Copernicus had never lived. His great
                    merit, like that of Lord Bacon, consists in the sound views which he took of
                    nature, and in advancing so far before the general attainments of his age.</p>
                <p>Fearing the opposition which was likely to arise from religious bigotry to
                    opinions so much at-variance with vulgar prejudice, Copernicus long delayed the
                    publication of his great work; and it was only at the urgent request of his
                    friends that he at last allowed it to be printed. He is said to have received
                    the last sheet of it only on the day of his death. He was buried in the
                    cathedral of Frauenberg, and his only epitaph consisted of some spheres cut out
                    in relief on his tombstone.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105155" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5155-0738"/>
                <p>The ideas of Copernicus soon spread over Germany, 'where astronomy was at that
                    time diligently cultivated; but they do not seem to have met with general favour
                    before the commencement of the seventeenth century. The art of observing was,
                    however, gradually receiving improvement; instruments were constructed on better
                    principles, and more accurately divided; and the methods of computation were
                    rendered much less laborious. Nonius, or Nunez, a Portuguese, invented the
                    ingenious method of subdividing the small divisions of instruments which still
                    retains his name; Reinhold extended the table of tangents of Regiomontanus to
                    every minute of the quadrant, reformed the tables of Copernicus, and composed
                    many works of practical utility; but of the immediate successors of Copernicus,
                    no one deserves to be more honourably mentioned than William IV., landgrave of
                    Hesse. This prince built a magnificent observatory on the top of his palace at
                    Cassel, which he furnished with excellent instruments of copper, and is said to
                    have calculated himself the positions of no less than 400 stars. He was aided in
                    the labours of the observatory by some astronomers of great merit whom his
                    liberality drew to his court; among others, by Rothman, and Justus Byrgius, a
                    distinguished artist, to whom Kepler has ascribed some idea of the
                    logarithms.</p>
                <p>Tycho Brahe, one of the best and most indefatigable observers of whom practical
                    astronomy can boast, was born at Knudstorp, in Scania, the 13th of December
                    1546. His family was one of the most ancient and noble in Denmark; and his
                    father, probably thinking that illustrious birth superseded the necessity of
                    education, refused his consent to have his son instructed in Latin. Through the
                    kindness of a maternal uncle, however, he was rescued from the state of
                    barbarous ignorance to which he had been doomed by his parent; and, after having
                    received the requisite preliminary instruction, he was sent to the university of
                    Leipsic to study jurisprudence and scholastic philosophy. The tastes of the
                    future astronomer were first excited by an eclipse of the sun which happened in
                    1560. Struck with astonishment at the accuracy of the prediction, he conceived a
                    vehement desire to become acquainted with the principles of so certain a
                    science, and exerted his utmost ingenuity to elude the obstacles which were
                    interposed by his parents and governor to prevent him from acquiring the
                    elementary notions of mathematics and astronomy. By placing the hinge of a
                    common compass near his eye, he contrived to guess at the distances of the
                    planets from the stars, and by this means, according to his own account,
                    detected several errors in the Ephemerides of Stadius. By his persevering
                    efforts he at last obtained the consent of his family to study according to his
                    own inclinations; and from that moment he divided his time between the
                    observation of the heavens, and chemical experiments. He visited the different
                    cities of Germany where he hoped to meet with astronomers and skilful
                    mechanicians, and was received with flattering attention by the landgrave of
                    Hesse-Cassel, with whom he contracted an intimate friendship. On his return to
                    Denmark he obtained from Frederick II. a grant of the small island of Huen, in
                    the strait of Sunda, together with a pension and some presents, by means of
                    which, and an expenditure of 100,000 crowns of his own patrimony, he was enabled
                    to build the castle of Uraniburg, and procure a magnificent collection of the
                    largest and most accurate instruments which could then be constructed. In this
                    celebrated retreat he passed twenty-five years, actively employed in making
                    observations, and attracting by his discoveries the attention of the learned
                    throughout Europe. On the death of his protector Frederick he fell under the '
                    displeasure of the government, and a storm of persecution was raised against
                    him, from causes which he has not explained, by a minister named Walckendorp,
                    who, on this account, has been devoted by Lalande to the infamy and execration
                    of all ages. He was deprived of his pension, compelled to leave the castle of
                    Uraniburg, and to banish himself from Denmark. He retired first to Wandesburg,
                    near Hamburg; he afterwards sought an asylum in Bohemia, and ultimately settled
                    at Prague under the protection of the emperor Rudolph II. Here he resumed his
                    observations, assisted by the illustrious Kepler and Longomontanus. The causes
                    of his exile are involved in mystery; but to whatever it was owing, it turned
                    out fortunate for the progress of astronomy. Had he remained in his island, his
                    observations would not probably have fallen into the hands of Kepler, and the
                    discovery of the laws of the planetary motions might have been deferred to
                    another age. He died at Prague on the 24th of October 1601.</p>
                <p>As an indefatigable and skilful observer, Tycho is justly considered as far
                    superior to any astronomer who had preceded him since the revival of the science
                    in Europe. His ample fortune gave him the means of procuring the best
                    instruments which the age could produce; and by his ingenuity and persevering
                    application, he was admirably qualified to employ them to the best advantage. He
                    computed the first table of refractions, and if it extended only to 45°, the
                    reason was, that the effects of refraction, at a higher altitude, were
                    altogether insensible to his instruments. His solar tables were brought to so
                    great a degree of exactness, that he affirms he could never detect an error in
                    them exceeding a quarter of a minute; but there is reason to suspect some
                    exaggeration in this statement, particularly as Cassini, a century after, with
                    much better means, could scarcely answer for errors of a whole minute. He
                    contributed greatly to the improvement of the lunar tables, and detected a
                    considerable inequality in the moon’s motion in longitude, to which he gave the
                    name of the <hi rend="italic">Variation,</hi> by which it has ever since been
                    distinguished. He also discovered an equation in latitude similar to the
                    evection which had been observed by Hipparchus, and fixed its amount with great
                    accuracy. He remarked the fourth inequality of the moon in longitude, although
                    he failed in his attempt to ascertain its amount, or assign its law. He
                    represented the inequalities of the motions of the nodes, and in the inclination
                    of the lunar orbit, by the motion of the pole of that orbit in a small circle
                    round the pole of the ecliptic. He demonstrated that the region of the comets is
                    far beyond the orbit of the moon, and determined the relative and absolute
                    positions of 777 fixed stars with a scrupulous attention, which gave his
                    catalogue an immense superiority over those of Hipparchus and Ulugh Beigh; and
                    he left to his successors a regular series of observations on the planets,
                    amassed for the purpose of establishing the truth of his own system, but of
                    which Kepler made a better use by employing them to establish the system of
                    Copernicus.</p>
                <p>These are some of the important benefits which resulted to astronomy from the
                    labours of Tycho. As a philosopher he ranks low. Alchemy and judicial astrology,
                    in the reveries of which he was a firm believer, engrossed as much of his
                    attention as astronomy. Yet his errors, or rather weaknesses, ought to be viewed
                    with indulgence. He was seated, to use the simile of Bailly, on the confines of
                    two ages; partaking of the darkness which preceded, and the light which came
                    after him. He rejected the simple system of Copernicus, and, whether from
                    participating in the religious scruples of his age, or from the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193105168" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5168-0739"/>ambition of appearing as the
                    author of a new system, h¢ ’ restored to the earth its immobility, and placed it
                    in the centre of the motions of the sun and moon. The Tycho-nic system was an
                    unsuccessful attempt to reconcile the incongruous hypotheses of Ptolemy and
                    Copernicus. It never enjoyed any real estimation; and its followers were only
                    found among those who dreaded the anathemas of the church, or who, belonging to
                    some university or religious corporation, were deprived of the liberty of
                    expressing their real opinions.</p>
                <p>Tycho was assisted in his observations at Huen, during eight years, by
                    Longomontanus, who afterwards be- ’ came professor of the higher mathematics at
                    Copenhagen. This astronomer composed a large work, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Astronomia</hi><hi rend="italic">Danica,</hi> in which he deduced the elements
                    of the different theories from the observations made at Uranibourg, and gave
                    formulae for computing the planetary motions, according to the three systems of
                    Ptolemy, Copernicus, and Tycho.</p>
                <p>The great mass of accurate observations accumulated by Tycho furnished the
                    materials out of which his disciple Kepler may be said to have constructed the
                    edifice of the world. This great man, the true founder of modem astronomy, was
                    born at Wiel, in the kingdom of Wurtemberg, on the 27th of December 1571. He
                    studied philosophy at Tubingen, and was instructed in mathematics and astronomy
                    by Moestlin, whose name deserves a place in the history of science, on account
                    of his having been one of the first who had the courage to adopt and to teach
                    the system of Copernicus. The philosophical mind of Kepler, disgusted with the
                    improbabilities and absurdities of the ancient system, received with transport
                    the novel doctrines explained by Moestlin. The appointment of mathematician to
                    the emperor, which he procured on the death of Stadius, confirmed him in the
                    resolution which he had taken to devote himself to astronomical pursuits; and
                    the energy of his character enabled him in a very short time to make himself
                    thoroughly master of the different hypotheses and principal discoveries which
                    had been made prior to his time. In the year 1596 he published a <hi
                    rend="italic">Prodromus</hi> of Dissertations on the properties and causes of
                    the celestial orbits, which procured him the friendship of Tycho, and an
                    invitation to take part in the observations and researches of that great
                    astronomer at Prague. On the death of Tycho, which happened soon after, Kepler
                    obtained possession of his invaluable collection of observations, and was
                    charged with the task of completing and publishing the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rudolphine Tables.</hi></p>
                <p>During his short residence with Tycho, Kepler learned to check the fanciful
                    suggestions of his brilliant imagination, and to draw his conclusions from
                    observations alone, by rigorous and patient induction. The observations of the
                    Danish astronomer had furnished him with the means of establishing with
                    certainty the truth or inaccuracy of the various hypotheses which he
                    successively imagined; and the diligence with which he laboured in comparing and
                    calculating these observations during 20 years, was finally rewarded by some of
                    the most important discoveries which had yet been made in astronomy. Deceived by
                    an opinion which had been adopted by Copernicus, and had never been called in
                    question by the ancients, that all the celestial motions are performed in
                    circles, he long fruitlessly endeavoured to represent, by that hypothesis, the
                    irregular motions of Mars; and after having computed with incredible labour the
                    observations of seven oppositions of that planet, he at length succeeded in
                    breaking down the barrier which had so long obstructed the progress of
                    knowledge, and found that the motions could only be accurately represented by
                    supposing the planet to move in an ellipse, having the sun in one of its foci.
                    Having arrived at this important result, he next proceeded to consider, the
                    angular motion of the planet, and finding that it was not uniform in respect of
                    any point situated within the orbit, he concluded that the uniform motion, till
                    then universally received as an axiom, was a vain chimera, which had no
                    existence in nature. He perceived, however, that the areas described by the
                    radius vector of the planet, at its greatest and least distances, were equal in
                    equal times; and subsequent observations enabled him to demonstrate that this
                    equality extended to every point of the orbit. It was therefore discovered that
                    Mars moves in an elliptic orbit, of which the sun occupies a focus, and in such
                    a manner, that the area described by a line drawn from the centre of the planet
                    to that of the sun is always proportional to the time of description. The same
                    conclusions he found to be true in respect of the orbit of the earth; and
                    therefore he could no longer hesitate to extend them by analogy to the other
                    planets. These are two of the three general principles which are known by the
                    name of the <hi rend="italic">Laws of Kepler.</hi></p>
                <p>It was some years later before Kepler arrived at the knowledge of the analogy
                    which subsists between the distances of the several planets from the sun, and
                    the periods in which they complete their revolutions. To the discovery of this
                    analogy he attached the greatest importance, and regarded all his other labours
                    as incomplete without it. After having imagined numberless hypotheses, it at
                    last occurred to him to compare the different powers of the numbers which
                    express the distances and times of revolutions; and he found, to his infinite
                    satisfaction, that the squares of the periodic times of the planets are always
                    in the same proportion as the cubes of their mean distances from the sun. This
                    is the third law of Kepler. He demonstrated it to be true of all the planets
                    then known. It has been found to be equally true in regard to those which have
                    been since discovered, and likewise to prevail in the systems of the satellites
                    of Jupiter and Saturn. It is indeed, as can be shown mathematically, a necessary
                    consequence of the law of gravitation, directly as the masses, and inversely as
                    the squares of the distances.</p>
                <p>By these brilliant discoveries, the solar system was reduced to that degree of
                    beautiful simplicity which had been conceived by Copernicus, but from which that
                    great astronomer had found himself constrained to depart. The sun could not
                    occupy the common centre of the circular orbits, but his place is in the common
                    focus of the elliptic orbits of all the planets; and it is to this focus that
                    every motion is to be referred, and from which every distance is to be measured.
                    The discovery of the elliptic motion, of the proportionality of the areas to the
                    times, and the method of dividing an ellipse, by straight lines drawn from the
                    focus to the periphery, into segments having a given ratio, formed the solution
                    of a problem which had been the constant object of the labours of all
                    astronomers from Ptolemy to Tycho, namely, to assign the place of a planet at
                    any instant of time whatever. The tables which he computed for the elliptic
                    motions form the model of those in present use. Some additions have been made in
                    consequence of the perturbations, which the geometry of Kepler was inadequate to
                    estimate, and which were only partially detected by the genius of Newton. It has
                    been considered matter of surprise that Kepler did not think of extending the
                    laws of the elliptic motion to the comets. Prepossessed with the idea that they
                    never return after their passage to the sun, he imagined that it would only be a
                    waste of time to attempt the calculation of the orbits of bodies which had so
                    transitory an existence. He supposed <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105181"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5181-0740"/>the tail to be produced by the action of the solar
                    rays, which, in traversing the body of the comet, continually carry off the most
                    subtile particles, so that the whole mass must be ultimately annihilated by the
                    successive detachment of the particles. He therefore neglected to study their
                    motions, and left to others a share of the glory resulting from the discovery of
                    the true paths of the celestial bodies. .</p>
                <p>The observations of eclipses had formed the principal object of the earliest
                    astronomers, but it was Kepler who first showed the practical advantages which
                    may be derived from them, by giving an example of the method of calculating a
                    difference of meridians from an eclipse of the sun. The method extends to
                    occultations of the stars, and is deservedly considered as the best we possess
                    for determining geographical longitudes and correcting the tables. He composed a
                    work on optics, replete with new and interesting views, and gave the first idea
                    of the telescope with two convex glasses, which has since been advantageously
                    substituted for that of Galileo. Prompt to seize every happy idea of his
                    contemporaries, he perceived with delight the advantages which practical
                    astronomy would derive from the new invention of the logarithms, and he
                    immediately constructed a table, from which the logarithms of the natural
                    numbers, sines, and tangents could be taken at once.</p>
                <p>Kepler was not merely an observer and calculator; he inquired with great
                    diligence into the physical causes of every phenomenon, and made a near approach
                    to the discovery of that great principle which maintains and regulates the
                    planetary motions. He possessed some very sound and accurate notions of the
                    nature of gravity, but unfortunately conceived it to diminish simply in
                    proportion to the distance, although he had demonstrated that the intensity of
                    light is reciprocally proportional to the surface over which it is spread, or
                    inversely as the square of the distance from the luminous body. In his famous
                    work <hi rend="italic">De Stella Martis,</hi> which contains the discovery of
                    the laws of the planetary motions, he distinctly states that gravity is a
                    corporeal affection, reciprocal between two bodies of the same kind, which
                    tends, like the action of the magnet, to bring them together, so that when the
                    earth attracts a stone, the stone at the same time attracts the earth, but by a
                    force feebler in proportion as it contains a smaller quantity of matter.
                    Further, if the moon and the earth were not retained in their respective orbits
                    by an animal or other equipollent force, the earth would mount towards the moon
                    one fifty-fourth part of the interval which separates them, and the moon would
                    descend the fifty-three remaining parts, supposing each to have the same
                    density. He likewise very clearly explains the cause of the tides in the
                    following passage. “If the earth ceased to attract its waters, the whole sea
                    would mount up and unite itself with the moon. The sphere of the attracting
                    force of the moon extends even to the earth, and draws the waters towards the
                    torrid zone, so that they rise to the point which has the moon in the zenith.”
                    It is not difficult to imagine how much these views must have contributed to the
                    immortal discovery of Newton.</p>
                <p>It is afflicting to consider how frequently the just rewards of true merit are
                    usurped by charlatanism and pretension. While the fire-eaters and astrologers of
                    Rudolph were basking in the sunshine of imperial favour, Kepler, from whose
                    labours the sciences derived the most signal benefits, passed his life in
                    extreme indigence. Born without fortune, the only revenue he possessed, and out
                    of which he had to maintain a numerous family, arose from the precarious produce
                    of his writings, and his pension of mathematician to the emperor,—a pension
                    which, owing to the calamities of the times, was seldom duly paid.</p>
                <p>On this account he was obliged to prefer frequent solicitations, and undertake
                    long journeys, whereby he lost his time, always precious to genius, and
                    exhausted his mind in anxiety. He died on the 15th of November 1630, at
                    Ratisbon, whither he had gone to solicit the arrears that were due to him. In
                    the present century a marble monument has been erected to his memory by an
                    enlightened prince, Charles of Alberg. It contains his bust and the ellipse of
                    Mars; a monument more glorious and more imperishable than brass or marble.</p>
                <p>Contemporary with Kepler was the illustrious Galileo, whose discoveries, being of
                    a more popular nature, and far more striking and intelligible to the generality
                    of mankind, had a much greater immediate effect on the opinions of the age, and
                    in hastening the revolution which was soon about to change the whole face of
                    physics and astronomy. Galileo-Galilei, a Florentine patrician, was born at
                    Florence in the year 1564. He passed his youth at Venice, where he continued
                    till he was appointed to a professor’s chair at Padua. After a residence of
                    eighteen years in that city, he was induced to remove to Pisa by Cosmo II, who
                    assigned him a pension, and conferred on him the tide of his first
                    mathematician. While residing at Venice, he heard it reported that Metius, a
                    Dutch optician, had discovered a certain combination of lenses, by means of
                    which distant objects were approximated to the sight. This vague and scanty
                    intelligence sufficed to excite the curiosity of Galileo, who immediately set
                    about inquiring into the means whereby such an effect could be produced. His
                    researches were attended with prompt success, and on the following day he had a
                    telescope which magnified about three times. It was formed by the combination of
                    two lenses, a plano-convex and plano-concave, fitted in a leaden tube. In a
                    second trial he obtained one which magnified seven or eight times; and
                    subsequent essays enabled him to increase the magnifying power to 32 times. On
                    directing his telescope to the moon, he perceived numerous inequalities on her
                    surface, the diversified appearances of which led him to conclude almost with
                    certainty that the moon is an opaque body similar to the earth, and reflecting
                    the light of the sun unequally, in consequence of her superficial asperities.
                    The planet Venus exhibited phases perfectly similar to those of the moon. These
                    phases had been formerly announced by Copernicus as a necessary consequence of
                    his system; and the actual discovery of their existence made it impossible to
                    doubt of the revolution of Venus round the sun. He detected the four satellites
                    or moons of Jupiter, and, in honour of his patron, gave them the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Medicean Stars.</hi> The discovery of these little bodies
                    circulating round the huge orb of Jupiter afforded him a strong analogical proof
                    of the annual revolution of the earth, accompanied by its moon. He perceived
                    spots on the disk of the sun, from the motions of which he concluded the
                    rotation of that body about its axis in the space of 27 days. The singular
                    appearances of Saturn were beheld by him with no less pleasure than
                    astonishment. His telescope was not sufficiently powerful to separate the ring
                    from the body of the planet; and to explain the appearances he supposed Saturn
                    to be composed of three stars almost in contact with one another. These
                    discoveries proved that the substances of the celestial bodies are similar to
                    that of the earth, and demolished the Aristotelian doctrine of their divine
                    essence and incorruptible nature. They enlarged the ideas of mankind respecting
                    the planetary system, and furnished the most convincing arguments in favour of
                    the doctrines of Copernicus.</p>
                <p>The discoveries of Galileo excited the envy of his <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193105194" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5194-0741"/> contemporaries, and stirred
                    up against him a persecution which embittered the last days of his life. The
                    motion of the earth, which he had proved so triumphantly, was considered
                    contrary to many express declarations of Scripture; it was also considered as a
                    heresy in the schools, where the doctrines of Aristotle were followed with
                    implicit submission. In defending the Copernican system, Galileo had incurred
                    the bitterest resentment, both of theologians and peripatetics. His great
                    reputation, his title of professor and first mathematician, gave them reason to
                    dread that the new doctrines, recommended by such an advocate, would spread too
                    rapidly, and finally overthrow the altars of Aristotle. They therefore combined
                    to check their progress, and to procure the ruin of Galileo by injurious
                    representatives to the Grand Duke and the court of Rome. Soon after his first
                    telescopic discoveries he was cited to appear before the Inquisition, and a
                    promise extorted from him that he would never, either by word or writing,
                    support the opinion of the motion of the earth. But in a great mind the love of
                    truth is the most imperious of all passions, and cannot be restrained by the
                    frowns of despotism, or the persecution of a fanatical tribunal. The evidences
                    of the motion of the earth burst forth from every point of the heavens; and
                    Galileo, in his celebrated <hi rend="italic">Dialogues</hi> on the system of the
                    world, exposed them in so clear and forcible a manner, that, although he
                    appeared to put them forth for the purpose of refuting them, it was not
                    difficult to perceive that he regarded them as complete and indubitable. For
                    this relapse into heresy he was again brought before the tribunal of the
                    Inquisition, and, in the seventieth year of his age, condemned formally to
                    retract and abjure the doctrine of the earth’s motion, and to be imprisoned
                    during the pleasure of the Inquisition. This scandalous proceeding has called
                    forth the indignant reprobation of every lover of truth and freedom. “What a
                    spectacle,” exclaims Bailly, “an old man, whose hairs were blanched with study,
                    watchings, and benefits to mankind, on his knees before the sacred Scriptures,
                    abjuring the truth in the eyes of Italy, which he had enlightened, in opposition
                    to the testimony of his conscience, and in spite of the manifestations given by
                    nature through all her works.”</p>
                <p>The sentence passed on Galileo was not inflicted with great severity. At the end
                    of a year the Grand Duke had the influence to procure his release from prison;
                    but he was prohibited from returning to Florence, and obliged to confine himself
                    to the Tuscan territory. He retired to the village of Arectri, where he resumed
                    his observations, and shortly afterwards discovered the libration of the moon.
                    The satellites of Jupiter continued also to engage his attention, and he
                    commenced a table of their motions, and pointed out the method of determining
                    the longitude by means of their eclipses. The states of Holland, aware of the
                    great benefit of his researches to commerce and navigation, sent two
                    astronomers, Hortensius and Blaeu, to present him with a gold chain, and
                    encourage him to persevere in his useful labours. A short time after receiving
                    this honourable mark of esteem from a foreign country, Galileo suddenly became
                    blind; and the task of forming the tables of the satellites was reserved for
                    Cassini. He survived this misfortune only a few years, and expired in 1642, in
                    the seventy-eighth year of his age..</p>
                <p>Science is indebted to Galileo for two other discoveries of a different kind,
                    less brilliant perhaps, but of far greater importance than those which we have
                    yet enumerated. These are the isochronism of the vibrations of the pendulum, and
                    the law of the acceleration of falling bodies. His telescopic discoveries could
                    not have remained long unknown; in fact, with the exception of those of the
                    phases of Venus, and of the triple form of Saturn, they were alI fiercely
                    disputed, even during his own lifetime. It is now' universally admitted that he
                    was the first who discovered the satellites of Jupiter, and the spots of the
                    sun; but the very circumstance of other claimants to these discoveries having
                    arisen, proves that they were within the reach of ordinary attention. No one
                    ever thought of disputing with Kepler the discovery of the laws of the planetary
                    motions. Those of Galileo required only eyes, and may be regarded as following
                    of course from the discovery of the telescope; but his persecution, his
                    condemnation, and his being compelled to retract and abjure a doctrine of which
                    he had given the physical proof, inspire a hallowed interest in his history, and
                    contributed much to the great reputation which he acquired throughout
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>While astronomy was making these rapid advances in the hands of Kepler and
                    Galileo, an event occurred in Scotland which contributed, though less directly,
                    no less powerfully, to the acceleration of its progress. This was the invention
                    of the logarithms by Lord Napier, baron of Merchiston; “an admirable artifice,”
                    says Laplace, “which, by reducing to a few days the labour of many months,
                    doubles the life of the astronomer, and spares him the errors and disgust
                    inseparable from long calculations; an invention of which the human mind has the
                    more reason to be proud, inasmuch as it was derived exclusively from its own
                    resources.” It may be added, that without this, or some equivalent artifice, the
                    computations rendered necessary by more correct observations would far exceed
                    the limits of human patience or industry, and astronomy could never have
                    acquired that precision and accuracy by which it is now distinguished above all
                    the other branches of human knowledge.</p>
                <p>The same epoch presents to us a great number of excellent observers, who,
                    although they did not produce any revolution in the state of astronomy, still
                    rendered it useful service. Scheiner is celebrated for his observations on the
                    solar spots, and his disputes with Galileo. John Bayer of Augsburg published a
                    description of the constellations, accompanied by maps, in which the stars are
                    marked by a Greek letter; a simple idea, which has been universally adopted.
                    Lansberg, a Flemish mathematician, published in 1632 a set of astronomical
                    tables, which, though filled with inaccuracies, rendered good service to science
                    by apprizing Horrox of the transit of Venus over the sun’s disk, which that
                    young astronomer and his friend Crabtree had the satisfaction of observing on
                    the 24th of November 1639. They were the first who ever witnessed that
                    interesting but rare phenomenon. Snellius is celebrated for his measure of the
                    earth. Gassendi, who had the merit, along with Descartes, of hastening the
                    downfall of the Aristotelian philosophy in France, made some useful
                    observations, particularly one of a transit of Mercury in 1631. His works, which
                    fill six folio volumes, abound with curious and useful researches. Riccioli, a
                    Jesuit, born at Ferrara in 1598, contributed to the progress of astronomy, not
                    so much by his own discoveries, as by collecting and rendering an account of
                    those of others. He rejected the system of Copernicus, and was more zealous in
                    maintaining the doctrines of the. church than in investigating nature; but his
                    works form a· vast repertory of useful information. His <hi rend="italic">Novum
                    Almagestum</hi> is a collection of the observations, opinions, and. physical
                    explanations of the phenomena, together with all the methods of computation then
                    known. He was assisted in his labours by Grimaldi, who discovered the inflection
                    of light, and gave the names to the principal spots of the moon which are now
                    used by astronomers.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105207" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5207-0742"/>
                <p>The most accurate observations that were ever made prior to the adaptation of the
                    telescope to astronomical instruments were those of Hevelius, a rich citizen of
                    Dantzic, who devoted his life and a large fortune to the service of astronomy.
                    Having fitted up an observatory, and furnished it with the best instruments
                    which could be procured, he commenced a course of observations, which he
                    followed assiduously upwards of forty years. In his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Selenographia</hi> he has given an accurate description of the face and spots
                    of the moon, accompanied with excellent delineations of her appearance in her
                    different phases and librations. The idea of making drawings of the different
                    phases of the moon had previously occurred to Gassendi and Peiresc, but they had
                    not been able to execute the project; indeed the difficulty attending it was
                    such, that it occupied Hevelius, who was an excellent draughtsman, as well as
                    observer, during a great number of years. Hevelius made an immense number of
                    researches on comets; and finding that the observations could not be represented
                    by rectilinear or circular orbits, he supposed them to move in parabolas. During
                    a temporary absence from Dantzic, this indefatigable astronomer had the
                    misfortune to lose, in a great fire which occurred in the city, his observatory,
                    instruments, manuscripts, and almost the entire edition of the second volume of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Machina Caelestis,</hi> which contained the results of his
                    long labours and numerous observations. He was now in his old age, but his zeal
                    did not give way under the terrible calamity. He patiently recommenced all his
                    calculations, reconstructed tables of the sun, and prepared for publication his
                    <hi rend="italic">Firmamentum</hi><hi rend="italic">Sobiescianum,</hi> or
                    celestial chart, which did not appear till after his death. Towards the latter
                    part of his life, the use of telescopic sights began to be generally adopted.
                    Hevelius, however, resisted the innovation, and continued to employ plain
                    sights. This preference given to the ancient method by so skilful an observer
                    induced Dr Halley to visit him at Dantzic, for the purpose of ascertaining, by a
                    comparison of observations made at the same time and plaĉe, which of the two
                    methods gave the most correct results. Dr Halley observed with the telescope,
                    and Hevelius with his own instruments; but such was the dexterity he had
                    acquired through long practice, that the difference of their observations seldom
                    amounted to more than a few seconds, and in no case to so much as a minute.
                    Notwithstanding this agreement, it is to be regretted that Hevelius did not
                    adopt the new method; for, on account of the greater precision given to
                    instruments by the use of the telescope, his observations, which were made
                    without it, cannot now be admitted in the construction of tables, and
                    consequently are for the most part useless to astronomy.</p>
                <p>Few individuals have rendered more important services to science than Huygens.
                    Born at the Hague in 1629, he studied geometry under Schooten, the commentator
                    of Descartes, and gave early proofs of proficiency in that science by a treatise
                    on the quadrature of the conic sections. Having passed into France, he studied
                    law at the university of Angers; but his principal attention was directed to the
                    physical sciences, particularly to optics. He employed himself in grinding and
                    polishing lenses; and constructed a telescope of ten feet, with which he
                    discovered one of the satellites of Saturn. His application of the pendulum to
                    clocks deserves to be considered as one of the best gifts which genius has ever
                    conferred on science. He seems to have conceived the idea of this application in
                    1656; and he presented the first description of the pendulum clock to the states
                    of Holland in 1657. He endeavoured to make this invention subservient to the
                    problem of the longitudes; and if his efforts were not attended with the desired
                    success, it may be said, that without another invention, in which also he had a
                    principal share,' that of the spiral spring, the object would never have been
                    accomplished so nearly as it was a hundred years later. By means of his
                    excellent telescopes he discovered that the extraordinary appearance exhibited
                    by Saturn was occasioned by a ring surrounding the body of the planet, and
                    inclined to the ecliptic in an angle which he estimated at 21°. He published his
                    observations on this planet in a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Systema
                    Saturnium,</hi> which still shows some traces of that species of reasoning from
                    final causes which so greatly disfigures the writings of Kepler. For example, on
                    discovering the satellite, he conceived that as the number of satellites now
                    equalled the number of planets, it was in vain to look for more, the equality
                    being necessary to the harmony of the system. He lived, however, to witness the
                    discovery of four more satellites belonging to the same planet. Huygens was
                    invited to settle in France by Colbert, the patriotic minister of Louis XIV.,
                    who assigned him a pension and a seat in the academy of sciences. He continued
                    in that country till the revocation of the edict of Nantz in 1681, when he
                    resigned his pension and retired to Holland. After this he contributed several
                    papers to the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> and in 1690
                    published a treatise on light and gravitation. Geometry, mechanics, and optics,
                    are indebted to the genius of Huygens for many important discoveries. His
                    theorems on central forces, his researches on the doctrine of probabilities and
                    continued fractions, and his theory of involutes and evolutes, raise him to the
                    highest rank among the mathematicians of his age. He died on the 8th of June
                    1695, at the age of 66 years.</p>
                <p>The application of telescopes and micrometers to graduated instruments forms an
                    important epoch in the history of astronomy. This happy improvement was first
                    brought into use by Picard in 1667. Morin, indeed, had applied a telescope to
                    the quadrant so early as 1634, and <hi rend="italic">perceived</hi> the stars in
                    full day in 1635. In 1669 Picard began to observe the stars on the meridian in
                    the daytime, with a quadrant, to which, in concert with Azout, he had applied an
                    astronomical telescope having cross wires in its focus. Huygens invented the
                    plate micrometer in 1650; Malvasia that with the fixed wires in 1662; and Azout
                    that with the movable wire in 1666. (SeeDe-lambre, <hi rend="italic">Astronomie
                    du Moyen</hi><hi rend="italic">Age,</hi> p. 618. Note by Bouvard.) It is
                    principally to the happy discoveries and ingenious inventions just referred to,
                    and the fine application of the pendulum to clocks by Huygens in 1656, that we
                    must attribute the rapid progress since made in practical astronomy, and the
                    extreme precision of modern observations. Picard was also the first who
                    introduced the modem method of determining the right ascensions of the stars, by
                    observing their meridional passages, and employed the pendulum for that purpose.
                    He likewise introduced the method of corresponding altitudes, and is entitled to
                    be regarded as the founder of modern astronomy in France.</p>
                <p>Roemer, the friend and pupil of Picard, discovered the progressive motion of
                    light in 1675, and measured its velocity by means of the eclipses of Jupiter’s
                    satellites. He was the first who erected a transit instrument, which gave a new
                    accuracy to observations of right ascension.</p>
                <p>The Royal Observatory of Paris was completed in 1670, and its direction intrusted
                    to Dominic Cassini. This ce-ĵ lebrated astronomer was born at Perinaldo, in the
                    county of Nice, and educated in a college of the Jesuits at Genoa. He acquired
                    an early passion for astronomical observations; and in 1644 was invited to
                    Bologna by the marquis Malvasia, where, in 1650, he succeeded Cavalleri <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193105220" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5220-0743"/> as professor of
                    astronomy. In this situation he continued 'till 1669, when he went to Paris on
                    the invitation of Louis XIV. He was naturalized in France in 1673, and continued
                    in the charge of the observatory till his death, which happened in 1712.</p>
                <p>Cassini enriched astronomy with a great number of curious observations and
                    discoveries. He determined the motions of Jupiter’s satellites from observations
                    of their eclipses, and constructed tables of them, which were found to be
                    remarkably exact. He observed that the ring of Satum is double, and discovered
                    four of the satellites of that planet. He also determined the rotation of
                    Jupiter and Mars, and made a number of observations on Venus with the same view.
                    He observed the zodiacal light, and made a near approximation to the parallax of
                    the sun. We also owe to him the first table of refractions, calculated on
                    correct principles; and a complete theory of the libration of the moon. Galileo
                    had only observed the libration in latitude; Hevelius explained the libration in
                    longitude, by supposing that the moon always presents the same face to the
                    centre of her orbit, of which the earth occupies a focus. Cassini made the
                    important remark, that the axis of rotation of the moon is inclined to the
                    ecliptic, and that its nodes coincide with those of the lunar orbit, so that the
                    poles of the orbit, ecliptic, and equator of the moon, are on the same circle of
                    latitude, the pole of the ecliptic being situated between the other two. The
                    greater number of these discoveries are, however, only of secondary importance;
                    and it must be confessed that Cassini took no part in the great and permanent
                    improvements which astronomy received in that age. He has, nevertheless,
                    obtained an extraordinary reputation. Lalande remarks, that in his hands
                    astronomy underwent the most signal revolutions, and that his name is, in
                    France, almost synonymous with that of creator of the science. Delambre has,
                    however, taken a different and far more accurate view of the real services of
                    Cassini. “The revolution in Astronomy,” this judicious critic observes, “was
                    brought about by Copernicus, by the laws of Kepler, by the pendulum of Huygens,
                    the micrometers of Azout and Picard, by the sectors and mural of Picard, and his
                    method of corresponding altitudes, by the transit instruments of Roemer; and
                    Cassini appears to us an entire stranger to all these innovations. He followed
                    another route; he devoted a long life to painful observations, which at last
                    deprived him of sight. Let us not refuse him the praise which he has so well
                    merited, but let us reserve a place in our esteem for labours less brilliant
                    perhaps, but of greater and more permanent utility, and which evince at least
                    equal talent and sagacity.”</p>
                <p>Cassini was assisted in his observations by his nephew, James Philip Maraldi, who
                    determined the regression of the nodes, and the progressive motion of the
                    apsides of the orbit of Jupiter. This astronomer also corrected the theory of
                    Mars, and observed the sun’s parallax. He rejected the hypothesis of the
                    progressive motion of light, as being insufficient to explain the inequalities
                    of Jupiter’s satellites; and he conceived the design of forming a new catalogue
                    of the stars, which, however, was never executed. He died in 1729.</p>
                <p>There is no period in the history of mankind so distinguished by great and
                    important discoveries, or so remarkable for the rapid development of the human
                    intellect, as the seventeenth century. We have already noticed the invention of
                    the pendulum, and its application to regulate the motion of time-keepers; of the
                    telescope, and some of the phenomena of the new worlds it has exposed to view;
                    of the logarithms, by which computations are so much abridged; and of the
                    mechanical contrivances for measuring minute angles in the heavens. The same
                    century witnessed the application of algebra to geometry, the discovery of the
                    laws of the planetary motions, of the infinitesimal calculus, the acceleration
                    of falling bodies, the sublime theory of central forces, and the great principle
                    of gravitation which connects the celestial orbs, and regulates the motions
                    which it had been the business of the astronomer to observe since the earliest
                    ages of the world. The different steps which conducted to this important
                    discovery, and the immediate consequences deduced from it by its immortal
                    author, are so fully developed in the admirable Dissertation on the Progress of
                    the Physical Sciences, in this Encyclopaedia, that it is unnecessary to enter
                    into any detail respecting them here; we may only remark, that if observation
                    has furnished the data for the discovery of the mechanical principle and
                    primordial laws of the universe, the knowledge of these laws has been, in turn,
                    of the most essential service to observation, by guiding and directing it to its
                    most important objects. Many of the inequalities of the planetary motions, in
                    consequence of their minuteness and the slowness with which they vary, could not
                    have been detected by observation; others might perhaps have been perceived, but
                    we should still have been ignorant whether their constant accumulation might not
                    ultimately change the state of the system, and, by destroying all confidence in
                    the tables, demolish the fabric which had been reared at such a vast expense of
                    time and labour. But when these inequalities are detected by theory, and
                    separated from the mean motions with which they were blended, it becomes an
                    object of the highest interest to confirm their existence by the most delicate
                    and accurate observations. Hence, a more refined practice has constantly
                    followed every theoretical discovery. Besides, it is the perfection of theory,
                    and not the mere knowledge of isolated facts, which gives astronomy its greatest
                    value in the eyes of the philosopher. Numerous and important as its applications
                    are, they have but a subordinate interest, in comparison of the knowledge of
                    those general laws to which every particle of matter in the universe is subject,
                    and by the discovery of which man has penetrated so deeply into the mysteries of
                    nature.</p>
                <p>By the discovery of the law of gravity Newton laid the foundations of physical
                    astronomy; and by the consequences which he deduced from that law, proceeded far
                    in the erection of the superstructure. He showed that the motions of all the
                    bodies of the planetary system are regulated by its influence; he determined the
                    figure of the earth on the supposition of its homogeneity; he gave a theory of
                    the tides, discovered the cause of the precession of the equinoxes, and
                    determined some of the principal lunar inequalities and planetary perturbations.
                    Many of his theories were left in an imperfect state; for it is not in matters
                    of science that it is given to the same individual to invent and bring to
                    perfection: their complete development required that several subsidiary sciences
                    should be farther advanced; but it has been the triumph of his system, that
                    every subsequent discovery has only tended to strengthen and confirm it. This
                    bright ornament of the human genius was born on the 25th of December 1642, the
                    day of the death of Galileo, and died on the 20th of March 1727, in the 85th
                    year of his age.</p>
                <p>While physical astronomy was undergoing a complete revolution in the hands of
                    Newton, the practical part was receiving great improvement from Flamsteed, the
                    first astronomer royal, who conducted the Greenwich Observatory. This celebrated
                    institution, from which so many important discoveries have emanated, was erected
                    under the reign of Charles II. in 1675. Flamsteed was appoint; <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193105233" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5233-0744"/>ed to it in 1676, and
                    continued with indefatigable zeal to discharge the duties of the office during
                    the long period of 33 years. In the course of this time he made an immense
                    number of excellent observations, the results of which are given in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi rend="italic">Caelestis,</hi> the first edition
                    of which was published in 1712, at the expense of Prince George of Denmark, the
                    husband of Queen Anne. The second appeared in 1723, some time after the death of
                    the author, in three volumes folio. The first volume contains the observations
                    which he made, first at Derby, and afterwards at Greenwich, on the fixed stars,
                    planets, comets, spots of the sun, and Jupiter’s satellites. The second volume
                    contains the transits of the planets and stars over the meridian, and the places
                    of the planets deduced from these observations. The third contains an historical
                    notice, in which he gives a description of the instruments used by Tycho and
                    himself; catalogues of fixed stars by Ptolemy, Ulugh Beigh, Tycho, the landgrave
                    of Hesse, and Hevelius; together with the British Catalogue, containing the
                    places of 2884 Stars. The labours of Flamsteed were, however, confined entirely
                    to the practical part of astronomy. He made no improvements in theory; but he is
                    entitled to the merit of having been the first who brought into common use the
                    method of simultaneously observing the right ascension of the sun and a star, a
                    method by means of which the determination of the positions of the stars is
                    reduced to the observation of meridional transits and altitudes. He was likewise
                    the first who explained the true principles of the equation of time; and he
                    improved the lunar tables by introducing into them the annual equation which had
                    been suggested by Horrox. The <hi rend="italic">Atlas Caelestis,</hi> another
                    posthumous work of Flamsteed, was published in 1753.</p>
                <p>Flamsteed was succeeded in the observatory by Dr Halley, a philosopher whose
                    inventive genius and indefatigable activity rendered him one of the brightest
                    ornaments of his country. Halley was the son of a wealthy citizen of London,
                    where he was born on the 8th of November 1656. From his earliest years he
                    applied himself with ardour to the study of mathematics and astronomy; and
                    having procured a few instruments, he began to make observations, by which he
                    was led to remark the inaccuracy of the tables of Jupiter and Saturn. In his
                    19th year he published a direct and geometrical method of finding the
                    eccentricities and aphelia of the orbits of the planets; and in the year
                    following he undertook a voyage to St Helena, with a view to form a catalogue of
                    the stars in the southern hemisphere. The station was unfortunately chosen, for,
                    owing to the incessant rains and foggy atmosphere of that island, he was able to
                    determine the places of only 360 stars in the course of a whole year. He had,
                    however, the satisfaction of observing a transit of Mercury over the sun’s disk,
                    a phenomenon which suggested to him the important remark, that the transits of
                    the inferior planets might be advantageously employed in determining one of the
                    most essential elements of the planetary system, viz. the parallax of the sun,
                    and consequently the diameters of the orbits. The method has since been
                    successfully employed in the case of Venus: the transits of Mercury, though much
                    more frequent, are not so well adapted to the purpose. On his return from St
                    Helena he was commissioned by the Royal Society to visit Hevelius at Dantzic,
                    and determine, by a direct comparison of observations, the dispute which had
                    arisen between that astronomer and Dr Hooke respecting the relative advantages
                    of plain and telescopic sights. After this Halley for some time travelled on the
                    Continent, and on his return to England devoted himself entirely to scientific
                    pursuits. The fruits of his leisure soon began to appear in the multitude of
                    treatises which he published from time to time in every department of the
                    mathematical and physical sciences. The’ most important of those connected with
                    astronomy was his <hi rend="italic">Synopsis Astronomies Cometicae,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> a work abounding in profound and original views, and which,
                    in respect of theory, formed perhaps the most remarkable accession to the
                    science that had been made since the time of Kepler. In this work he revived an
                    ancient opinion, that the comets belong to the solar system, and move in very
                    eccentric orbits round the sun, returning after stated but long intervals. He
                    also ventured to predict that the comet of 1681 would again return to its
                    perihelion in 1759,—the first prediction of the kind that was verified. In 1720
                    Dr Halley was appointed to succeed Flamsteed in the Royal Observatory; and
                    though now in the 64th year of his age, he undertook, with a view to improve the
                    lunar theory, to observe the moon through a whole revolution of her nodes,
                    erroneously supposing, that after such a revolution the errors of the tables
                    would again appear in the same order. He was the first who, by a comparison of
                    ancient and modern observations, remarked the acceleration of the mean motion of
                    the moon, and thus called the attention of mathematicians to an important and
                    curious phenomenon, the physical cause of which was at length detected by the
                    powerful analysis of Laplace. He was also the first who pointed out the secular
                    inequalities of Jupiter and Saturn, occasioned by their mutual perturbations,—a
                    theory that formed the subject of several profound memoirs of Euler and
                    Lagrange, and for the complete development of which astronomy is likewise
                    indebted to Laplace. Besides these important discoveries in astronomy, the
                    labours of Dr Halley also greatly contributed to the promotion of geometry and
                    navigation. He undertook two long voyages, and traversed the Pacific Ocean to
                    observe the deviations of the magnetic needle; and posterity will gratefully
                    recollect that it v¢as through his pressing solicitations that Newton consented
                    to the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Principia.</hi> In 1703 he succeeded
                    Dr Wallis as professor of geometry at Oxford. He became secretary of the Royal
                    Society in 1713, and died at Greenwich in 1742.</p>
                <p>The discoveries of Bradley, who succeeded Halleyas] astronomer royal, form a
                    memorable epoch in the history t of the science. This great astronomer was born
                    at Sher- “borne in Gloucestershire in 1692, and acquired from his uncle, Mr
                    Pound, an early taste for astronomical observation. He was destined for the
                    church, and for some time held a curacy, which he resigned in 1721, on being
                    appointed to succeed Keill as Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford. His
                    first essays indicated no extraordinary talent; but an opportunity having
                    presented itself of engaging in more important researches, he embraced it with
                    ardour; and by his sagacity and perseverance was conducted to two discoveries
                    which have entirely changed the face of astronomy.</p>
                <p>A singular motion of the polar star had been observed] by Picard, of which,
                    however, that astronomer could nei- <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> ther assign
                    the law nor give any satisfactory explanation. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> He
                    only remarked that the inequality was annual, and amounted to about 40 seconds.
                    Hooke, in 1674, a few years after the observations of Picard, imagined that he
                    had discovered a parallax in some of the stars; and Flamsteed, following the
                    ideas of Hooke, explained, by means of parallax, the minute changes of position
                    which he had observed in Polaris and some circumpolar stars. Manfredi and
                    Cassini demonstrated the error of Flamsteed, but were not more successful in
                    their attempts to explain the motion in question. Samuel Molyneux conceived the
                    idea of verifying all that had been said respecting the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193105246" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5246-0745"/>supposed parallaxes, and for
                    this purpose commenced a 'series of observations at Kew, with an excellent .24
                    feet sector constructed by Graham. Bradley, who happened at that time to reside
                    at Kew, took a part in these observations, the result of which was, that the
                    remarks of Picard were confirmed beyond the possibility of doubt. It was,
                    however, abundantly evident that the apparent motions alluded to were not
                    connected in any manner with parallax; it therefore became an object of the
                    greatest interest to determine their physical cause, and assign their law and
                    period. The first idea that occurred was to inquire whether they arose from a
                    change of position in the earth’s axis; but this supposition was found to be
                    inadequate to the explanation of the phenomena. Molyneux having been in the mean
                    time appointed a lord of the admiralty, the observations were discontinued at
                    Kew; they were, however, shortly after resumed by Bradley at Wanstead, with a
                    smaller but more convenient instrument; and after they had been continued
                    several years, it was found that the star <hi rend="italic">(γ</hi> draconis) on
                    which they were principally made, appeared to describe annually a small ellipse,
                    the transverse axis of which amounted to 40". This was an important
                    determination; for the ellipse afforded the means of computing at all times the
                    aberration of any star whatever, whether in longitude, latitude, declination, or
                    right ascension. Bradley also pointed out the physical cause of the aberration,
                    and demonstrated that it resulted from the combination of the motion of light
                    with the annual motion of the earth. This capital discovery was made in
                    1728.</p>
                <p>Bradley, anxious to verify his ingenious theory, conti- nued his observations,
                    and soon felt the difficulty that had so much embarrassed Picard. The places of
                    the stars, 'calculated according to his formula for the aberration, could not be
                    reconciled with the observations. The errors continued to augment during nine
                    years, after which they went on diminishing during the nine years following.
                    This inequality, of which the period, like that of the nodes of the moon, was 18
                    years, was readily explained by supposing a slight oscillation of the earth’s
                    axis, occasioned by the action of the moon on the protuberant parts surrounding
                    the equator of the terrestrial spheroid. After assiduously observing its effects
                    during twenty years, Bradley found that the phenomena could be accurately
                    represented by giving the pole of the equator a retrograde motion about its mean
                    place in an ellipse whose axes are 18" and 16", and completing its revolution in
                    the period of 18 years. This result was communicated to the Royal Society in
                    1748. To these two grand discoveries of Bradley, the aberration and nutation,
                    modern astronomy is wholly indebted for all its accuracy and precision; and, as
                    Delambre remarks, they assure to their author a distinguished place, after
                    Hipparchus and Kepler, above the astronomers of all ages and all countries.</p>
                <p>Bradley was appointed astronomer royal in 1741, and from this time to the period
                    of his death made an immense number of observations, which were presented by his
                    heirs to the university of Oxford, on condition that they should forthwith be
                    published. The first volume appeared only in 1798, edited by Dr Hornsby. The
                    rest were committed to the care of the late Dr Abraham Robertson, and appeared
                    in 1805. Dr Bradley was chosen a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences
                    in 1748. In 1752, twenty-four years after his great discovery of the aberration
                    of light, he was admitted into the Royal Society. He died on the 13th of July
                    1762, in the 70th year of his age.</p>
                <p>While England was deriving so much glory from the brilliant discoveries of
                    Bradley, .France produced a multitude of excellent astronomers, by whose
                    successful labours every department of the science was signally promoted. Among
                    these Lacaille is pre-eminently distinguished, both by the variety and
                    importance of his observations, and the indefatigable zeal with which, during
                    twenty-two years, he prosecuted the most laborious researches. He commenced his
                    astronomical career in 1739, by assisting Cassini de Thury (grandson of the
                    first Cassini) in the verification of the measurement of the meridian through
                    France. In 1751 he undertook a voyage to the Cape of Good Hope, the primary
                    objects of which were to determine the sun’s parallax, by means of observations
                    on the parallaxes of Mars and Venus, while similar observations were made in
                    Europe; and to form a catalogue of the southern circumpolar stars. No
                    undertaking for the benefit of science was ever more successfully executed. In
                    the course of a single year, Lacaille, without assistance, observed upwards of
                    ten thousand stars, situated between the tropic of Capricon and the pole, and
                    computed the places of 1942 of them; a labour which would scarcely be credited,
                    if the details of his observations had not been published in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Coelum</hi><hi rend="italic">Australe Stelliferum,</hi> a work
                    which was given to the world in 1763. Our admiration of the rapid execution of
                    this vast undertaking will be increased, when we consider, that during the same
                    time he measured a degree of the meridian, and made numerous observations on the
                    moon simultaneous with those of Lalande, who observed at Berlin, in order to
                    determine the moon’s parallax, by means of direct observations made at the
                    extremities of a meridional arc of upwards of 85 degrees. Before his return to
                    Europe, he visited the isles of France and Bourbon, where he measured the length
                    of the pendulum, and made numerous remarks on the natural and civil history of
                    those countries. Astronomy is likewise indebted to Lacaille for a table of
                    refractions which he computed from a comparison of above 300 observations made
                    at the Cape and at Paris. In 1757 he published his <hi rend="italic">Astronomies
                    Fundamenta,</hi> in which he gave rules and tables for computing the apparent
                    motions of the stars, which continued to be employed till Lambert supplied the
                    corrections depending on the nutation, and Delambre those depending on the
                    aberration. To defray the expense attending the publication of this important
                    work, which he distributed in presents to the different observatories and
                    astronomers in Europe, he submitted to the drudgery of calculating ephemerides
                    during ten years. Lacaille composed several elementary works for the use of the
                    students in the college of Mazarin, where he occupied the chair of astronomy,
                    and inserted a great number of memoirs in the volumes of the Academy of
                    Sciences. This great astronomer, distinguished as much by the excellence of his
                    moral qualities as his profound knowledge and indefatigable zeal, died suddenly
                    in 1762.</p>
                <p>The Royal Observatory of Paris continued under the direction of the family of
                    Dominie Cassini during 120 years. James Cassini, the second of that name, is
                    principally known by a work on the magnitude and figure of the earth, and his
                    <hi rend="italic">Elements of Astronomy.</hi> He seems not to have duly
                    appreciated the new discoveries which were daily making around him. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements,</hi> published in 1740, contains no mention of the
                    aberration; and he adopted the opinion that the earth is elongated instead of
                    being flattened at the poles. His son, Cassini de Thury, was chiefly occupied
                    with the meridian, and the geometrical survey of France. The last astronomer of
                    the family, the Count de Cassini, was obliged to resign the observatory at the
                    revolution.</p>
                <p>The question of the figure of the earth furnished ample materials for the
                    practical as well as the speculative as <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105259"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5259-0746"/>tronomer during the last century. The results of
                    the measurement of the meridian by Cassini were at variance with the theories of
                    Newton and Huygens; and the Academy of Sciences resolved on making a decisive
                    experiment by the actual measurement of the lengths of two degrees, one at the
                    equator, and another in as high a latitude as could be reached. In the year
                    1735, three astronomers, Godin, Bouguer, and La Condamine, were commissioned by
                    the French government to accomplish the first of these objects in Peru; and the
                    year following, Maupertuis, Clairaut, Camus, and Lemonnier, went to Lapland to
                    execute the second under the polar circle. Notwithstanding the greater
                    difficulties they had to contend with, the first party were the most successful;
                    but the result of both operations established the compression of the earth at
                    the poles. Bouguer published the details of the Peruvian measurement in an
                    admirable work on the <hi rend="italic">Figure of the Earth,</hi> in which he
                    has also inserted an account of a great number of experiments made by him in the
                    same country to determine the length of the seconds’ pendulum, and the effects
                    of the attraction of mountains on the plumb-line. Bouguer is likewise the author
                    of an excellent treatise on light. This accomplished mathematician and
                    experimenter did not adopt the Newtonian theory of gravitation, but he was the
                    last apostle of the Cartesian philosophy in the Academy of Sciences.</p>
                <p>It would greatly exceed the limits of this article to give even an abridged
                    account of tfie numerous observers who, about this period, contributed to the
                    improvement of every department of practical astronomy. We must therefore
                    content ourselves with merely noticing the names of some of the most
                    distinguished, leaving the details of their labours to be given in the
                    biographical articles interspersed throughout the work.</p>
                <p>Delisle formed a school of astronomy in Russia, and has left a method of
                    computing the heliocentric places of the sun’s spots, and of Mercury and Venus
                    in their transits over the sun’s disk, and likewise of determining, by means of
                    the stereographic projection, the directions of their path when they enter and
                    leave the disk. Lemonnier introduced the discoveries of Bradley into his <hi
                    rend="italic">Astronomical Institutions,</hi> and was the instructor of Lacaille
                    and Lalande. He published a <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Celeste,</hi> containing a collection of observations from 1666 to 1685, and a
                    number of other works and memoirs connected with astronomy. He made an immense
                    number of observations, but their accuracy is far inferior to those of Bradley.
                    Wargentin, secretary of the Academy of Sciences of Stockholm, devoted the whole
                    of his life to the correction of the tables of the satellites of Jupiter. The
                    theory of the satellites was not then far advanced; but when theory failed him,
                    he profited by the remarks of others and by his own reflections, and endeavoured
                    by repeated trials to find empirical equations capable of conciliating the
                    tables with the best observations. By confining himself almost exclusively to
                    this subject, he acquired a high reputation, and was ranked among the first
                    astronomers of an epoch which abounds in great names. His tables of the
                    satellites have, on account of their superior accuracy, been employed in
                    determining the masses, and other elements, which serve as the basis of the
                    analytical theories.</p>
                <p>One of the most celebrated astronomers of the last century was Lalande. He
                    commenced his early career by a set of lunar observations at Berlin, undertaken
                    simultaneously with those of Lacaille at the Cape, for the purpose of
                    determining the moon’s horizontal parallax. On his return to Paris he was
                    received, though only twenty-one years of age, into the Academy of Sciences; and
                    on the resignation of Delisle was appointed professor of astronomy m the college
                    of France. By his extraordinary zeal, indefatigable activity, and the care which
                    he took to have his name constantly before the public, Lalande soon became one
                    of the most distinguished men of his day; but his reputation, acquired in a
                    great measure from attention to subjects which had only an ephemeral interest,
                    and not through any permanent or fundamental additions to science, has already
                    begun to wane; and his works, many of which are of considerable utility, seem to
                    have fallen into unmerited neglect. His character as an astronomer is fairly and
                    impartially summed up by Delambre in the following terms :—“If Lalande did not
                    renew the foundations of astronomical science, like Copernicus and Kepler,— if
                    he did not, like Bradley, immortalize himself by two brilliant discoveries,—if
                    he was not so learned and accurate a theorist as Mayer,—if he was not to the
                    same decree as Lacaille an exact, expert, scrupulous, industrious, and
                    indefatigable observer and calculator,—if he had not the constancy to attach
                    himself, like Wargentin, to a single object, in order to become the first in a
                    particular department,—and if, in all these respects, he was only an astronomer
                    of the second rank,—he was the first of all as a professor. No one ever did more
                    to propagate the knowledge and love of astronomy. It was his object to be useful
                    and celebrated; and he succeeded, through his labours, his activity, his credit,
                    and his solicitations: by means of a most extensive correspondence he
                    incessantly laboured for the benefit of science: he even endeavoured to serve it
                    after his death, by founding a medal, which the Academy of Sciences adjudges
                    annually to the astronomer who has made the most interesting observation, or
                    written the most useful memoir.” (Delambre, <hi rend="italic">Astronomie</hi><hi

                <p>Bradley was succeeded in the Greenwich Observatory by Dr Bliss, who died in the
                    course of a few years after his appointment. Dr Bliss was in turn succeeded by
                    Dr Maskelyne, the late astronomer royal,· under whose care the observatory
                    maintained the high character which it acquired from the immortal labours of his
                    illustrious predecessors. Dr Maskelyne began his astronomical career in 1761,
                    when he was appointed to observe the transit of Venus at the island of St
                    Helena, and endeavour to verify the existence of a small parallax of the star
                    Sirius, which seemed to be indicated by the observations of Lacaille at the
                    Cape. Unfortunately the state of the weather prevented him from observing the
                    transit; and his observations on Sirius were abandoned in consequence of the
                    discovery of a defect in the zenith sector which he had carried out with him for
                    the purpose of making the observations in question. The main objects of his
                    voyage were thus frustrated; but some indirect advantages resulted from it,
                    which compensated in some measure for the disappointment. The attention of
                    Ramsden was called to the sector, and a better method of constructing these
                    instruments was devised. At St Helena he made several interesting observations
                    on the tides, the variation of the compass, the moon’s horary parallaxes,
                    &amp;c. In going out and returning home, he paid particular attention to the
                    different methods of finding the longitude at sea, and practised that which
                    depends on observations of the lunar distances from known stars, taken with a
                    Hadley’s sextant, or other reflecting instrument. He also composed a set of
                    rules for the use of the seamen, which he published on his return, first in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> and afterwards in the <hi
                    rend="italic">British Mariners Guide.</hi> In the year 1765 he was appointed
                    astronomer royal, and soon after recommended to the Board of Longitude the
                    general adoption in the navy of the lunar method of finding the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193105272" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5272-0747"/>longitude, and proposed that
                    tables for facilitating that method should be calculated and published in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Nautical Almanac.</hi> This recommendation was adopted, and
                    the Nautical Almanac continued to be published under his superintendence during
                    forty-eight successive years. He also published a set of tables requisite to be
                    used with that long-celebrated ephemeris; and by these means contributed to
                    bring nautical astronomy to its present state of precision. Dr Maskelyne was
                    most assiduous in the discharge of his important duties as astronomer royal. On
                    one occasion only did he consent to leave the observatory, viz. when at the
                    request of the Royal Society he proceeded to Scotland for the purpose of
                    determining, by experiments on Schehallien, the deflection of the plumb-line
                    occasioned by the attraction of the mountain. The result of the observations
                    made on this occasion furnished data for the determination of the mean density
                    of the earth, which Dr Hutton, by a laborious process of calculation, found to
                    be about five times greater than that of water. Dr Maskelyne had the credit to
                    procure, at the expense of the Royal Society, the regular publication of his
                    observations, by which he rendered a great service to all the astronomers of
                    Europe. The lunar method of determining the longitude, the Nautical Almanac, the
                    catalogue of 36 stars, and some improvements in the construction of instruments,
                    are the principal benefits for which astronomy is indebted to Dr Maskelyne.</p>
                <p>Sir William Herschel, born in Hanover in 1738, has rendered his name immortal by
                    the discovery of a new planet without the orbit of Saturn, and thereby doubling
                    the ancient boundaries of the solar system. Having settled in England, at Bath,
                    he began to devote his leisure to the construction of telescopes and the
                    polishing of reflecting mirrors. Endowed with equal skill and patience, he soon
                    obtained instruments superior to any that had been known before, by means of
                    which he was led to the most brilliant discoveries that have been made in the
                    heavens since the time of Galileo. Being employed in making a review of the sky
                    with a powerful telescope, he perceived, on the 13th of March 1781, near the
                    feet of Gemini, a star of the fifth magnitude, having a disk perfectly well
                    defined, and differing in appearance from the other stars which afforded the
                    same quantity of light. On observing it with a telescope whose magnifying power
                    was 932, he perceived its diameter was enlarged, while that of the stars
                    underwent no change. These circumstances were sufficient to draw his attention
                    to the star, and nothing more was requisite to enable him speedily to discover
                    that it had a slow motion. He at first supposed it was a comet, and acquainted
                    Dr Maskelyne with the discovery. The circumstance was soon made known at Paris;
                    and it was gradually perceived, that as the distance of the star did not
                    sensibly vary, it was necessary to regard it as a seventh planet. Herschel, in
                    honour of his royal patron, gave it the name of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Georgium</hi><hi rend="italic">Sidus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but the
                    mythological appellation of Uranus has prevailed. On the 11th of January 1787 he
                    discovered two satellites revolving round the new planet, and subsequently found
                    that it was accompanied by four others. It was soon noticed that Uranus had been
                    observed by Flamsteed, Mayer, and Lemonnier, who had each supposed it to be one
                    of the fixed stars. Their observations enabled Delambre to correct the elements
                    of the orbit, and calculate tables of its motion. By means of his powerful
                    telescopes Herschel determined the figure and rotation of Saturn, discovered the
                    parallel belts on his surface, and perceived that the ring was double. In 1789
                    he discovered two new satellites belonging to this planet, and revolving within
                    the ring. From some appearances indicated by the fixed stars,</p>
                <p>Herschel was led to conclude that the whole solar system is in motion about some
                    distant centre, and that its direction is at present towards the constellation
                    Hercules, a conclusion, however, which succeeding observations have not
                    verified. His observations on nebulae and double stars have opened up a new
                    field of research, boundless in extent, and interesting by reason of the variety
                    of the objects it presents to the attention of the observer. The extraordinary
                    activity with which he pursued his favourite occupations is attested by 67
                    memoirs communicated from time to time to the Royal Society. A great part of
                    these, however, is filled with speculations of no value to astronomy; and his
                    taste was rather to observe astronomical phenomena than to engage in
                    computations, or the more arduous and essential, though less fascinating,
                    labours through which the science can be really benefited. In the course of the
                    following chapters we shall have frequent occasion to allude to his discoveries,
                    and his ingenious speculations concerning the constitution of the sun and the
                    sidereal heavens.</p>
                <p>Few individuals have contributed so eminently to the perfection of modern
                    astronomy as Delambre, the late perpetual secretary of the Academy of Sciences.
                    The scientific life of this illustrious astronomer did not commence till he had
                    attained his 40th year; but from that time till his death it was occupied by a
                    series of unremitting labours to enlarge the boundaries, and ameliorate the
                    practice and theory of the science. Associated with Mechain, he was employed
                    during the troubles of the revolution in measuring the meridian from Dunkirk to
                    Barcelona,—a labour which was prosecuted with admirable zeal in the face of
                    innumerable difficulties, and even dangers of the most formidable kind. By an
                    immense number of excellent observations he determined the constants which enter
                    into the formulae deduced from theory by the profound researches of Lagrange and
                    Laplace, and also formed a set of tables much more exact than any that had
                    appeared before them. His <hi rend="italic">Astronomic</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Théorique et Pratique,</hi> in three quarto volumes, contains the best rules
                    and methods which have yet been devised for the guidance of the practical
                    astronomer; and his <hi rend="italic">Histoire,</hi> in six large volumes 4to,
                    gives an account of every successive improvement which has been made in the
                    science, and a full abstract of every work of celebrity which has been written
                    respecting it, since the first rude observations of the Greeks to the end of the
                    last century. It is invaluable to the historian, and will ever remain a proud
                    monument of the profound learning and laborious research of its author.</p>
                <p>The observatory which was established at Palermo about the year 1790, under the
                    active superintendence of Piazzi, holds a distinguished rank among the similar
                    institutions of Europe. Piazzi, born in 1746, took the habit of the religious
                    order of the <hi rend="italic">Theatins</hi> at Milan, and finished his
                    noviciate in the convent of St Anthony. Among his preceptors he had the
                    advantage of counting Tiraboschi, Beccaria, Le Soeur, and Jacquier; and from
                    these illustrious masters he speedily acquired a taste for mathematics and
                    astronomy. After filling several professors’ chairs in the colleges of the
                    Jesuits at Rome and Ravenna, he was appointed in 1780 professor of the higher
                    mathematics in the academy of Palermo. Here his first care was to reform the
                    general system of education; and, by the alterations which he introduced, he
                    contributed powerfully to dissipate the shades of ignorance, which, under the
                    double influence of the Jesuits and the Inquisition, still lowered over the soil
                    of Sicily. After having rendered this service to literature, he obtained from
                    the prince of Caramanico viceroy of the island, permission to found an
                    observatory, and undertook a voyage to France and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193105285" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5285-0748"/>England, in order to provide
                    the instruments necessary for the new establishment. Having procured a vertical
                    circle, a transit, and some other instruments from Ramsden, he returned to
                    Palermo and commenced his observations. His first care was to prepare a new
                    catalogue of stars, the exact positions of which he justly considered as the
                    basis of all true astronomy. In prosecuting this object he did not content
                    himself with a single observation, but before he fixed the position of any star,
                    observed it several times successively; and, by this laborious but accurate
                    method, he constructed his first great catalogue of 6748 stars, which was
                    crowned by the Academy of Sciences of France, and received with admiration by
                    the astronomers of all countries. His constant practice of repeating his
                    observations led to another brilliant result, the discovery of an eighth planet.
                    On the 1st of January 1801, Piazzi, searching for the star 87 of the catalogue
                    of Mayer, cursorily observed a small star of the eighth magnitude, between Aries
                    and Taurus. On the following day he remarked that the star had changed its
                    position, and accordingly supposed it to be a comet. He communicated his
                    observations to Oriani, who, seeing that this luminous point had no nebulosity
                    like the comets, and that it had been stationary and retrograded within
                    comparatively small limits like the planets, computed its elements on the
                    hypothesis of a circular orbit. He found that this hypothesis agreed with the
                    observations, and other astronomers soon confirmed its accuracy. He gave the
                    planet the name of <hi rend="italic">Ceres Eerdinandea,</hi> in honour of
                    Ferdinand, king of Naples, in whose dominions it was discovered, and who
                    proposed to consecrate the event by a gold medal, struck with the effigy of the
                    astronomer; but Piazzi, nobly preferring the interests of science to vain
                    honours which could add nothing to his glory, requested that the money destined
                    for this purpose should be employed in the purchase of an equatorial, which was
                    still wanting to his observatory. In 1814 he published a new catalogue, extended
                    to 7646 stars,—a splendid monument of indefatigable zeal and activity. He made
                    an uninterrupted series of solstitial observations from 1791 to 1816, for the
                    purpose of determining the obliquity of the ecliptic, which, compared with those
                    of Bradley, Mayer, and Lacaille, in 1750, give a diminution of 44" in a year.
                    Besides these labours, sufficient to occupy a life of ordinary industry, Piazzi
                    composed a number of memoirs for the different societies of which he was a
                    member, and was intrusted by the Neapolitan government with several important
                    commissions respecting the public instruction and the regulation of weights and
                    measures in Sicily. He died in 1826, after having bequeathed his library and all
                    his instruments to the observatory at Palermo, and assigned a liberal annuity to
                    be devoted to the instruction of young men who evince a decided taste for
                    astronomy.</p>
                <p>The discovery of Ceres led to that of three other little planets, circulating at
                    nearly the same distance from the sun,—a circumstance unique in the construction
                    of the solar system. On account of the smallness of the new planet, and the
                    nebulosity by which it is surrounded, the difficulty of finding it after it had
                    for some time ceased to be observed, was so considerable, that Dr Olbers of
                    Bremen was induced to examine, with particular care, the configurations of all
                    the small stars situated in the vicinity of its path, in order to have the means
                    of detecting it at any time with greater facility. While engaged in making
                    observations for this purpose, he discovered, on the 28th of March 1802, and
                    nearly in the same place where he had before observed Ceres, another planet
                    similar in size and appearance, to which he gave the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pallas.</hi> The extraordinary circumstance of the discovery of two planets
                    having nearly the same mean distance, and performing their revolutions nearly in
                    the same time, led’ Dr Olbers to imagine that Ceres and Pallas were fragments of
                    a larger planet which had revolved in the same place, and been shattered by some
                    external force or internal convulsion. The immediate consequence of this
                    hypothesis was the probability of the existence of other fragments of the
                    original planet, hitherto undiscovered; and that if such fragments existed, the
                    planes of their orbits would pass through the points in which the orbits of
                    Ceres and Pallas intersect each other. This bold idea acquired some probability
                    from the subsequent discovery of two other planets in the very quarter of the
                    heavens to which Dr Olbers had directed the attention of astronomers. <hi
                    rend="italic">Juno</hi> was discovered by Μ. Harding of Lilienthal, on the 2d of
                    September 1804; and <hi rend="italic">Vesta,</hi> by Dr Olbers himself, on the
                    29th of March 1807. Diligent observation has not since added to their
                    number.</p>
                <p>Astronomy is a science which borrows the aid of several other sciences, with
                    which its advancement is simultaneous. Instruments capable of appreciating or
                    measuring' the exceedingly minute quantities about which the observer now
                    concerns himself, could only be produced in a very advanced state of mechanics.
                    In the accurate graduation of large instruments, our English artists have long
                    maintained an unrivalled superiority. Graham, a celebrated watch-maker, united
                    to great dexterity in the mechanical arts a decided taste for observation; and
                    the extraordinary improvements which he effected in the art of dividing form an
                    era. in the history of practical astronomy. The sector used by Bradley, in the
                    observations which led to the discovery of the nutation, was of his
                    construction, and he was also the inventor of the first compensation pendulum.
                    Sisson, who succeeded him, maintained in this department the honour and
                    pre-eminence of ∙ England. Bird was originally a weaver in Durham, and first
                    gave proof of his mechanical genius by dividing dials for the watch-makers in a
                    manner far superior to what had been commonly practised. He was employed by
                    Sisson in the division of mathematical instruments, and recommended by that
                    artist to Graham, who instructed him in his methods. He constructed the 8 feet
                    quadrants employed in the Greenwich and Paris observatories, and another of 6
                    feet for Mayer at the observatory of Göttingen. Ramsden invented a machine for
                    the more accurate division of instruments, on account of which he received a
                    premium from the Board of Longitude. The mural quadrants of this artist were
                    held in high estimation, and the transit instrument, sextant, and refracting
                    micrometer, in passing through his hands, received considerable ameliorations.
                    His astronomical instruments in general were considered the best that could be
                    procured in Europe. Mr Troughton, who at present stands the foremost of our'
                    British opticians, has more than rivalled his predecessors. In the hands of this
                    distinguished artist and astronomer, the division of instruments has been
                    carried to a degree of precision and accuracy which probably will never be
                    surpassed; while the great improvements he has introduced into the methods of
                    constructing and mounting large instruments, and his ingenious inventions to
                    elude natural obstacles, and guard against the accidental derangements from
                    which it is impossible altogether to protect them, entitle him to the high place
                    which he holds by universal consent among the most eminent philosophers and

                <p><hi rend="italic">Progress of Physical Astronomy.</hi></p>
                <p>Having now endeavoured to give an account of the labours of those astronomers who
                    have principally contributed to make us acquainted with the state of the
                    heavens, and the order and succession of the various phenomena they exhibit, we
                    will conclude this part of the article by briefly adverting to the profound
                    researches of some illustrious mathematicians who have developed the theory of
                    Newton, and raised the fabric of physical astronomy to its present proud
                    elevation.</p>
                <p>: Although the law of gravitation, as proposed by Newton, had from the first been
                    admitted by all the most eminent astronomers of Britain, it was for a long time
                    either opposed or neglected on the Continent. In fact, great improvements were
                    required both in analysis and mechanics before it admitted of other applications
                    than had been made by its great author, or could be regarded as any thing more
                    than a plausible hypothesis. Newton demonstrated, that if two bodies only were
                    projected in space, mutually attracting each other with forces proportional
                    directly to their masses, and inversely to the squares of their distance, they
                    would each accurately describe an ellipse round the common centre of gravity;
                    and the spaces described by the straight line joining that centre and the moving
                    body, would be proportional to the time of description, according to the second
                    law of Kepler. But when it is attempted to apply Newton’s law to the case of the
                    solar system, great difficulties immediately present themselves. Any one planet
                    in the system is not only attracted by the sun, but also, though in a greatly
                    smaller degree, by all the other planets, in consequence of which it is
                    compelled to deviate from the elliptic path which it would pursue in virtue of
                    the sun’s attraction alone. Now, the calculation of the effects of this
                    disturbing force was the problem which geometers had to resolve. In its most
                    general form it greatly transcends the power of analysis; but there are
                    particular cases of it, and those too the cases presented by nature, in which,by
                    reason of certain limitations in the conditions, it is possible to obtain an
                    approximate solution to any required degree of exactness. For example, the Sun,
                    Moon, and Earth form in a manner a system by themselves, which is very slightly
                    affected by the aggregate attractions of the other planets. In the same way the
                    Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn form another system, in which the motions are very
                    little influenced by the action of any other body. In these two cases, then, the
                    number of bodies to be taken into consideration is only three; and in this
                    restricted form, the problem, celebrated in the history of analysis under the
                    denomination of the <hi rend="italic">Problem of the Three Bodies,</hi> is
                    susceptible of being treated mathematically. With the hope of ameliorating the
                    lunar tables, and of completing the investigations which Newton had commenced in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Principia,</hi> three distinguished geometers, Clairaut,
                    D’Alembert, and Euler, about the middle of the last century, undertook,
                    simultaneously, and without the knowledge of each other, the investigation of
                    the problem of the three bodies, and commenced that series of brilliant
                    discoveries which it is the glory of our own times to have seen completed.</p>
                <p>Clairaut’s solution of the problem of the three bodies was presented to the
                    Academy of Sciences in 1747, and was applied to the case of the moon. From this
                    solution he deduced with great facility, not only the inequality of the
                    variation, which Newton had obtained by a more complicated, though at the same
                    time a very ingenious method, but also the evection, the annual equation, and
                    many other inequalities which Newton had not succeeded m connecting with his
                    theory. It happened, however, curiously enough, that in the calculation of one
                    effect of the disturbing force, namely, the progression of the moon s apogee,
                    Clairaut was led into an error which produced a result that threatened to
                    overturn the system of gravitation. The error consisted in the omission of some
                    of the terms of the series expressing the quantity in question, which he wrongly
                    supposed to have only an insensible value; and by reason of this omission, his
                    first approximation gave only half of the observed progressive motion of the
                    apogee. As this result was confirmed by D’Alembert and Euler, who had both
                    fallen into the same error, it seemed to follow, as a necessary consequence,
                    either that the phenomenon depended on some other cause than the disturbing
                    force of the sun, or that the law of gravity was not exactly proportional to the
                    inverse square of the distance. The triumph which this result gave to the
                    Cartesians was not of long duration. Clairaut soon perceived the cause of his
                    error; and by repeating the process, and carrying the approximations farther, he
                    found the computed to agree exactly with the observed progression,—a result
                    which had the effect of dissipating for ever all doubt respecting the law of
                    gravity. The researches of Clairaut were followed by a set of lunar tables, much
                    more correct than any which had been previously computed.</p>
                <p>The return of the comet of 1682, which Halley had predicted for the end of 1758,
                    or beginning of 1759, afforded an excellent opportunity for putting to the test
                    both the theory of gravity and the power of the new calculus. Clairaut applied
                    his solution of the problem of the three bodies to the perturbations which this
                    comet sustained from Jupiter and Saturn, and, after calculations of enormous
                    labour, announced to the Academy of Sciences, in November 1758, that the comet
                    would return in the beginning of the following year, and pass through its
                    perihelion about the 15th of April. It returned according to the prediction, but
                    passed its perihelion on the 13th of March. The correction of an error of
                    computation reduced the difference to nineteen days; and if Clairaut had been
                    aware of the existence of the planet Uranus, he might have come still nearer the
                    truth.</p>
                <p>Besides these important researches on the system of the world, Clairaut composed
                    an admirable little treatise on the figure of the earth, in which he gave the
                    differential equations, till then unknown, of the equilibrium of fluids, whether
                    homogeneous or heterogeneous, supposing an attractive force, following any law
                    whatever, to exist among the molecules. He applied these equations to the earth;
                    demonstrated that the elliptic figure satisfies the conditions of equilibrium;
                    assigned the ellipticity of the different strata of which the earth may be
                    supposed to be formed, together with the law of gravitation at the exterior
                    surface. He likewise discovered the important theorem which establishes a
                    relation between the oblateness of the terrestrial spheroid and the increase of
                    gravitation towards the poles, on every supposition which can be imagined
                    relative to the interior construction of the earth. By means of this theorem the
                    ellipticity of the spheroid is deduced from observations of the lengths of the
                    seconds’ pendulum at different points of the earth’s surface.</p>
                <p>D’Alembert, as has already been mentioned, presented a solution of the problem of
                    the three bodies to the Academy of Sciences at the same time with Clairaut. In
                    the year 1749 he published his treatise on the precession of the equinoxes,—a
                    work remarkable in the history of analysis and mechanics. By means of his newly
                    invented <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105311" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5311-0750"
                    />calculus of <hi rend="italic">Partial Differences,</hi> and the discovery of a
                    ʹ fertile principle in dynamics, he determined from theory the rate of the
                    precession, which is nearly 50" in a year. He also determined the nutation of
                    the earth’s axis, which had been discovered by Bradley, and assigned the ratio
                    of the axes of the small ellipse which the true pole of the earth describes
                    around its mean place, in the same time in which the nodes of the lunar orbit
                    complete a revolution. The solution of .this problem led to the determination of
                    the ratio of the attractive forces of the sun and moon, which D’Alembert found
                    to be that of seven to three very nearly; whence he inferred that the mass of
                    the earth is 70 times greater than that of the moon. He proved likewise that the
                    precession and nutation are the same in every hypothesis concerning the interior
                    constitution of the earth. In 1754 he published the first two volumes of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Researches on the System of the World.</hi> In this work he
                    applied the formulae by which he had calculated the motions of the moon to the
                    motions of the planets disturbed by their mutual attraction, and pointed out the
                    simplest method of determining the perturbations of the motions, of a planet
                    occasioned by the action of its own satellites. D’Alembert also treated the
                    subject of the figure of the earth in a much more general manner than had been
                    done by Clairaut, who had. confined his investigations to the case of a spheroid
                    of revolution. He determined the attraction of a spheroid of small eccentricity,
                    whose surface can be represented by an algebraic equation of any order whatever,
                    and even supposing the spheroid to be composed of strata of different
                    densities.</p>
                <p>The works of D’Alembert, which are extremely numerous, abound generally in
                    profound and original views, and contributed greatly to the advancement of the
                    physical and mathematical sciences; but it is to be regretted that they are very
                    frequently deficient in that perspicuity and order so necessary in abstruse
                    speculations, and that the course of his reasoning can be followed with
                    difficulty when he descends into the detail of analytical operations. He had a
                    horror of calculation, and delighted in general considerations and speculations
                    which frequently turned on matters of pure curiosity.</p>
                <p>The first memoir of Euler on the planetary perturba- <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    tions was transmitted to the secretary of the Academy of Sciences in July 1747,
                    some months before Clairaut and D’Alembert had communicated their solutions of
                    the problem of the three bodies, and it carried off the prize which the academy
                    had proposed for the analytical theory of the motions of Jupiter and Saturn. In
                    this memoir Euler gave the differential equations of the elements of the
                    disturbed planet, but suppressed the analysis by which he had been conducted to
                    them. This analysis, however, he subsequently expanded in two memoirs, the first
                    of which appeared in the Berlin Memoirs in 1749, and the second in those of
                    Petersburg in 1750. Of these supplementary memoirs the first is remarkable on
                    several accounts. It contains the first example of a method which has been
                    fruitful of important consequences—namely, that of the variation of the
                    arbitrary constants in differential equations, and the development of the
                    radical quantity which expresses the distance between two planets in a series of
                    angles, multiples of the elongations. The expressions which he gave for the
                    several terms of this series were simple and elegant; and he demonstrated a
                    curious relation subsisting among any three consecutive terms, by means of which
                    all the terms of the series may be calculated from the first two. He was thus
                    enabled to develop the perturbing forces in terms of the sines and cosines of
                    angles increasing with the time, and thereby to surmount a very great analytical
                    difficulty. Notwithstanding, however, the great merit of Euler’s memoir several
                    of the formulae expressing the secular and periodic' inequalities were found to
                    be inaccurate; and in order to procure a correction of these errors, and give
                    greater perfection to so important a theory, the academy again proposed the same
                    subject for the prize of 1752. This prize was also carried off by Euler. In the
                    memoir which he presented on this occasion, he considered simultaneously the
                    motions of Jupiter and Saturn, and determined, in the first instance, the amount
                    of their various inequalities, independently of the consideration of the
                    eccentricities of their orbits. Pushing the approximations farther, and having
                    regard to the inequalities depending on the eccentricities, he arrived at a most
                    important result relative to the periodic nature of the inequalities occasioned
                    by the mutual perturbations of the planets; which laid the foundation of the
                    subsequent discovery by Lagrange and Laplace of the permanent stability of the
                    planetary system. He demonstrated that the eccentricities and places of the
                    aphelia of Jupiter and Saturn are subject to constant variation, confined,
                    however, within certain fixed limits, which it never exceeds; and he computed
                    that the elements of the orbits of the two planets recover their original values
                    after a lapse of about 30,000 years. In the year 1756 the Academy of Sciences
                    crowned a third memoir of Euler on the same subject as the two former, namely,
                    the inequalities of the motions of the planets produced by their reciprocal
                    attractions. This memoir, analytically considered, is also of great value. The
                    method which he followed and illustrated has since been generally adopted in
                    researches of the same nature, and consists in regarding as variable, in
                    consequence of the disturbing forces, the six elements of the elliptic motion,
                    viz. Isí, the greater axis of the orbit, which, by the law of Kepler* gives the
                    ratio of the differential of the mean longitude to the element of the time; 2cζ
                    the epoch of this longitude; 3cζ the eccentricity of the orbit; 4iΛ, the motion
                    of the aphelion; <hi rend="italic">ĩdh,</hi> the inclination of the orbit to a
                    given fixed plane; and, <hi rend="italic">Qth,</hi> the longitude of the node.
                    By considering separately the variations introduced into each of these elements
                    by the disturbing forces, Euler obtained some important results; but even in
                    this memoir his theory was not rendered complete. He did not consider the
                    variation of the epoch; and the expression which he gave for the motion of the
                    aphelion did not include that part of it which depends on the ratio of the
                    eccentricities of the orbits of the disturbed and disturbing planet. Besides,
                    the present memoir, like the two former, contained several errors of
                    computation, which, by leading to results known to be wrong, probably prevented
                    the author himself from being aware of the full value of the ingenious methods
                    of procedure which he had exposed. Euler concluded this important memoir by
                    making an extended application of his formulae to the orbit of the earth as
                    disturbed by the action of the planets. From some probable suppositions, first
                    employed by Newton, relative to the ratios of the masses of the planets to that
                    of the sun, he determined the variation of the obliquity of the ecliptic at 48"
                    in a century,—a result which agrees well with observation. By this determination
                    the secular variation of the obliquity of the ecliptic, which had been regarded
                    by Lahire, Lemonnier, D’Alembert, and other eminent astronomers, as uncertain,
                    was placed beyond doubt.. The three memoirs which we have mentioned contain the
                    principal part of Euler’s labours on the perturbations; but physical astronomy
                    is indebted to him for many other researches. He gave a solution of the problem
                    of the precession of the equinoxes, and made several important steps in the
                    lunar theory, with which he seems to have <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105324"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5324-0751"/>occupied himself before he undertook the
                    investigation of the planetary perturbations. In the year 1772, when entirely
                    blind, he directed his son, Albert Euler, and two illustrious pupils, Krafft and
                    Lexell, in the composition of a work of enormous labour on the same subject,
                    which was undertaken with a view to discover the cause of the moon’s
                    acceleration. This work was concluded with a set of lunar tables deduced
                    entirely from theory; but they were found to be far inferior to those of Mayer,
                    and in some respects hardly equal to those of Clairaut.</p>
                <p>The labours of Euler form an epoch in the history of the mathematical sciences.
                    From the arithmetic of sines, and the simplest formulae of trigonometry up to
                    the variation of the arbitrary constants of differential equations, there is
                    hardly an analytical theory which has not received extension or improvement from
                    the creative powers of his great mind. The transactions of the Berlin and
                    Petersburg Academies are filled with his inestimable productions; and if
                    fecundity were not itself one of the attributes of genius, the number of the
                    profound and laborious researches in which he was engaged would appear
                    altogether incredible.</p>
                <p>The first theory of Euler formed the basis of the excellent lunar tables which
                    were calculated by Tobias Mayer, and first published in the Memoirs of the
                    Academy of Göttingen in 1753. Mayer was a skilful astronomer, and determined the
                    co-efficients of the arguments of the different lunar inequalities from his own
                    observations. He continued to correct and improve his tables till the time of
                    his death, which happened in 1762, when a copy of them, containing his last
                    corrections, was presented by his widow to the Board of Longitude in London.
                    Bradley ascertained their accuracy by comparing them with a great number of his
                    own observations, and made so favourable a report concerning them, that the
                    Board of Longitude presented the widow of Mayer with a gratuity of L.30.00. They
                    were printed along with the author’s lunar theory in 1765. Subsequently, the
                    Board of Longitude directed Mason, who had been assistant to Bradley, to revise
                    them, under the superintendence of Dr Maskelyne. Mason compared them with about
                    1200 of Bradley’s observations; he corrected the co-efficients of Mayer, and
                    introduced some new equations which had been indicated by that astronomer, but
                    which he had considered as too uncertain, or of too small a value, to render it
                    necessary to load his tables with them. Mayer’s tables, thus corrected, were
                    published in 1784, and for a long time continued to be the most accurate that
                    had appeared.</p>
                <p>The solution of the problem of the three bodies by Clairaut, D’Alembert, and
                    Euler, gave rise to many other important works relative to the theory of the
                    moon, into the merits of which, however, our limits will not permit us to enter.
                    Thomas Simpson, Walmesley, Frisi, Lambert, Schulze, and Matthew Stewart, treated
                    the subject with more or less success; but the complete explication of the
                    theory of the lunar and planetary perturbations was reserved for two
                    mathematicians, whose discoveries perfected the theory of gravitation, and
                    explained the last inequalities which remained to be accounted for in the
                    celestial motions,—we mean Lagrange and Laplace.</p>
                <p>In the year 1764, the Academy of Sciences of Paris, which had so successfully
                    promoted the great efforts that had already been made to perfect the theory of
                    attraction, proposed for the subject of a prize the theory of the libration of
                    the moon. This was considered as an appeal to the genius of Lagrange, whose
                    splendid talents had suddenly shone forth in two profound papers on the theory
                    of sound, inserted among the Memoirs of the Turin Academy, and in which the
                    calculus of variations was first explained and made use of. Lagrange had the
                    honour of carrying off the prize; but although he treated the subject in a
                    manner altogether new, and with extraordinary analytical skill, he did not on
                    this occasion arrive at a complete solution of the problem. In 1766 he obtained
                    another prize for a theory of Jupiter’s satellites. In the admirable memoir
                    which Lagrange presented to the academy on this subject, he included in the
                    differential equations of the disturbed motion of a satellite, the attracting
                    force of the sun, as well as of all the other satellites, and thus, in fact, had
                    to consider a problem of six bodies. His analysis of this problem is remarkable,
                    inasmuch as it contained the first general method which was given for
                    determining the variations which the mutual attractions of the satellites
                    produce in the forms and positions of their orbits, and pointed out the route
                    which has since been so successfully followed in the treatment of similar
                    questions.</p>
                <p>Of all the grand discoveries by which the name of La-1 grange has been
                    immortalized, the most remarkable is <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> that of the
                    invariability of the mean distances of the pla- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    nets from the sun. We have already mentioned that* Euler had perceived that the
                    inequalities of Jupiter and Saturn, in consequence of their mutual actions, arc
                    ultimately compensated, though after a very long period. In prosecuting this
                    subject, which Euler had left imperfect, Laplace had discovered that, on
                    neglecting the fourth powers in the expressions of the eccentricities and
                    inclinations of the orbits, and the squares of the disturbing masses, the mean
                    motions of the planets, and their mean distances from the sun, are invariable.
                    In a short memoir of 14 pages, which appeared among those of the Berlin Academy
                    for 1776, Lagrange demonstrated generally, and by a very simple and luminous
                    analysis, that whatever powers of the eccentricities and inclinations are
                    included in the calculation of the perturbations, no secular inequality, or term
                    proportional to the time, can possibly enter into the expression of the greater
                    axis of the orbit, or, consequently, into the mean motion connected with it by
                    the third law of Kepler. From this conclusion, which is a necessary consequence
                    of the peculiar conditions of the planetary system, it results that all the
                    changes to which the orbits of the planets are subject in consequence of their
                    reciprocal gravitation, are periodic, and that the system contains within itself
                    no principle of destruction, but is calculated to endure for ever.</p>
                <p>In 1780 Lagrange undertook a second time the subject of the moon’s libration; and
                    it is to the memoir which he now presented to the Berlin Academy that we must
                    look for the complete and rigorous solution of this difficult problem, which had
                    not been resolved before in a satisfactory manner, either on the footing of
                    analysis or observation. In the same year he obtained the prize of the Academy
                    of Sciences on the subject of the perturbations of comets. In 1781 he published,
                    in the Berlin Memoirs, the first of a series of five papers on the secular and
                    periodic inequalities of the planets, which together formed by far the most
                    important work that had yet appeared on Physical Astronomy since the publication
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Principia.</hi> This series did not, properly speaking,
                    contain any new discovery; but it embodied and brought into one view all the
                    results and peculiar analytical methods which had appeared in his former
                    memoirs, and contained the germs of all the happy ideas which he afterwards
                    developed in the <hi rend="italic">Mécanique Analytique.</hi></p>
                <p>On account of the brilliant discoveries and important labours which we have thus
                    briefly noticed, Lagrange must be considered as one of the most successful of
                    those illustrious individuals who have undertaken to perfect the theory of
                    Newton, and pursue the principle of gravitation<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193105337" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5337-0752"/> to its remotest
                    consequences. But the value of his services to science are not limited to his
                    discoveries in physical astronomy, great and numerous as they were. After Euler,
                    he has contributed more than any other individual to increase the power and
                    extend the applications of the calculus, and thereby to arm future inquirers
                    with an instrument of greater power, by means of which they may push their
                    conquests into new and unexplored fields of discovery.</p>
                <p>With the name of Lagrange is associated that of Laplace, whose rival labours
                    divided the admiration of the scientific world during half a century. Like
                    Newton and Lagrange, Laplace raised himself at an early age to the very highest
                    rank in science. Before completing his 24th year, he had signalized himself by
                    the capital discovery of the invariability of the mean distances of the planets
                    from the sun, on an hypothesis restricted, indeed, but which, as we have already
                    mentioned, was afterwards generalized by Lagrange. About the same time he was
                    admitted into the Academy of Sciences, and thenceforward devoted himself to the
                    development of the laws which regulate the system of the world, and to the
                    composition of a series of memoirs on the most important subjects connected with
                    astronomy and analysis. His researches embraced the whole theory of gravitation;
                    and he had the high honour of perfecting what had been left incomplete by his
                    predecessors.</p>
                <p>Among the numerous inequalities which affect the motion of the moon, one still
                    remained which no philosopher as yet had been able to explain. This was the
                    acceleration of the mean lunar motion, which had been first suspected by Dr
                    Halley, from a comparison of the ancient Babylonian observations, recorded by
                    Hipparchus, with those of Albategnius and the moderns. The existence of the
                    acceleration had been confirmed by Dunthorne and Mayer, and its quantity
                    assigned at 10" in a century, but the cause of it remained doubtful. Lagrange
                    demonstrated that it could not be occasioned by any peculiarity in the form of
                    the earth; Bossut ascribed it to the resistance of the medium in which he
                    supposed the moon to move; and Laplace himself at first explained it on the
                    supposition that gravity is not transmitted from one body to another
                    instantaneously, but successively in the manner of sound or light. Having
                    afterwards remarked, however, in the course of his researches on Jupiter’s
                    satellites, that the secular variation of the eccentricity of the orbit of
                    Jupiter occasions a secular variation of the mean motions of the satellites, he
                    hastened to transfer this result to the moon, and had the satisfaction to find
                    that the acceleration observed by astronomers is occasioned by the secular
                    variation of the eccentricity of the terrestrial orbit. This was the last
                    celestial phenomenon which remained to be accounted for on the principle of
                    gravitation.</p>
                <p>Another discovery relative to the constitution of the planetary system, which
                    does infinite honour to the sagacity of Laplace, is the cause of the secular
                    inequalities indicated by ancient and modern observations in the mean motions of
                    Jupiter and Saturn. On examining the differential equations of the motions of
                    these planets, Laplace remarked, that as their mean motions are nearly
                    commensurable (five times the mean motion of Saturn being nearly equal to twice
                    that of Jupiter), those terms of which the arguments are five times the mean
                    longitude of Saturn, minus twice that of Jupiter, may become very sensible by
                    integration, although multiplied by the cubes and products of three dimensions
                    of the eccentricities and inclinations of the orbits. The result of a laborious
                    calculation confirmed his conjecture, and showed him that in the mean motion of
                    Saturn there existed a great inequality, amounting at its maximum to 48' 2"∙3,
                    and of which the period is 929 years; and that in the case of Jupiter there
                    exists a corresponding inequality of nearly the same period, of which the
                    maximum value is 19' 46", but which is affected by a contrary sign, that is to
                    say, diminishes while the first increases, and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi> He also perceived that the magnitude of the co-efficients of these
                    inequalities, and the duration of their periods, are not always the same, but
                    participate in the secular variations of the elements of the orbits.</p>
                <p>The theory of the figures of the planets, scarcely less interesting than that of
                    their motions, was also greatly advanced by the researches of Laplace. He
                    confirmed the results of Clairaut, Maclaurin, and D’Alembert, relative to the
                    figure of the earth, and treated the question in a much more general way than
                    had been done by those three great mathematicians. From two lunar inequalities
                    depending on the non-sphericity of the earth, he determined the ellipticity of
                    the meridian to be - <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> ⅛; very nearly.</p>
                <p>Newton, in the <hi rend="italic">Principia,</hi> explained the cause of the
                    phenomena of the tides, and laid the foundations of a theory which was
                    prosecuted and extended by Daniel Bernoulli, Maclaurin, Euler, and D’Alembert;
                    but as no one of these geometers had taken into account the effects of the
                    rotatory motion of the earth, the subject was in a great measure new when it was
                    taken up by Laplace in 1774. Aided by D’Alembert’s recent discovery of the
                    calculus of <hi rend="italic">Partial Differences,</hi> and by an improved
                    theory of hydrodynamics, he succeeded in obtaining the differential equations of
                    the motion of the fluids which surround the earth, having regard to all the
                    forces by which these motions are produced or modified, and published them in
                    the Memoirs of the’Academy in 1775. By a careful examination of these equations,
                    he was led to the curious remark, that the differences between the heights of
                    two consecutive tides about the time of the solstices, as indicated by Newton’s
                    theory, are not owing, as Newton and his successors had supposed, to the inertia
                    of the waters of the ocean, but depend on a totally different cause, namely, the
                    law of the depth of the sea, and that it would disappear entirely if the sea
                    were of a uniform and constant depth. He also arrived at the important
                    conclusion, that the fluidity of the sea has no influence on the motions of the
                    terrestrial axis, which are exactly the same as they would be if the sea formed
                    a solid mass with the earth. The same analysis conducted him to the knowledge of
                    the conditions necessary to insure the permanent equilibrium of the waters of
                    the ocean. He found that if the mean density of the earth exceeds that of the
                    sea, the fluid, deranged by any causes whatever from its state of equilibrium,
                    will never depart from that state but by very small quantities. It follows from
                    this, that, since the mean density of the earth is known to be about five times
                    greater than that of the sea, the great changes which have taken place in the
                    relative situation of the waters and dry land must be referred to other causes
                    than the instability of the equilibrium of the ocean.</p>
                <p>Closely connected with the problem of the tides is that of the precession of the
                    equinoxes, which also received similar improvements in passing through the hands
                    of Laplace. He demonstrated, as has just been mentioned, that the fluidity of
                    the sea has no influence on the phenomena of precession and nutation. He
                    considered some of the effects of the oblate figure of the earth which had not
                    been attended to by D’Alembert, and showed that the annual variation of the
                    precession causes a corresponding variation in the length of the tropical year,
                    which at present is about 9 or 10 seconds shorter than it was in the time of
                    Hipparchus. He proved that the secular inequa <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193105350" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5350-0753"/>lities of the motions of the
                    earth and moon have no sensible effect in displacing the axis of the earth’s
                    rotation; and he determined the nutation of the lunar orbit corresponding to the
                    nutation of the terrestrial equator.</p>
                <p>Physical astronomy is also indebted to Laplace for a complete theory of the
                    system of Jupiter’s satellites, from which Delambre constructed a set of tables
                    which represent the motions of these bodies with all desirable accuracy. And
                    when to these numerous and most important researches we add the mathematical
                    theories of molecular attraction, and the propagation of sound, together with
                    many great improvements in analysis,—and reflect,besides, that he is the author
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Mécanique Céleste,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Système</hi><hi rend="italic">du Monde,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Théorie
                    des Probabilités,</hi> —∙we shall not hesitate to rank him next to Newton among
                    the greatest benefactors of the mathematical and physical sciences.</p>
                <p>By the brilliant discoveries of Laplace, the analytical solution of the great
                    problem of physical astronomy was completed. The principle of gravity, which had
                    been discovered by Newton to confine the moon and the planets to their
                    respective orbits, was shown to occasion every apparent irregularity, however
                    minute, in the motions of the planets and satellites; and those very
                    irregularities which were at first brought forward as objections to the
                    hypothesis have been ultimately found to afford the most triumphant proofs of
                    its accuracy, and have placed the truth of the Newtonian law beyond the reach of
                    all future cavil. Such is the state to which analysis has now attained, that the
                    geometer embraces in his formulae every circumstance which affects the motions
                    or positions of the different bodies of the planetary system; and the conditions
                    of that system being made known to him at any given instant of time, he can
                    determine its conditions at any other instant in the past or future duration of
                    the world. He ascends to remote ages to compare the results of his theories with
                    the most ancient observations; he passes on to ages yet to come, and predicts
                    changes which the lapse of centuries will hardly be sufficient to render
                    sensible to the observer. But notwithstanding the proud elevation to which the
                    theory of astronomy has been raised, it is still far from having reached the
                    limit beyond which further refinement becomes superfluous. The masses of the
                    plañets, and some other elements, remain to be determined with still greater
                    precision, by a diligent comparison of the analytical formulae with good
                    observations; and the labours of the geometer may still be beneficially employed
                    in giving greater simplicity to the calculus, or in extending its power over
                    subjects which have hitherto eluded its grasp. The recent discovery of two
                    periodic comets completing their revolutions in comparatively short intervals of
                    time, opens up an interesting field for speculation and research, and will
                    doubtless be the means of throwing light over some curious, and as yet very
                    obscure, points, respecting the appearances, motions, and physical constitution
                    of those strange bodies.</p>
                <p>In the other departments of the science, also, numerous questions still remain to
                    be discussed, the solution of which will occupy and reward the future labours of
                    the astronomer. The curious phenomena of double and multiple stars, some of
                    which appear to form connected systems of bodies revolving about one another, or
                    a common centre of motion,—the variable stars,—the proper motions of the
                    stars,—the translation of the solar system in space,—the progressive
                    condensation of nebulae,—are subjects still in a great measure new; for it is
                    only of late years that observers have begun to direct the requisite attention
                    towards them, or indeed have been in possession of instruments of sufficient
                    power and delicacy to observe and measure the minute changes which take place
                    beyond the boundaries of our own system. The observations of some living
                    astronomers, particularly of Mr Herschel and Mr South, have made known some
                    important facts regarding the nebulae and double-stars, and laid the foundations
                    of interesting discoveries to be realized by their successors in future ages of
                    the world.</p>
                <p>Among the events auspicious to the future progress of astronomy in our own
                    country, we cannot forbear to regard the establishment of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Astronomical Society of London,</hi> an association which, though it dates only
                    from 1820, includes in its list of <hi rend="italic">Members</hi> the names of
                    the greater part of the most distinguished cultivators of the science in Europe.
                    The society has already given the best proofs of its energy and usefulness, by
                    the publication of a catalogue of the reduced places of 2881 of the principal
                    stars visible above our horizon, and four splendid volumes of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoirs,</hi> replete with information and remarks of the most useful kind to
                    the observer. The number of public observatories recently established, or at
                    present in a state of progress, in various parts of the country and its
                    colonies, also holds out a cheering prospect to the friends of astronomical
                    discovery. Nor if we turn our eyes abroad shall we perceive less reason for
                    congratulation. The same zeal for extension and refinement is manifested in
                    every country of Europe; and while some of the states, among which Prussia and
                    Denmark deserve to be honourably mentioned, are gaining themselves glory by the
                    encouragement they hold out to the cultivation of this department of science,
                    the exertions of individual observers appear to increase in proportion as the
                    field is narrowed by their success. Armed with instruments to which former times
                    had nothing to compare, the astronomer of the present day not only anticipates a
                    more perfect knowledge than he yet possesses of the nature and number of the
                    bodies belonging to the solar system, but aspires to set at rest the disputed
                    question of parallax, to determine the proper motions of the stars, and trace
                    the effects of gravity in the remotest regions of the universe.</p>
                <p>Such are the present prospects of astronomy. The mind delights to contemplate
                    unlimited advancement in a walk in which its efforts have been so signally
                    triumphant; yet in consequence of what has already been done, the future
                    progress of the science must necessarily be slow; and it must be acknowledged
                    that greater precision than has already been attained is unnecessary to
                    navigation or geography, or any practical application of which astronomy admits.
                    The future results of observation may add to the stock of speculative knowledge,
                    but can only be remotely useful to mankind.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Celestial
                    Sphere.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">When</hi> a spectator on a clear evening
                    directs his attention to the sky, he perceives a concave hemisphere studded with
                    innumerable brilliant points, all which appear to move in parallel directions,
                    constantly preserving the same distances and relative positions. New groups of
                    stars incessantly follow one another, rising in the east, mounting to a certain
                    height, and then gradually sinking till they disappear in the west. On turning
                    his face towards the north he observes some groups of stars which remain visible
                    during the whole night; wheeling round a certain fixed point, and describing
                    circles of greater or less magnitude, according as they are at a greater or less
                    distance from that point. The same phenomena are observed every successive
                    night; and as the stars present always the same configurations, and succeed each
                    other in the same order, the mind is irresistibly led to the hypothesis of the
                    diurnal revolution of the whole heavens about a fixed axis. This hypothesis
                    implies that the stars move in parallel planes, and that their mutual distances
                    remain invariable. In order, however, to be assured that such is the case, it is
                    necessary to have recourse to more accurate observations, and to refer their
                    successive positions to something that is fixed,—to certain points or planes
                    which do not participate in the general motion.</p>
                <p>What is most obviously adapted for this purpose is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Horizon,</hi> or the plane which appears extended all round us, and bounded by
                    a circle of which the eye of the spectator occupies the centre. Let the circle
                    SENW (fig. 1) represent the horizon, C being the centre or place of the
                    observer. Suppose now that a star is observed to rise at a certain point of the
                    horizon A, and, after tracing its circuit in the sky, to set at the point A';
                    suppose, also, that another star rises at B, and sets at B'; then, if the
                    distances AB, A'B' are measured by means of some angular instrument, it will be
                    found that AB is equal to A'B', and that this is the case with regard to any two
                    stars whatever. Since therefore the arcs AB and A'B' are equal, it follows that
                    the chords A A', B B’, joining their extremities, are parallel; whence we infer,
                    that if two stars rise successively at the same point of the horizon A, they
                    will also set at the same point A', a circumstance which is of itself strikingly
                    indicative of the uniformity of the motion of the celestial bodies.</p>
                <p>Through C let a perpendicular be drawn to the chord A A', meeting the boundary of
                    the horizon in S and N. These two points are the <hi rend="italic">South</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">North</hi> points of the horizon; and another straight
                    line drawn through C, parallel to A A', will meet the horizon in E and W, the
                    <hi rend="italic">East</hi> and <hi rend="italic">West</hi> points. The four
                    together, namely, S, E, N, W, are called the four <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cardinal</hi> points of the horizon. The horizontal circle is itself
                    denominated the <hi rend="italic">Azimuth Circle.</hi> Azimuth distances are
                    measured from the North and South points, so that SA is the azimuth distance of
                    a star’s rising at A, and SA' is that of its setting at A'. The complement of
                    the azimuth, or its defect from a right angle, is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amplitude,</hi> which is consequently measured from the East and West points;
                    thus the arc EA is the amplitude of a star’s rising at A, or its <hi
                    rend="italic">ortive</hi> amplitude, and WA' is that of its setting, or its <hi
                    rend="italic">οccasive</hi> amplitude.</p>
                <p>Conceive a straight line to pass through C, perpendicular to the horizon. This
                    line, which is called the <hi rend="italic">Vertical,</hi> will meet the visible
                    hemisphere in a point directly above the observer, which is denominated the <hi
                    rend="italic">Zenith;</hi> the point diametrically opposite, in which the
                    prolongation of the vertical meets the invisible hemisphere, is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nadir.</hi> The plane determined by the vertical and the straight
                    line NS is called the <hi rend="italic">Meridian,</hi> because when the sun
                    reaches it, he is equally distant from the points at which he rises and sets,
                    or, it is mid-day. The great circle formed by the intersection of the meridian
                    with łhe celestial sphere is the <hi rend="italic">Meridional</hi> circle; it
                    divides the sphere into the eastern and western hemispheres. Any circle passing
                    through the Zenith and Nadir is called a <hi rend="italic">Vertical
                    Circle</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that which intersects the meridional circle
                    at right angles; or which passes through the points E and W, is called the <hi

                <p>Let HPZH' (fig. ,2) represent a meridional circle passing through P, that point
                    of the sphere which appears to remain immovable; and let Z be the zenith, and
                    HH' the horizon. Join PC', and let, it meet the circle in P'. The points P and
                    P' are denominated the <hi rend="italic">Poles</hi> of the, world, and the

                    attention of the observer is the 'inequality of the times during which different
                    stars continue visible above the horizon. A star which describes the circle AEAE
                    continues visible during a shorter time than one which describes <hi
                    rend="italic">hl,</hi> and still shorter than one which moves in <hi
                    rend="italic">^Αg.</hi> It will be remarked, however, that the interval between
                    two successive risings of the same star is always the same, in whatever point of
                    the horizon it makes its appearance. Those which describe AEAE are peculiar in
                    this respect, that the interval between their rising and setting is exactly
                    equal to that between their setting and rising; hence the great circle which
                    they describe is called the <hi rend="italic">Equator,</hi> and when the sun
                    describes that circle, the days and nights are exactly of the same length. In
                    general, the time during which a star continues visible is greater in proportion
                    as its path is nearer to the visible pole. Those, however, which describe the
                    circle <hi rend="italic">Hg, or</hi> any other parallel, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >uv,</hi> nearer to P, remain always above the horizon; hence such circles are
                    called circles of <hi rend="italic">Perpetual Apparition,</hi> and the stars
                    describing them are called <hi rend="italic">Circumpolar Stars.</hi></p>
                <p>There are some other technical terms, chiefly employed in the old treatises of
                    astronomy, to denote particular circles of the sphere. A <hi rend="italic"
                    >Secondary</hi> to any great circle, is a circle passing through the poles of
                    its primary: thus the meridian is a secondary to the horizon HH', and to the
                    equator AEAE'. The <hi rend="italic">Colures</hi> are two secondaries to the
                    equator, one of which passes through the equinoctial points, and is called the
                    <hi rend="italic">Equinoctial Colure</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the other
                    intersects the equator at the distance of 90° from the former, and is
                    denominated the <hi rend="italic">Solstitial Colure.</hi> The small circles
                    parallel to the equator are simply termed <hi rend="italic">Parallels</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> those which are parallel to the horizon are called <hi
                    rend="italic">Almicantars</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the different
                    meridians are likewise termed <hi rend="italic">Hour Circles.</hi></p>
                <p>The hypothesis of a spherical revolution implies, as has already been mentioned,
                    that the stars move in parallel planes, or describe parallel circles round the
                    pole. This point, in reference to any particular star, must be determined by
                    observing whether its angular distance from the pole remains invariable during
                    its whole revolution. Let Z (fig. 3) be the zenith, P the pole, and S the place
                    of a star. The arcs PZ, ZS, PS, which join these points on the sphere, will form
                    a spherical triangle, of which the sides PZ and ZS, or the distances of the pole
                    and the star from the zenith, are given by direct observation. The angle PZS is
                    also given in the same manner, for it is equal to the star’s azimuth counted
                    from the north point of the horizon. In the triangle ZPS we have therefore given
                    the two sides ZP and ZS, together with the included angle PZS, from which data
                    the polar distance PS is found by the following formula of spherical
                    trigonometry:</p>
                <p>cos. PS = sin. ZS sin. ZP cos. PSZ + cos. ZS cos. ZP. In order to adapt this
                    formula to logarithmic computation, an auxiliary angle <hi rend="italic">φ</hi>
                    may be assumed such, that tan. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> = cos. PZS tan. ZP, by
                    the substitution of which the formula becomes cos. ZP. cos. (PZS — <hi
                    rend="italic">&lt;ρ)</hi> cos. PS =; cos. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> from which
                    the polar distance PS of the star can be easily computed.</p>
                <p>On performing the computation for any particular star, PS is always found to be
                    of a constant magnitude, whatever may be the value of PZS, that is, at whatever
                    part of its course the star is observed. Hence wė infer that the diurnal motion
                    of the stars round the pole is exactly circular.</p>
                <p>. After having recognised that the celestial bodies move in parallel planes, the
                    next object of the astronomer is to determine whether they revolve with
                    velocities uniform or variable. For this purpose it is necessary to compare, by
                    means of a well-regulated clock, the angular distances between the meridian and
                    the successive positions of a star, with the times elapsed since the star’s
                    passage over the meridian. Let <hi rend="italic">mno</hi> (fig. 4) be the
                    parallel described by a star, and <hi rend="italic">ssl</hi> two of its
                    successive positions. The arcs <hi rend="italic">ns, ns</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> t</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> intercepted between the meridional
                    plane and the planes passing, through the axis PP' and the points <hi
                    rend="italic">s, s',</hi> are measured by the arcs of the equator <hi
                    rend="italic">Ca,</hi> Cδ. Now, it is the result of constant experience, that
                    the number of degrees in the arc <hi rend="italic">Ca</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cb</hi> is to the number in the whole circumference as the time employed by the
                    star in describing <hi rend="italic">na</hi> or <hi rend="italic">nb</hi> is to
                    the time in which it completes a revolution. The time occupied by the star in
                    completing its revolution is called a sidereal day; and the uniformity of the
                    diurnal revolution enables us to calculate the angle CPs, which is measured by
                    <hi rend="italic">Ca,</hi> without having recourse to any other observation than
                    that of the star’s meridional passage. Denoting a sidereal day by T, the
                    interval of time which elapses while the star describes the arc <hi
                    rend="italic">ns</hi> by <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and the angle at the pole by
                    P, we shall have the analogy T: <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >:</hi>: 360: P; therefore P= 370°; a formula which gives the angle at P, or its
                    measure Co. The angles CPs, CPs', and sPs ’ are called <hi rend="italic">Hour
                    Angles,</hi> because the arcs which they intercept on the star’s parallel of
                    declination correspond to the hours and fractions of an hour into which the
                    sidereal day is divided. For example, if the hour angle sPs' contain 15°, the
                    two planes passing through s and s' will intercept on <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi>
                    the diurnal circle of the star, an arc equal to 15°; consequently there will be
                    24 such arcs in the whole circumference, each of which will be described in the
                    24th part of a sidereal day, or in one hour of sidereal time. In consequence of
                    this perfect uniformity of the diurnal motion, the arc which a star describes on
                    its parallel is conveniently measured by the time of its description; and the
                    sidereal day, or the interval between two successive returns of the same star to
                    the plane of the meridian, offers the most perfect <hi rend="italic">unit of
                    time,</hi> inasmuch as it is exactly the same to all the inhabitants of the
                    earth, and remains absolutely unalterable in all ages, being one of the very few
                    invariable elements of the system of the world.</p>
                <p>In fixing the position of a point on a plane surface, geometers usually refer it
                    to two straight lines at right angles to each other, the positions of which are
                    supposed to be known. The same practice is imitated by astronomers, who refer
                    the position of any point on the surface of the sphere to two great circles,
                    which are employed as a system of rectangular co-ordinates, and from which all
                    distances are measured. The equator being a circle of the sphere not subject to
                    any arbitrary condition, but determined by the very nature of the spherical
                    revolution, is obviously well adapted for this purpose. It is therefore
                    universally employed as a term of comparison in assigning the places of the
                    celestial bodies. Suppose an hour circle passing through the star 5 to intersect
                    the equator at <hi rend="italic">a;</hi> the arc <hi rend="italic">sa,</hi>
                    which measures on the sphere the distance of <hi rend="italic">s</hi> from the
                    equator, is called the <hi rend="italic">Declination</hi> of the star. All other
                    stars situated on the same parallel <hi rend="italic">mo</hi> have the same
                    declination; and it is invariable for all places of the earth, because it is not
                    affected by the diurnal motion which is performed in the parallel <hi
                    rend="italic">mo.</hi> The declination is <hi rend="italic">northern</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">southern,</hi> according as the star is situated in the northern
                    or southern hemisphere. It. is expressed in degrees from 0 to 90, proceed<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193105389" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5389-0756"/>ing from the
                    equator to the pole. The polar distance <hi rend="smallcaps">;</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pä</hi> is the complement of the declination, because Ps + <hi
                    rend="italic">sa</hi> ·=. 90°. In order to distinguish s from all other stars
                    which may be situated on the same parallel, we must also know the point <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> of the equator to which it corresponds; and for this
                    purpose it is necessary to select a point w of the equator for the origin of the
                    co-ordinates. This point ought to be independent of the diurnal motion,
                    otherwise its position could only be determined for a single instant of time;
                    and it must be such that it can be readily found, in whatever part of the earth
                    the observer may be situated. Astronomers have agreed to employ for this purpose
                    the point determined by the intersection of the equator with another very
                    remarkable circle of the sphere, of which we shall speak hereafter, and to count
                    the degrees on the equator, setting out from ɤ, from 0 to 360, in the direction
                    opposite to that of the diurnal motion, or from west to east. The arc ɤ a, which
                    measures the distance between ɤ and <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Right Ascension</hi> of the star: it is also the right ascension
                    of any other star situated in the hour circle PsP'. It is measured by the
                    interval of time which elapses between the transit of the star s over the
                    meridian, and that of the point ɤ, which has been chosen as the point of
                    departure. It may be remarked that the point ɤ is also the origin of sidereal
                    time; that is to say, the time is counted 0 hour 0 min. 0 sec. when that point
                    passes the meridian.</p>
                <p>From these definitions it is easy to conceive the general method of forming a
                    catalogue of stars. A clock being regulated to sidereal time, arid marking 0
                    hour at the instant of the transit of the point ɤ (or any star chosen
                    arbitrarily), the hours, minutes, and seconds, are noted at which the stars
                    successively pass the axis of the transit instrument, together with their
                    respective altitudes at the same instant. These observations give the right
                    ascensions and declinations; for the time is easily converted into degrees, at
                    the rate of 15° an hour, or by the formula given above for determining the hour
                    angle. If the star s pass the meridian one hour after <hi rend="italic">st,</hi>
                    the arc <hi rend="italic">a b,</hi> which measures the distance between their
                    horary circles, PαP', PZ*P', is 1 hour or 15°; and the declination of a star s
                    which moves in the parallel <hi rend="italic">hl</hi> (fig. 2) is AEZ= H'Z—
                    H'AE, that is, equal to the difference between its meridional altitude and the
                    complement of the altitude of the pole H P. Modern celestial charts are
                    constructed on the principle of assigning to each star the place indicated by
                    the values of these two co-ordinates; and as observation proves that the mutual
                    distances and relative positions of the stars scarcely undergo any sensible
                    variation, a globe or chart once constructed will serve to represent the state
                    of the heavens for at least a long series of ages.</p>
                <p>Having now considered the general phenomena of the diurnal revolution, and
                    explained the terms that are technically employed in assigning the positions of
                    the celestial bodies, we may next proceed to inquire how these phenomena are to
                    be accounted for,—whether the stars are really in motion, as they seem to be, or
                    if the apparent motion is only an illusion occasioned by the revolution of our
                    own earth. The perfect uniformity of the motions of the different stars renders
                    it exceedingly improbable that they are disconnected; hence the simplest view of
                    the phenomena is obtained by substituting for each star its projection on the
                    celestial sphere, at an infinite distance, and supposing this sphere, with the
                    projections of all the stars, to revolve in 24 hours from east to west round an
                    immovable axis. But it is easy to see that the phenomena will be equally well
                    explained by supposing that the starry firmament is absolutely at rest, and that
                    the earth revolves in the same time, round the same axis, but in an opposite
                    direction, from west to east. In both cases the stars remain immovable, the
                    phenomena are exactly the same, and, relatively to <hi rend="italic">Spherical
                    Astronomy,</hi> in which we only concern ourselves with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >apparent</hi> motions, it is absolutely indifferent which of the two hypotheses
                    we adopt. They are both only modes of explaining certain appearances; and the
                    one may be employed which renders the explanation most simple and perspicuous.
                    The proofs of the earth’s motion will go on accumulating as we proceed. At
                    present we need only remark, that as the organ of sight makes us acquainted with
                    the existence of relative, and not of absolute motion, it is impossible to
                    decide, merely from appearances, whether the motion we perceive is real or
                    otherwise; for whatever motion one body may have in respect of another, it is
                    always possible to explain the phenomena by supposing it to be perfectly at
                    rest, and the other to move in an opposite direction. The conclusions which we
                    draw from the <hi rend="italic">optical</hi> effects of motion afford no
                    mathematical certainty with regard to the cause of that motion. The hypothesis
                    of the revolution of the sphere is attended with innumerable and insurmountable
                    difficulties. The distance of the nearest fixed star from the earth is not less
                    than 350,000 times the distance of the sun; a distance which light, prodigious
                    as its velocity is, would not traverse in less than five years. This immense
                    line, therefore, supposing the heavens to revolve round the earth, would form
                    the radius of a circle, the circumference of which, six times larger, would be
                    passed over by the star in the space of 24 hours; its velocity must therefore be
                    6 × 5 × 365= 10950 times greater than that of light. This velocity, which is
                    nearly equivalent to 2100 millions of miles in a second of time, is so enormous
                    that it baffles the utmost efforts of the imagination to form any conception of
                    it; and the supposition of its existence will appear still more revolting when
                    we reflect that the distance of the nearest star is probably many thousand times
                    less than that of the Milky Way. If we ascribe the motion to the earth, its
                    velocity, though it may still be supposed great, is moderate in comparison of
                    many well-known phenomena of nature. A point on the equator will describe in 24
                    hours a circle of about 25,000 miles, or about 17 miles in a minute; a velocity
                    somewhat exceeding that of sound, but 7400 millions of times less rapid than the
                    preceding.</p>
                <p>In all that has hitherto been said respecting the apparent motion of the starry
                    sphere, we have only had regard to the innumerable multitude of stars which
                    constantly maintain the same relative situations, and which are in consequence
                    called A⅛ei∕ <hi rend="italic">Stars.</hi> There are, however, several other
                    bodies, some of them remarkable on account of their splendour, which, besides
                    participating in the general motion, have peculiar motions of their own, and are
                    incessantly shifting their positions among the fixed stars. An attentive
                    observation of the state of the sky during a few successive evenings, will
                    suffice to show that there are some stars which have in the mean time changed
                    their places; and, on continuing to observe them, they will be found to separate
                    themselves from particular constellations, and gradually but imperceptibly to
                    approach others, till they at length appear, after unequal intervals of time, in
                    an opposite quarter of the heavens. From this circumstance they were designated
                    by the Greeks <hi rend="italic">Planets,</hi> I that is, <hi rend="italic"
                    >wandering stars,</hi> in contradistinction to those which obey only the law of
                    the diurnal motion. Besides the sun and moon, there are five discernible by the
                    naked eye, and which have consequently been known from the remotest ages. These
                    are Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Five others, namely, Uranus,
                    Ceres, Pallas, Juno, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105402"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5402-0757"/>land Vesta, have been discovered by the aid of the
                    tele- ’ ∙ scope. Astronomers, with a view to abbreviate their descriptions, have
                    appropriated a certain symbol to each of these planets, as well as to the sun
                    and moon: thus, in the order of distance from the sun, the names and
                    characteristics are as follows :—</p>
                <p>The Sun 0 Ceres p</p>
                <p>Mercury £ Pallas £</p>
                <p>Venus Ç Jupiter <hi rend="italic">Iţ.</hi></p>

                <p>Vesta g Uranus Ķ</p>
                <p>Juno $</p>
                <p>The Earth, which, as we shall afterwards see, is also a planet, and takes its
                    place between Venus and Mars, has for its symbol θ, and the moon 5 . Venus,
                    Jupiter, and sometimes Mars, are distinguished by their extraordinary
                    brilliancy. Mercury, on account of his proximity to the sun, is rarely visible
                    to the naked eye. Uranus, discovered by Sir W. Herschel in 1778, can with
                    difficulty, by reason of his great distance, be perceived without a telescope.
                    Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta, discovered since 1801, are extremely small in
                    size, and can only be seen with the aid of the telescope.</p>
                <p>f of all the celestial bodies, the most interesting to us are the sun and moon;
                    and their peculiar motions have accordingly, in every age of astronomy, been
                    studied with the greatest attention. The proper motion of the moon is
                    particularly remarkable. In the course of a single night she separates herself
                    very sensibly from the stars in her vicinity, moving over a space nearly equal
                    to her own breadth in an hour, and completing a whole circuit in about 27 days.
                    The sun moves with much less velocity, but his motion is still sufficiently
                    apparent. If we take notice of the stars which immediately follow him when he
                    sinks under the horizon, we shall find that in the course of a few nights they
                    will be no longer visible. Others which, some time previously, did not set till
                    long after him, have taken their places and now accompany the sun. In the
                    morning similar appearances present themselves, but in a contrary order. The
                    stars which appear in the eastern horizon at sun-rise, are, after a few days,
                    considerably elevated above it at the same time. Thus the sun seems to fall
                    daily behind the stars, by insensible degrees, till at last he appears in the
                    east when they are about to set in the west. To account for these appearances,
                    the ancients supposed the sun’s diurnal motion to be really slower than that of
                    the stars; hence they supposed him to be attached to a different sphere. For
                    like reasons they ascribed particular spheres to the moon and each of the
                    planets; and as no trace of these imaginary spheres is perceptible in the
                    heavens, they next supposed them to be crystalline and transparent. The
                    appearances are explained equally well, and with infinitely greater simplicity,
                    by ascribing to the sun a proper motion, in a direction opposite to that of the
                    diurnal rotation of the sphere, in consequence of which he advances to meet the
                    stars, instead of falling behind them.</p>
                <p>The greater part of the observations of the early astronomers had for their
                    object the determination of the positions of the stars relatively to the sun at
                    his rising and setting, by which they fixed the seasons, and regulated the
                    operations of agriculture. They distinguished all these phenomena by technical
                    terms, which occur very frequently in the works of the ancient poets,
                    particularly in Hesiod and in Ovid’s <hi rend="italic">Fasti.</hi> A star which
                    rises at the same time with the sun is effaced by his light, and is said to rise
                    <hi rend="italic">cosmically (orths cosmicus).</hi> Soon after, when the sun by
                    his proper motion has advanced so far to the east that the star can be perceived
                    on the eastern horizon in the morning twilight, it disengages itself from the
                    sun’s rays, and is said to rise <hi rend="italic">heliacally (</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> 0r</hi><hi rend="italic">tus heli</hi><hi rend="italic

                    subscript"> s</hi><hi rend="italic">Y</hi> At the end of six months, the sun
                    being diametrically opposite to the same star, it sets as the sun rises, and in
                    this case it is said to set <hi rend="italic">cosmically</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(occasus</hi><hi rend="italic">cosmicus)</hi>: at nearly the same time it rises

                    rend="italic">(ortus</hi><hi rend="italic">acronyctus).</hi> The sun afterwards
                    begins to approach the star, till he advances so near that it is again about to
                    be effaced by his light; it is now said to set <hi rend="italic"
                    >heliacally,</hi> or just so long after the sun as to be visible when he has
                    disappeared <hi rend="italic">(occasus</hi><hi rend="italic">heliaaus).</hi> At
                    the end of a year, the star again rises and sets at the same moment with the
                    sun; it is now said to set <hi rend="italic">acronically</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(occasus</hi><hi rend="italic">acronyctus).</hi> These distinctions, and the
                    ancients had several others of the same kind, which are all defined by Ptolemy,
                    are now scarcely ever mentioned. They have lost the whole of their interest
                    since, in the progress of astronomy, more certain methods have been discovered
                    of determining the commencement of the year and the seasons.</p>
                <p>The proper motions of the planets are in general, like that of the sun, in a
                    direction opposite to the diurnal motion, or from west to east, among the stars:
                    but they do not preserve the same character of uniformity; the planet sometimes
                    becomes stationary among the fixed stars, and even advances from east to west in
                    the direction of the diurnal motion. In this case it is said to <hi
                    rend="italic">retrograde.</hi> This retrograde motion is, however, not of long
                    continuance. After having been accelerated during a short time, it begins to
                    relax. The planet again becomes <hi rend="italic">stationary,</hi> and then
                    resumes its <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> motion from west to east. These
                    phenomena were observed in the remotest antiquity, and their explanation formed
                    the principal part of the rational astronomy of the Greeks and the Arabians.</p>
                <p>Besides the planets, other bodies occasionally make their appearance in the
                    heavens, which, by reason of the extraordinary phenomena they exhibit, have been
                    frequently contemplated with terror and dismay, and regarded by superstitious
                    ignorance as harbingers of calamity, and precursors of the divine vengeance.
                    These bodies shoot down, from the remote regions of space, with inconceivable
                    velocity, towards the sun. At their first appearance they are small; their light
                    is feeble and dusky; and they are generally accompanied by a sort of nebulosity
                    or luminous tail, from which they have derived their appellation of <hi
                    rend="italic">Cornets (coma,</hi> hair). As they approach the sun, their
                    apparent magnitudes and brilliancy greatly increase, and the nebulosity
                    sometimes occupies a large portion of the heavens, presenting a magnificent and
                    astonishing spectacle. Having attained the point of their orbits nearest the
                    sun, they again recede to enormous distances, and vanish by insensible degrees.
                    They differ from the planets not only by the appearances they present, but also
                    by the diversity of their motions; for, instead of being confined to a
                    particular zone, and moving from west to east, they traverse the sky
                    indifferently in all directions. They are visible only in a small part of their
                    orbit, which, being near the sun, is passed over with prodigious rapidity. They
                    seldom continue visible longer than six months. Their number is entirely
                    unknown, but during the last two centuries upwards of 150 have been observed,
                    and their orbits computed.</p>
                <p>Thus we recognise three distinct classes of celestial bodies; the planets, the
                    comets, and the fixed stars. It is the business of the astronomer to determine
                    the positions of these bodies in the heavens; to observe their motions, and
                    measure them with precision; to discover the laws by which their courses are
                    regulated; and from these laws to assign the past or future state of the heavens
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105415" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5415-0758"/> at any given
                    instant of time. The fixed stars form infi-; nitely the most numerous class; but
                    their motions being sensibly uniform, and their mutual distances invariable, the
                    principal object with regard to them is to determine their places and relative
                    positions. The comets in general return only after long periods; and
                    observations are not yet sufficiently numerous to allow any certain deductions
                    to be made with respect to their nature and constitution. The planets present a
                    great variety of curious phenomena; they are always within our view;
                    observations on them may be multiplied indefinitely; and for this reason, as
                    well as on account of their proximity, and their forming a system of which the
                    earth constitutes a part, they present by far the most interesting objects of
                    astronomical study.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Globular Form of
                    the Earth, Parallax, and Refraction.</hi></p>
                <p>Having now considered the general phenomena of the diurnal motion, we proceed
                    next to inquire into the form of the earth, and our situation with respect to
                    the centre round which the celestial sphere appears to revolve. The plane of the
                    horizon seems to be stretched out indefinitely till it actually meets the sky;
                    but this illusion is quickly dissipated by transferring ourselves from one place
                    to another on the surface of the earth, and attending to the phenomena which
                    such a change of place gives rise to. Let an observer, for example, set out from
                    any given point in the northern hemisphere, and proceed directly south. In
                    proportion as he advances, the stars in the southern region of the heavens will
                    be elevated more above the horizon, and describe larger segments of their
                    diurnal circles, while new ones come into view which were invisible at the
                    station he left. On the other hand, the polar star, with those in its vicinity,
                    will be depressed, and some stars which before continued above the horizon
                    during the whole time of their revolution will now rise and set. The planes of
                    the diurnal circles become also more perpendicular to the horizon, so that the
                    aspect of the heavens is entirely changed. If, instead of advancing in the
                    direction of the meridian, the spectator proceeded towards the east or west, he
                    would in this case also remark that his horizon constantly shifted its position.
                    A star will pass his meridian sooner as he advances eastward, or later as he
                    travels westward; in short, by a change of place in any direction whatever, the
                    perpendicular to the horizon, or the plumb-line, will correspond to a different
                    point of the heavens. The plane of the horizon is therefore variable, and its
                    variation by insensible degrees indicates with the greatest evidence the
                    rotundity of the earth. Experience also shows that a spectator sees more of the
                    terrestrial surface in proportion as he is elevated above it; and that on a
                    mountain surrounded by the sea, or standing in the middle of a level plain, the
                    horizon appears equally depressed all round, which is the distinctive feature of
                    a spherical curvature. In fig. 5 let 0 be the place of a spectator on the summit
                    of a mountain, the straight line H H will represent his horizon, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Oh, Ohl</hi> the directions of visual rays to the remotest visible
                    points on the surface of the earth. The inclinations of these lines to the plane
                    of the horizon, or the angles <hi rend="smallcaps">HOa,</hi> ΗΌΛ' are called the
                    <hi rend="italic">apparent depression</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and these
                    being always observed to be equal to each other, it follows that the curve <hi
                    rend="italic">hAh'</hi> is a circle. On the Peak of Teneriffe, Humboldt observed
                    the surface of the sea to be depressed on all sides in an angle of nearly <hi
                    rend="italic">2°..</hi> The sun arose to him 12 minutes sooner than to an
                    inhabitant of the plain; and from the plain, the top of the mountain appeared
                    enlightened 12 minutes before the rising or after the setting of the sun. The
                    same phenomena, though on a smaller scale, are observed with regard to every
                    mountain or elevation on the earth. Another familiar illustration of the
                    globular figure of the earth is derived from the successive and gradual
                    disappearance of a ship which leaves the shore and stands out to sea. The hulk
                    disappears before the sails and the rigging, and the top of the mast is the last
                    part that is visible. The ship thus appears gradually to sink under the horizon,
                    exactly in the same manner as she must necessarily do on the supposition that
                    the surface of the sea is spherical. The appearance of the moon at the time she
                    is eclipsed is also demonstrative of the roundness of the earth. When the moon
                    penetrates the shadow of the earth, the line which separates the illuminated
                    from the eclipsed portion of the disk is circular; evidently proving the conical
                    form of the shadow, and consequently the roundness of the body by which the
                    shadow is projected. From all these considerations, it is inferred with the
                    highest certainty that the earth with its waters forms a round mass, isolated in
                    space.</p>
                <p>The globular form of the earth is a property common to it with the other bodies
                    which compose the planetary system. The sun and moon are evidently round bodies;
                    and when the planets are examined through a telescope their disks appear
                    sensibly circular; and as they are known to have a motion of rotation, in
                    consequence of which they successively present different points of their
                    surfaces to the earth, the uniform roundness of their disks may be taken as a
                    conclusive proof of their sphericity. We shall by and by have occasion to remark
                    other striking analogies between the planets and the earth.</p>
                <p>Since the figure of the earth is spherical, the horizontal plane cannot coincide
                    with any considerable portion of its surface. It may be defined to be the plane
                    which touches the earth at any given point, and is perpendicular to the vertical
                    line, or the direction of gravity at that point. The <hi rend="italic">Sensible
                    Horizon of</hi> any place is the plane which passes through the eye of the
                    spectator, perpendicular to the plumb-line at that place. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rational Horizon</hi> is a plane parallel to this, passing through the centre
                    of the earth. The particular phenomena of different places depend on the
                    position of their horizon with respect to the planes of the apparent diurnal
                    motion of the sun and stars. The rational horizon of a place on the equator
                    passes through the poles, and divides equally die equator and its parallels.
                    Hence the days and nights arc always equal in such places, and each of the stars
                    performs one half of its revolution above, and the other below its horizon. The
                    circles of diurnal motion are all perpendicular to the horizon, and therefore
                    the inhabitants are said to be under a <hi rend="italic">Right Sphere.</hi> If a
                    spectator could place himself directly under the pole, his horizon would
                    coincide with the equator, and the whole of the northern celestial hemisphere
                    would be within his view, while no part of the southern hemisphere would be
                    visible to him, on account of its being always beneath the horizon. The circles
                    of the diurnal motion being parallel to the equator, and consequently also to
                    the horizon, the fixed stars would never either rise or set. A spectator thus
                    situated is said to be under a <hi rend="italic">Parallel Sphere·</hi> In
                    Intermediate places the circles of the diurnal motion are oblique to the
                    horizon, one pole being always elevated above it, and the other equally
                    depressed below it. The stars whose distances from the elevated pole are not
                    greater than the arc of its elevation above the horizon never set, while those
                    within the same distance ol the depressed pole never rise. These phenomena
                    belong to all places situated between the equator and the poles, and the
                    inhabitants of such places are said to be under an <hi rend="italic">Oblique

                <p>The situation of a place on the surface of the earth is determined by two
                    co-ordinate circles, in the same manner as that of a star on the celestial
                    sphere. Let Z (fig. 2) be a place of which the position is required to be
                    assigned with reference to circles of the terrestrial sphere, analogous to those
                    which we have described as belonging to the sphere of the heavens. Since the
                    axis of the celestial sphere passes through the centre of the earth, we may
                    suppose the poles of the world, the equatorial circle, and the meridians, to be
                    transferred to the earth’s surface, so that the same figure may represent either
                    the celestial or terrestrial sphere. The intersection of the plane P Z AE with
                    the surface of the earth is the terrestrial meridian of the place Z, and the
                    straight lines C Z, C AE, in that plane, intercept an arc of the terrestrial
                    meridian between Z and the equator, containing as many degrees as the arc of the
                    celestial sphere which measures the declination of the zenith of the place Z.
                    The angle <hi rend="italic">AE</hi> C Z which is measured by the meridional arc
                    AE Z is called the <hi rend="italic">Geographical Latitude</hi> of Z. But in
                    order to particularize the point at which the equator is intersected by the
                    meridian, it is necessary to assume some point of the equator to which all the
                    other points of that circle may be referred. The meridian passing through the
                    assumed point is called the <hi rend="italic">First Meridian</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and the angular distance between the planes of the first
                    and any 3ther meridian measured by the equatorial arc intercepted by these
                    planes on the equator, is called the <hi rend="italic">Geο-</hi> ∣ <hi
                    rend="italic">rαρhical Longitude</hi> of the place through which the last

                    from he first meridian towards the east or west. It is usual to eckon the
                    degrees towards the east, all round the globe, or rom 0 to 360°. From these
                    definitions it is evident that he geographical latitudes and longitudes are
                    exactly ana-ogous to the declinations and right ascensions on the ce-estial
                    sphere. The first point of the terrestrial equator ;annot be determined by any
                    star or fixed point in the icavens, on account of the diurnal motion; it is
                    therefore ecessary to fix its position by means of known places on he earth; and
                    geographers are in the habit of assuming s the first meridian that which passes
                    through the capi-ιl city or principal observatory of their country. The hoice is
                    of no importance; for in geography, as in astro-omy, what is essential to be
                    known is only the <hi rend="italic">difference</hi> f longitudes or meridians,
                    in order to reduce the situ-tion of a place, or observations which have been

                    determination of its actual dimensions is attended ith great practical
                    difficulties, which can only be overcome by the perfect instruments and refined
                    science of modern times. Eratosthenes seems to have been the l∙'st who made use
                    of astronomical methods to determine l’te circumference of the earth, or the
                    length of the median. He remarked that, at Syene, in the Thebais, the fin on the
                    meridian, at the time of the summer solstice, fas vertical; and that at
                    Alexandria, at the same time, is zenith distance was 7° 12 ’. Now let S (fig. 6)
                    be the, <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> ιn, vertical to Μ, and Z the zenith of
                    Alexandria, C iiing the centre of .the earth, and 0 Alexandria. The <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> gle Z 0 S is the sun’s zenith distance, which was
                    ob-rved to be 7° 12'. But Z 0 S = Z C S + 0 S C; whence, as the angle 0 S C,
                    which is extremely small on account of the sun’s great distance, may be
                    neglected in the calculation, the angle Z C S at the centre is also equal to 7°
                    12', and therefore the whole circumference eauals 360° *</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">rļo 12'</hi> × Μ 0. To obtain the length of the meridian, it is
                    therefore only necessary to measure the arc Μ 0. Eratosthenes assumed the
                    distance between Syene and Alexandria to be 5000 stadia; hence the circumference
                    of</p>
                <p>360°</p>
                <p>the earth = <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi>-L-^ × 5000 stadia = 250,000 stadia. The
                    uncertainty which exists respecting the length of the Egyptian stade prevents us
                    from deriving any precise information from this rude attempt to estimate the
                    dimensions of the globe.</p>
                <p>The method which has just been described takes for granted that the meridian is
                    exactly circular,—an assumption which, even supposing the ’method perfect in all
                    other respects, would lead to erroneous results, especially in an arc of so
                    great a magnitude as seven degrees. In a small arc, of 1° for example, the error
                    arising from the non-sphericity of the earth will be insensible; for it is
                    certain, from the phenomena before explained, that the deviation from the
                    spherical figure is not very considerable; and besides, whatever the nature of
                    the meridional curve may be, it will sensibly coincide with its osculating
                    circle, throughout the extent of an arc of 1°. It has been found by numerous and
                    accurate experiments, that the lengths of arcs of 1° on the same meridian are
                    longer in proportion as we advance nearer the pole. Hence, on account of the
                    similarity of the isosceles triangles of which these arcs form the bases, their
                    sides, or the terrestrial radii, must also be longer, and consequently the
                    convexity of the earth is less towards the pole than at the equator. The surface
                    of the earth is extremely irregular, even independently of the inequalities
                    occasioned by mountains and cavities; yet it has been discovered that the
                    meridional curves differ almost insensibly from ellipses; whence it is concluded
                    that the figure of the earth is an ellipsoid of revolution about its shortest
                    axis. In comparing the results of the various measurements which have been made
                    with the formulae belonging to the dimensions of such a body, this conclusion
                    has been fully verified; and the lengths of the arcs, the ellipticity, the
                    distance of the pole from the equator, and, in short, all the elements of the
                    spheroid, have been determined. The results of theory and observation give an
                    ellipticity amounting very nearly to - <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> ∙⅛- <hi

                <p>The figure of the earth is one of the most difficult and most important questions
                    of astronomy; and as our limits will not permit us to treat it in this place
                    with all the details which its importance renders necessary, we shall reserve,
                    for a separate article, an account of the different geodetical operations which
                    have been undertaken with a view to determine it, together with the development
                    of the mathematical theory of its equilibrium. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Figure
                    of the Earth.</hi></p>
                <p>In describing the phenomena of the diurnal revolution, we have supposed the eye
                    of the spectator to be placed <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105441"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5441-0760"/>in the centre of motion, on which supposition the
                    appa- rent and true places of the celestial bodies will be the ’same. This,
                    however, as is evident, can only be rigorously true in respect of one point of
                    the earth’s surface, and is therefore most probably not true of any. Astronomers
                    have on this account agreed to refer all the motions to the centre of the earth;
                    that is, to consider the centre of the earth as the centre of the celestial
                    sphere, and to regard as the true geocentric place of a star, that at which it
                    would appear to a spectator placed at the centre. But the spectator is
                    necessarily placed at the surface. In order, therefore, to render observations
                    made at different stations on the earth’s surface comparable with one another,
                    we must consider what changes will be produced in the apparent positions of the
                    celestial bodies, in consequence of their being observed from a point not
                    situated in the centre of motion.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">O</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> f</hi> and 0 (fig. 6)
                    be two stations on the earth’s surface on the same meridian, from both of which
                    a star S is observed at the same time. As an object is always seen in the
                    direction of the visual ray, the spectator at 0 will refer the star S to a
                    certain point I on the surface of the celestial sphere, while the spectator at
                    O' will refer it to a different point I' in the direction O' I'; and the
                    difference of the apparent places I and I' depends on the magnitude of the angle
                    OSO', which is subtended by the chord of the arc OO'. If a third spectator could
                    be placed at C, the centre of the earth, the same star would appear to him in
                    the direction CS, and be referred to its true place on the sphere at Q. Now, the
                    difference between the angles ZOS and ZCS, that is, the angle OSC, under which
                    the radius of the earth is seen by an observer at S, is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">parallax</hi> of S. On account of the great distance of the fixed
                    stars, this angle is altogether insensible with regard to them; it is, however,
                    very sensible in the case of the moon, with regard to which it amounts to about
                    1°. The greatest parallax of the nearest planets does not exceed 30".</p>
                <p>From the definition which has just been given, it appears that the parallax of a
                    star is the angle comprised between two lines drawn from the star, the one to
                    the centre of the earth, and the other to any point whatever on its surface. But
                    it is evident, that while the distance of S from the earth remains constant, the
                    angle OSC will vary with the angle ZOS, that is, with the distance of the star
                    from the zenith, or its altitude above the horizon. Let OH (fig. 7) represent
                    the horizon. It is easy to see that the angle OSC will have its greatest value
                    when OS touches the surface of the earth, or coincides with the horizon OH, that
                    is, when the angle ZOS = 90°. It is equally evident that the parallax OSC
                    vanishes entirely when the line CS coincides with CZ, that is, when the star is
                    in the zenith of the observer at 0; hence the parallax depends on the altitude
                    of the star, according to a law which we now proceed to determine.</p>
                <p>In the triangle OSC (fig. 7), we have sin. OSC: sin.</p>
                <p>CO</p>
                <p>SOZ;: CO: CS, whence sin. OSC = ⅛⅛- sin. SO Z. Let the angle SOZ, or the zenith
                    distance of the star = Z, the semidiameter of the earth OC = α, the distance of
                    the star CS = <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and the parallax OSC = <hi rend="italic"
                    >p,</hi> we have then sin. <hi rend="italic">p = f</hi> sin. Z. On account of
                    the smallness of the angle <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> which, as we have
                    mentioned, in no case exceeds 1°, the arc may be substituted for the sine (for
                    their difference even in an arc of 1° does not exceed 0"∙18): the above
                    expression therefore becomes <hi rend="italic">P</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">~</hi><hi rend="superscript"> sin</hi> ∙ Z; that is to say, the
                    parallax of a star is proportional to the ' sine of its zenith distance. At the
                    zenith, Z = 0, there-- fore sin. Z = 0, and the parallax vanishes: at the
                    horizon, Z = 90°, and sin. Z = 1; the parallax, therefore, becomes equal to p In

                    apparent zenith distance.</hi> It is evident that the apparent altitude SOH is
                    always less than the true altitude SBH, by the whole amount of the parallax; the
                    effect of the parallax is therefore to depress the object, or increase its
                    zenith distance; hence, if <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> be the apparent altitude of

                <p>From the above results it is manifest, that if the horizontal parallax can be by
                    any means determined, the parallax at any other altitude will be found at the
                    same time. The determination of the horizontal parallax is, however, attended
                    with considerable difficulty, and various methods have been proposed and
                    practised to ascertain its exact amount, modified by particular circumstances in
                    the cases of the different celestial bodies. The method, however, which serves
                    as the basis of all the others is extremely simple, and exactly analogous to
                    that by which the distance of a remote object is determined on the surface of
                    the earth. Suppose two observers to be stationed at the points 0 and O' (fig.
                    6), of which the] latitudes are known, and which are both situated on the same
                    meridian, and let them simultaneously observe the zenith distances of the star
                    S; these observations will give the angles ZOS, Z'O'S, whence their supplements
                    SOC and SO'C become known at the same time. A third angle of the quadrilateral
                    figure SOCO', namely OCO,' is also known, being measured by the meridional arc
                    OMO ’, the difference or sum of the latitudes of the two observers, according as
                    they are on the same or opposite sides of the equator. The two sides also, CO
                    and CO', being semidiameters of the earth, are supposed to be known; every part
                    of the quadrilateral figure is therefore determined, and its diagonal CS may be
                    calculated by the rules of plane trigonometry. But when CS is determined, the
                    horizontal parallax is obtained immediately from the formula P = -, that is, P =

                    observing at the Cape of Good Hope, and the latter at Berlin; and the parallax

                <p>Let us suppose two lines to be drawn from the centre of a planet touching the
                    surface of the earth in points diametrically opposite; the inclination of these
                    two straight lines is the double of the horizontal parallax; but the same angle
                    also measures the diameter of the earth as seen from the planet: hence the
                    horizontal parallax of a planet is equal to the apparent semidiameter of the
                    earth at the distance of the planet. From this consideration the true diameter,
                    and consequently the volume, of a planet maybe found by measuring its apparent
                    diameter, that is, the optical angle under which its diameter appears when seen
                    from the earth. Let <hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the <hi rend="superscript">
                    a</hi> PP <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> ^ rent, and D the true diameter of a
                    planet; the angle <hi rend="italic">įd</hi> is comprised between two straight
                    lines drawn from the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105454"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5454-0761"/>earth, the first of which is directed to the
                    centre of the planet, and the last is a tangent to it: hence į D = <hi

                    sin. ∙⅜√, according as <hi rend="italic">τ</hi> is the line which touches the
                    planet or that which is directed to its centre. Now, on account of the smallness
                    of the angle <hi rend="italic">l,d,</hi> the sine and tangent are sensibly equal
                    to the arc; we may therefore suppose in all cases D = <hi rend="italic">τ
                    d.</hi> Combining this with the equation P = -, we deduce — = ~; which gives the
                    ratio between the true diameters of the planet and the earth in terms of the
                    apparent magnitude and horizontal parallax of the planet. It follows also from
                    this last equation that -p-, or the ratio of the apparent diameter and parallax
                    of a planet, is constant; the horizontal parallax may therefore be found at any
                    time whatever by measuring the planet’s diameter.</p>
                <p>From the equation <hi rend="italic">P=~, we</hi> have ʹ-J√ that is, the distance
                    of a planet from the earth is known in terms of its parallax and the earth’s
                    semidiameter. The parallaxes, therefore, give the ratio of the distances of all
                    the planets from the earth, and consequently of their distances from one
                    another, and from the sun; hence the radius of the earth furnishes the scale by
                    which the astronomer measures the dimensions of the whole solar system, and the
                    magnitudes or volumes of all the bodies of which it is composed. On this account
                    the accurate determination of the parallaxes of the celestial bodies is a
                    problem of great importance in practical astronomy.</p>
                <p>It is evident from the mere inspection of the figure, that the plane in which the
                    straight lines C S and O S are situated is the vertical plane passing through S,
                    consequently the whole effect of the parallax is to diminish the altitude of a
                    planet in its vertical circle. When the observation, therefore, is made in the
                    meridian, the effect of the parallax is to alter the declination, without
                    producing any change whatever in the right ascension of the planet. Out of the
                    meridian it is necessary to have regard to the azimuth or hour angle, as well as
                    to the altitude, in calculating the correction due to the parallax. When we
                    sup-Îiose the earth to be spherical, the formulae for the calcu-ation of the
                    parallax are extremely simple, because the radius is constant, and the vertical
                    line, or perpendicular to the surface of the earth, passes . through its centre.
                    But in the case of the true or elliptical figure of the earth neither of these
                    circumstances takes place. The radius in this case is variable, and must be
                    determined by a particular process of computation for every point on the
                    meridian; and the vertical line, with reference to which the latitude of the
                    place and the altitudes are determined, does not pass through the centre of the
                    earth, but makes different angles with the axis. These circumstances render the
                    calculation of the parallax a matter of much greater complication and
                    difficulty.</p>
                <p>The term parallax in its general signification properly denotes <hi rend="italic"
                    >change</hi> of place. There are consequently various kinds of parallaxes, such
                    as parallax of right ascension, of declination, longitude, latitude, &amp;c. In
                    what has preceded, we have .supposed the earth to be at rest in the centre of
                    the universe, and therefore have had regard solely to the variations produced in
                    the apparent diurnal motions by the eccentric position of the observer on the
                    surface of the earth, and which are comprehended generally under the
                    denomination of the <hi rend="italic">diurnal</hi> parallax.</p>
                <p>The effects of the diurnal parallax are only sensible with regard to those bodies
                    of which the distance from the earth is not so great as to be incomparable with
                    the earth’s semidiameter. That the apparent place of an object must be changed
                    in consequence of a change in the situation of the observer, is a simple
                    geometrical truth which no experiment was required to discover. The first
                    observers must accordingly have anticipated a parallax in all the celestial
                    bodies; and it was doubtless only after considerable experience that they
                    admitted the existence of any exception to the general law. There is, however,
                    another cause of variation in the apparent positions of the celestial bodies
                    also connected with the earth, the existence of which could not be known <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori,</hi> but must have been discovered by experience alone.
                    We allude to the refraction of the rays of light in passing through the earth’s
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <p>The angular distance between two stars is found to undergo very sensible
                    variations at different hours of the day. This phenomenon cannot be explained by
                    any proper motion of the stars, because it evidently depends on their altitude
                    above the horizon; and the differences are found to be the same daily at the
                    same altitude. It is most striking when we compare a star which, without
                    setting, passes the meridian twice a day, once near the zenith, and the second
                    time near the horizon, with another star situated very near the pole, and of
                    which the altitude is consequently nearly invariable. It will be found that at
                    the time of the first transit the distance between the two stars is greater than
                    at the second by nearly half a degree. It is evident, therefore, that the
                    phenomenon consists in diminishing the distance between a star situated in the
                    horizon and the visible pole, that is to say, in elevating the stars, whereas
                    the effect of the parallax is to depress them. The refraction also takes place
                    in an equal degree with regard to the fixed stars, and even the moon and
                    planets, without being in any degree modified by the great differences in the
                    distances of the celestial bodies, contrary in. this respect likewise to the
                    parallax, which depends entirely on the distance. The reason of this will be
                    evident from the consideration of the physical cause of the phenomenon.</p>
                <p>According to the known principles of optics, a ray of light, in passing obliquely
                    from one transparent medium into another of a different density, does not hold
                    on .in its rectilinear course, but is refracted, or bent towards the denser
                    medium. Now, the atmosphere which surrounds the earth may be regarded as
                    composed of an infinity of concentric spherical strata, the densities of which
                    are greater in proportion as they are nearer to the earth’s surface. When a ray
                    of light, therefore, proceeding from a star enters the atmosphere, it is
                    inflected towards the earth, or bent so as to form a smaller angle with a
                    perpendicular to the surface of the earth; and this inflection will be increased
                    by every successive stratum of the atmosphere through which the light passes. In
                    fig. 8, let AA', BB', CC', represent the boundaries of the successive strata,
                    which, for the sake of illustration, we here suppose to have a finite thickness.
                    A ray of light proceeding from S comes in contact with the highest stratum of
                    the atmosphere AA' at <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> The molecular attraction of this
                    atmospherical stratum, acting in the direction of a normal to A A' at <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> causes the luminous ray to deviate from the direction S
                    <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> and assume another, <hi rend="italic">a y,</hi> in
                    which it would continue to move if the atmosphere were equally dense from A A'
                    to the earth. But in the course of its progress the ray penetrates another
                    denser stratum at <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and consequently suffers another
                    inflection; so that instead of proceeding in the direction <hi rend="italic">a
                    y,</hi> it is bent into a new direction <hi rend="italic">bz,</hi> more nearly
                    perpendicular to the concentric strata. A similar effect is produced at <hi
                    rend="italic">c,</hi> so that the luminous ray, when it finally reaches the
                    observer at 0, has as <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105467"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5467-0762"/>sumed the direction <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 0. In
                    its progress from <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to O, it has therefore successively
                    moved in the direction of the sides of the polygon <hi rend="italic">a, b,
                    e,</hi> 0; and to the spectator at 0, the star from which it proceeded, instead
                    of appearing in its true place at S, will appear to be at S', or in the last
                    direction of the visual ray. Now, if A A' is the most elevated stratum of the
                    atmosphere into which the ray enters in the direction S <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> it is clear that the whole effect is produced by the atmospherical
                    strata situated below A A', and that the length of S <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is
                    perfectly indifferent; hence the refraction is entirely independent of the
                    distance of the stars, provided they are beyond the limits of the earth’s
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <p>The decrease of the density of the atmosphere, from the surface of the earth
                    upwards, follows the law of continuity, or takes place by insensible degrees; so
                    that the luminous ray, in traversing the atmosphere, enters at every instant
                    into a denser medium, and is therefore continually brought nearer and nearer to
                    the vertical direction. Hence the true path of the ray is curvilinear, and
                    concave towards the earth, as represented in fig. 9. This is equivalent to the
                    supposition that the thickness of the different concentric strata of uniform
                    density is infinitely small, and that the light, as it successively penetrates
                    each, deviates from its former path by an infinitely small angle, which may be
                    considered as the differential of the refraction, the total amount of which will
                    therefore be obtained by integration. The direction of the ray, when it reaches
                    the eye of the observer, is the tangent to the last portion of its curvilinear
                    path; and the apparent zenith distance of the star will be ZOS', while the real
                    zenith distance is ZOS. The difference of these two angles, namely S'OS, is what
                    is denominated the <hi rend="italic">Astronomical Refraction.</hi> It is evident
                    that the whole path of the ray is confined to the vertical plane, in which the
                    star and the eye of the observer are situated; for the earth and its atmosphere
                    being very nearly spherical, that plane will divide the strata symmetrically;
                    the attracting forces will therefore be equal on each side of it, and
                    consequently produce no effect in a lateral direction. When the observed star is
                    due north or south, the vertical plane is the plane of the meridian; hence, in
                    meridional observations, the whole of the refraction, like that of the parallax,
                    takes place in declination, while the right ascension remains unaltered.</p>
                <p>It is evident that the amount of the refraction is greater in proportion as the
                    observed star is nearer to the horizon; for in this case the luminous rays
                    strike the tangent planes of the atmospherical strata more obliquely, and have
                    besides to traverse a greater extent of atmosphere before they arrive at the eye
                    of the observer. On determining by experiment the refraction at every altitude
                    from zero to 90°, tables of <hi rend="italic">Refraction</hi> may be
                    constructed, which will furnish the means of discovering the law of its
                    diminution; but as such a process would be exceedingly tedious, and likewise
                    subject to lead to erroneous results on account of the inevitable errors of
                    observation, it is found more convenient to assume some hypothesis for a basis
                    of calculation, and to verify the results which it leads to by comparing them
                    with observation. In regard to media which may be said to be permanent, such,
                    for instance, as water and glass, the determination of the refraction is not
                    attended with great difficulty; but the circumstances are greatly altered when
                    we come to make experiments on the atmosphere. In this case the difficulty
                    arises from the incessant changes which the atmosphere is undergoing relatively
                    to its refringent powers; changes which it is impossible for the observer fully
                    to appreciate, inasmuch as he can only determine its physical state within a
                    short distance of the earth, while that of the upper strata remains wholly
                    unknown to him. The refringent power of the atmosphere is affected by its·
                    density and temperature. The effects of the humidity are insensible; for the
                    most accurate experiments seem to prove that the watery vapours diminish the
                    density of the air in the same ratio as their refractive power is greater. It is
                    therefore only necessary, even in delicate experiments, to have regard to the
                    state of the barometer and thermometer at the time the observation is made. At a
                    medium density, and at the temperature of melting ice, it was found by Biot and
                    Arago, from a great number of exact experiments, that at any altitude between
                    10° and the zenith the refraction is very nearly represented by the formula <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> = 60"∙6 tan. (Z — 3 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 25 × r),
                    in which <hi rend="italic">τ</hi> is the refraction corresponding to a given
                    zenith distance Z. With the exception of the numerical co-eñĩcients, this
                    formula was first given by Bradley; but whether it was deduced from theory by
                    that great astronomer, or was only empirical, is uncertain. Bradley’s formula
                    was <hi rend="italic">τ</hi> = 57" tan. (Z — 3 × r). When the direction of the
                    luminous rays makes a smaller angle than 10° with the horizon, it becomes
                    indispensable to take into account, in the calculation of the refraction, the
                    law of the variation of the density of the atmosphere at different altitudes; a
                    law which is subject to incessant variation, from the operation of winds, and
                    other causes which agitate the atmosphere, as well as the decrease of
                    temperature in the superior regions. For this reason all astronomical
                    observations which have not refraction directly for their object, or which are
                    by their nature independent of its influence, are made at an elevation exceeding
                    10°. For lower altitudes, it is to be feared that no theory will ever be found
                    sufficiently exact to entitle the observations to much confidence.</p>
                <p>The existence of the atmospherical refraction was not unknown to the ancient
                    astronomers; but it is only in modem times that the subject has been studied
                    with the requisite care to admit of its influence being calculated in the
                    reduction of observations. Ptolemy does not allude to the subject in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Almagest,</hi> but he has given a sufficiently exact idea of it in
                    his work on <hi rend="italic">Optics.</hi> He mentions experiments made to
                    ascertain how far a ray of light is bent from its rectilinear course in passing
                    from air into glass and water; and observes that the astronomical refraction
                    brings a star nearer to the zenith, and that it is feebler in proportion as the
                    star is more elevated. He likewise indicates a method of measuring its effects,
                    although he does not seem to have attempted to practise it. The same notions,
                    but in a less precise form, were reproduced in the <hi rend="italic">Optics</hi>
                    of Alhazen. Walther began to estimate the effects of refraction near the
                    horizon; and Tycho, a century after, found the means of measuring them with
                    greater accuracy, and was thereby enabled to construct a table. Tycho estimated
                    the horizontal refraction at 34 ’, and supposed it to vanish at the altitude of
                    45°; which proves that his ideas on the subject were less accurate than those of
                    Ptolemy, who says expressly that it vanished only at the zenith. Dominic Cassini
                    was the first who proposed an hypothesis for calculating the refraction at any
                    altitude; and he computed a table, which was published in 1662. Since that time
                    the subject of refraction has been investigated, theoretically and practically,
                    with the most scrupulous and delicate attention, and tables constructed to
                    exhibit its amount at every altitude, and at the different seasons of the year.

                <p>The refringent power of the atmosphere gives rise to a number of curious
                    phenomena. When the sun appears in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105480"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5480-0763"/>I the horizon, the rays of light which issue from
                    the extremities of his vertical diameter are refracted unequally on ' account of
                    the difference of altitude, so that the disk, at other times circular, then
                    assumes an oval appearance; , and on measuring the horizontal and vertical
                    diameters by means of the micrometer, the former is sometimes found to exceed
                    the latter by four or five minutes of a degree. This effect is particularly
                    remarkable when the sun is observed at his rising or setting from the top of a
                    mountain, or an elevation near the sea-shore, in which cases the difference of
                    the two diameters sometimes, in particular states of the atmosphere, amounts to
                    upwards of 6', or a fifth of the whole apparent diameter of the sun. In the case
                    of the moon this oval appearance is seldom so perceptible; for unless she
                    happens to be exactly full, or in opposition, at the same time that she is in
                    the horizon—and this can rarely be the case—the defect of the illumination of
                    her disk reduces her figure to those rounder but somewhat irregular shapes which
                    it often exhibits. The horizontal refraction being equal to the apparent
                    diameter of the sun or moon, it happens also that either of these luminaries,
                    and consequently any other of the celestial bodies, may be entirely visible
                    above the plane of the horizon, when in fact it has set below it. A curious
                    instance of this was observed at Paris in 1750. The moon rose eclipsed, while
                    the sun, whose place at the time of a lunar eclipse is diametrically opposite to
                    that of the moon, still appeared above the horizon. Another phenomenon
                    occasioned by the refraction of the atmosphere is the appearance of the moon
                    when she is eclipsed, or immersed in the earth’s shadow, and consequently
                    receives no light directly from the sun. On these occasions her disk continues
                    distinctly visible, and is of a dusky red colour, exhibiting the appearance of
                    tarnished copper, or iron nearly red-hot. This phenomenon occasioned great
                    perplexity to the ancient astronomers who were unacquainted with the refractive
                    powers of the atmosphere; and some of them ascribed it to the native light of
                    the moon, in virtue of which she continues visible when hid from the sun’s rays.
                    Plutarch ingeniously supposed it to be occasioned by the light of the stars
                    reflected from the dark surface of the moon; but the quantity of this light is
                    greatly too small to produce the effect in question. It is now explained by the
                    scattered beams of light bent into the earth’s shadow by refraction in their
                    passage through the atmosphere.</p>
                <p>The refraction of the rays of light in traversing the earth’s atmosphere is the
                    cause of <hi rend="italic">Twilight,</hi> which sensibly lengthens the duration
                    of the day, and prevents a sudden transition from light to darknesS on the
                    disappearance of the sun. When the sun is more than 33' below the horizon, the
                    refraction is not powerful enough to bring his rays sufficiently near the earth
                    to reach our eyes; they pass over our heads, and are irregularly reflected by
                    the molecules of the atmosphere. By this means a portion of the celestial vault
                    is enlightened, while the sun is invisible. This illumination of the upper
                    regions is called the twilight. It commences as soon as objects can be
                    distinguished before sun-rise, and terminates when they cease to be visible
                    after the sun has set. The time, however, at which the twilight commences and
                    terminates cannot be assigned with any degree of precision. It is generally
                    supposed to be limited by the depression of the sun 18° below the horizon.
                    Lacaille found the limit in the torrid zone to be between 16° and 17°. According
                    to Lemonnier, it varies in France between 17° and 21° ∙ The duration of the
                    twilight will evidently be longer or shorter according as the inclination of the
                    plane of the sun’s orbit to the horizon is more or less oblique.</p>
                <p>To assign the time at which it is a maximum or minimum, or of a given length at a
                    given latitude, is a problem of pure geometry, which has been frequently solved
                    since the time of the Bernoullis.</p>
                <p>The scintillation or twinkling of the stars is another phenomenon produced by
                    certain modifications of atmospherical refraction. The atmosphere is at all
                    times more or less agitated; and on this account the clusters of molecules of
                    which it is composed are constantlyundergoing momentary compressions and
                    dilatations, which occasion minute differences of refraction, and consequent
                    changes in the directions of the luminous rays. The minute and rapid variations
                    thus occasioned in the apparent places of the stars produce the twinkling or
                    tremulous appearances which, in certain states of the atmosphere, particularly
                    on the approach of rain after a long drought, are very remarkable. The
                    agitations of the atmosphere are manifest to the eye in the tremulous motion of
                    the shadows cast from high towers, and in looking at objects through the smoke
                    of a chimney, or over beds of hot sand. The scintillation of the planets is much
                    less than that of the stars. This proceeds from the magnitude of their disks,
                    which, although apparently very small, are still far greater than those of the
                    fixed stars, and indeed so considerable, that the accidental variations in the
                    directions of the rays of light are too minute to displace them entirely. The
                    borders of their disks are affected only by a slight undulation; whereas the
                    stars, which are merely brilliant points of insensible magnitude, undergo a
                    total displacement.</p>
                <p>The apparent enlargement of the sun and moon in the horizon is an optical
                    illusion, connected in some measure with the atmosphere, of which various
                    explanations have been given since the time of Ptolemy. According to the
                    ordinary laws of vision, the celestial bodies, particularly the moon, which is
                    nearest to the earth, ought to appear largest in the meridian, because their
                    distance is then less than when they are near the horizon; and yet daily
                    experience proves that the contrary takes place. To an observer placed at E
                    (fig. 10), the visual angle subtended by the moon in the horizon at Μ is
                    somewhat less than that under which she appears in the zenith at 0; and this
                    fact, a consequence indeed of her circular motion, is proved by accurate
                    measurements of her diameters in those circumstances by the micrometer. The mean
                    apparent diameter of the moon, at her greatest height, is 31' in round numbers,
                    but in the horizon she seems to the eye two or three times larger. The commonly
                    received explanation of this phenomenon was first given by Descartes, and after
                    him by Dr Wallis, James Gregory, Malebranche, Huygens, and others, and may be
                    stated as follows. The opinion which we form of the magnitude of a distant body
                    does not depend exclusively on the visual angle under which it appears, but also
                    on its distance; and we judge of the distance by a comparison with other bodies.
                    When the moon is near the zenith there is no interposing object with which we
                    can compare her, the matter of the atmosphere being scarcely visible. Deceived
                    by the absence of intermediate objects, we suppose her to be very near. On the
                    other hand, we are used to observe a large extent of land lying between us and
                    objects near the horizon, at the extremity of which the sky begins to appear; we
                    therefore suppose the sky, with all the objects which are visible in it, to be
                    at a great distance. The illusion is also greatly aided by the comparative
                    feebleness of the light of the moon in the horizon, which renders us in a manner
                    sensible of the interposition of the atmosphere. Hence the moon, though seen
                    under nearly the same angle, alternately appears very large and very small.
                    Desaguliers illustrated the doctrine of the horizontal moon on the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193105493" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5493-0764"/> supposition of
                    our imagining the visible heavens to be only a small portion of a spherical
                    surface, as <hi rend="italic">mnop</hi> (fig. 10), in which case the moon, at
                    different altitudes, will appear to be at different distances, and therefore
                    seem to vary in magnitude, as at <hi rend="italic">m, n, o.</hi> It is evident,
                    however, that this affords no explanation of the phenomenon; for why does the
                    sky, it may be asked, appear to be a smaller segment than a hemisphere? In the
                    solution of this question the whole difficulty is contained.</p>
                <p>It may be remarked that these illusions disappear as soon as the intermediate
                    objects are concealed from view. They may be destroyed by regarding the moon
                    through a tube, which permits her disk alone to be seen, and in this manner she
                    will appear no larger at the horizon than near the zenith. The same effect may
                    be produced by viewing her through a smoked glass, because the dark tint permits
                    only the luminous object to be seen, and conceals all the rest. The only
                    precaution necessary to be observed in making this experiment, is to place the
                    eye in such a position that the surrounding bodies may not be visible.</p>

                    Motion of tire Sun in the Ecliptic, and Position of the Ecliptic in

                <p>The consideration of the diurnal motion common to all the celestial bodies, and
                    the succession of day and night resulting from it, forms the first object of
                    astronomy. The second is to pass from the diurnal motion of the sphere to the
                    proper motion of the sun, and from the vicissitudes of the day to the seasons of
                    the year. The sun, as has already been remarked, is constantly shifting his
                    place among the stars. If we observe the altitude of any star, or group of
                    stars, above the eastern horizon at sun-set, we shall find, on making the same
                    observation a few days afterwards, that its elevation is considerably increased,
                    and that it has approached nearer to the meridian. At the end of three months it
                    will appear at sun-set on the meridian, and from that time continue to advance
                    nearer and nearer to the sun, till it is at last concealed by the splendour of
                    his rays. After remaining for some time invisible, it will again make its
                    appearance in the morning to the westward of the sun, and its distance from him
                    will continue to jncrease daily, till, at the end of a year, it has made a
                    complete circuit of the sky, and regained the position it occupied at the time
                    of the first observation. The earliest observers explained this phenomenon by
                    supposing the diurnal motion of the sun to be less rapid than that of the stars,
                    in consequence of which he constantly falls behind them. This supposition would
                    be admissible if the sun remained constantly in the plane of the equator; but as
                    he deviates considerably from that plane, on both sides of it, it is infinitely
                    more simple to ascribe to the sun a motion of his own, independent of the
                    diurnal motion, and performed in a contrary direction, in virtue of which he
                    traces an oblique route among the stars.</p>
                <p>The oblique path of the sun may be determined by observing the positions of the
                    stars near which he successively passes in the course of the year. The same
                    object is however accomplished with much greater precision by the modern
                    practice of observing his declinations and right ascensions, that is to say, his
                    distances from the equator, and an arbitrary meridian. In this manner his place
                    may be accurately assigned every day; and, by a repetition of similar
                    observations, a series of points will be obtained on the surface of the
                    celestial sphere, which mark out his annual course. The result of constant
                    experience shows, that the declination reaches its maximum on the south side of
                    the equator about the 22d of December, when it amounts to 23∙465 degrees. From
                    this time it gradually diminishes till about the 21st of March, when the sun
                    reaches the plane of the equator. At this time the days and nights are of equal
                    length all over the earth, and the instant of time at which the sun’s centre is
                    in the equatorial plane is called the instant of the equinox. The sun then
                    appears on the opposite side of the equator, and his declination or meridional
                    altitude continues to increase till about the 22d of June, when he becomes
                    stationary, and then again shapes his course towards the equator. His maximum
                    declination on the north side of the equator is exactly equal to that on the
                    south, amounting to 23° ∙465. The sun now continues to approach the equator till
                    about the 24th of September, when he again reaches that plane, and a second
                    equinox succeeds. Continuing still to move in the same direction, he declines
                    from the equator southward, till he reaches his former limit about the 22d of
                    December, after which he resumes his former course.</p>
                <p>The two small circles of the sphere, parallel to the equator, which pass through
                    the two points where the declination is great, are called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Solstices,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Tropics</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    that on the northern hemisphere is called the <hi rend="italic">Tropic of
                    Cancer,</hi> and the other is called the <hi rend="italic">Tropic of
                    Capricon.</hi> These two parallels, which mark the extreme limits of the sun’s
                    declination, are, as has just been stated, equally distant from the equator,
                    with regard to which the variations of declination on either side are perfectly
                    symmetrical and uniform.</p>
                <p>If at the time of the vernal equinox we remark the stars which set in the true
                    west while the sun is rising in the east, and which are then separated from him
                    by a semi-circumference, it will be found that the difference of their right
                    ascensions, and the right ascensions of those which have precisely a similar
                    situation relatively to the sun at the time of the autumnal equinox, is exactly
                    180°. It follows, therefore, that the solar orbit intersects the equator in two
                    points diametrically opposite; but we have seen that its northern and southern
                    declinations are equal; hence the orbit projected on the sphere must be a great
                    circle, provided it lies wholly in the same plane. Whether this is the case or
                    not it will be easy to prove by means of a few observations, in the following
                    manner.</p>

                    declination, drawn through any two points S and T of the orbit. If the sun’s

                    give the declinations D and D'; and the difference of right ascensions, AE'—AE,
                    will be found by comparing the time of the sun’s culmination, or transit over
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105506" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5506-0765"/> the meridian,
                    with that of a star. If, therefore, it is • found that, by assigning a certain
                    constant value to <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> this ' equation will satisfy all the
                    observations, combined by pairs, of the sun’s right ascensions and declinations,
                    it will follow that the plane determined by any two points in the sun’s course
                    and the point in which it intersects the equator, has always the same
                    inclination to the equator; in other words, all the planes so determined are
                    identical.</p>
                <p>Now the observations of the sun’s right ascensions and meridional altitudes,
                    which have been made daily during so great a number of years, and under so many
                    different meridians, are found to conform entirely with the preceding formulae:
                    they therefore furnish so many proofs that the projection of the sun’s orbit is
                    a great circle of the celestial sphere, and that the orbit itself is wholly
                    confined to the same plane.</p>
                <p>The great circle which the sun describes in virtue of his proper motion is called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ecliptic.</hi> It has received this name from the
                    circumstance that the moon, during eclipses, is either in the same plane or very
                    near it. These phenomena can in fact only happen when the sun, earth, and moon
                    are nearly in the same straight line, and, consequently, when the moon is in the
                    same plane with the earth and the sun. The angle formed by the planes of the
                    ecliptic and equator, and which is measured by the arc of a circle of
                    declination intercepted between the equator and tropic, is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Obliquity of the Ecliptic.</hi> The two points in which the

                    through which the sun passes on coming from the south to the north of the
                    equator is called the <hi rend="italic">Ascending Node,</hi> and is usually
                    distinguished by the character &amp;; the opposite node is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Descending Node,</hi> and is marked by ö. A straight line passing through the
                    centre of the earth, perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, is called the
                    <hi rend="italic">Axis,</hi> and the points in which its prolongation meets the
                    sphere are called the <hi rend="italic">Poles, of the Ecliptic</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> these denominations being analogous to those of the axis
                    and poles of the equator. The two small circles of the sphere which pass through
                    the poles of the ecliptic, and are parallel to the equator, are called the <hi

                <p>The ecliptic has been divided by astronomers, from time . immemorial, into twelve

                <p>In each of these signs the ancients formed groups of stars, which they

                    not confined to the ecliptic, but included within an imaginary belt, extending
                    8° on each side of it, to which they gave the name of <hi rend="italic">Zodiac

                    is now employed only to denote an arc of 30°, and will probably soon be banished
                    entirely from the astronomical tables. It is already confined to the tables of
                    the planets. Thus, to denote that the longitude of a planet is 276° 12', it is
                    usual to write 9 <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> 6° 12'. Formerly it was usual to
                    employ the characteristic symbol, and to write &gt;y 6° 12', meaning that the
                    planet was 12' in the 6th degree of Capriconus, or the tenth sign. This
                    inconvenient practice is now laid aside, and the signs, when they are employed,
                    are simply - distinguished by the ordinal numbers.</p>
                <p>As the greater part of the celestial phenomena connected with the planetary
                    system take place either in the ecliptic or in planes not greatly inclined to
                    it, it is found to be most convenient to refer the positions of the planets, and
                    frequently those of the stars also, to that plane. The first point of Aries,
                    which is the technical expression for the intersection of the ecliptic and
                    equator, or the place of the sun at the vernal equinox, is assumed as the origin
                    from which the degrees of the equator, as well as of the ecliptic, are counted
                    from west to east, or in the direction of the sun’s annual motion. The angular
                    distance of the sun from this point is called his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Longitude;</hi> and the longitude of a star is the arc intercepted on the
                    ecliptic between the same point and a great circle passing through the star
                    perpendicular to the ecliptic. The arc of this circle intercepted between the
                    star and the ecliptic, or, which is the same thing, the complement of the star’s
                    distance from the pole of the ecliptic, is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Latitude</hi> of the star; so that longitude and latitude are with regard to
                    the ecliptic what right ascension and declination are with regard to the
                    equator. Thus, let O&lt;r Q (fig. 12) be the equator, IɤL the ecliptic, P and: E
                    the north poles of these two circles respectively, and S the place of a star.
                    Having drawn through the pole of the ecliptic and the star the great circle ESM
                    perpendicular to the ecliptic in Μ; then ɤM is the longitude of S, counted on
                    the ecliptic from the vernal point <hi rend="italic">&lt;p</hi> towards the
                    east; and SM, the distance of the star from the ecliptic, is its latitude; and
                    for this reason all great circles passing through the poles of the ecliptic are
                    called <hi rend="italic">Circles of Latitude.</hi> The place of a star is thus
                    determined by its longitude cγ&gt; Μ, and its latitude SM, as well as by its
                    right ascension ɤ R, and its declination SR; and when the angle Lɤ Q is known,
                    it is easy to pass from the one system of co-ordinates to the other by means of
                    the formulae of spherical trigonometry. These formulae are of constant use, for
                    it is the declinations and right ascensions only which are directly
                    observed.</p>
                <p>The plane of the sun’s orbit will be determined completely when its inclination
                    to the equator and the position of the line of the nodes in space have been made
                    known by observation. The declination of the sun twice a year, namely, at the
                    summer and winter solstice, is equal to the obliquity of the ecliptic; whence,
                    if the solstice happened exactly at mid-day, the obliquity would be given
                    directly by an observation of his meridional altitude. This circumstance,
                    however, can happen only for one terrestrial meridian; but as the declination of
                    the sun when he approaches the tropics varies little from one day to another,
                    his greatest observed declination will be a very near approximation to the
                    obliquity, at whatever part of the earth the observation may have been made. It
                    is easy, however, to correct the error which results from the observation being
                    made on a meridian different from the solstitial colure. Taking an example from
                    Woodhouse, let us suppose the sun’s declination to be observed on three
                    successive days (the 20th, 21st, and 22d of June), and found to be on these days
                    respectively, 23° 27' 37", 23° 27' 41", 23° 27' 20"; then it is obvious, that if
                    the middle observation gave the greatest inclination exactly, the other two
                    would differ from it equally, which they do not. The maximum declination is
                    therefore a quantity somewhat different from 23° 27' 41"; and it is easy to
                    conclude, from the inspection of the numbers, that it is nearer to 23° 27' 41"
                    than to either of the other two. It is obvious, therefore, that that observation
                    must have been made within 12 hours of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105519"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5519-0766"/>time when the sun was exactly in the solstitial
                    point. In order to form an exact notion of the amount of error which may
                    possibly arise from this circumstance, let S (fig. 13) be the place of the sun
                    at the time of the observation, and X the true but as yet unknown solstitial
                    point, and <hi rend="italic">S s, Xx</hi> meridional arcs intersecting the
                    equator in 5 and <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> The arc S X must be less than 30',
                    for in 12 hours the variation of the sun’s longitude does not exceed an arc of
                    that magnitude. Suppose it 30': then, by Napier’s rules, rad. × sin. Ss = sin.
                    &lt;y&gt; × sin. S ɤ, and rad. × sin. X a?—sin. <hi rend="italic">&lt;γ,</hi> ×
                    sin. X&lt;v ’; whence, on eliminating sin. ɤ, and observing that sin. X ɤ = sin.
                    90° = 1, we shall have sin. S <hi rend="smallcaps">ä</hi> sin. S 5 sm. X <hi

                    rend="italic">.</hi> sin.⅛ɤ cos. SX</p>
                <p>By taking, according to the observation, S s = 23° 27'41", and S X = 30 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>, we shall find from the logarithmic tables <hi
                    rend="italic">Ar</hi> = 23° 27' 44"∙5. It will be observed that 30 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> is the maximum error in longitude; if instead of 30 ’
                    it had been supposed only 3', the corresponding error in declination would have
                    amounted only to 0"∙035. In the example chosen, the error of longitude is about
                    20', whence the error of declination is 1"∙5 nearly, and consequently the
                    resulting obliquity differs little from 23° 27' 42"∙5. This result is, however,
                    to be understood of the <hi rend="italic">apparent</hi> obliquity, which is
                    subject to slight variations, depending on the longitudes of the moon’s nodes:
                    the <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> obliquity, deduced from the comparison of a
                    great number of observations, both of the summer and winter solstice, may be
                    regarded as amounting to 23° 27' 41" at the commencement of the year 1830. We
                    shall see, when we come to speak of the <hi rend="italic">Nutation,</hi> in what
                    the difference between the apparent and mean obliquity consists.</p>
                <p>When the mean value of the obliquity of the ecliptic, as determined by the
                    delicate instruments of the present day, is compared with that given by ancient
                    observations, it appears to have undergone a progressive diminution, and is
                    always greater as the observation is more remote. The ancient observers were
                    not, indeed, possessed of the means of determining an element of this sort with
                    great precision; but as all the observations recorded in history agree in making
                    the obliquity greater in former times than it is now, the probability is almost
                    infinite that the angle formed by the planes of the equator and ecliptic has
                    really diminished; for, had the differences of the values assigned to it arisen
                    solely from errors of observation, they would have been in excess and defect
                    indifferently, instead of being, as they are, uniformly in excess. The various
                    observations and traditions by which the progressive diminution of the obliquity
                    is confirmed have been collected by Bailly; in the following table we have
                    inserted those which appear to be the best authenticated, and have added the

                <p>Although the comparison of these observations with one another gives very
                    discordant results relatively to the law according to which the obliquity
                    varies, their totality places the fact of its progressive diminution beyond all
                    manner of doubt. Lacaille, who was followed by the greater number of
                    astronomers, estimated the diminution of 44" in a hundred years; a result to
                    which he was led chiefly by a comparison of his own observations with those of
                    Walther. Lalande, after comparing an immense number of modern observations with
                    those of the 17th, 16th, and 15th centuries, and also with those of the Arabians
                    and Chinese, found the secular diminution to be 50". Bessel, rejecting the
                    ancient observations as too uncertain, and comparing those only which have been
                    made since the time of Bradley, has fixed the secular diminution at 45"∙7, which
                    differs inconsiderably from the determination of Lacaille. It cannot yet be
                    determined by observation whether this diminution is uniform, or accelerated, or
                    retarded; but so slow is the rate at which it proceeds, that it may, without any
                    sensible error, be regarded as uniform for many centuries to come.</p>
                <p>The gradual diminution of the obliquity of the ecliptic might lead us to suppose
                    that a time will ultimately arrive when that plane will coincide with the
                    equator, and the earth be deprived, in consequence, of the agreeable vicissitude
                    of the seasons. But the theory of universal gravitation, which has revealed the
                    cause of the diminution, has also shown that there are certain limits which the
                    angle of the two planes can never exceed, and between which it must continue for
                    ever to oscillate. Geometers have not yet ventured to assign the precise extent
                    of these limits, but their existence is certain; and the planes of the ecliptic
                    and equator, which have been approaching to each other during the last 2000
                    years, will, in the course of some thousands of years more, begin to recede.</p>
                <p>In what has yet been said respecting the diminution of. the obliquity of the
                    ecliptic, no fact has been mentioned ∣ from which it can be inferred, whether
                    the phenomenon isι <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105532"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5532-0767"/>occasioned by the displacement of the plane of the
                    eclip- ∙tic or that of the equator. This question may also be de- ' cided by a
                    comparison of modern with ancient observations; for it is evident, that if the
                    inclination of these two planes becomes less, the stars which are situated
                    between them, particularly those near the solstitial colure, will appear to
                    approach to that plane which changes its position; so that if the ecliptic is
                    displaced, the latitudes of those stars will be diminished, or their
                    declinations if the displacement belongs to the equator. It was first observed
                    by Tycho, and the observation has been confirmed by succeeding astronomers, that
                    the latitudes of the southern stars situated near the solstitial colure, that
                    is, of those stars whose longitudes are nearly 90°, have diminished upwards of
                    20' since the time of Hipparchus and Ptolemy, while the latitudes of the
                    northern stars have undergone a corresponding augmentation. From this fact it is
                    proved that the diminution of the obliquity is occasioned by the displacement of
                    the ecliptic; and theory has shown that the cause of the displacement is the
                    action of the planets, particularly of Jupiter and Venus, on the earth, by
                    virtue of which the plane of the earth’s orbit is drawn nearer to the planes of
                    the orbits of these two planets. This, however, though by far the most
                    considerable, is not the sole cause of the phenomenon; for theory also shows
                    that a slight motion of the plane of the equator is produced by the attraction
                    of the sun and moon, but so very minute that its effects will only become
                    appreciable after a long series of ages.</p>
                <p>After determining the inclination of the plane of the ecliptic to that of the
                    equator, the only element requisite to fix its position absolutely in space, is
                    the situation of the straight line formed by its intersection with that plane,
                    that is to say, the line of the nodes. The longitudes of the stars, as has
                    already been mentioned, are counted on the ecliptic from the vernal equinox; and
                    therefore, if the line of the equinoxes, which is the same as the line of the
                    nodes, is invariable, the longitude of any star will always be the same,
                    whatever interval of time may elapse between two observations of that longitude.
                    But on comparing the actual state of the heavens with the observations recorded
                    by ancient astronomers, it is perceived that the longitudes of all the stars are
                    considerably increased; whence we must infer, either that the whole firmament
                    has advanced in the order of the signs, or that the equinoctial points have gone
                    backwards, or retrograded. The latter supposition is infinitely the more
                    probable; for it is inconceivable that the innumerable multitude of stars should
                    have a common motion relatively to points which depend solely on the motion of
                    the earth. The phenomenon is therefore to be explained by attributing to the
                    equinoctial points a retrograde motion from east to west, in consequence of
                    which, the sun, whose motion is direct, arrives at them sooner than if they
                    remained at rest; and therefore the equinoxes, spring, autumn, and the other
                    seasons, happen before the sun has completed an entire circuit. On this account
                    the motion has been denominated the <hi rend="italic">Precession of the
                    Equinoxes.</hi> As this motion is extremely slow, its exact amount can be
                    discovered only by a comparison of observations separated from each other by
                    long intervals of time; but the imperfection of instruments prior to the
                    sixteenth century renders the ancient observations of little authority where
                    quantities so minute are concerned, and therefore some discrepancies may be
                    expected in the different determinations of the amount of the precession. The
                    comparison of modern observations with those of Hipparchus gives its annual
                    amount equal to 50∣ seconds, and with those of Ptolemy somewhat greater. The
                    mean result of the observations of Tycho, compared with those of Lacaille, gives
                    50"∣. On com- ' paring modern observations with one another, we find- 50"∙06.
                    Delambre, in his solar tables, supposes the annual precession to be equal to
                    50"∙1. According to this estimate the equinoctial points go backwards at the
                    rate of one degree in 71∙6 years nearly, and therefore will make a complete
                    revolution of the heavens in about 25,868, or nearly 26 thousand years.</p>
                <p>The discovery of the precession of the equinoxes is generally attributed to
                    Hipparchus, who, on comparing his own observations with those of Timocharis,
                    more ancient by 160 years, perceived that in this· interval the longitudes of
                    the stars had been augmented by about two degrees. It would seem, however, from
                    many proofs collected by Bailly, that this motion, slow as it is, was known to
                    all the ancient nations who cultivated astronomy, long before the time of
                    Hipparchus. It is indeed easy to conceive, from the great attention which they
                    gave to the heliacal risings of the remarkable stars, that they might observe a
                    gradual change of the seasons at the occurrence of these phenomena, from which
                    they would necessarily be led to conclude a variation of the star’s longitude.
                    In consequence of this regression of the equinoctial points, the sun’s place
                    among the zodiacal constellations at any given season of the year is now greatly
                    different from what it was in remote ages. Some time prior to Hipparchus, the
                    first points of Aries and Libra corresponded to the vernal and autumnal
                    equinoxes; those of Cancer and Capricon to the summer and winter solstices: at
                    present these constellations have receded 30 degrees from the same points of the
                    ecliptic. The vernal equinox now happens in the constellation Pisces, the summer
                    solstice in Gemini, the autumnal equinox in Virgo, and the winter solstice in
                    Sagittarius. Astronomers, however, still count the signs from the vernal
                    equinox, which, therefore, always corresponds to the first point of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sign</hi> of Aries. On this account it is necessary to distinguish
                    carefully between the <hi rend="italic">Signs</hi> of the Zodiac, which are
                    fixed with regard to the equinoxes, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Constellations,</hi> which are movable with respect to those points.</p>
                <p>The diminution of the obliquity of the ecliptic arises from the displacement of
                    the ecliptic itself; the precession of the equinoxes is, on the contrary,
                    occasioned by the <hi rend="subscript"> ¢</hi> continual displacement of the
                    plane of the terrestrial equator. This displacement results from the combined
                    action of the sun and moon (for the influence of the planets amounts only to a
                    fraction of a second, and is consequently scarcely sensible,) on the mass of
                    protuberant matter accumulated about the earth’s equator, or the matter which
                    forms the excess of the terrestrial spheroid above its inscribed sphere. The
                    attracting force of the sun and moon on this shell of matter may be resolved
                    into two; one parallel to the plane of the equator, the other perpendicular to
                    it. The tendency of this last force is to diminish the angle which the plane of
                    the equator makes with that of the ecliptic; and if the earth had no motion of
                    rotation, it would soon cause the two planes to coincide. In consequence,
                    however, of the rotatory motion of the earth, the inclination of the two planes
                    remains constant; but the effect produced by the action of the force in question
                    is, that the plane of the equator is constantly shifting its place, in such a
                    manner that the line of the equinoxes advances in the direction of the diurnal
                    motion, or contrary to the order of the signs, its pole having a slow angular
                    motion about the pole of the ecliptic, so slow indeed, that it requires nearly
                    26,000 years to complete its revolution.</p>
                <p>If the sun and moon moved in the plane of the equator, there would evidently be
                    no precession; and the effect of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105545"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5545-0768"/>their action in producing it varies with their
                    distance from that plane. Twice a year, therefore, the effect of the sun in
                    causing precession is nothing; and twice a year, namely at the solstices, it is
                    a maximum: on no two successive days of the year is it exactly the same, and
                    consequently the regression of the equinoctial points, which results from· the
                    sun’s action, must be unequable. On this account the obliquity of the ecliptic
                    is subject to a semi-annual variation; for the sun’s force, which tends to
                    produce a change in the obliquity, is variable, while the diurnal motion of the
                    earth, which prevents the change from taking place, is constant. Hence the plane
                    of the equator is subject to an irregular motion, which is technically called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Solar Nutation.</hi> The existence of the solar nutation
                    is, however, only a deduction from theory, for its amount is too small to be
                    perceptible to observation; but a similar effect of the moon’s action is
                    sufficiently appreciable, and was, in fact, discovered by Dr Bradley before
                    theory had indicated its existence. Its period, however, is different, and
                    depends on the time of the revolution of the moon’s nodes, which is performed in
                    18 years and about 7 months. During this time the intersection of the lunar
                    orbit with the ecliptic has receded through a complete circumference; and the
                    inequality of the moon’s action will consequently, in the same time, have passed
                    through all its different degrees. Bradley observed that the declinations of the
                    stars continued to augment during nine years, that they diminished during the
                    nine years following, and that the greatest change of declination amounted to
                    18". He remarked further, that this motion was connected with an irregularity of
                    the precession of the equinoxes, which followed exactly the same period; whence
                    he concluded that the motion of the poles of the equator, occasioned by this
                    vibration of its plane, was not confined to the solstitial colure. A series of
                    observations on stars differently situated proved that all the phenomena could
                    be explained on the hypothesis that the pole of the equator describes in 18
                    years a small circle of 18" diameter, contrary to the order of the signs; or
                    that the axis of the world, following the circumference of this circle,
                    describes the surface of a cone, the axis of which forms with its side an angle
                    of 9". This apparent vibratory motion is significantly denominated the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nutation of the Earth’s Axis.</hi></p>
                <p>In consequence of the two motions which occasion the precession and the nutation,
                    the true path of the pole of „the equator round that of the ecliptic is an
                    epicycloidal curve, which will be understood by referring to fig. 14. Let E be
                    the pole of the ecliptic, round which the pole of the equator P describes, in
                    virtue of the precession, and in a direction contrary to the order of the sines,
                    the circle PQR, of which the radius EP is equal to the obliquity of the
                    ecliptic, or the mean distance of the two poles. While P, the mean place of the
                    pole, moves in the circle PQR, with a velocity equal to the regression of the
                    equinoctial points, or at the rate of 50"∙1 a year, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >true</hi> pole <hi rend="italic">p</hi> describes at the same time round P a
                    small circle of 18" diameter in the same direction <hi rend="italic">pqr.</hi>
                    The true path of the pole is therefore along the circumference of a circle <hi
                    rend="italic">pqr,</hi> the centre of which retrogrades on the circumference of
                    another circle, and consequently moves in an epicycloid <hi rend="italic"
                    >abcdefg</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> the curve which results from
                    the composition of the two motions. Suppose the mean pole at Q, the true pole at
                    <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and αQ=9". In the course of nine years the mean pole
                    will have retrograded from Q to R, making QR=9 X 50"∙1, while the true pole will
                    have accomplished a semi-revolution in its circle. It will’therefore be at <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> (Re being=9"), and have described the epicycloidal arc <hi
                    rend="italic">abc,</hi> the greatest distance of which from the circle PQR is at
                    <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and equal to 9". At the end of the following nine
                    years the mean pole has retrograded from R to S, or 9×50"∙1, and the true pole
                    has returned to the same point <hi rend="italic">a</hi> of its epicycle; it will
                    therefore be found at <hi rend="italic">e</hi> Se being =9". In this interval it
                    has necessarily been within the circle PQR, its greatest distance from which at
                    <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is 9", so that in 18 years it has traced the curve <hi
                    rend="italic">abede.</hi> But <hi rend="italic">ac</hi> = QR + <hi rend="italic"

                    13". From <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to c the motion of the true pole in the
                    epicycle is in the same direction as that of the mean pole; from c to e it is in
                    an opposite direction, but as it is always much slower, being only about 3" in a
                    year, while that of the mean motion is 50"∙1, the true motion which results from
                    the combination of both will always be in the direction <hi rend="italic"
                    >ce,</hi> and at <hi rend="italic">d</hi> its velocity will be equal to their
                    difference. At <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> the
                    difference between the latitudes of the true and mean pole is a maximum, while
                    the difference of their longitudes is nothing; in other words, the correction of
                    the obliquity is greatest when that of the precession vanishes: at <hi
                    rend="italic">a, c,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> the correction of the
                    obliquity vanishes, and that of the precession is a maximum.</p>
                <p>Dr Bradley remarked that the effects of the nutation would be represented still
                    more accurately by supposing <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> the curve described
                    by the pole of the equator about its* mean place to be an ellipse instead of a
                    circle, the transverse and conjugate axes being 18" and 16" respectively. This
                    is also confirmed by theory, from which Laplace calculated the semi-axes of the
                    ellipse at 9"∙63 and 7"T7. The semi-transverse axis of the ellipse described by
                    the pole in virtue of the sun’s action alone does not exceed half a second, and
                    is consequently totally inappreciable. The sensible part of the nutation,
                    therefore, follows exactly the period of the revolution of the nodes of the
                    moon. From a series of 810 observations, embracing three complete revolutions of
                    the moon’s node, the major and minor semiaxes of the ellipse have been found by
                    Μ. Lindenau to be 8"∙977 and 6"∙682 respectively.</p>
                <p>It is now easy to see the reason of the distinction drawn above between the <hi
                    rend="italic">mean</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">true</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >apparent</hi> obliquity. The mean obliquity is represented by the radius EP of
                    the deferent circle PQR, along the circumference of which the centre of the
                    small circle or ellipse is carried, while the true obliquity is that quantity
                    increased or diminished by the nutation. The calculation of the mean obliquity
                    from the true is performed by the aid of the astronomical tables.</p>
                <p>The progressive diminution of the mean obliquity and the nutation of the earth’s
                    axis are inequalities distinguished from each other, not only by their being
                    derived from different and distinct causes, but still more by the very great
                    difference of time required for their full development. Almost every other
                    element of the planetary system is affected in a similar manner by inequalities
                    of two kinds, which are distinguished by the terms <hi rend="italic"
                    >secular</hi> and <hi rend="italic">periodic.</hi> The secular inequalities
                    proceed with extreme slowness, and continue progressive in the same sense during
                    many centuries; while the periodie are much more rapid in their march, and run
                    through the whole period of. their changes in comparatively short intervals of
                    time. The inequalities of the first kind are also periodic; but their periods
                    are vastly longer, and may be reckoned by centuries instead of years; and from
                    this circumstance they derive their name of <hi rend="italic">secular

                <p>Having now considered the situation of the plane in which the sun is observed to
                    move relatively to the fixed stars, and also the small secular and periodic

                    which it is subject, ŵe proceed next to inquire into the •nature of his orbit,
                    or the curve which he describes on ’that plane. The means which we have of
                    determining the solar orbit are the observed variations of the sun’s angular
                    velocity, and of his distance from the earth; hence two kinds of observations
                    are necessary,—the first, of his daily meridional altitudes, from which, as the
                    inclination of the orbit is known, his angular velocity is easily found; and the
                    second, of his apparent diameter, the variations of which follow the inverse
                    ratio of his distance.</p>
                <p>That the angular velocity of the sun’s motion in his orbit is not uniform, is
                    obvious from the fact that he remains 7f days longer in the northern than in the
                    southern signs, or, which is the same thing, that the interval between the
                    vernal and autumnal equinoxes is 7^ days longer than the interval between the
                    autumnal and vernal. It is proved by numerous observations that the sun moves
                    with the greatest velocity when at a point situated near the winter solstice;
                    while at the opposite point of the orbit, or near the summer solstice, his
                    velocity is the least. At the first point the diurnal motion is 1° ∙01943, and
                    at the second only 0° ∙95319. It is constantly varying between these two points;
                    and the variation is observed to be nearly proportional to the sun’s angular
                    distance from the point of his orbit where his velocity is a maximum or minimum.
                    The mean velocity is 0° ∙98632, or nearly 59' 11", which is the rate of the
                    sun’s daily motion about the beginning of April and October.</p>
                <p>The point of the solar orbit, which is .the most remote from the earth, is called
                    the <hi rend="italic">apogee (a</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> r</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">zο γr</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ς,</hi> away from the earth); that which is nearest is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">perigee (πs%ι γrrς,</hi> near the earth). The same points are also
                    called respectively the superior and inferior <hi rend="italic">Apsis</hi> of
                    the orbit, and the straight line which joins them is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Line of the Apsides.</hi></p>
                <p>The exact determination of the sun’s diameter is a problem which engaged the
                    earliest astronomers, but of which, before the invention of the telescope and
                    micrometer, it was impossible to obtain a solution sufficiently accurate to make
                    known its variations. Archimedes, by an extremely ingenious though imperfect
                    method, demonstrated that it must be included between the limits <hi
                    rend="subscript"> s</hi> ⅜ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> and of a right angle,
                    that is, between 27' and 32' 55"∙7. The Egyptians, by observing the time which
                    the Sun takes to rise above the horizon, found it to be between a 750th and a
                    700th part of a circumference, that is, between 28 ’ 48" and 30' 51"∙5.
                    Aristarchus of Samos supposed it to be 30 ’. The precision of modern
                    observations shows that the apparent diameter is greatest about the time of the
                    winter solstice, and least about the summer solstice; but there is some
                    discrepancy among the results of different astronomers with respect to its
                    actual magnitude. According to Lalande, the greatest apparent diameter, about
                    the end of December, is 32' 35"∙5; the least, about the end of June, 31' 30"∙5.
                    According to the tables of Delambre, its greatest value is 32' 35"∙6, and its
                    least 31'31"; the mean apparent diameter, or the diameter at the sun’s mean
                    distance, is equal to 32' 2"∙9.</p>
                <p>From these remarks it is obvious, that if the orbit of the sun be a circle, the
                    earth is not situated in the centre of that circle, otherwise the distance of
                    the sun from the earth would remain always the same, which is contrary to fact.
                    It is possible, however, that the variation in his angular velocity may not be
                    <hi rend="italic">real,</hi> but only apparent. Thus, in fig. 15, let AMPN be
                    the orbit of the sun, C the centre of that orbit, and E the position of the
                    earth at some distance from the centre. It is obvious that P is the sun’s
                    perigee, and A his apogee. Now, as the sun’s apparent orbit is a circle having
                    the earth in its centre, it is evident that this orbit must be αMpN, and that
                    the angular motion of the sun will be measured upon that circle. Suppose now
                    that the sun in his apogee moves from A to A', it is obvious that his apparent
                    or angular motion will be the segment <hi rend="italic">a</hi> α' of the
                    apparent orbit, considerably smaller than AA'; so that at the apogee the angular
                    motion of the sun will be less than his real motion. Again, let the sun in his
                    perigee move from P to P, describing a segment préciser ly equal to the segment
                    A A'. This segment, as seen from the earth, will be referred to <hi
                    rend="italic">ppt,</hi> which in that case will be the sun’s angular motion,
                    evidently considerably greater than his real motion.</p>
                <p>Hence it is obvious, that even on the supposition that the sun moved equably in
                    his orbit, his angular motion as seen from the earth would still vary, that is,
                    would be smallest at the apogee and greatest at the perigee, and that the
                    angular and real motion would only coincide in the points Μ and N, where the
                    real and apparent orbits intersect each other. From the figure, it is obvious
                    also that the angular velocity would increase gradually from the apogee to the
                    perigee, and diminish gradually from the perigee to the apogee, which likewise
                    corresponds with observation.</p>
                <p>But if the variation in the angular motion of the sun were owing alone to the
                    eccentric position of the earth within the solar orbit, it is easy to
                    demonstrate that in that case the diminution of his angular velocity would
                    follow the same ratio as the diminution of his diameter. The fact however is,
                    that the angular velocity diminishes in a ratio twice as great as the diameter
                    of the sun does. The variation of the angular velocity cannot then be owing to
                    the eccentricity alone. Hence it follows that the variation of the motion of the
                    sun is not merely apparent, but real, and that its velocity in its orbit
                    actually diminishes as his distance from the earth increases. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Twq</hi> causes, then, combine to produce the variation in the
                    sun’s angular velocity; namely, 1. the increase and diminution of his distance
                    from the earth, and, 2. the real increase and diminution of his velocity in
                    proportion to this variation of distance. These two causes combine in such a
                    manner that the daily angular motion of the sun diminishes as the square of his
                    distance increases, so that the product of the angular velocity multiplied into
                    the square of the distance is a constant quantity.</p>
                <p>The observation, that the sun’s angular motion in his orbit is inversely
                    proportional to the square of his distance from the earth, is due to Kepler. The
                    discovery was made by a careful comparison of the sun’s diurnal motion with his
                    apparent diameter, which is inversely proportional to his distance from the
                    earth. Let ASB (fig. 16) be the sun’s orbit, E the earth, and S' the sun.
                    Suppose a line ES joining the centres of the earth and sun to move round along
                    with the sun. It is obvious that when S moves to S', ES, moving along with it,
                    is now in the situation ES', having described the small sector SES'. In the same
                    time that S performs one revolution in its orbit, the radius vector ES will
                    describe the whole area ABS inclosed within the sun’s orbit. Let ŞŞ' be the
                    sun’s angular motion during one day. It is evident that the small sector SES' is
                    proportional to the square of ES, multiplied by SS'; for the radius vector is
                    the sun’s distance from the earth, and SS' his angular motion. Hence this
                    sector: is a constant quantity, whatever the angular motion of the! sun be; and
                    the whole area SEA increases as the number ļ of days which the sun takes in
                    moving from S to A., Hence results that remarkable law, first pointed out by
                    Kepler, that <hi rend="italic">the areas described by the radius vector are
                    proportional to the times of</hi><hi rend="italic">descriptiori.</hi> Suppose
                    the sun to describe SS' in one day, and SA in twenty days; then <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193105571" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5571-0770"/>the area SES' is to the area
                    SEA as 1 to 20, or the area SEA is 20 times greater than the area SES'.</p>
                <p>The knowledge of these facts enables us to draw upon paper, from day to day,
                    lines proportional to the length of the radius vector of the solar orbit, and
                    having the same relative position. If we join the extremity of these lines, by
                    making a curve pass through them, we shall perceive that this curve is not
                    exactly circular. Let E (fig. 17) represent the earth, and E <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> E <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> E c, E <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> E <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> &amp;c. the position and length of the radius vector
                    during every day of the year; if we join together the points <hi rend="italic"
                    >a, b, c, cl, e, f g, It, i, k, l, m, n, o,</hi> by drawing the curve <hi
                    rend="italic">aeim</hi> through them, it is obvious that this curve is not a
                    circle, but elongated towards <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >i,</hi> the points which represent the sun’s greatest and least distance from
                    the earth. The resemblance of this curve to the ellipse induced Kepler to
                    compare them together; and he ascertained their identity, and thus proved that
                    the orbit of the sun is an <hi rend="italic">ellipse,</hi> having the earth in
                    one of its foci.</p>
                <p>Having arrived at the knowledge of the true nature of the sun’s orbit, it becomes
                    necessary, in the next place, to determine its position on the plane of the
                    ecliptic, that is, to assign the position of the transverse axis, or line of the
                    apsides, with reference to some other straight line given by position on that
                    plane. The line which it is most convenient to assume for this purpose is the
                    line of the equinoxes; and the position of the apsides may be determined from
                    observations of the time which the sun occupies in performing a semi-revolution,
                    counting from different points of his orbit. Thus, if among the observations of
                    the sun’s longitude made daily during the course of a year, we compare, two and
                    two, all those which are diametrically opposite, or which differ by 180°, it
                    will be found that the interval between them will be somewhat less than half a
                    year, if the sun, during that interval, has passed through his perigee, or
                    longer if he has passed through his apogee; and that the time between the two
                    observations will differ less from half the time of a whole revolution, in
                    proportion as the sun’s place, at the time of the two observations, was nearer
                    to the apsides. If the difference of time between the two observations is
                    exactly half a year, then the place of the apsides would be obtained at once,
                    because the sun must have been in those points when the observations were made.
                    The probability is, however, infinitely small, that this can ever happen
                    exactly; but as the position of the apsides is known very nearly from the
                    diurnal observations of the variation of the sun’s angular velocity, the
                    necesssary corrections can easily be supplied by computation.</p>
                <p>From the comparison of observations made in different ages, it appears that the
                    position of the apsides is not fixed on the plane of the ecliptic, but that the
                    greater axis of the solar ellipse revolves in the direction of the sun’s annual
                    motion. The observations of Hipparchus, compared with those of the present
                    times, show that the apsides have a direct motion at the rate of 65" in a year.
                    According to the observations of Walther, the longitude of the apogee in 1496
                    was 93° 57' 57"; and according to Lacaille, the same element in 1750 was 98° 37'
                    28"; whence, dividing the difference by 254, the interval between the two
                    epochs, the annual motion of the line of the apsides amounts to 66". Delambre
                    found, by the comparison of a great number of modern observations, that the
                    annual motion is 6l"∙95 a year. The theory of attraction, which, in respect of
                    such slow and minute variations, must be considered as giving more accurate
                    results than can be obtained directly by observation, gives 61"∙9 for the yearly
                    progressive motion of the apsides.</p>
                <p>In the above determination, the position of the ap sides is referred to the line
                    of the equinoxes, and their motion compared with the sun’s tropical revolution.
                    But if we wish to determine their motion with reference to the fixed stars, it
                    is necessary to have regard to the retrograde movement of the equinoctial
                    points; for it is obvious, that if the line of the equinoxes is not fixed, the
                    displacement of the apsides with respect to the stars will be increased or
                    diminished by the whole amount of its motion, according as the two motions are
                    in the same or opposite directions. Now the motion of the line of the apsides is
                    direct, and has just been stated to amount to 61"∙9 in a solar year; that of the
                    equinoxes is, on the contrary, retrograde, and amounts to 50"∙1 in the same
                    time. Hence the displacement of the apsides, with reference to a star or fixed
                    point in the ecliptic, is 61"∙9 — 50"∙1 = 11"∙8 a year, in the direction of the
                    sun’s annual motion. The time, therefore, in which the solar perigee completes a
                    revolution in the <hi rend="subscript"> κ</hi> κ ∙ 360°</p>
                <p>heavens, or returns to the same star, is τ-—, equal near- 11"∙8</p>
                <p>ly to 110,000 years.</p>
                <p>Since the greater axis of the solar ellipse has a progressive motion on the plane
                    of the ecliptic, it forms a variable angle with the line of the equinoxes, and
                    at distant epochs will coincide with that line, or be perpendicular to it. The
                    epochs at which these phenomena happen may be easily found by simple
                    proportions, when the longitude of the perigee at any given time, and its annual
                    motion, are known. According to the observations of Lacaille, already quoted,
                    the longitude of the perigee in 1750 was 278° 37' 28"; but when the longitude of
                    the perigee was 270°, the greater axis of the solar ellipse must have been
                    perpendicular to the line of the equinoxes. The difference of these two
                    longitudes is 8° 37' 28", and the number of years requisite to describe that
                    arc, at the rate of 61"∙9 8° 37' 28"</p>
                <p>annually,is—- <hi rend="subscript"> q</hi> — = 500 years nearly; whence the</p>
                <p>O JL V</p>
                <p>major axis was perpendicular to the line of the equinoxes in the year 1250, when
                    the perigee of the orbit coincided with the winter solstice.</p>
                <p>Suppose it were required to assign the epoch at which the major axis coincided
                    with the line of the equinoxes. At the occurrence of this phenomenon the
                    longitude of the perigee was 180°, consequents from that time to 1750 the
                    perigee had advanced 278° 37'28"-180° = 98° 37'28".</p>
                <p>98° 37' 28"</p>
                <p>Now —— = 5735; therefore 5735 is the number</p>
                <p>61"∙9</p>
                <p>of years intervening between the occurrence of the phenomenon and 1750. Hence
                    about 4000 years before the commencement of our era, the transverse axis of the
                    solar orbit coincided with the line of the equinoxes; and it is a singular
                    coincidence that this epoch is considered by chronologists to be that of the
                    beginning of the world, or, to speak more correctly, of the first traces of the
                    existence of the human race; for numerous physical circumstances attest that the
                    earth itself has existed during an infinitely longer period. The same phenomenon
                    will again occur when the longitude of the perigee shall have reached 360°, or
                    become zero; and by calculating as above, this will be found to take place in
                    the year 6485 of our era. The solar perigee will then coincide with the vernal
                    equinox; in the former case it coincided with that of autumn.</p>
                <p>By reason of the progressive motion of the perigee, the i length of the seasons
                    is continually varying. Let AP (figs.i 18, 19, 20) represent the line of the
                    apsides, S and W the summer and winter solstices, V and O the vernal and
                    autumnal equinoxes. When the greater axis was perpendicular to the line of the
                    equinoxes, as happened in the year 1250 of our era, the perigee P (fig. 18)
                    coincided <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105584" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5584-0771"/>with
                    W the winter solstice; and on that account the time between the autumnal equinox
                    0, and the winter solstice W, was equal to the time between W and V, or between
                    the winter solstice and the vernal equinox. But in this position the equator,
                    which is here represented by VO, divides the ellipse into two unequal portions,
                    the smaller of which must be described in less time than the greater, because
                    the times of description are proportional to the spaces passed over. The summer
                    was therefore, at that time, longer than the winter, and both were divided into
                    equal parts by the solstices. In any other position the seasons differ in length
                    from each other. In the time of Hipparchus, the longitude of the perigee was
                    less than in 1750 by 32° ∙292, or was 246° ∙330. The position of the ellipse
                    with regard to the equinoxes was therefore such as is represented in fig. 19,
                    the angle PEW being 270° — 246° ∙33 = 23° 40' 12". The interval between V and S
                    was then 94⅜ days, and that between S and 0 only 92∣ days. The spring was
                    therefore at that time longer than the summer, and the winter longer than the
                    autumn. The position of the ellipse in 1800 is represented in fig. 20. The angle
                    PEW was then 9° 29', and the following were nearly the lengths of the seasons

                <p>The spring is therefore at present shorter than the summer, and the autumn longer
                    than the winter.</p>
                <p>After describing the position of the transverse axis of the solar ellipse on the
                    plane of the ecliptic, we come next to consider the species of that ellipse, or
                    its eccentricity, on which depend the apparent inequalities of the sun’s angular
                    motion. It is evident that this element will be made known if we can by any
                    means determine the ratio of the two segments into which the major axis is
                    divided by the focus. This ratio might seem to be obtainable without any
                    difficulty by comparing the sun’s apparent diameters at the perigee and apogee,
                    to which the distances are inversely proportional; but such observations, on
                    account of the irradiation and other difficulties, are liable to considerable
                    uncertainty: it is therefore necessary to have recourse to other methods of
                    estimating the eccentricity, and the variations to which it is subject. These
                    methods are derived from the fundamental law of the elliptic motion, namely, the
                    proportionality of the areas described by the radius vector to the times of
                    description, by which the inequalities of motion and the ellipticity pf the
                    orbit are connected with each other; so that when the inequalities are made
                    known by direct observation, the species of the ellipse can be computed from the
                    principles of geometry. It will, however, be necessary to attend more closely
                    than we have yet done to the phenomena resulting from the eccentric position of
                    the earth in the sun’s orbit, and to explain some terms technically employed by
                    astronomers to abbreviate and simplify their descriptions.</p>
                <p>The sun’s motion may be regarded as composed of two distinct parts, namely, a
                    circular uniform motion, which constitutes the principal part of it; and a
                    correction depending on the deviation of the orbit from a circle, which modifies
                    the first, and alternately accelerates and retards the mean angular velocity. To
                    illustrate this, let E (fig. 21) be the earth, PSA the orbit of the sun, AP the
                    line of the apsides, and «γ» <hi rend="smallcaps">λ</hi> the intersection of the
                    plane of the orbit∙with that of the equator. While the true sun S moves round
                    his elliptic orbit, describing areas proportional to the times, conceive a
                    fictitious sun $ to move round the earth in the circumference of a circle of
                    which the radius is equal to EP the sun’s distance at the perigee, and with a
                    uniform motion such, that if the two suns set out at the same instant from P,
                    they may also return to the same point together, after having completed each a
                    revolution. At the perigee the radius vector of the real sun is a minimum; his
                    velocity is consequently a maximum, and he therefore advances before the
                    fictitious sun. But his motion relaxes in proportion as his distance from P
                    becomes greater; and at a certain point S of the orbit it becomes equal to
                    that*of the fictitious sun, which has then only reached the point s. After
                    passing the point S, the angular distance SEs continues to diminish on account
                    that the motion of the real sun continues to relax, and it vanishes altogether
                    when he reaches his apogee at A, the fictitious sun arriving at <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> in the same straight line with A and E at the same instant
                    of time. From the apogee to the perigee the phenomena are reversed. The motion
                    of the real sun being then the slowest possible, he at first falls behind the
                    fictitious sun; but his motion continuing to be gradually accelerated, he has
                    again acquired the same velocity when he reaches S', after which his motion is
                    more rapid than that of the fictitious sun, which he at last overtakes at P. If,
                    therefore, we conceive a radius vector to be drawn from the earth to each of the
                    two suns, those lines will form with each other a variable angle, having its
                    maximum value when the velocities are equal, and vanishing at the perigee and
                    apogee. This angle, namely, SEs, is called the <hi rend="italic">Equation of the
                    Centre,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Equation of the Orbit.</hi> It is the
                    correction necessary to be made to the longitude of the sun deduced from his
                    equable motion, in order to have his real longitude. Those quantities which form
                    the difference between the true and mean results are,-in astronomy, denominated
                    equations. The ancients employed the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prosthaphaeresis</hi> in the same sense.</p>
                <p>From the perigee to the apogee, the true longitude of the sun is found by adding
                    the equation of the centre to the mean longitude, and in the other half of the
                    orbit by taking the difference of the same quantities. The equation of the
                    centre is a maximum when the sun is at the points S and S', or when the mean and
                    true motions are equal; and if its value can be obtained from observation at
                    those times, the eccentricity of the orbit may be deduced by means of the
                    geometrical properties of the ellipse. Now the points S and S' may be found very
                    nearly by observing when the diurnal velocity of the sun is equal to the mean
                    motion, or to 0∙985647 parts of a degree. By these observations the angle SES',
                    which is the difference of the real longitudes of the sun, or of his distances
                    from tγ&gt;, will be given. But $ E √ is also given; for it is the angle which
                    would be described by the sun, in virtue of his mean motion, during the interval
                    between the two observations. Hence the difference between sE√ and SES' is
                    given, being equal to twice SEs the maximum equation of the centre, in
                    consequence of the symmetrical position of the points S and S', and also of $
                    and √, in respect of the line of the apsides AP. The accuracy of a result
                    obtained in this manner may appear questionable, on account of the impossibility
                    of determining by observation the exact moment at which the sun’s true motion in
                    longitude is equal to his mean motion; but as the real motion varies very little
                    during a few days before and after that epoch, the equation of the centre will
                    be scarcely affected by a slight error in the time. Besides, any error in the
                    result is corrected by taking the mean of a great number of similar
                    observations.</p>

                <p>By a comparison of numerous observations of this kind, Delambre found that the
                    greatest equation of the centre, in the year 1776, amounted to 1° ∙9254, or 1°
                    55' 31"∙4. In 1801 the same equation was 1° 55' 27"∙ 3. (See Baily’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Astronomical Tables,</hi> p. 66.)</p>
                <p>Having obtained the value of the greatest equation of the centre, the
                    eccentricity of the orbit may be computed from the first two terms of the
                    following series, <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> = ⅜E — 24?3 E <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> — <hi rend="subscript"> 21</hi> θ <hi

                <p>in which e represents the eccentricity, and E the greatest equation of the
                    centre. By reversing the series the following expression is found for the
                    greatest equation in terms of the eccentricity, viz.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> E = 2e</hi> +Ä <hi rend="superscript"> e3</hi> + ÄP + <hi
                    rend="superscript"> &amp;c</hi> ·</p>
                <p>For an investigation of the above formulae the reader may consult Biot, <hi
                    rend="italic">Astronomie</hi><hi rend="italic">Physique,</hi> tom. ii. p.
                    185.</p>
                <p>It has been discovered by observation, that the equation of the centre of the
                    sun’s orbit is subject to a nearly uniform secular diminution. This fact is
                    confirmed by theory, from which also the secular diminution has been assigned.
                    It amounts to 8° ∙0047 in a century. This phenomenon implies a corresponding
                    diminution of the eccentricity of the solar orbit amounting to ∙000037495 in the
                    same time, the semiaxis major being unit. This will be conceived more distinctly
                    by converting the above fraction into some familiar expression of linear
                    magnitude. Supposing the mean distance of the sun to be 96,000,000 of miles, the
                    fraction ∙000037495 will represent nearly 3700 miles, so that the annual
                    diminution of the eccentricity is nearly at the rate of 37 miles,—a line which
                    is considerable on the surface of the earth, but which has scarcely an
                    appreciable ratio to the immense distance of the sun. If, however, this
                    diminution, small as it is, were to be continued indefinitely, the eccentricity
                    would ultimately vanish, and the sun’s orbit would be changed into a circle; but
                    the theory of universal gravitation proves that, like all the other variations
                    of the elements of the solar system, the variation of the eccentricity is
                    subject to periodic laws. After having continued during a certain time to
                    diminish, the eccentricity will again begin to increase, and will successively
                    pass through all its former values. Thus it will continue to oscillate within
                    certain limits, of which the extent, though not precisely known, cannot be very
                    great: and the solar orbit will eternally preserve its elliptic form, unless the
                    application of some external force shall derange the system of the world, or
                    modify the laws by which it is at present governed.</p>
                <p>The true nature of the solar orbit being known, together with its situation on
                    the plane of the ecliptic, and the amount of its eccentricity, as also the time
                    of a revolution, the sun’s longitude may be determined at any assigned epoch.
                    This determination is what is usually termed <hi rend="italic">Keplers
                    Problem,</hi> having been first proposed by that great astronomer on the
                    hypothesis of an elliptic orbit. Its solution, which is not susceptible of being
                    exhibited under a finite form, is derived from the principle of the equable
                    description of areas. Let ASP (fig. 22) represent the semi-orbit of the sun, C
                    the centre of the orbit, E the focus occupied by the earth, and let the time and
                    motion be counted from the perigee P. On AP describe a semicircle, on the
                    circumference of which let a point Μ be supposed to move uniformly, and to
                    describe the semicircle PMA, in the same time in which the sun describes the
                    semi-ellipse PSA. Now, suppose that at the end of a given time <hi rend="italic"
                    >t,</hi> the sun has moved from P to S; then, denoting by T the time of a
                    complete revolution, and putting π for the semi-circumference, the place of Μ,
                    at the end of the same time <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> will be given by the
                    equation PM = ∙ψ 2 or. Through S let a perpendicular be drawn to AP, meeting the
                    semicircle in D and AP in N, and join EM, ES, ED, CM, and CD. The different
                    angles of this figure have received certain technical names, which it is
                    necessary to explain. The angle PES, which is the <hi rend="italic">true</hi>
                    longitude of the sun, is called the <hi rend="italic">True Anomaly·</hi> PEM is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Mean Anomaly,</hi> and PCD is denominated the <hi
                    rend="italic">Eccentric Anomaly.</hi> This last is measured by the arc PMD,
                    which is the perigean distance of a star describing a circle circumscribed about
                    the solar ellipse, and having constantly the same absciss PN as the sun. The
                    word <hi rend="italic">anomaly</hi> originally signified <hi rend="italic"
                    >inequality</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> it now simply designates the angular
                    distance of a planet from its perihelion, seen from the sun, or, as in the
                    present case, the angular distance of the sun from his perigee.</p>
                <p>According to the law of the equable description of areas, we have the sector PCM
                    to PES as the surface of the semicircle to the surface of the semi-ellipse; that
                    is, as the semi-transverse to the semi-conjugate axis, or as ND to NS, according
                    to a well-known property of the ellipse. Hence PCM: PES:: PED: PES, and
                    therefore PCM = PED = PCD — ECD. Now, if we express the arc PM by <hi
                    rend="italic">z,</hi> PD by <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> the eccentricity EC by <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> and make the radius equal to unity, we shall have the
                    sector PCM = <hi rend="italic">±z,</hi> the sector PCD = <hi rend="italic"
                    >⅛x,</hi> and the triangle ECD = ļe. DN = <hi rend="italic">⅜e</hi> sin. <hi
                    rend="italic">x.</hi> Substituting, therefore, these expressions in the above
                    equation, it will become, on multiplying both sides of it by 2,</p>
                <p>Z = a? — <hi rend="italic">e</hi> sin. <hi rend="italic">X...............</hi>

                <p>The form of the sun’s orbit is discovered from the variations of his apparent

                    knowledge of its real dimensions, or of the mean distance of the sun from the
                    earth, it is necessary to determine his parallax, that is to say, the angle
                    subtended by the earth’s semidiameter as seen from the sun. This angle is too
                    small to be measured directly in the manner which was pointed out when treating
                    of parallax; it is most accurately deduced from observations of the time
                    occupied by an inferior planet in passing over the sun’s disk, as will be
                    explained afterwards. From such observations it has been found to be less than
                    9", an angle of which the sine is to radius in the ratio of 1 to 23,000 nearly;
                    whence the distance of the sun is about 23,000 times the semidiameter of the
                    earth. The following table exhibits more accurately the numerical results of

                <p>When the sun’s parallax is known, we are enabled not only to estimate his
                    distance, but also to compare his diameter and magnitude with those of the
                    earth. For example, the mean parallax of the sun is 8"∙56; his mean apparent
                    semidiameter, seen from the earth, is 961"*4; the semidiameter of the sun and
                    earth are therefore to each other in the ratio of 961∙4: 8∙56, or of 112 to
                    unity nearly. Supposing the sun and earth to be both spherical bodies, which is
                    a supposition sufficiently accurate for the present purpose, their volumes will
                    be to one another as the cubes of their radii; hence the volume of the sun is to
                    that of the earth as the cube of 112 to unity, or the sun’s volume is about
                    1,300,000 times greater than that of the earth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Motion of
                    Translation of die Earth, and the Aberration of Light.</hi></p>
                <p>Hitherto we have regarded the sun as being actually in motion round the earth in
                    an elliptic orbit, of which the earth occupies one of the foci. This supposes
                    the motion which we observe to be real. But we have already seen that all the
                    phenomena of the diurnal revolution of the celestial bodies may be equally well
                    explained by supposing these motions to be only optical illusions, of the same
                    nature as those by which a person sailing rapidly along a river, or the
                    sea-shore, is almost irresistibly led to ascribe the motion to the banks on the
                    shore, even when fully aware that <hi rend="subscript"> k</hi> the appearance is
                    only occasioned by his own motion in a contrary direction. In the same manner
                    all the phenomena of the annual motion are susceptible of an equally simple
                    explanation, on the hypothesis that the earth revolves in an elliptic orbit, and
                    that the sun is at rest in one of the foci of the ellipse. In fact, if there
                    were no other bodies in the universe than the earth and the sun, it would be
                    matter of absolute indifference which of the two hypotheses we should adopt in
                    order to explain the appearances. Supposing, for example, the earth to revolve
                    in a circular orbit (the eccentricity, on account of its smallness, being here
                    neglected), and the sun to be placed at the centre; a spectator at E (fig. 23)
                    sees the sun S in the heavens at the point A, and corresponding to the star <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> on the celestial sphere. If the earth now take the place of
                    the sun, and the sun be placed on the curve at A, the spectator will still see
                    the sun correspond to the star <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Let the earth be
                    transferred from E to E ’; the spectator will then see the sun in A'. The sun
                    therefore appears to him to have moved from A to A', which is exactly the same
                    appearance as would be presented to a spectator at the centre by a real
                    translation of S from A to A'; so that, in respect of the annual motion, the
                    appearances, when referred to the celestial sphere, are precisely the same on
                    either hypothesis.</p>
                <p>If we now consider the phenomena with reference to the earth, we shall find that
                    they may be all equally well explained on the hypothesis of the earth’s motion,
                    and the immobility of the sun. The most remarkable phenomenon connected with the
                    annual revolution is the variation of the seasons; and’in order to explain their
                    cause, it is only necessary to suppose that the earth, in describing its oblique
                    orbit, always preserves its axis parallel to the same straight line. Let A, B,
                    C, D (fig. 24) repre<pb break="no" facs="nls:193105623"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5623-0774"/>sent the earth in four different positions of its
                    orbit, <hi rend="italic">n s</hi> being its axis, and <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    and s its north and south poles respectively. While the earth goes round the sun
                    in the order of the letters A, B, C, D, its axis <hi rend="italic">ns</hi>
                    preserves its obliquity, and always continues parallel to its first direction.
                    At A the north pole inclines towards the sun, and brings all the northern places
                    more into the light than at any other season of the year. But when the earth is
                    at C, the opposite point of the orbit, the north pole declines from the sun, and
                    a less portion of the northern hemisphere enjoys the blessings of his light and
                    heat. At B and D the axis is perpendicular to the plane of the orbit, so that
                    the poles are situated in the boundaries of the illuminated hemisphere, and the
                    sun, being directly over the equator, makes the days and nights equal at all
                    places. These phenomena are illustrated in fig. 25, which represents the
                    situation of the north pole with regard to the limits of illumination, in eight
                    different positions of the orbit. In this figure, AE is the terrestrial equator,
                    T the tropic of Cancer, the dotted circle the parallel of London, U the arctic
                    or north polar circle, and P the north pole, where all the meridians or
                    hour-circles meet. The spectator is supposed to be placed at the pole of the
                    ecliptic.</p>
                <p>WTιen the earth is at the beginning of Libra, about the 20th of March, the sun,
                    as seen from the earth, appears at the beginning of Aries in the opposite part
                    of the heavens, the north pole is just coming into light, and the sun is
                    vertical to the equator, which, with all its parallels, is divided into two
                    equal parts by the circle which forms the boundary between the dark and
                    illuminated hemispheres, and therefore the days and nights are equal all over
                    the earth. As the earth moves in the ecliptic according to the order of the
                    letters A, B, C, D, &amp;c., the north pole P comes more and more into the
                    light, and the days increase in length at all places north of the equator AE.
                    When the earth comes to the position between B and C, or the beginning of
                    Capricon, the sun, as seen from the earth, appears at the beginning of Cancer,
                    about the 21st of June; and the north pole of the earth inclines towards the
                    sun, so as to bring into light all the north frigid zone, and more of each of
                    the northern parallels of latitude in proportion as they are farther from the
                    equator. As the earth advances from Capricon towards Aries, and the sun appears
                    to move from Cancer towards Libra, the north pole recedes from the light, which
                    causes the days to decrease and the nights to increase in length, till the earth
                    comes to the beginning of Aries, and then they are equal as before; the boundary
                    of light and darkness cutting the equator and all its parallels equally. The
                    north pole then goes into the dark, and does not emerge till the earth has
                    completed a semi-revolution of its orbit, or from the 23d of September till the
                    20th of March. All these phenomena will be readily understood from the bare
                    inspection of the figure; and it will be perceived that what has been said of
                    the northern hemisphere is equally true of the southern in a contrary sense,
                    that is, at opposite seasons of the year.</p>
                <p>The only objection against the annual motion of the earth, which at first sight
                    creates some difficulty, is the enormous distance which, on account of the want
                    of annual parallax, that hypothesis makes it necessary to assign to the fixed
                    stars. Abstracting from the precession, which in the region of the poles amounts
                    only to about 20", the axis of the earth, in every part of its orbit, appears to
                    be directed towards the same point of the starry sphere. It is certain, however,
                    that the radius of the terrestrial orbit is upwards of 90 millions of miles; and
                    therefore, when the earth is at opposite points of this immense circle, its pole
                    ought to be directed to points in the heavens 18Q millions of miles distant from
                    each other. Suppose the sun to be at rest in S (fig. 26), the centre of the
                    orbit EαZ&gt;, and the earth to be at the point E. Suppose also A to be the
                    projection of S on the sphere of the fixed stars, and w the first point of the
                    ecliptic. The longitude of A, as seen from E, is the angle AEɤ; but when seen
                    from S, the longitude of the same point is ASɤ∙ This last is the <hi
                    rend="italic">true</hi> longitude of A; Aew is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >apparent</hi> longitude, and their difference is the angle Sɤ E. Now, in the
                    first half of the ecliptic, the apparent longitude will be less than the true,
                    and in the second half greater; hence there ought to result an apparent annual
                    inequality in the sun’s longitude. But as no such inequality is indicated by
                    observation, it becomes necessary either to abandon the hypothesis of the
                    earth’s motion, or to suppose the distance of the fixed stars to be so great,
                    that, in comparison of it, the radius ES, which exceeds 90 millions of miles, is
                    altogether insensible; and that the whole orbit of the earth, or the ellipse
                    E«ô, is a mere point in comparison of a great circle of the starry sphere.</p>
                <p>The most convincing proof of the earth’s motion is not to be found in any
                    circumstance of which the senses can take immediate cognizance, but is afforded
                    by the full development of the planetary system, and the mutual connection of
                    all the truths of rational astronomy,—by the clearness, simplicity, and
                    coherence which this hypothesis gives to the most complicated phenomena,—and can
                    therefore only be fully appreciated after an attentive study of the whole series
                    of facts which astronomy makes known. There exists, however, one direct proof of
                    the earth’s annual motion, in a phenomenon discovered by the accurate
                    observation and patient sagacity of Bradley, although it is one which, we are
                    almost tempted to think, ought to have been perceived <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori,</hi> after Roemer’s discovery of the progressive motion of light. It is
                    known by the name of the <hi rend="italic">Aberration of Light,</hi> and is
                    manifested in a small dif-∙ ference between the apparent and true places of a
                    star,' occasioned by the motion of light combined with that of the earth in its
                    orbit.</p>
                <p>To illustrate this effect, conceive a body to move in the direction EE' (fig.
                    27), and another to impinge on it in the direction SE. To find the direction of
                    the resulting motion, take EC and EA proportional to the two velocities
                    respectively, and, having completed the parallelogram EABC, draw the diagonal
                    EB. The combination of the two motions produces an impression on the eye exactly
                    similar to that which would have been produced if the eye had remained at rest
                    in the point E, and the molecule of light had come to it in the direction ES';
                    the star, therefore, whose real place is at S, will appear to the spectator at E
                    to be situated at S'. The difference between its true and apparent place, that
                    is, the angle SES', is the <hi rend="italic">aberration,</hi> the magnitude of
                    which is obtained from the known ratio of EA to Efe, or the velocity of light to
                    that of the earth in its orbit. Now, we know from the phenomena of the eclipses
                    of Jupiter’s satellites, that a ray of light describes a line equal to the mean
                    radius of the ecliptic in 8 min. 13∙2 sec. or 493∙2 seconds of time. But the arc
                    described by the earth in that time is found from the proportion</p>
                <p>365 <hi rend="superscript"> d</hi> ∙256: 493≡∙2:: 360°: <hi rend="italic">x,</hi>
                    whence <hi rend="italic">x</hi> = 20''∙25. It is evident, therefore, that when
                    the directions of the two motions are at right angles, the star S always appears
                    in advance of its real place, in a direction parallel to that of the motion of
                    the earth, by a quantity equal to 20"∙25. This quantity, 20"∙25, is called the
                    <hi rend="italic">Constant of Aberration</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but as it
                    has been obtained on the assumption that the earth moves uniformly in a circular
                    orbit, it is evidently not altogether exact, and recourse <pb break="no"

                    to determine its precise •amount. Bradley supposed it to be 20"; Dr Brinkley,
                    from the mean of 2633 comparisons of various stars, has deduced the value
                    20"∙37. From a series of 2000 observations of circumpolar stars, made for the
                    purpose with the utmost care at the Greenwich Observatory by Mr Richardson, its
                    value was found to be 20"∙302. On account of the number and accuracy of these
                    observations, the constant of aberration may be regarded as one of the best
                    determined elements of astronomy. (See <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the
                    Astronomical Society,</hi> vol. iv.)</p>
                <p>It is easy to see that, on the same principles, there ought also to be a diurnal
                    aberration; but the diurnal rotation of the earth being sixty-five times less
                    rapid than the orbital motion, its effect in producing aberration does not
                    amount to more than 0 <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> ∙0208, when reduced to
                    seconds of time. It is consequently altogether insensible in the
                    observations.</p>
                <p>The magnitude of the angle of deviation SES' depends on the relative directions
                    of the earth and the visual ray, and may have any value from 0 to 20"∙3.
                    Suppose, for example, we observe a star situated in the plane of the ecliptic.
                    When the earth is at that point of its orbit, between the sun and the star,
                    where the tangent to the orbit is perpendicular to the visual ray (which, on
                    account that the star has no sensible parallax, always maintains a parallel
                    direction), the apparent place of the star will be 20 ’ '∙3 to the eastward of
                    its true place. When the earth is in the opposite point of its orbit the same
                    star will appear to be 20"∙3 to the westward of its true place; so that it will
                    appear to have an oscillatory motion on the ecliptic, the range of which is
                    4O"∙6, and the period exactly a year. Half-way between these two points the
                    tangent of the orbit is parallel to the direction of the ray of light, and
                    consequently there is no aberration. When the star is not situated in the
                    ecliptic, it will suffer a displacement in latitude as well as in longitude. To
                    render this still more sensible, let EEE (fig. 28) be the ecliptic, E the earth,
                    and A the true place of a star situated at any altitude above the ecliptic. In
                    the direction EA take Eα to represent the velocity of light, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab</hi> that of the earth, and in a parallel direction, that is, parallel to
                    the tangent to the ecliptic at E; the line Eó will now be the apparent visual
                    ray, and the star will seem to be situated at B. Suppose the earth to be placed
                    at different points of its orbit; the lines Eα will be all parallel to each
                    other on account of the infinite distance of the star A; the lines <hi
                    rend="italic">ab</hi> will vary little in magnitude, because they are very small
                    in comparison of <hi rend="italic">Ea,</hi> but their directions will undergo
                    every possible change, being always parallel to the tangent at E. At the two
                    points of the orbit where the tangent is parallel to E A, the two lines Eα and
                    <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> coincide, and consequently there is no aberration. Let
                    us next suppose the star to be situated in the pole of the ecliptic. In this
                    case the visual ray is constantly perpendicular to the direction of the earth’s
                    motion, so that the star will always appear at a distance of 20"∙3 from its true
                    place, or appear to describe a small circle about the pole of the ecliptic. In
                    all other situations, out of the ecliptic, the star’s apparent path will be an
                    ellipse, the major axis of which, parallel to the plane of the ecliptic, is
                    always 4O"∙6, while the minor axis varies with the latitude.</p>
                <p>• The cause of the aberration being known, we have two methods of measuring its
                    quantity, or the extent of the apparent oscillations, viz. by calculating the
                    angle of deviation SAS' (fig. 27), the tangent of which is to radius as AB to
                    AE, that is, as 1 to 10313; or, by direct observation, when the star is in
                    opposition to the sun. The two methods give exactly the same result, and the
                    dimensions of the ellipse described by any star not situated in the ecliptic, in
                    consequence of the aberration, are found to be the same when computed from
                    theory or determined by direct observation. The motion of translation of the
                    earth, therefore, receives a mathematical demonstration from this agreement; and
                    the phenomenon of the aberration, otherwise unimportant on account of its
                    minuteness, thus becomes one of the most interesting discoveries ever made in
                    astronomy. The fact of the earth’s orbital motion is, however, rendered so
                    probable by other phenomena, that it must have been universally admitted,
                    although the direct proof had never been discovered.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Measure of Time.
                    Equation of Time.</hi></p>
                <p>The notion of time, or of succession, is generally said to be acquired from the
                    aspect of natural phenomena; but from whatever source it may be derived, it is
                    certain that time itself can only be measured by comparing it with something of
                    which the senses can take cognizance. If we have a series of events, such as the
                    oscillations of a pendulum, or the flux and reflux of the sea, uniformly
                    succeeding each other, then time may be measured by the number of such events
                    that have been observed. In like manner, if a body move uniformly in a certain
                    direction, time may be measured by the spaces over which it successively passes.
                    In strict language, motion and time, being heterogeneous quantities, cannot
                    measure one another; but different times are compared with each other by means
                    of the motions that have taken place in those times respectively; for the
                    motions being supposed uniform, equal spaces are passed over in equal times, or,
                    which is the same thing, the times are directly proportional to the spaces
                    described. If, therefore, we assume for unit the time which is absolved while a
                    certain uniform motion takes place, we may obtain, by a simple proportion, the
                    corresponding time of any other similar motion. In this manner we find the ratio
                    of one portion of time to another, although we can form no idea whatever of its
                    absolute quantity.</p>
                <p>In order that motion may be employed as a measure of time, it is indispensably
                    requisite that it be perfectly uniform. The only motions having this property,
                    with which we are acquainted, are those of the rotation of the celestial bodies
                    about their own axes. The motion of the sun and planets in their orbits is
                    irregular from various causes: even the successive returns of the fixed stars to
                    the meridian are rendered unequal on account of the precession and nutation; but
                    the diurnal rotation of the earth <hi rend="underline">ap-</hi> peaiŝ to be.
                    affected by no cause of irregularity whatever. Time, therefore, may be properly
                    measured by this uniform motion; and the method of proceeding is as follows. The
                    culmination of a star, or of a given point of the equator, marks the instant at
                    which the day commences, and at any other instant its horary angle determines
                    the portion of the day which has elapsed at the moment of the observation. In
                    order, therefore, to determine the time of an observation, we must find the
                    horary angle formed by the meridian of the observed star with that which passes
                    through the given point where the motion is supposed to begin; in other words,
                    it is necessary to determine the star’s right ascension. This, however, when
                    attempted by direct measurement, is a determination attended with difficulty,
                    and liable to considerable uncertainty. Happily the invention of the pendulum
                    has rendered it unnecessary; and astronomers, instead of deducing the time from
                    the right ascensions, determine, on the contrary, the right ascensions by means
                    of the time indicated by the clock. The clock, of which the motion is supposed
                    to be perfectly regular, is adjusted in such a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193105649" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5649-0776"/>manner that its index
                    describes 24 hours, while a point of the equator describes an arc of 360°, or
                    makes a complete revolution. This is called a <hi rend="italic">sidereal
                    day.</hi> The sidereal hour is divided in the usual manner into minutes,
                    seconds, &amp;c.; whence the corresponding arcs are easily found at the rate of
                    15° to an hour. The point whose culmination marks the origin of time is
                    arbitrary; but astronomers have agreed to choose for that purpose the
                    equinoctial point of Aries, from which the right ascensions are reckoned, so
                    that the hours of the clock and the degrees of the equator may commence at the
                    same instant. This point, it is true, is not, and cannot be, permanently marked
                    by any star; but the right ascension in time of any star whatever being the hour
                    of its transit over the meridian, the star will be in the plane of the meridian
                    at the instant denoted by its right ascension in time. On this account sidereal
                    time expresses the actual right ascension of the zenith; or, as it is frequently
                    termed, <hi rend="italic">the right ascension of the mid-heaven.</hi></p>
                <p>We have already seen, that on account of the precession of the equinoxes, a star
                    employs somewhat more time than the first point of Aries in returning to the
                    meridian. It is therefore not without some violation of language that the
                    interval between two successive transits of a given point of the equator over
                    the meridian is called a <hi rend="italic">sidereal</hi> day, which, in its
                    strict acceptation, denotes the time which elapses between two successive
                    transits of the same star; but in this case the difference is so small as to be
                    totally inappreciable. The annual precession in longitude is = 50"∙1, and that
                    in right ascension is nearly the same, excepting in regard to the circumpolar
                    stars, which, therefore, are not employed in regulating the clocks. This arc of
                    50"∙l, converted into time, gives 3*3 seconds as the time in which a star will
                    pass the meridian later than the equinoctial point, at the end of the year; and
                    this small quantity being distributed over the whole year, is altogether
                    insensible in short intervals of two or three days. The successive transits of a
                    star, therefore, if we abstract from the nutation and aberration, will mark the
                    sidereal day within the hundredth part of a second of time; and the sidereal
                    year, though not immediately ascertainable by observation, becomes a quantity
                    which may be easily computed. But the regularity of the motion of the stars is
                    deranged by the effects of aberration and nutation; so that in order to measure
                    time with the precision required by modern observers, it is necessary to be
                    acquainted with the minute displacements of the stars. If they seem to return to
                    the meridian after equal portions of absolute time, it is only because our
                    organs are unable to distinguish the hundredths of a second.</p>
                <p>The sidereal day is a measure of time which, on account of its uniformity and the
                    facility of observing it, is excellently well adapted for astronomical purposes;
                    but relatively to the ordinary wants of life it is not sufficiently marked;—the
                    culmination of the stars is an event entirely unconnected with civil
                    occupations, and which, for any given star, is even invisible during a great
                    part of the year. The proper motion of the sun causes the sidereal day to
                    commence sometimes by day and sometimes by night, so that great confusion and
                    embarrassment would arise from regulating time and civil affairs by the motions
                    of the stars. On this account the diurnal revolution of the sun has been
                    universally adopted as the measure of time. This is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >civil day,</hi> and denotes the interval of time which elapses between two
                    successive transits of the sun over the same hour-circle. Most nations have
                    agreed in reckoning it from the inferior semicircle of the meridian, so that the
                    civil day commences and terminates at midnight; but astronomers, in imitation of
                    Hipparchus and Ptolemy, usually reckon the commencement of the day from the
                    instant of the sun’s culmination, that is, from noon; and count through the 24
                    hours from one noon to the following. Thus 9 o’clock in the morning of February
                    14th is by astronomers called February the 13th at 21 hours. The day thus
                    determined is called the <hi rend="italic">astronomical</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">solar day</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and being regulated by the
                    true motion of the sun, the time which is measured by it is called <hi
                    rend="italic">true</hi> or <hi rend="italic">apparent</hi> time.</p>
                <p>Astronomical or solar days are not equal. Two causes, in particular, conspire to
                    produce their inequality, namely, the unequal velocity of the sun in his orbit,
                    and the obliquity of the ecliptic. The effect of the first cause is sufficiently
                    sensible. At the summer solstice, when the sun’s motion is slowest, the
                    astronomical day approaches nearer the sidereal than at the winter solstice,
                    when his motion is most rapid.</p>
                <p>To conceive the effect of the second cause, it is necessary to have regard to the
                    motion of the sun in reference to the equator. The sun describes every day a
                    small arc of the ecliptic. Through the extremities of this arc suppose two
                    meridians to pass; the arc of the equator, which they intercept, is the sun’s
                    motion for that day referred to the equator, and the time which that arc takes
                    to pass the meridian is equal to the excess of the astronomical day above the
                    sidereal. But it is obvious that at the equinoxes the arc of the equator is
                    smaller than the corresponding are of the ecliptic, in the proportion of the
                    cosine of the obliquity of the ecliptic to radius: at the solstices, on the
                    contrary, it is greater in the proportion of radius to the cosine of the same
                    obliquity. The astronomical day is diminished in the first case, and lengthened
                    in the second.</p>
                <p>To have a mean astronomical day independent of these causes of inequality,
                    astronomers have supposed a second <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> sun to move
                    uniformly on the ecliptic, and to pass over' the extremities of the axis of the
                    sun’s orbit at the same instant with the real sun. This removes the inequality
                    arising from the inequality of the sun’s motion. To remove the inequality
                    arising from the obliquity of the ecliptic, conceive a third sun to pass through
                    the equinoxes at the same instant with the second sun, and to move along the
                    equator in such a manner that the angular distances of the two suns at the
                    vernal equinox shall be always equal. The interval between two consecutive
                    returns of this third sun to the meridian forms the <hi rend="italic">mean
                    astronomical day. Mean time</hi> is measured by the number of the returns of
                    this third sun to the meridian; and <hi rend="italic">true time</hi> is measured
                    by the number of returns of the real sun to the meridian. The arc of the
                    equator, intercepted between two meridian circles drawn through the centres of
                    the true sun and the imaginary third sun, when reduced to time, is what is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Equation of Time.</hi> This will be rendered
                    plainer by the following diagram.</p>
                <p>Let Zɤ2^ (fig. 29) be the earth; ZFRz its axis; <hi rend="italic">abcde,</hi>
                    &amp;c. the equator; ABCDE, &amp;c. the northern half of the ecliptic from ɤ to
                    =^=, on the side of the globe next the eye; and MNOP, &amp;c. the southern half
                    on the opposite side from <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> ≤⅛ to ɤ∙ Let the points
                    at A, B, C, D, E, F, &amp;c. mark off equal portions of the ecliptic, gone
                    through in equal times by the real sun, and those at <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,
                    d, e, f,</hi> &amp;c. equal portions of the equator described in equal times by
                    the fictitious sun; and let <hi rend="italic">Zɤz</hi> be the meridian.</p>
                <p>As the real sun moves obliquely in the ecliptic, and the fictitious sun directly
                    in the equator, any point between ɤ and F on the ecliptic must be nearer the
                    meridian Z ɤ <hi rend="italic">z</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> than
                    the corresponding point on the equator from ɤ to <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> that

                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5662-0777"/>more so, as the obliquity is greater; and
                    therefore the true sun comes sooner to the meridian every day whilst he is in
                    the quadrant ɤF, than the fictitious sun does in the quadrant <hi rend="italic"
                    >ɤ f</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for which reason the solar noon precedes noon
                    by the clock, until the real sun comes to F, and the fictitious to <hi

                    from the meridian, both suns will come to it precisely at noon by the clock.</p>
                <p>Whilst the real sun describes the second quadrant of the ecliptic FGHIKL from
                    Cancer to =c⅛, he comes later to the meridian every day than the fictitious sun
                    moving through the second quadrant of the equator from <hi rend="italic">f</hi>
                    to =o=; for the points at G, H, I, K, L, being farther from the meridian, their
                    corresponding points at <hi rend="italic">g, h, i, k, l,</hi> must come to it
                    later; and as both suns come at the same moment to the point W, they come to the
                    meridian at the moment of noon by the clock.</p>
                <p>In departing from Libra through the third quadrant, the real sun going through
                    MNOPQ towards &gt;j&gt; at R, and the fictitious sun through <hi rend="italic"
                    >mnopq</hi> towards <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> the former comes to the meridian
                    every day sooner than the latter, until the real sun comes to R, and the
                    fictitious to <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and then they come both to the meridian
                    at the same time.</p>
                <p>Lastly, as the real sun moves equably through STUVW, from R towards Υ&gt;, and
                    the fictitious sun through <hi rend="italic">stuvw,</hi> from <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> towards ɤ, the former comes later every day to the meridian than the
                    latter, until they both arrive at the point ɤ, and then they make iţ noon at the
                    same time with the clock.</p>
                <p>Having explained one cause of the difference between true and mean time, we now
                    proceed to explain the other cause of this difference, namely, the inequality of
                    the sun’s apparent motion, which is slowest in summer, when the sun is farthest
                    from the earth, and swiftest in winter, when he is nearest to it.</p>
                <p>If the sun’s motion were equable in the ecliptic, the whole difference between
                    the equal time as shown by the clock, and the unequal time as shown by the sun,
                    would arise from the obliquity of the ecliptic. But the sun’s motion sometimes
                    exceeds a degree in 24 hours, though generally it is less; and when his motion
                    is slowest, any particular meridian will revolve sooner to him than when his
                    motion is quickest; for it will overtake him in less time when he advances a
                    less space than when he moves through a larger.</p>
                <p>Now, if there were two suns moving in the plane of the ecliptic, so as to go
                    round it in a year, the one describing an equal arc every 24 hours, and the
                    other describing in the same time sometimes a less arc, and at other times a
                    larger, gaining at one time of the year what it lost at the opposite; it is
                    evident that one of these suns would come sooner or later to the meridian than
                    the other, as it happened to be behind or before the other; and when they were
                    in conjunction, they would both come to the meridian at the same moment.</p>
                <p>As the real sun moves unequably in the ecliptic, let us suppose a fictitious sun
                    to move equably in a circle coincident with the plane of the ecliptic. Let ABCD
                    (fig. 30) be the ecliptic or orbit in which the real sun moves, and the dotted
                    circle <hi rend="italic">abed</hi> the imaginary orbit of the fictitious sun;
                    each going round in a year according to the order of letters, or from west to
                    east. Let HIKL be the earth turning round its axis in the same direction every
                    24 hours; and suppose the two suns to start from A and <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>
                    at the same moment, A and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> being in the same straight
                    line, and in the plane of the meridian EH. Suppose also that the real sun, when
                    at A, is at his greatest distance from the earth, where his motion is slowest.
                    In the time that the meridian revolves from H to H again, according to the order
                    of the letters HIKL, the real sun has moved from A to F; and the fictitious sun
                    with a quicker motion from <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to <hi rend="italic">f,</hi>
                    through a larger arc: therefore the meridian EH will revolve sooner from H to
                    <hi rend="italic">h</hi> under the real sun at F, than from HE to <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> under the fictitious sun at/; and consequently it will then
                    be noon by the sun-dial sooner than by the clock.</p>
                <p>As the real sun moves from A towards C, the velocity of his motion increases all
                    the way to C, where it is at its maximum. But notwithstanding this, the
                    fictitious sun gains so much upon the real, soon after his departing from A,
                    that the increasing velocity of the real sun does not bring him up with the
                    equally-moving fictitious sun till the former comes to C and the latter to <hi
                    rend="italic">c,</hi> when each has gone half round its respective orbit; and
                    then being in conjunction, the meridian EH, revolving to EK, comes to both suns
                    at the same time, and therefore it is noon by them both at the same moment.</p>
                <p>But the increased velocity of the real sun now being at its maximum, carries him
                    before the fictitious one; and therefore the same meridian will come to the
                    fictitious sun sooner than to the real; for whilst the fictitious sun moves from
                    <hi rend="italic">c</hi> to <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> the real sun moves through
                    a greater arc from C to G; consequently the point K has its noon by the clock
                    when it comes to <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> but not its noon by the sun till it
                    comes to <hi rend="italic">l.</hi> And although the velocity of the real sun
                    diminishes all the way from C to A, and the fictitious sun by an equable motion
                    is still coming nearer to the real sun, yet they are not in conjunction till the
                    one comes to A and the other to <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and then it is noon by
                    them both at the same moment.</p>
                <p>Mean solar time and sidereal time being both uniform, it is easy to compare the
                    one with the other, and assign the number of degrees, minutes, &amp;c. which the
                    sun and a star will respectively describe in a given portion of sidereal or mean
                    solar time. In a mean solar day the sun’s right ascension and mean longitude are
                    increased by 59' 8"∙33; consequently 360° 59' 8"∙33 of the equator pass the
                    meridian in 24 mean solar hours. The sidereal time corresponding to this period
                    is 24 hours 3 min. 56∙555 sec.; therefore 24 mean solar hours are equal to 24
                    hours 3 min. 56∙555 sec. of sidereal time; and 24 hours of sidereal time are
                    equal to 23 hours 56 min. 4∙0907 sec. of mean solar time, or to 24 hours minus 3
                    min. 55∙9093 sec. This difference of 3 min. 55∙9093 sec. is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">acceleration of the fixed stars</hi> in mean solar time; and the
                    preceding excess of 3 min. 56∙555 sec. is the retardation of the sun in sidereal
                    time. Hence the one species of time may be easily converted into the other; and
                    the arc of the equator passed over by the meridian in a given mean time may be
                    calculated. Thus,</p>
                <p>≡∞≤2 = 15« 2-27-84708</p>
                <p>24</p>
                <p>is the arc described by a star in one hour of mean solar time.</p>
                <p>But the process of converting sidereal or mean solar time into true or apparent
                    time, or of computing from the instants of apparent time the corresponding mean
                    solar and sidereal times, is attended with much greater difficulty. The reason
                    is, that the interval between two successive transits of the sun over the
                    meridian, which, in apparent time, measures the day, is a variable quantity; and
                    hence there cannot exist any constant ratio between true and mean time, as there
                    does between mean find sidereal time. The correction or equation by which
                    apparent time is reduced to mean time, is technically called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Equation of Time,</hi> and is composed of the aggregate of the
                    several variable terms which denote the inequalities of the sun’s motion in
                    longitude. Besides the eccentricity, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105675"

                    result from the effect of the planetary perturbations on the earth; and hence
                    the equation of time cannot be exactly computed without the aid of Physical
                    Astronomy.</p>
                <p>It will be evident, from what has preceded, that the equation of time expresses
                    merely <hi rend="italic">the difference between the true and mean right
                    ascensions of the sun,</hi> reduced to time. Its different parts may be
                    calculated numerically in the following manner. Let NA (fig. 31) represent the
                    mean motion of the sun during a given interval, then NA is the sun’s mean
                    longitude, N being the first point of Aries. Let NA = Μ, and from this mean
                    longitude subtract the longitude of the apogee, the remainder will be the sun’s
                    mean anomaly. From the mean anomaly let the equation of the centre be found and
                    denoted by E. Take AB = E, then NB = Μ + E is the longitude corrected for the
                    eccentricity.</p>
                <p>Let us next suppose BC to be the small quantity by which the sun’s longitude is
                    increased in consequence of the perturbations of the planets, and let BC = P;
                    then NC = Μ + E+ P is the true and exact longitude of the sun. Through C let the
                    arc CD be drawn perpendicular to the equator; the point D will be that point of
                    the equator which passes the meridian at the same time with the sun. Let R = NC
                    — ND = the reduction to the ecliptic; we have then the sun’s right ascension = Μ
                    + E + P—R.</p>
                <p>Let NF = NA, and F will be the place which the sun would occupy in the equator at
                    the same instant that he occupies the point A in the ecliptic, if he moved
                    uniformly in the former circle; for NF as well as NA will represent the mean
                    diurnal motion of 59' 8"∙33 multiplied by the number of days elapsed in the
                    interval between the equinox N and the time of the observation. The mean sun
                    would therefore pass the meridian with the point F, whereas the true sun passes
                    it with the point D; therefore, at the instant of true noon, when the sun C and
                    the corresponding point D are on the meridian, the mean sun is at a distance
                    from D expressed by the arc FD=M + E+P—R — M=E + P — R. Now, the arc of the
                    equator FD measures the horary angle between the mean and the true sun, or the
                    angle at the pole between the meridian and the hour-circle passing through D; it
                    is therefore converted into time by the following proportion :—</p>
                <p>360°: FD:: 24 mean solar hours: time from true noon; consequently the difference
                    between mean and true noon, or the equation of time,</p>
                <p>= ¾^ = <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛(E+ <hi rend="superscript">
                    p</hi>-R)=&lt;rt.</p>
                <p>But this equation is not yet perfectly accurate: it requires to be corrected for
                    the effects of nutation. Now it is known that the variation of the mean
                    longitude of the sun, arising from the unequal precession of the equinoxes in
                    consequence of the nutation occasioned by the inclination of the lunar orbit, is
                    expressed by the formula 18" sin. (360° — moon’s node) = 18" sin. N. This
                    variation, reduced to the direction of the equator, will therefore be 18" sin. N
                    cos. <hi rend="italic">e (e</hi> being the obliquity of the ecliptic). The
                    difference between the two expressions is 18" sin. N (1 — cos. <hi rend="italic"
                    >e) =</hi> 36" sin. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    1</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">e</hi> sin. N = 1"
                    ∙4887 sin. N, which, reduced to time, becomes 0∙09925 sec. × sin. N. This small
                    correction, amounting to less than a tenth of a second, was long omitted in
                    computing the equation of time. When it is included, that equation becomes <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">í/T =</hi><hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> &gt;θ (E + P — R) +
                    0∙09925 sec. × sin. N.</p>
                <p>The quantities E, P, R, and N, are to be computed se- '. parately from the
                    astronomical tables; and it must be ob-∙ <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> served,
                    that the result will be expressed in <hi rend="italic">mean solar'
                    time.</hi></p>
                <p>The cosine of the obliquity, that is, cos. 23° 28', is equal to ∙9173 = ⅛ very
                    nearly. Hence, since the equation of time is equal to the sun’s true right
                    ascension, diminished by his mean longitude and the effects of nutation in right
                    ascension (= ND — NA =f∑ 18" sin. N cos. e), it may, on denoting the true right
                    ascension by A, be expressed as follows :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">cTĨ =</hi> A — Μ →= 18" sin. N × ⅛.</p>
                <p>This is the form under which the equation of time was expressed by Dr
                    Maskelyne.</p>
                <p>The equation of time is at its maximum about the 3d of November, when it amounts
                    to 16' 16"∙7, and is subtractive. At four different times of the year it
                    vanishes, namely, about the 25th of December, the 16th of April, the 16th of
                    June, and the 1st of September. These epochs, however, do not remain constant;
                    for, on account of the change which the line of the apsides is constantly
                    undergoing in reference to the line of the equinoxes, the difference between the
                    true and mean right ascensions of the sun—in other words, the equation of
                    time—varies continually in different years.</p>

                    his Rotation, and Constitution.</hi></p>
                <p>The sun, the great source of light, heat, and animation, when beheld with the
                    naked eye, appears only as a luminous mass of uniform splendour and brightness;
                    but when examined with the telescope, his surface is frequently observed to be
                    mottled over with a number of dark spots, of irregular and ill-defined forms,
                    and constantly varying in appearance, situation, and magnitude. These spots are
                    occasionally of immense size, so as to be even visible without the aid of the
                    telescope; and their number is frequently so great that they occupy a
                    considerable portion of the sun’s surface. Dr Herschel observed one in 1779, the
                    diameter of which exceeded 50,000 miles, more than six times the diameter of the
                    earth; and Scheiner affirms that he has seen no less than 50 on the sun’s disk
                    at once. Most of them have a deep black nucleus, surrounded by a fainter shade,
                    or <hi rend="italic">umbra,</hi> of which the inner part, nearest to the
                    nucleus, is brighter than the exterior portion. The boundary between the nucleus
                    and umbra is in general tolerably well defined; and beyond the umbra a stripe of
                    light appears more vivid than the rest of the sun.</p>
                <p>The discovery of the sun’s spots has been attributed to different astronomers.
                    They appear to have been first taken notice of in a work of Fabricius, the
                    friend of Kepler, which was published at Wittenberg in 1611, under the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">Joh.</hi><hi rend="italic">Fabricii</hi><hi rend="italic">Pl

                    Narratio.</hi> It contains, however, nothing more than a few vague conjectures
                    respecting the spots, the phenomena of which he could not have observed with any
                    degree of accuracy, inasmuch as he seems to have been unacquainted with any
                    method of protecting the eye by intercepting a portion of the solar rays; for he
                    recommends to those who should repeat his observations, to admit into the
                    telescope only a small portion of the sun at once, till the eye should by
                    degrees become able to support the full blaze of light. About the same time the
                    discovery was warmly disputed by the illustrious Galileo, and Schciner, a German
                    Jesuit, professor of mathematics at Ingolstadt. The whole circumstances
                    connected with this dispute are narrated at great length by Galileo in his work
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Istoria e 1A-</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193105688"

                    it appears certain that he observed the spots so early as April 1611. In a
                    letter published by him in 1612, he remarks that the spots are situated on the
                    surface of the sun, or that at least their distance from it is imperceptible;
                    that the time of their continuance varies from 2 or 3 to 30 or 40 days; that
                    their figures are irregular and variable; that some are seen to separate, and
                    others to unite, even on the middle of the disk; that besides these peculiar
                    motions, they have also a common motion, in virtue of which they traverse the
                    disk in parallel lines. From this general motion he infers that the sun turns on
                    an axis from west to east; and he adds as a curious remark, that the spots are
                    confined within a zone extending only about 28 or 29 degrees to the north and
                    south of the sun’s equator. Galileo illustrates all these positions by
                    mathematical reasoning, and by drawings of the spots made on many successive
                    days.</p>
                <p>Scheiner’s observations were first announced in January 1612, in three letters
                    addressed to his friend Marc Velser, a magistrate of Augsburg. In the first of
                    these, the date of which is November 1611, he says that he had observed the
                    spots seven months before, but that, having a different object in view, he had
                    given little attention to them. He observed them again in the following October,
                    and at that time imagined the appearance was owing to some imperfection of his
                    telescope, till he was convinced by repeated observations that it was necessary
                    to refer it to .the sun. From these remarks it is pretty clear that Scheiner had
                    formed no accurate notions respecting the spots before October 1611, that is,
                    six months after they had been observed by Galileo. Scheiner made the
                    observation of the solar spots his whole occupation during the following
                    eighteen years, in the course of which he discovered the position of the solar
                    equator, and formed a theory much more complete than that of Galileo. The
                    account of his observations was published in 1630, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Rosa Ursina,</hi><hi rend="italic">sive</hi><hi rend="italic">Sol
                    ex</hi><hi rend="italic">admirando Facularum et Macularum suarum Phaenomeno
                    Varius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The discovery of the solar spots has also been claimed for our countryman
                    Harriot. Amidst these conflicting pretensions it is perhaps impossible to arrive
                    at the truth; but the matter is of little importance; the discovery is one which
                    followed inevitably that of the telescope, and an accidental priority of
                    observation can hardly be considered as establishing any claim to merit.</p>
                <p>The solar spots furnish an extensive subject of curious speculation, but in an
                    astronomical point of view they are chiefly interesting on account of their
                    establishing the fact, and affording the means of determining the period, of the
                    rotation of the sun. In order to obtain a precise idea of the position of a
                    spot, and the path which it describes, it is necessary to project that path on
                    the plane passing through the centre of the sun, and perpendicular to the visual
                    ray drawn from the earth to the sun’s centre. Suppose the diameter of a circle
                    ASB (fig. 32) to be divided into as many parts of unity as there are seconds in
                    the apparent diameter of the sun. Let CP be taken equal to the number of seconds
                    contained in the difference of the longitudes of the spot and the sun’s centre,
                    and the perpendicular PM equal to the number of seconds in the latitude of the
                    spot; then Μ will represent its position on the surface of the sun. By repeating
                    the same operation a number of days consecutively, a series of points Μ Μ' Μ",
                    &amp;c. will be obtained in the apparent path of the spot on the sun’s disk, or
                    rather in the projection of that path on the plane perpendicular to the visual
                    ray. This projection is in general an oval slightly differing from an ellipse;
                    and it is found that all the spots observed at the same time describe similar
                    and parallel curves. They also return to the same relative positions in the same
                    time, and their period is about 27⅛∙ days.</p>
                <p>The paths described by the spots undergo very considerable changes, according to
                    the season of the year at which they are observed. About the end of November and
                    beginning of December they appear simply as straight lines Mm, <hi rend="italic"
                    >M'm', M"m" (fig.</hi> 33), along which the spots move in the direction <hi
                    rend="italic">Mm,</hi> that is, they enter on the eastern and disappear on the
                    western edge of the sun’s disk; and the points at which they disappear are more
                    elevated, or nearer the north pole of the ecliptic, than those at which they
                    enter. After a certain time the lines <hi rend="italic">Mm</hi> begin to assume
                    a curved appearance, and form ovals, as represented in fig. 34. During the
                    winter and spring the convexity of the ovals is turned towards the north pole of
                    the ecliptic; but their inclination, or rather the inclination of the straight
                    lines joining their extreme points, to the plane of the ecliptic continues to
                    diminish, and about the beginning of March disappears; so that the points at
                    which they seem to enter and leave the sun’s disk are equally elevated, as in
                    fig. 35. From this time the curvature of the ovals diminishes; they become
                    narrower and narrower till about the end of May or beginning of June, when they
                    again appear under the form of straight lines (fig. 36); but their inclinations
                    to the ecliptic are now precisely in a contrary direction to what they were six
                    months before. After this they begin again to expand, as in fig. 37, and their
                    convexity is now turned towards the south pole. Their inclinations also vary at
                    the same time, and about the commencement of September they are seen as
                    represented in fig. 38; the points at which they enter and disappear being again
                    equally elevated. After this period the ovals begin to contract and become
                    inclined to the ecliptic, and by the beginning of December they have exactly the
                    same direction and inclination as they had the previous year.</p>
                <p>These phenomena are renewed every year in the same order, and the same phases are
                    always exhibited at corresponding seasons. Hence it is evident that they depend
                    on a uniform and regular cause, which is common to all of them, since the orbits
                    described by the various spots are exactly parallel, and subject in all respects
                    to the same variations. The simplest method of explaining the phenomena is to
                    suppose with Galileo that the spots are adherent to the surface of the sun, and
                    that the sun uniformly revolves round an axis inclined to the axis of the
                    ecliptic. If the axis of revolution were perpendicular to the plane of the
                    ecliptic, the spots, supposing them to adhere to the sun’s surface, would
                    describe circles parallel to that plane, which, seen from the earth, would
                    appear as so many parallel straight lines; but by supposing the axis to have a
                    suitable inclination, all the phenomena become explicable in a very simple
                    manner. While the sun is carried round in his orbit, his axis, constantly
                    preserving its parallelism, will successively assume different positions
                    relatively to the earth; and the planes of the circles described by the spots,
                    which planes are always perpendicular to the axis, will consequently be
                    presented to us under different inclinations; hence the variations of their
                    apparent curvature. In two opposite points of the orbit the visual ray drawn
                    from the earth to the centre of the sun is perpendicular to the axis of
                    rotation. In these two positions the poles of the sun, or the points in which
                    the axis meets the surface, are both visible at the same moment, and the spots
                    appear to move in parallel straight lines. But as the axis retains this
                    perpendicular position only for an instant, and declines from it very sensibly
                    while the spot traverses the sun’s disk, the path of <pb break="no"

                    disk is neither a straight line nor an ellipse, one of which it would
                    necessarily be if the sun, while revolving about his axis, did not change his
                    place in his orbit. When the axis is not perpendicular to the visual ray, the
                    path of the spots will appear to be a curve of which the concavity is turned
                    towards that pole which is visible from the earth. This inclination of the solar
                    axis to the plane of the ecliptic also explains the reason why the points of the
                    disk at which the spots appear are more elevated during one half of the year,
                    and more depressed during the other half, than those at which they disappear. It
                    will also follow from the same hypothesis, that the curvature of the ovals must
                    be the greatest possible when the straight lines joining their extremities are
                    parallel to the ecliptic; and, on the contrary, least when the same straight
                    lines are most inclined to the ecliptic; all which is exactly conformable to
                    observation.</p>
                <p>The various appearances which we have now described may be accurately represented
                    by means of a common celestial or terrestrial globe. Let the wooden horizon of
                    the globe, which is here supposed to represent the sun, be placed horizontally
                    in the same plane with the eye of the spectator, and the pole be inclined about
                    <hi rend="italic">7°</hi> from the zenith. The wooden horizon will now represent
                    the ecliptic; and if the spectator walk round the globe, always keeping his eye
                    in the plane of the wooden horizon, the circles of latitude will appear to him
                    as ellipses of different inclinations and eccentricities: in two opposite points
                    they will appear as straight lines, and, in short, exhibit in their various
                    positions all the phenomena of the oval paths described by the spots of the
                    sun.</p>
                <p>The consequences deduced from the hypothesis of the rotatory motion of the sun
                    are so perfectly conformable with observation, as to render the inference
                    inevitable, that <hi rend="italic">the sun revolves from west to east, on an
                    axis inclined about</hi> 93° <hi rend="italic">to the plane of the
                    ecliptic.</hi> The plane which passes through the centre of the sun,
                    perpendicular to the axis of rotation, is the <hi rend="italic">Equator</hi> of
                    the sun; the straight line joining the points in which it intersects the
                    ecliptic is called the <hi rend="italic">Line of the Nodes</hi> of the equator.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Nodes</hi> themselves are the two opposite points in which
                    this straight line, produced indefinitely, meets the celestial sphere.</p>
                <p>In order to determine the situation of the solar axis in space, it is necessary
                    to find its inclination to the ecliptic, and the angle which the line of the
                    nodes makes with any given line on the plane of the ecliptic, for example, with
                    the line of the equinoxes. The requisite data for the solution of this problem
                    are three different positions of the same spot, which must be obtained by
                    observation. Let S (fig. 39) be the centre of the sun’s disk, AB a parallel to
                    the terrestrial equator, and Μ the place of a spot, the co-ordinates of which,
                    as referred to AB, are SX and MX. In this figure the earth is supposed to be
                    situated in a straight line passing through S perpendicular to the plane of the
                    paper, and it is to be recollected that SX and MX are in fact arcs of the solar
                    globe, though so small when seen from the earth that they may be regarded as
                    straight lines. By comparing the times of the transits of B, the border of the
                    disk, and the spot Μ, we shall find BX, from which, as SB the semidiameter of
                    the sun is known, we shall have SX the difference of the right ascensions of the
                    spot and sun’s centre. The line CY, which is the difference of the declination
                    of the border of the disk and that of the spot, is measured by the micrometer.
                    This will give MX the declination of the spot.</p>

                    by the formula tan. BSE = tan. <hi rend="italic">e</hi> cos. ©: hence MSE (=MSX
                    — BSE) is also given. On SE let fall the perpendicular Mm, then Mm = SM sin. MSE
                    is the geocentric latitude of the spot, and Sm = SM cos. MSE is the difference
                    between its geocentric longitude and that of the centre of the sun: the object
                    is now to determine the angles subtended by these lines at the centre of the
                    sun, that is, to convert the <hi rend="italic">geocentric</hi> into <hi
                    rend="italic">heliocentric</hi> latitudes and longitudes.</p>
                <p>Suppose two straight lines to be drawn from the earth, one to the centre of the
                    sun, and the other to the centre of the spot Μ, and let <hi rend="italic">ô</hi>
                    be their inclination, which is measured by SM, and is consequently known, being
                    the geocentric distance of the spot from S, the centre of the sun’s disk. Let R
                    = distance of the sun’s centre from the earth, <hi rend="italic">r</hi> =
                    semidiameter of the sun, <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> = the angle made at the centre
                    of the sun by the straight lines drawn from it to the earth and the spot Μ, and
                    let -ψ be the remaining angle of the triangle formed by the lines joining the
                    earth, the centre of the sun, and the spot. We have then <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi>: R:: sin. <hi rend="italic">ô</hi>: sin. ∙ψ, whence sin. ∙ψ = — sin. <hi

                    we have the number of degrees, minutes, and seconds in <hi rend="italic"

                    which joins the centres of the earth and sun. Having thus obtained the
                    hypothenuse SM in parts of a great circle of the solar orb, the sides Sm and Mm
                    will be obtained in similar parts from the common trigonometrical formulae for
                    the resolution of a right-angled spherial triangle. These formulae give tan. Sm
                    = tan. SM cos. MSE, sin. Mm = sin. SM sin. MSE.</p>
                <p>It will be remarked that Mm is the heliocentric latitude of the spot, Sm the
                    difference of its longitude and that of the earth; and as the longitude of the
                    earth is equal to 180° + that of the sun, the heliocentric longitude of the spot
                    will be 180° + © — SM if the spot is behind or to the east of the centre of the
                    sun, and 180° + © + Sm if it precedes the centre.</p>
                <p>In this manner the heliocentric longitudes and latitudes of the spots are deduced
                    from their observed right as- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> censions and
                    declinations. The next step is to show how they are employed in determining the
                    position of the solar axis. This problem is in practice somewhat laborious,
                    although the principles on which its solution rests are sufficiently simple. The
                    planes of the circles described by the spots are parallel to the sun’s equator:
                    if, therefore, the position of one of them can be found, the position of the
                    equator, and consequently of the axis, will be found at the same time. Now, the
                    position of a plane is determined by three given points through which it is
                    required to pass; consequently, by three observations of the same spot, we shall
                    have three points in its plane, and thence the plane itself. The problem is
                    therefore one of pure geometry, and may be-solved in various ways. The results
                    of the most accurate observations make the inclination of the solar equator to
                    the ecliptic amount to <hi rend="italic">7</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> o</hi> 19'23" or, 7° ⅜ very nearly; and the heliocentric longitude
                    of the ascending node, that is, the point in which the equator of the sun
                    intersects the ecliptic, in passing from <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105714"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5714-0781"/>south to north, 80° <hi rend="italic">7'</hi> 4".
                    The position of the node seems to undergo no variation, except such as may be
                    supposed to arise from the precession of the equinoxes.</p>
                <p>It has already been mentioned that the mean time in which a solar spot returns to
                    the same position, relatively to the earth, is 27∙3 days. This, however, is not
                    the time in which the sun makes a revolution about his axis. In the interval of
                    27∙3 days the sun describes in the ecliptic an arc equal to 26° ∙91 (for 365 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> d</hi> ∙25: 27 <hi rend="superscript"> d</hi> ∙3:: 360°: 26°
                    ∙91), and by virtue of this motion alone he exhibits every day different points
                    of his surface, the whole of which would be successively shown to the earth in
                    the course of a year, independently of the motion of rotation. Hence results an
                    apparent annual rotation round an axis perpendicular to the ecliptic, and we
                    must abstract the effects of this optical illusion in order to arrive at the
                    time of a real rotation. This apparent rotatory motion will be easily understood
                    by referring to fig. 40, in which S is the sun, E the earth, and C the point in
                    which the visual ray ES intersects the surface of the sun. Suppose the sun to
                    have advanced in his orbit from S to S', the visual ray drawn from the sun’s
                    centre to the earth will now meet the surface in a different point C', and the
                    angular distance between C and C' will be found by drawing S'E' parallel to SE;
                    for the point <hi rend="italic">c</hi> in which S'Ľ meets the surface will
                    correspond to C, and the arc C'c, or the angle E'S'E, will be the apparent
                    rotation, while the sun advances in his orbit from S to S'. Now, the angle E'S'E
                    is equal to S'ES, or the apparent rotatory motion is equal to the angular motion
                    of the sun in his orbit; hence, since the real rotation is in a contrary
                    direction, it is obvious that, if the axis were perpendicular to the plane of
                    the ecliptic, when a spot appears to have made one revolution, it has in reality
                    passed over an arc equal to 360° + 26° ∙91, or 386 ’ 91 degrees. By a simple
                    proportion, therefore, 386∙91: 360:: 27∙3: 25*4; and consequently 25∙4 days is
                    the real time of the sun’s revolution. This result is, however, not quite
                    accurate, on account of its having been supposed that the axis of rotation is
                    perpendicular to the ecliptic, whereas it differs from a perpendicular to that
                    plane by 7° ⅛∙; but the correction necessary on account of the difference is so
                    small as to fall far within the limits of the errors to which the observations
                    are liable; it is therefore unnecessary to have regard to it.</p>
                <p>Observations of the spots, from which the elements of the sun’s rotation are
                    deduced, are attended with a very considerable degree of uncertainty. The
                    semidiameter of the sun, which at the surface of the earth subtends an angle of
                    only 16', or 960", is equivalent to 90° at the centre of the sun. Hence the
                    error of a single second (and it is impossible to answer for one or two seconds
                    in observations of this sort) corresponds to about 338", or 5' 38", on the
                    surface of the solar globe. An observer may, therefore, notwithstanding the
                    greatest care, be mistaken to the extent of 10' with regard to the length of a
                    heliocentric arc; and when to this we add, that the margins of the spots are ill
                    defined, and even changeable, so that their centres, which it becomes necessary
                    to observe, are not always the same, it will not appear surprising that a
                    considerable discordance exists among the results of different observations. The
                    uncertainty respecting the time of rotation amounts to no less than 10 or 12
                    hours. From a careful discussion of a numerous set of observations, Delambre
                    found the time of rotation to be only 25Ό1154 days, instead of 25∙4 given above;
                    and he remarks that, in order tourender the last-mentioned number admissible, it
                    is necessary to suppose either an error of 2° 22', which is scarcely possible,
                    or else that the spot has a proper motion in the same direction as the motion of
                    rotation of the earth and all the planets.</p>
                <p>From four different combinations of equations, derived from eleven observations
                    of the same spot, Delambre computed the following table of the elements of
                    rotation.</p>

                <p>With regard to observations on the sun’s spots, Delambre remarks that he attaches
                    little value to them, first, because it is impossible to make them well; and,
                    secondly, because, even if they were sure, they only lead to results of little
                    importance to astronomy. He discussed a hundred different spots, each observed
                    at least three times by Messier, and deduced thirty different determinations of
                    the elements of rotation. The more he multiplied his calculations, the more
                    certain he became of the impossibility of a good solution; of which, indeed,
                    there is no other chance than in a compensation of errors, little probable on
                    account of their enormous magnitudes. These discrepancies render it probable
                    that the spots, besides partaking of the general motion of the solar globe, have
                    also proper motions either of displacement, or occasioned by a change of form,
                    which may long prevent this part of astronomy from reaching a greater degree of
                    exactness than it has already attained.</p>
                <p>From the circumstance that the sun is incontestably endowed with a rotatory
                    motion, Lalande concluded that, according to the rules of probability, he ought
                    also to have a motion of translation in space. This idea was adopted by
                    Herschel, and is now generally received as probable. It explains some, though
                    not all, of the proper motions which have been supposed to be observed among the
                    stars. If, indeed, the stars are so many suns, revolving like ours each on its
                    own axis of rotation, it is extremely probable that they have also motions of
                    translation; and thus, there being no fixed points in the heavens, the problem
                    of their proper motions becomes so complicated as to be altogether
                    insoluble.</p>
                <p>The only interesting fact which has been deduced from the observations of the
                    solar spots is the rotation of the sun. The curious appearances which they
                    exhibit have, however, attracted great attention, and given rise to numerous
                    theories respecting the constitution of that immense body which governs and
                    vivifies the planetary system. We will now proceed to give a brief account of
                    the appearances, and mention some of the theories that have been founded on
                    them; premising, that after all that has been written on this subject, we are
                    not yet, and probably never will be, in possession of any definite knowledge.
                    The nature of the spots, and the physical constitution of the sun, afford
                    fruitful subjects of harmless conjecture and speculation, but form no part of
                    science.</p>
                <p>The phenomena of the solar spots, as delivered by Scheiner and Hevelius, may be
                    summed up in the following particulars. 1. Every spot which has a nucleus, or
                    comparatively dark part, has also an umbra, or fainter shade surrounding it. 2.
                    The boundary between the nucleus and umbra is always distinct and well defined.
                    3. The increase of a spot is gradual, the breadth of the nucleus and umbra
                    dilating at the same time. 4. In like manner the decrease of a spot is gradual,
                    the breadth of the nucleus and umbra contracting at the same time.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105727" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5727-0782"/>
                <p><hi rend="italic">5.</hi> The exterior boundary of the umbra never consists of
                    sharp angles, but is always curvilinear, how irregular soever the outline of the
                    nucleus may be. 6. The nucleus of a spot, whilst on the decrease, often changes
                    its figure by the umbra encroaching irregularly upon it, insomuch that in a
                    small space of time new encroachments are discernible, whereby the boundary
                    between the nucleus and umbra is perpetually varying. 7. It often happens, by
                    these encroachments, that the nucleus of a spot is divided into two or more
                    nuclei. 8. The nuclei of the spots vanish sooner than the umbra. 9. Small umbrae
                    are often seen without nuclei. 10. An umbra of any considerable size is seldom
                    seen without a nucleus in the middle of it. 11. When a spot which consisted of a
                    nucleus and umbra is about to disappear, if it is not succeeded by a <hi
                    rend="italic">facula</hi> or spot brighter than the rest of the disk, the place
                    where it was is soon after not distinguishable from the rest.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Philosopliical Transactions,</hi> vol. lxiv. Dr Wilson,
                    late professor of astronomy at Glasgow, has given a dissertation on the nature
                    of the solar spots, in which he mentions the following appearances. 1. When the
                    spot is about to disappear on the western edge of the sun’s limb, the eastern
                    part of the umbra first contracts, then vanishes, the nucleus and western part
                    of the umbra remaining; then the nucleus gradually contracts and vanishes, while
                    the western part only of the umbra remains. At last this disappears also; and if
                    the spot remains long enough to become again visible, the eastern part of the
                    umbra first becomes visible, then the nucleus; and when the spot approaches the
                    middle of the disk, the nucleus appears environed by the umbra on all sides, as
                    already mentioned. 2. When two spots lie very near to one another, the umbra is
                    deficient on that side which lies next to the other spot: and this will be the
                    case, though a large spot should be contiguous to one much smaller; the umbra of
                    the large spot will be totally wanting on that side next the small one. If there
                    are little spots on each side of the large one, the umbra does not totally
                    vanish, but appears flattened or pressed in towards the nucleus on each side.
                    When the little spots disappear, the umbra of the large one extends itself as
                    usual. This circumstance, he observes, may sometimes prevent the disappearance
                    of the umbra in the manner above mentioned; so that the western umbra may
                    disappear before the nucleus, if a small spot happens to break out on that
                    side.</p>
                <p>In the same volume, p. 337, the Rev. Dr Wollaston observes that the appearances
                    mentioned by Dr Wilson are not uniform. He positively affirms that the faculae
                    or bright spots on the sun are often converted into dark ones. “I have many
                    times,” says he, “observed near the eastern limb a bright facula just come on,
                    which has the next day shown itself as a spot, though I do not recollect to have
                    seen such a facula near the western one after a spot’s disappearance. Yet, I
                    believe, both these circumstances have been observed by others, and perhaps not
                    only near the limbs. The circumstance of the faculae being converted into spots,
                    I think I may be sure of. That there is generally, perhaps always, a mottled
                    appearance over the face of the sun, when carefully attended to, I think I may
                    be as certain. It is most visible towards the limbs, but I have undoubtedly seen
                    it in the centre; yet I do not recollect to have observed this appearance, or
                    indeed any spots, towards the poles. Once I saw, with a twelve-inch reflector, a
                    spot burst to pieces while I was looking at it. I could not expect such an
                    event, and therefore cannot be certain of the exact particulars; but the
                    appearance, as it struck me at the time, was like that of a piece of ice when
                    dashed on a frozen pond, which breaks to pieces and slides in various
                    directions.” He also observes, that the nuclei of the spots are not always in
                    the middle of the umbrae, and gives the figure of one seen on the 13th of
                    November 1773, which is a remarkable instance' to the contrary.</p>
                <p>The faculae, or bright spots, were observed with particular attention by Messier,
                    who frequently saw them enter on the eastern limb of the sun, disappear as they
                    approached the centre of the disk, re-appear on the opposite limb, and continue
                    visible, as they had done at the time of their first appearance, for about three
                    days, till they were carried off the disk by the rotation of the sun. Spots
                    frequently broke out in these faculae, and when this did not happen, they were
                    succeeded by spots which generally became visible on the following day; and from
                    the regularity of this occurrence, he was enabled to predict the appearance of a
                    spot 24 hours before it entered on the sun’s disk. He observed, also, that the
                    magnitude of the spots was proportional to the brightness of the antecedent
                    faculae. Like the spots, the faculae are generally confined to the equatorial
                    regions of the sun; but they have been occasionally observed by Schroeter on
                    every part of the disk.</p>
                <p>To explain these singular appearances, numerous theories, more or less plausible,
                    have been proposed, but all: resting on many gratuitous assumptions, and subject
                    to great difficulties. Scheiner imagined that the spots do not belong to the
                    sun, but supposed them to be inferior planets revolving at no great distance
                    from the central luminary. Galileo, Hevelius, and others, have supposed them to
                    be scoriae floating in the inflammable liquid matter of which they imagined the
                    sun to be composed. This opinion, although it accounts for the appearance of the
                    spots in the equatorial regions of the sun, to which such scoriae would be
                    carried by the centrifugal force resulting from his rotation, cannot be
                    reconciled with the regularity with which the spots frequently re-appear on the
                    eastern limb of the sun. Dr Wilson, having observed that the spots situated near
                    the edge of the disk are narrow, and without a penumbra on the side next the
                    centre, and that only the central spots are completely surrounded by a penumbra
                    (appearances which would be exactly represented by a conical gulf or cavity
                    presented to us under different aspects by the revolution-of the sun), was led
                    to adopt the opinion, that the appearances of the spots are occasioned by real
                    excavations in the solar globe. He supposed the sun to consist of a dark
                    nucleus, covered only to a certain depth by a luminous matter, not fluid,
                    through which openings are occasionally made by volcanic or other energies,
                    permitting the solid nucleus of the sun to be seen; and that the umbra which
                    surrounds the spot is occasioned by a partial admission of the light upon the
                    shelving sides of the precipice opposite to the observer. It is evident that, in
                    proportion as these excavations are seen obliquely, their apparent dimensions
                    will be diminished; one of the edges will disappear as it approaches the sun’s
                    limb, or come more into view as it advances towards the middle of the disk; when
                    the spot is about to leave the disk, the bottom of the excavation, or the
                    nucleus seen through it, will first disappear, but a sort of faint or obscure
                    spot will remain visible as long as the visual ray penetrates the cavity. These
                    appearances are all conformable to the laws of perspective; but Dr Wilsou,
                    wishing to give a still more palpable demonstration of the accuracy of his
                    theory, fitted up a large globe, into which holes of the proper dimensions were
                    inserted; and this machine being placed at a distance, and made to revolve, was
                    found, when examined through a telescope, to exhibit in the course of its
                    revolution all the phenomena of the solar spots.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105740" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5740-0783"/>
                <p>Dr Wilson’s theory was keenly combated by Lalande, who adduced several
                    observations of his own, and some by Cassini, that could not be explained by
                    means of it; and urged with reason, that an hypothesis, founded on the
                    uniformity of appearances which in reality are exceedingly variable, was
                    entitled to little consideration. Lalande himself supposed the spots to be
                    scoriae which have settled or fixed themselves on the summits of the solar
                    mountains; an opinion which he grounded on this circumstance, that some large
                    spots which had disappeared for several years were observed to form themselves
                    again at the identical points at which they had vanished.</p>
                <p>The late Sir William Herschel, with a view to ascertain more accurately the
                    nature of the sun, made frequent observations upon it from the year 1779 to the
                    year 1794&gt;∙ He imagined the dark spots on the sun to be mountains, which,
                    considering the great attraction exerted by the sun upon bodies placed at its
                    surface, and the slow revolution it has upon its axis, he thought might be more
                    than 300 miles high, and yet stand very firmly. He says that in August 1792 he
                    examined the sun with several powers from 90 to 500, when it evidently appeared
                    that the dark spots are the opaque ground or body of the sun, and that the
                    luminous part is an atmosphere, through which, when interrupted or broken, we
                    obtain a view of the sun itself. Hence he concluded that the sun has a very
                    extensive atmosphere, consisting of elastic fluids that are more or less lucid
                    and transparent, and of which the lucid ones furnish us with light. This
                    atmosphere, he thought, cannot be less than 1843, nor more than 2765 miles in
                    height; and he supposed that the density of the luminous solar clouds needs not
                    be much more than that of our aurora borealis, in order to produce the effects
                    with which we are acquainted. The sun, then, if this hypothesis be admitted, is
                    similar to the other globes of the solar system with regard to its solidity, its
                    atmosphere, its surface diversified with mountains and valleys, its rotation on
                    its axis, and the fall of heavy bodies on its surface; it therefore appears to
                    be a very eminent, large, and lucid planet, the primary one in our system,
                    disseminating its light and heat to all the bodies with which it is
                    connected.</p>
                <p>Herschel supposed that there are two regions or strata of solar clouds; that the
                    inferior stratum is opaque, and probably not unlike our own atmosphere, while
                    the superior is the repository of light, which it darts forth in vast quantities
                    in all directions. The inferior clouds act as a curtain to screen the body of
                    the sun from the intense brilliancy and heat of the superior regions, and, by
                    reflecting back nearly one half of the rays which they receive from the luminous
                    clouds, contribute also greatly to increase the quantity of light which the
                    latter send forth into space, and thereby perform an important function in the
                    economy of the solar system. The luminous clouds prevent us in general from
                    seeing the solid nucleus of the sun; but in order to account for the spots, he
                    supposes an empyreal elastic gas to be constantly forming at the surface, which,
                    carried upwards by reason of its inferior density, forces its way through the
                    planetary or lower clouds, and mixing itself with the gases which have their
                    residence in the superior stratum, causes decompositions of the luminous matter,
                    and gives rise to those appearances which he describes under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">corrugations.</hi> Through the openings made by this accidental
                    removal of the luminous clouds, the solid body of the sun becomes visible,
                    which, not being lucid, gives the appearance of the dark spots or nuclei seen
                    through the telescope. The length of the time during which the spots continue
                    visible renders it evident that the luminous matter of the sun cannot be of a
                    liquid or gaseous nature; for, in either case, the vacuity made by its
                    accidental removal would instantly be filled up, and the uniformity of
                    appearance invariably maintained. Herschel supposed •the luminous clouds to be
                    phosphorescent.</p>
                <p>It would be a needless waste of time to enter into any discussion of a theory so
                    entirely vague and fanciful, and so destitute of all solid foundation. Till we
                    are better acquainted with the nature of light,· fire, and heat, and have
                    attained to the knowledge of every possible mode in which these elements can be
                    produced and propagated, all hypotheses respecting the construction of the sun
                    can only be gratuitous and conjectural. Some interesting questions, however,
                    arise out of this subject. Whether the inferior stratum of solar clouds is
                    sufficiently dense, as Herschel imagined, to protect the body of the sun from
                    the scorching effects of the surrounding regions of light and heat, and render
                    it a fit habitation for human beings, is a question of no importance to man, or
                    to any thing pertaining to his planet; but it is interesting for him to know
                    whether the light and heat dispensed by the sun are liable to any variation or
                    secular diminution, either connected with the spots, or resulting from a
                    decrease of the sun’s volume.</p>
                <p>Those philosophers who adopt the hypothesis of the production of light and heat
                    by the vibrations of an ethereal fluid, consider the mass of the sun to be
                    invariable. Those, on the contrary, who attribute these effects to an emanation
                    from the sun, think his mass and volume must be diminished by the incessant
                    discharge of torrents of luminous particles from his surface. During the two
                    thousand years which have elapsed since the first astronomical observations, no
                    diminution of the sun’s volume has been perceived; but it must be remarked that
                    such an effect may have taken place, though not yet sensible to our instruments.
                    The sun’s diameter is nearly 2000"; and at the distance of 95,000,000 miles a
                    second corresponds to 460 miles. Now, supposing the solar diameter to suffer a
                    daily diminution of two feet, which may be considered as enormous, considering
                    the vast magnitude of the sun, and the excessive rarity of light, the diminution
                    would amount to 800 feet in a year, and to 460 miles, or 1", in 3000 years.
                    Thus, after thirty centuries, the diminution would still be imperceptible,
                    inasmuch as our instruments are not sufficiently accurate to enable us to
                    appreciate, in an observation of this sort, so small a variation as one
                    second.</p>
                <p>Some astronomers, after Herschel, have imagined that the existence of the solar
                    spots has an influence on the temperature of the seasons. In 1823 the summer was
                    cold and wet; the thermometer at Paris rose only to 23° ∙7 of Reaumur, and the
                    sun exhibited no spots; whereas in the summer of 1807 the heat was excessive,
                    and the spots of vast magnitude. The relation, however, between the temperature
                    and the appearance of the solar spots is not so uniform as to give much weight
                    to this opinion. Warm summers, and winters of excessive rigour, have happened in
                    the presence or absence of the spots. The year 1783 was remarkable for its
                    fertility and the magnitude of the solar spots; a dry fog enveloped the greater
                    part of Europe, and was followed by the earthquake of Calabria. Another opinion
                    entertained by Herschel was, that one hemisphere of the sun emits less light
                    than the other, so that when viewed at a great distance he will resemble some
                    stars of which the brilliancy is subject to periodical variations.</p>
                <p>By reason of the globular figure of the sun, his surface towards the border of
                    the disk is seen obliquely, and therefore a much greater portion of it is
                    comprehend-I<pb break="no" facs="nls:193105753" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5753-0784"/>
                    ed under a given visual angle, than when the ray proceeds from his centre. Now,
                    as every point of the sun’s surface is supposed to emit an equal quantity of
                    light in all directions, it follows that the light ought to be much more intense
                    near the circumference of the disk, because <hi rend="italic">if</hi> greater
                    number of rays will proceed from the larger surface, which forms the oblique
                    base of the luminous cone. Bouguer, deceived by some imperfect experiments,
                    thought the light more intense at the centre of the disk than towards the limb;
                    a circumstance which could only be explained by supposing the light to be
                    diminished by some cause which acts most powerfully with regard to the borders
                    of the disk. Such would be the effect of a dense atmosphere surrounding the sun;
                    for in this case the rays which proceed from the border must traverse a much
                    greater extent of the solar atmosphere, and consequently be absorbed in greater
                    proportion than those which proceed from the central parts and traverse it
                    directly; just as the atmosphere of the earth renders the light of the stars at
                    the horizon much feebler than at the zenith. It has been found, however, that
                    Bougucr’s experiments were inaccurate, and that the light is equally intense at
                    the border and the centre. The existence of a solar atmosphere cannot therefore
                    be demonstrated in this manner; but it is clearly indicated by the faint light
                    which is observable round the sun’s limb during a total eclipse.</p>
                <p>Another very curious phenomenon connected with the sun, is the faint nebulous
                    aurora which accompanies him, known by the name of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zodiacal Light.</hi> This phenomenon was first observed by Kepler, who
                    described its appearance with sufficient accuracy, and supposed it to be the
                    atmosphere of the sun. Dominic Cassini, however, to whom its discovery has been
                    generally but erroneously attributed, was the first who observed it attentively,
                    and gave it the name which it now bears. It is visible immediately before
                    sunrise, or after sunset, in the place where the sun is aboűt to appear, or has
                    just quitted, in the horizon. In total eclipses it is seen surrounding the sun’s
                    disk, and resembling the beard of a comet. It has a flat lenticular form, and is
                    placed obliquely on the horizon, as represented in fig. 41, the apex extending
                    to a great distance in the heavens. Its direction is always in the plane of the
                    sun’s equator, and for this reason it is scarcely visible in our latitudes,
                    excepting at particular seasons,' when that plane is nearly perpendicular to the
                    horizon. When its inclination is great, it is either concealed altogether under
                    the horizon, or at least rises so little above it, that its splendour is effaced
                    by the atmosphere of the earth. The most favourable time for observing it is
                    about the beginning of March, or towards the vernal equinox. The line of the
                    equinoxes is then situated in the horizon, and the arc of the ecliptic SS' S"
                    (fig. 42) is more elevated than the equator SEQ by an angle of 23⅜ degrees; so
                    that the solar equator, which is slightly inclined to the ecliptic, approaches
                    nearer to the perpendicular to the horizon, and the pyramid of the zodiacal
                    light is consequently directed to a point nearer the zenith, than at any other
                    season of the year. For example, at the summer solstice, S"T, a tangent to the
                    ecliptic, is parallel to EQ the tangent to the equator, and the luminous pyramid
                    is in a plane less elevated by 23° ^∙ than at the time of the vernal
                    equinox.</p>
                <p>Numerous opinions have been entertained respecting the nature and cause of this
                    singular phenomenon. Cassini thought it might be occasioned by the confused
                    light of an innumerable multitude of little planets circulating round the sun,
                    in the same manner as the milky way owes its appearance to the light of
                    agglomerated myriads of stars. Its resemblance to the tails of comets has been
                    noticed by Cassini, Fatio Duillier, and others; and Euler endeavoured to prove
                    that they are both owing to similar causes. Mairan, like Kepler, ascribed it to
                    the atmosphere of the sun; and this hypothesis was generally adopted, till it
                    was shown by Laplace to be untenable for the following reasons. The atmosphere
                    of any planet, endowed with a motion of rotation, cannot extend to an indefinite
                    distance: it can only reach to such a height that the centrifugal force is
                    exactly balanced by the force of gravity. Beyond this height the atmosphere
                    would be dissipated by the superior energy of the centrifugal force. Now the
                    height above the sun at which the two forces are equal is that at which a
                    planet, if placed there, woul’d revolve about the sun in the same time in which
                    the sun performs a revolution on his axis. But the orbit of such a planet would
                    be greatly inferior to the orbit of Mercury; for the time in which Mercury makes
                    a revolution in his orbit is eighty-eight days, while the sun revolves about his
                    axis in twenty-five; it is therefore certain that the atmosphere of the sun
                    cannot extend to the orbit of Mercury. Now, the greatest elongation of Mercury
                    doesnot exceed 28°, and the zodiacal light has been observed to extend to above
                    100°, reckoning from the sun to the apex of the luminous pyramid. Hence the
                    phenomenon cannot proceed from the sun’s atmosphere. Laplace further remarks,
                    that the ratio of the equatorial and polar axes of the solar atmospherical
                    spheroid cannot exceed that of three to two; whence its form would not
                    correspond with the lenticular appearance of the zodiacal light. But to whatever
                    cause this luminous matter is to be attributed, it is certain that it is of
                    extreme rarity, inasmuch as it does not intercept the light of the smallest
                    stars which are seen through it without any diminution of splendour.</p>

                <p>OF THE MOON.</p>
                <p>Next to the sun, the moon is to mankind the most important and interesting of all
                    the celestial bodies. Her conspicuous appearance in the heavens, the variety of
                    her phases, and the rapidity with which she changes her place among the fixed
                    stars, have rendered her at all times an object of admiration to the vulgar;
                    while her proximity to the earth, her physical effects on the ocean, the
                    intricacy of the theory of her motions, and the vast importance of that theory
                    to navigation and -geography, have equally <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105766"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5766-0785"/>claimed the attention of the observer and
                    mathematician; nor is there any other department of astronomy in which their
                    researches have been crowned with more triumphant success, or been rewarded with
                    more brilliant discoveries.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Phases, Parallax,
                    and Magnitude of the Moon.</hi></p>
                <p>The different appearances or phases of the moon were probably the first celestial
                    phenomena observed with any degree of attention. When the moon, after having
                    been for some days invisible, is again seen on the eastern side of the sun, and
                    at a distance of 20 or 30 degrees from him, she appears as a curved thread of
                    silvery light; and her form is that of a crescent, the horns of which are turned
                    towards the east. The breadth of the crescent increases continually in
                    proportion as she separates herself from the sun, till, having obtained a
                    distance of 90°, she appears under the form of a semicircle. At this point she
                    is said to be in her <hi rend="italic">first quarter.</hi> Continuing her motion
                    to the eastward, the line which terminates the eastern side of her disk assumes
                    the curvature of an elliptic arc, and her visible portion continues to increase
                    till she has attained the distance of 180° from the sun, when she appears
                    perfectly round. She is then <hi rend="italic">full,</hi> and is said to be in
                    <hi rend="italic">opposition,</hi> rising as the sun sets, and consoling us by
                    her pale light for the absence of the great luminary. Having passed this point,
                    she begins to approach the sun; her western side now takes the form of the
                    elliptic arc, and her luminous portion diminishes exactly in the same proportion
                    as it increased through the first half of her orbit. About seven days after the
                    full she again appears as a semicircle, the diameter of which is turned towards
                    the west, and she is now at her <hi rend="italic">third quarter,</hi> and at a
                    distance of 90° from the sun. The semicircle after this changes into a crescent,
                    and she continues to approach the sun, till, having advanced to within 20° or
                    30° from him, she again disappears, being lost in the splendour of his rays.
                    These phases regularly succeed each other, and the time in which they run
                    through all their changes is about 291 days. When the moon passes the meridian
                    at the same time with the sun, she is said to be in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conjunction.</hi> The two points of her orbit in which she is situated when in
                    opposition or conjunction are called the <hi rend="italic">Syzygies</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> those which are 90° distant from the sun are called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Quadratures;</hi> and the intermediate points between the syzygies
                    and quadratures are called the <hi rend="italic">Octants.</hi></p>
                <p>A slight attention to the lunar phases during a single revolution will be
                    sufficient to prove that they are occasioned by the reflection of the sun’s
                    light from the opaque spherical surface of the moon. This fact, which was
                    recognised in the earliest ages, will be made obvious by, the help of a diagram.
                    If the moon is an opaque body we can only see that portion of her enlightened
                    side which is towards the earth. Therefore, when she arrives at that point of
                    her orbit A (fig. 43) where she is in conjunction with the sun S, her dark half
                    is towards the earth, and she disappears, as at <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> there
                    being no light on that half to render it visible. When she comes to her first
                    octant, at B, or has gone an eighth part of her orbit from her conjunction, a
                    quarter of her enlightened side is towards the earth, and she appears horned, as
                    at <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> When she has gone a quarter of her orbit from her
                    conjunction, to C, she shows us one half of her enlightened side, as at <hi
                    rend="italic">c,</hi> and we say she is a quarter old. At D she is in her second
                    octant, and by showing us more of her enlightened side she appears gibbous, as
                    at <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> At E her whole enlightened side is towards the
                    earth, and therefore she appears round, as at <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> when we
                    say it is full moon. In her third octant, at F, part of her dark side being
                    towards the earth, she again appears gibbous, and is on the decrease, as at/. At
                    G we see just one half of her enlightened side, and she appears as a semicircle,
                    as at <hi rend="italic">g.</hi> At H we only see a quarter of her enlightened
                    side, being in her fourth octant, when she appears horned, as at <hi
                    rend="italic">h.</hi> And at A, having completed her course from the sun to the
                    sun again, she disappears, and we say it is new moon. Thus, in going from A to
                    E, the moon seems continually to increase; and in going from E to A, to decrease
                    in the same proportion, exhibiting like phases at equal distances from A and
                    E.</p>
                <p>The magnitude of the visible portion of the moon’s disk thus depends on the
                    situation of the moon relatively to the sun and the earth, and is easily
                    determined geometrically from her elongation or angular distance from the sun.
                    Let ADBC (fig. 44) be the projection of the lunar orb on the plane which passes
                    through the centres of the sun, moon, and earth; let S be the place of the sun,
                    E that of the earth, Μ the centre of the projection, and AB, CD two diameters
                    perpendicular to SM and EM respectively, and let EM meet the circumference in G.
                    It is evident that AGDB represents the hemisphere illuminated by the sun, and
                    CAGD that which is visible from the earth; the whole portion of the visible
                    disk, therefore, is represented by AGD, or by AG and DG. Now, if we conceive the
                    moon’s surface to be projected on the plane which passes through her centre
                    perpendicular to the visual ray, the illuminated portion of the disk DG will
                    appear as a semicircle, while the part GA will appear as a semi-ellipse, the
                    minor axis of which is to its major as MF to MC, AF being perpendicular to MC.
                    The eye at E will therefore see the semicircle DMG, together with the
                    semi-ellipse GMA, and the visible part will be to the entire disk as DF: DC,
                    that is, as 1 + sin. AME: 2, or, as 1 + cos. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi>: 2; <hi

                <p>When the moon is in opposition the angle <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> = 0, whence 1 +
                    cos. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> = 2, and the whole disk is visible. At the
                    conjunction <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> = 180°, and 1 + cos, Φ = 0; the moon is
                    consequently invisible.</p>
                <p>The triangle EMS likewise furnishes the means of finding the distance of the moon
                    when that of the sun is known; or reciprocally, the distance of the sun from
                    that of the moon: but for this purpose it is necessary to observe accurately the
                    limit of illumination, which is not easily done. Let ADBE (fig. 45) be the
                    illuminated part of the moon ACBE. The distance between the cusps A and B,
                    measured by the micrometer, gives the major axis of the ellipse ADB, and the
                    semicojugate axis DM is found by measuring in the same manner the distance ED,
                    and subtracting EM, half the transverse AB. This</p>

                    given by observation, we have ESM or S = 180° — E — Μ; whence Μ and S are given
                    angles; and from the property of the triangle we have EM = ES ™ or ES = EM The

                    exact instant when the moon is dichotomized, or in her first or third quarter,
                    for the elliptic arc then becomes a straight line and the angle EMS=90°; so that
                    sin. Μ = l. In this case therefore we have EM = ES EM</p>
                <p>sin. S = ES cos. E, and ES = <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> ς, which gives the cos.
                    E <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> ratio of the distances of the sun and moon. In
                    this manner Aristarchus of Samos attempted to compare the distance of the two
                    luminaries; and although his result was extremely erroneous, inasmuch as he
                    found the distance of the sun to be only between eighteen and twenty times
                    greater than that of the moon, whereas it is actually 380 times greater, yet the
                    idea was an ingenious one, and the method perfectly accurate in theory. The
                    error arose from the inaccuracy of the ancient instruments, and the
                    impossibility of observing to within a few minutes the exact time of the
                    dichotomy. Besides, as the angle at the sun is extremely small, a very slight
                    error either with regard to the time or the angle has a great influence on the
                    result.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript">?</hi> The moon’s absolute distance from the earth is
                    obtained by means of her parallax, which, on account of her proximity, is very
                    considerable, and can therefore be determined by the methods which were
                    explained in chap. i. sect. 2. On comparing her parallaxes observed at different
                    times, they are found to differ considerably in value. Thus, according to
                    Lalande, the greatest horizontal parallax at Paris is 6P 29", the smallest 53'
                    51"; and it assumes every possible value between these two extremes. The
                    horizontal parallax being the angle which the earth’s radius subtends at the
                    moon, and consequently equal to the radius of the earth divided by the moon’s
                    distance, the perigean and apogean distances corresponding to the extreme
                    parallaxes are respectively 55∙916 and 63∙842 semidiameters of the earth. The
                    ratio of these two numbers, or of the extreme values of the parallax, is 1∙1417,
                    and denotes the greatest variations of the moon’s distance from the earth. The
                    ratio of the corresponding quantities in the case of the sun is only 1∙034;
                    hence the moon’s distance is subject to much greater variations than that of the
                    sun.</p>
                <p>These differences in the value of the parallax arise from the variations of the
                    moon’s distance from the earth; but it is also observed to differ sensibly at
                    different points of the earth’s surface, even at the same instant of time. If
                    the earth were spherical, the horizontal parallax of the moon, supposing her
                    distance to be invariable, would be the same at whatever part of the earth it
                    might be observed. The case is, however, different; for, on account of the
                    spheroidal figure of the earth, the section made by every vertical plane gives a
                    different ellipse, no one of which even passes through the centre of the earth,
                    excepting indeed the cases in which the place of the observer is on the equator
                    or under the pole; for in all other cases the perpendicular to the surface of
                    the earth does not pass through its centre. Hence it is necessary, in speaking
                    of the horizontal parallax, to specify the place of the observation.</p>
                <p>Since the parallax of the moon is subject to incessant variation, it is necessary
                    to assume a certain mean value of it, about which the true and apparent values
                    may be conceived to oscillate. This is denominated the <hi rend="italic"
                    >constant</hi> parallax. It is evident that it cannot be found by taking the
                    arithmetical mean of the extreme values; for by reason of the disturbing force
                    of the sun, the eccentricity of the lunar orbit, and consequently the perigean
                    and apogean distances, are constantly varying; and as the quantity by which one
                    of these distances is increased is not equal to that by which the other is
                    diminished, it follows that the mean of the perigean and apogean parallaxes will
                    not be a constant quantity, but different in successive revolutions of the moon.
                    If we abstract from all the inequalities of the lunar orbit, and suppose the
                    moon to be at her mean distance and mean place, the constant parallax will be
                    the angle under which a given semidiameter of the earth is seen by a spectator
                    at the moon in such circumstances. According to Lalande, the following are the
                    values of the constant parallax :—</p>

                    rend="italic">—</hi> A few simple observations of the right ascensions and
                    declinations of the moon suffice to show that her path is confined nearly to a
                    plane, having only a small inclination to the plane of the ecliptic. If her path
                    were rigorously confined to this plane, a single revolution would be sufficient
                    to determine its inclination; but as numerous disturbing causes exist, which
                    produce inequalities in all the elements of the lunar motion, it is only by
                    taking the mean value of a great number of observations that these elements can
                    be astronomically determined. In fixing the position of the plane of the orbit,
                    the first object is to determine the straight line formed by its intersection
                    with the plane of the ecliptic; that is to say, to determine the line of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nodes.</hi> This would be at once accomplished if it were possible
                    to observe the instant at which the moon’s latitude is nothing; for at this
                    instant her centre is in the plane of the ecliptic, and consequently her
                    longitude is the same as the longitude of the node. But as the accuracy of
                    modern practice requires that all important observations be made in the plane of
                    the meridian, and as it could only happen by a very rare coincidence that the
                    latitude deduced from the meridional right ascensions and declinations would be
                    exactly zero, it is necessary to have recourse to a process of calculation to
                    find the precise place of the node.</p>
                <p>Let LNL' (fig. 46) be a portion of the ecliptic, MNM‘I of the lunar orbit, N the

                    consequently the longitude of the node is determined.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ascending Node</hi> of the lunar orbit is that point of the
                    ecliptic through which the moon passes when she rises above the ecliptic towards

                    of the lunar orbit were anciently called the head and tail of the Dragon.</p>
                <p>The position of the nodes is not fixed in the heavens. They move in a retrograde
                    direction, or contrary to the order of the signs; and their motion is so rapid
                    that its effects become very apparent after one or two revolutions. Regulus, a
                    star of the first magnitude, is sometimes eclipsed by the moon; and as the
                    latitude of this star is only about 27' or 28', it is certain that when that
                    phenomenon occurs the moon is very near her node. Suppose it to be the ascending
                    node: the month following it will be observed that the moon passes to the north
                    of Regulus; and every succeeding month she will pass farther to the north of the
                    same star, till at the end of four or five years, when her meridional altitude
                    will be about 5° greater than that of Regulus. Having attained this elevation,
                    her latitude begins to diminish; and, after a period of about nine years,
                    Regulus is again eclipsed by the moon in her descent to the southern side of the
                    ecliptic. The moon after this passes to the south of the star for the following
                    nine years; and at the end of 18į years the nodes have returned to their first
                    position, after accomplishing a complete revolution. The same result is found
                    from the observation of eclipses, the magnitude of which depends on the moon’s
                    latitude; and therefore, if the nodes remained fixed, the eclipses would always
                    be of the same magnitude in the same quarter of the heavens. This, however, is
                    not the case; and it is only after about 18⅜ years that they begin to return in
                    the same order.</p>
                <p>The mean retrograde motion of the nodes is found by the comparison of

                <p>The inclination of the lunar orbit may be determined either by observing the
                    moon’s greatest latitudes, or it may be computed from the formula tan. N = <hi

                    5° 17' 35". The mean inclination may therefore be taken at 5° 8' 48".</p>
                <p>The retrograde motion of the moon’s nodes, as well as all the other inequalities
                    of the lunar motion, is occasioned by the attracting power of the sun, which
                    varies in intensity with the sun’s longitude, or distance from his perigee. The
                    principal inequality to which the inclination of the lunar orbit is subject, is
                    proportional to the cosine of double the sun’s distance from the moon’s
                    ascending <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> node. In <hi rend="italic">fact,</hi>
                    the sun and earth being always in the plane of the ecliptic, when the moon is
                    also in that plane the' action of the sun will have no tendency to increase or
                    diminish her latitude; it will only affect her radius vector, or distance from
                    the earth. But if the moon is not in the plane of the ecliptic, the sun’s
                    attracting force will not only affect her distance from the earth, but also tend
                    to bring her nearer to the ecliptic; and this action will be greater in
                    proportion to her deviation from that plane. When the nodes are in the quarters,
                    and the limits of latitude in the syzygies, the inclination is 5°, as was found
                    by Ptolemy; but when the nodes are in the syzygies, and the limits in the
                    quarters, the inclination is 5° 17' 35". It has therefore a mean value of 5° 8'
                    48", when the nodes and limits coincide with the octants. Denoting therefore the
                    greatest deviation from the mean values by <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> this
                    deviation will pass through all its values between + <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">— x</hi> while the sun’s distance from the ascending node
                    varies from 0° to 90°. It may therefore be represented by a function which
                    varies as the cosine of twice that distance, for the cosine of an angle runs
                    through all its changes from + 1 to — 1 between 0 and 180°. Hence the equation
                    which expresses the principal inequality of the moon’s latitude is</p>

                <p>The co-efficient 8' 48" is called, in astronomy, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Co-efficient of the Argument,</hi> the argument itself being the function by
                    which the inequality is represented.</p>
                <p>This periodic inequality of the moon’s latitude was discovered by Tycho Brahe,
                    from a comparison of the greatest latitudes at different epochs with the
                    correponding positions of the moon with reference to her nodes. He observed that
                    these latitudes oscillate about the mean value of 5° 8' 48"; and as the greatest
                    latitudes give immediately the inclination of the moon’s orbit to the plane of
                    the ecliptic, it necessarily followed that the inclination is subject to similar
                    variations. The motion of the node of the lunar orbit is also subject to an
                    inequality, depending on the same angle as the preceding, but proportional to
                    its sine. Tycho explained these two inequalities by a very simple hypothesis,
                    similar to that by which we have explained the oscillations of the terrestrial
                    equator, namely, a slight nutation of the earth’s axis. In the present case it
                    is only necessary to place the mean pole of the lunar orbit at the distance of
                    5° 8' 48" from the pole of the ecliptic, and to suppose the true pole to
                    describe a small ellipse about the mean pole in the same time that the sun
                    occupies in making a semi-revolution with regard to the nodes of the moon’s
                    orbit, that is, in 173∙309 days.</p>
                <p>There are various other inequalities which affect the latitude of the moon and
                    the inclination of her orbit, to correct which, no fewer than twelve equations
                    are given in the recent and most accurate tables. The greater part of them are,
                    however, only known from theory, and are so small that even their accumulated
                    effects are scarcely perceptible to observation.</p>
                <p>The inclination of the lunar orbit to the plane of the terrestrial equator
                    occasions considerable differences in the intervals between the moon’s rising or
                    setting on successive days, and gives rise to the phenomenon of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Harvest Moon.</hi> As the daily motion of the moon is about 13
                    degrees from west to east, it follows that if she moved in a plane parallel to
                    the equator, she would rise 50 minutes later every successive evening, because
                    her orbit would then make the same angle with the horizon at all seasons of the
                    year, and the intervals between her consecutive risings would be constant. For
                    the sake of explanation, we may here suppose the moon to move in the plane of
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105805" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5805-0788"/> 1 the
                    ecliptic. Now, the time in which a given arc of the ecliptic rises above the
                    horizon depends on its inclination to the horizon. In our latitudes the
                    inclination of the ecliptic at different points to the horizon varies so much,
                    that at the first point of Aries an arc of 13° becomes visible in the short
                    space of 17 minutes, while at the 23d of Leo the same arc will only rise above
                    the horizon in one hour and 17 minutes. Hence, when the moon is near the first
                    point of Aries, the difference of the times of her rising on two successive
                    evenings will be only about 17 minutes; and as this happens in the course of
                    every revolution, she will rise for two or three nights every month at nearly
                    the same hour. But the rising of the moon is a phenomenon which attracts no
                    attention, excepting about the time when she is full, that is, when she rises at
                    sunset. In this case she is in opposition to the sun, and consequently, if she
                    is in Aries, the sun must be in Libra, which happens during the autumnal months.
                    At this season of the year, therefore, the moon, when near the full, rises for
                    some evenings at nearly the same hour. This circumstance affords important
                    advantages to the husbandman, on which account the phenomenon attracts
                    particular attention.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, that as this phenomenon is occasioned by the oblique position of
                    the lunar orbit with regard to the equator, the effect will be greater than what
                    has just been described if the plane of that orbit makes a greater angle with
                    the equator than the plane of the ecliptic, does. But we have seen that the
                    plane of the moon’s orbit is inclined to the ecliptic in an angle exceeding 5°;
                    consequently, when her ascending node is in Aries, the angle which her orbit
                    makes with the horizon will be 5° less than that which the ecliptic makes with
                    the horizon; and the difference of time between her risings on two successive
                    evenings will be less than 17 minutes, as would have been the case had her orbit
                    coincided with the ecliptic. On the contrary, when the descending node comes to
                    Aries, the angle which her orbit makes with the horizon will be greater by 5°,
                    and consequently the difference of the times of her successive risings will be
                    greater than if she moved in the plane of the ecliptic. If when the full moon is
                    in Pisces or Aries the ascending node of her orbit is also in one of those
                    signs, the difference of the times of her rising will not exceed one hour and
                    forty minutes during a whole week; but when her nodes are differently situated,
                    the difference in the time of her rising in the same signs may amount to 3∣
                    hours in the space of a week. In the former case the harvest-moons arc the most
                    beneficial, in the latter the least beneficial, to the husbandman. All the
                    variations in the intervals between the consecutive risings or settings take
                    place within the period in which the line of the nodes makes a complete
                    revolution.</p>

                    orbit, the projection of her path on the surface of the celestial sphere will be
                    a great circle. But the variations observable in the magnitude of her apparent
                    diameter, and in the velocity of her motion, prove that if her orbit is a
                    circle, the earth is at least not placed at its centre. The numerous perturbing
                    causes which affect her motion render the exact determination of her orbit a
                    matter of great difficulty; but observation shows that it deviates very little
                    from an ellipse, of which the centre of the earth occupies one of the foci. It
                    has also been found that the spaces passed over by the radius vector of the moon
                    are very nearly proportional to the times of description; which is the
                    distinctive character of the elliptic motion.</p>
                <p>In order to obtain a correct idea of the figure and posi-Ί tion of the orbit, it
                    is necessary to know its major axis, its-^ eccentricity, and the position of its
                    apsides. The major <hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> axis is equal to the sum of
                    the greatest and least distances, and these have already been stated to be
                    respectively 63∙842 and 55∙916 semidiameters of the earth; whence, supposing the
                    earth’s radius to be 4000 miles, the major axis of the lunar orbit will amount
                    in round numbers to 480,000 miles. It may be here remarked that the moon’s
                    distance is an element which may be practically determined with great exactness.
                    A variation of 1" in the parallax would occasion an error of only about 67 miles
                    in the determination of the distance; therefore, since the parallax is certainly
                    known to within 4", the greatest error in the distance deduced from it cannot
                    exceed 280 miles out of about 240,000 miles.</p>
                <p>An approximation to the eccentricity of the orbit of the moon is easily obtained
                    from the variations of her apparent diameter. The moon’s apparent diameter is
                    observed to vary between 29' 30" and 33' 30" very nearly. Now, let D denote the
                    mean, D' the apogean, D" the perigean diameter, and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> the

                <p>This eccentricity corresponds to an equation of the centre amounting to 7° 16',
                    and is much more considerable than that of the solar orbit, which, as we have
                    before seen, amounts only to 0° ∙0168. The result just given is, however, only
                    to be considered as approximative, and is, in fact, considerably too large. In
                    the best and most recent tables the value assigned to the eccentricity of the
                    lunar orbit is 0∙0548442, and the corresponding equation of the centre 6° 17'
                    12"∙7. (See <hi rend="italic">Astronomical Tables and Formulae,</hi> by Francis
                    Baily, Esq. London, 1827.)</p>
                <p>The place of the apsides is likewise found from observations of the moon’s
                    apparent diameter, because at these points of the orbit the apparent magnitude
                    has its maximum and minimum values. But as the apparent magnitude varies very
                    slowly at the apsides, it is preferable, as Lalande remarks, to choose the
                    points of mean distance where its variations arc most rapid. Having selected two
                    observations which give the same apparent diameter at two opposite points of the
                    orbit, we shall have two points evidently at equal distances from the perigee,
                    the longitude of which will therefore be given at the middle time between the
                    two observations. In comparing the positions of the apsides thus determined at
                    different epochs, it is found that they have a rapid progressive motion, that
                    is, according to the order of the signs. In Mr Bally’s tables the motion of the
                    perigee is stated to be 4069° ∙046278, or 11 revolutions + 109° 2' 46"∙6, in
                    36525 mean solar days. Its mean motion in a mean solar day is consequently 6'
                    41"; and in 365 mean solar days, 40° 39' 46"∙36. Hence the time in which it
                    completes a sidereal revolution is 3232∙575343 mean solar days. The period of a
                    tropical revolution of the apsides is 3231∙4751 mean solar days = 3231 days, 11
                    hours, 24 minutes, 0*8 seconds, or nearly 9 years. This mean motion of the lunar
                    apsides is, however, subject to periodic inequalities of considerable magnitude,
                    and therefore can only be determined accurately by means of observations
                    separated from <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105818" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5818-0789"
                    />each other by a long interval of time. In the tables just quoted, the epoch is
                    the commencement of the present century, when the longitude of the perigee was
                    in 266° Iff ,7"∙5. From this and the rate of the mean motion, the longitude of
                    the perigee at any other epoch may be easily computed.</p>
                <p>If the moon’s place in her orbit were not subject to the influence of any
                    disturbing force, her true longitude, or distance from the apsis, would be found
                    at any instant from the theory of the elliptic motion, supposing her mean
                    motion, or the time of a return to the same perigee or apogee, to be accurately
                    known. Thus, supposing E to denote the maximum elliptic equation, which, as we
                    have already stated, amounts to 6° 7' 12"∙7, we should have the true longitude =
                    mean longitude + E sin. A, A being the moon’s mean anomaly, and the longitudes
                    counted from the perigee. This first equation or correction of the mean motion
                    results solely from the circumstance that the moon moves in an elliptic orbit,
                    according to the laws of Kepler, in the same manner as the sun and all the
                    planets. Its argument is the mean anomaly A, and its period the anomalistic
                    month. But the moon’s longitudes, as determined in this manner, are far from
                    agreeing with observation; and several other corrections must be applied, the

                <p>After the equation of the centre, the most considerable of the inequalities of
                    the moon’s longitude is that to which Boulliaud gave the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Evection.</hi> It was noticed by Hipparchus; but it was Ptolemy
                    who discovered its Iaw, and gave a construction which represents its general
                    effects with great accuracy. These effects are to diminish the equation of the
                    centre when the line of the apsides lies in syzygy, and to augment it when the
                    same line lies in quadratures. Thus, supposing the apsides to lie in syzygy, and
                    that it is sought to compute the moon’s true longitude about seven days after
                    she has left the perigee, by adding the equation of the centre to the mean
                    anomaly, the resulting longitude will be found to be above 80 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">less</hi> than that which is given
                    by observation. But if the line of the apsides lies in quadratures, the place of
                    the moon at about the same distance, that is, 90° from the perigee, computed in
                    the same manner, will be found to be before the observed place by above 80';
                    that is, the computed will be <hi rend="italic">greater</hi> than the observed
                    longitude, by more than 80 minutes. After a long series of observations,
                    astronomers have found that the inequality in question is represented with great
                    exactness, by supposing it proportional to the sine of twice the mean angular
                    distance of the moon from the sun, minus the mean anomaly of the moon. In
                    Baily’s tables, its maximum value is stated to be 1° 20' 29"∙9; whence,
                    representing the angular distance of the sun and moon by î — Θ, and the mean
                    anomaly as before by A, the correction due to the evection will be</p>
                <p>(1° 20′ 29"∙9) sin. [2(D — Θ)-A].</p>
                <p>A third inequality of the lunar motion, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Variation,</hi> was discovered by Tycho Brahe, who found that the moon’s place,
                    calculated from her mean motion, the equation of the centre, and the evection,
                    does not always agree with the true place, and that the variations are greatest
                    in the octants, or when the line of the apsides makes an angle of 45° with that
                    of the syzygies and quadratures. Having observed the moon at different points of
                    her orbit, he found that this correction has no dependence on the position of
                    the apsides, but only on the moon’s elongation from the sun. Its maximum value
                    is additive in the octants which come immediately <hi rend="italic">after</hi>
                    the syzygies, where the elongation is 45°, or I80° + 45°, and subtractive in the
                    octants which <hi rend="italic">precede</hi> the syzygies, where the '
                    elongation is 360° — 45°, and 180° — 45°. It vanishes al- - together in the
                    syzygies and quadratures where the elonga-’ tion is 0°, 180°, 90°, or 270°; and
                    on this account it was not perceived by the ancient astronomers, who only
                    observed the moon in those positions. It will be readily perceived, from the
                    limits between which it varies, that it is proportional to the sine of twice the
                    angular distance between the sun and moon. Its maximum value, or the
                    co-efficient of its argument, is 35' 41"∙9; hence the correction necessary on
                    account of it is represented by the formula</p>
                <p>(35' 41"∙9) sin. 2 ( D — ©).</p>
                <p>When this equation is added to the two preceding ones, the differences between
                    the computed and observed places of the moon are brought within narrower limits;
                    but they do not yet disappear altogether except in the months of June and
                    December, and about the time of the equinoxes they are found to amount to eleven
                    or twelve minutes. This inequality was observed by Tycho and Kepler, though
                    neither of them determined its magnitude. They supposed it to be an equation of
                    time peculiar to the moon; and under this form Horrox inserted it in his tables,
                    assigning its maximum value at 11' 16", which differs only by four seconds from
                    that which is obtained from the most accurate modern observations. On account
                    that it is regulated by the seasons, and depends not on the lunar orbit, but the
                    anomaly of the sun, Kepler gave it the name of the <hi rend="italic">Annual
                    Equatioìi.</hi> By reason of this inequality the motion of the moon is slower
                    than the mean motion during the winter months, when the motion of the sun is
                    most rapid; and, on the contrary, is most rapid in summer, when the sun’s motion
                    is slowest. Hence its argument is the same as that of the equation ‘of the
                    centre of the sun, but with a contrary sign. It is therefore proportional to the
                    sine of the sun’s mean anomaly; its period is the anomalistic year, and its
                    maximum value is found by observation to be 11' 11"∙9; hence it is expressed by
                    the formula</p>
                <p>(11' 11"∙9) sin. O’s mean anomaly.</p>
                <p>If we now collect these equations we shall obtain the following corrected
                    expression of the moon’s true place: J) ’s true longitude = D’s mean
                    longitude,</p>
                <p>+ (6° 17' 12"∙7) sin. A</p>
                <p>+ (1° 20' 29"∙9) sin.[2( 5 — ø)—A] —( 35' 41"∙9) sin. 2 ( » — ø)</p>
                <p>—( 11' 11"∙9) sin. O’s mean anomaly.</p>
                <p>For the physical cause of the three last-mentioned inequalities, viz. the
                    evection, the variation, and the annual equation, see <hi rend="italic">Physical
                    Astronomy,</hi> sect. ii. par. 37, 38, and 39. They are the principal but not
                    the only periodic inequalities which affect the longitude of the moon; for the
                    profound investigations of modern science have detected many others, which, by
                    reason of their small values, and the manner in which they are blended with one
                    another, would have eluded all attempts to discover their period or their law by
                    observation alone. Observation can make known only the joint effect of the
                    independent equations, and thereby indicate their existence. In order to
                    separate them and determine their respective values, it is indispensable to have
                    recourse to the physical theory, from which alone the various circumstances of
                    the lunar motion can be properly determined. Newton was the first who attempted
                    to compute <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> the inequalities of the moon’s
                    motion, and thereby led the way in a research which was prosecuted with infinite
                    ingenuity and profound analytical skill by D’Alembert, Clairaut, Euler, and
                    other illustrious mathematicians of the last century, and which was only brought
                    to a successful termination by the labours of Laplace. The formulae given in the
                    seventh <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105831" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5831-0790"/>book
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Mécanique</hi><hi rend="italic">Celeste,</hi> for a
                    great number of new inequalities derived from the theory of attraction, form the
                    basis of the lunar tables of Burg and Burckhardt It is to these theoretical
                    researches that we are indebted for the precision with which the moon’s motion
                    is actually known, and the great advantages which thence result to geography and
                    navigation. The recent tables contain no fewer than twenty-eight equations of
                    longitude, all which may be regarded as corrections of the mean values of the
                    four which we have explained, and which are themselves corrections of the mean
                    motion. It is thus that astronomy approaches nearer and nearer, by every
                    successive step, to the last term of a series which would represent the orbits
                    and motions of the celestial bodies with absolute accuracy.</p>
                <p>The lunar inequalities which we have as yet considered are all of a periodic
                    nature, are compensated in the course of a comparatively small number of years,
                    and have passed through many complete revolutions since the commencement of the
                    history of astronomical observations. But there are, as in the case of the sun,
                    others of a different kind, the periods of which are so long that, with
                    reference to the duration of human life, they may be considered as permanently
                    affecting the elements of the lunar orbit. These are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Secular Inequalities,</hi> the most remarkable of which is the acceleration of
                    the moon’s mean motion.</p>
                <p>On comparing the lunar observations made within the last two centuries with one
                    another, there results a mean secular motion greater than that which is given by
                    comparing them with those made by Ebn-Jounis, near Cairo, towards the end of the
                    10th century, and greater still than that which is given by comparing them with
                    observations of eclipses made at Babylon in the years 719, 720, and 721 before
                    our era, and preserved by Ptolemy in the <hi rend="italic">Almagest.</hi> These
                    comparisons, which have been made by different astronomers with the utmost care,
                    prove incontestably the acceleration of the motion of the moon from the
                    Chaldeans to the Arabians, and from the Arabians to the present times.</p>
                <p>The acceleration of the moon’s mean motion was first remarked by Dr Halley, and
                    mentioned in his <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi> on the observations of
                    Albategnius, inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi>
                    for 1693. It was fully confirmed by Dunthorne, who was led by the discussion of
                    a great number of ancient, observations of eclipses, to suppose that it
                    proceeded uniformly at the rate of 10" in a hundred years; a supposition which
                    consequently gave him a correction for the mean longitude of the moon
                    proportional to the square of the time, or of 10" multiplied by the square of
                    the number of years elapsed between 1700 and the epoch of the calculation. This
                    was the first attempt to estimate the value of the secular equation, which had
                    hitherto been confounded with the mean secular motion. By a similar discussion
                    of ancient observations, Mayer was likewise led to a secular equation
                    proportional to the square of the time, which, in his first <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lunar Tables,</hi> published in 1753, he valued at 7" for the first century,
                    counting from the year 1700, but which he advanced to 9" in his last tables,
                    published in 1770. Lalande found it to amount to 9"∙886, and therefore agreed
                    with Dunthorne in estimating the acceleration at 10" for the first century after
                    1700. Delambre subsequently undertook to determine accurately the actual motion
                    of the moon in a century, from a comparison of the best modern observations. He
                    found it to amount to 307° 53' 9" (rejecting the circumferences), while the most
                    ancient observations agree in making it less by 3 or 4 minutes. The equation,
                    which, in consequence of these comparisons, was empirically introduced into the
                    tables, has been confirmed by the theory of gravitation; and the discovery of
                    the phy- <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> sical cause, and of the law of the
                    acceleration, due to La- * place, forms one of the most brilliant triumphs of
                    modern science. In 1786 Laplace demonstrated that the acceleration is one of the
                    effects of the attraction of the sun, and connected with the variations of the
                    eccentricity of the earth’s orbit in such a manner that the moon will continue
                    to be accelerated while the eccentricity diminishes, but that it will disappear
                    when the eccentricity has reached its maximum value; and when that element
                    begins to increase, the mean motion of the moon will be retarded.</p>
                <p>In order to take into account the effects of the acceleration in the
                    determination of the mean longitude, Μ. Damoiseau has given the following
                    formula for the secular variation; 10"∙7232 n <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    +0"∙019361 <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is the number of centuries
                    from 1801; so that if L is the mean longitude of the moon on the 1st of January
                    1801, and <hi rend="italic">m</hi> is the secular motion at that epoch, the mean
                    longitude will be L + <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> + 10"∙7232 n <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + 0"∙019361 <hi rend="italic">n?</hi> after <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> centuries. By means of this equation the tables satisfy the
                    most ancient observations, and may be extended to at least a thousand years from
                    the present epoch. It is only necessary to observe, that, in applying the
                    formula, <hi rend="italic">n</hi> must be taken negatively, if the epoch is
                    anterior to 1801.</p>
                <p>The same cause which gives rise to the acceleration of! the mean motion, namely,
                    the diminution of the eccen- ’ tricity of the earth’s orbit, also occasions
                    secular inequal- ’ ities in motion of the perigee and nodes of the orbit of <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> the moon. These two inequalities are, however,
                    affected with opposite signs to that of the former; that is, while the mean
                    motion of the moon is accelerated, the motion of her perigee and that of her
                    nodes are retarded. They were deduced by Laplace from theory, and the equations
                    by which they are expressed are connected with one another by a very simple
                    ratio. If we take A to represent the secular acceleration of the mean motion,
                    the secular variation of the perigee found by Laplace is — 4 ’ 00052 A, and that
                    of the nodes — 0∙735452 A. From this Laplace concluded that the three motions of
                    the moon, with respect to the sun, to her perigee, and to her nodes, are
                    accelerated, and that their secular equations are in the ratio of the above
                    numbers. By pushing the approximations to a great length, MM. Plana and Carlini,
                    and Μ. Damoiseau, in <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> which obtained the prize of
                    the Academy of Sciences for 1820, have found different numbers; those of
                    Damoiseau are 1, 4∙702, áïid 0∙612, These important results of theory are all
                    confirmed by observation.</p>
                <p>The three secular inequalities which have been pointed out will obviously
                    occasion others; for all quantities depending on the mean motion, the motion of
                    the perigee, or of the nodes, must be in some degree modified by them. Thus the
                    mean anomaly, which is the difference of the mean longitude of the moon and the
                    mean longitude of the perigee, is subject to a secular equation equal to the
                    difference of the secular equations affecting the longitudes of the moon and the
                    perigee. The radius vector, the eccentricity and inclination of the orbit, are
                    affected by the secular inequality of the mean motion, which, although too
                    minute to have been hitherto appreciable, will acquire sensible values in the
                    course of ages. The major axis of the ellipse is the only element exempted from
                    inequalities of this sort. It is not probable, however, that the utmost efforts
                    of science will ever make us acquainted with all the irregularities to which the
                    moon’s motion is subject. They can only be developed by the complete integration
                    of the differential equations of motion; an integration which is laboriously
                    performed term by term, and which, when attempted to be carried beyond a certain
                    point, transcends <pb break="no" facs="nls:193105844"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5844-0791"/>the limits of human patience and industry. What is
                    most essential is to select, among the multitude of terms, such as may possibly
                    acquire considerable co-efficients by integration.</p>

                    of Lunar Months.</hi></p>
                <p>In treating of the sun, we took notice of three different species of revolutions
                    or years, namely, the mean solar year, or the interval of time which the sun
                    employs in performing a complete revolution with regard to the equinoxes; the
                    sidereal year, or the time in which he returns to the same fixed star; and the
                    anomalistic year, or the time in which he returns to the same point of his
                    ellipse. In like manner, if we understand by the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >month</hi> the time which the moon employs to make an entire revolution
                    relatively to any given point, movable or fixed, we shall have as many different
                    species of months as there are different motions with which that of the moon can
                    be compared. For example, if we estimate her revolution relatively to the sun,
                    the month will be the time which elapses between two consecutive conjunctions or
                    oppositions. This is called the <hi rend="italic">synodic month, lunar
                    month,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lunation.</hi> If we consider her revolution as
                    completed when she has gone through 360° of longitude counted from the movable
                    equinox, we shall have the <hi rend="italic">tropical</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >periodic month.</hi> The interval between two successive conjunctions with the
                    same fixed star is the <hi rend="italic">sidereal month.</hi> A revolution with
                    regard to the apsides of her orbit, that is to say, the time in which she
                    returns to her perigee or apogee, gives the <hi rend="italic">anomalistic
                    month:</hi> and, finally, the revolution with regard to the nodes is the <hi
                    rend="italic">nodical</hi> or <hi rend="italic">draconitic month.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Of</hi> these different periods the most important to mankind is
                    the synodic month. It is also that which, by reason of the striking manner in
                    which it is marked out by the phases of the moon, would first offer itself to
                    the attention of the observer; and when its period is accurately determined, the
                    other months may be deduced from it without difficulty, when the relative
                    motions of the sun and moon are known with sufficient precision. The eclipses
                    furnish a simple means of determining the synodic revolution with a great degree
                    of accuracy. A few rude observations suffice to show that the period of a
                    lunation is very nearly 29∣ days; and with this knowledge we are in a condition
                    to compare two distant eclipses without running any risk of mistaking the number
                    of revolutions that have taken place in the interval. The most ancient
                    observation recorded by Ptolemy is an eclipse of the moon, which happened 720
                    years <hi rend="smallcaps">b.. c.,</hi> on the 19th of March, at 6 hours 48
                    minutes mean time at Paris, according to Lalande. In order to make use of this
                    observation directly for the purpose of determining the synodic revolution, it
                    is necessary to compare it with another of the same kind in which the moon
                    occupied the same point of her ellipse, or the same position relatively to her
                    apsides; for as it is the <hi rend="italic">true</hi> place of the moon which is
                    observed, and the <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> motion which we are in’ quest of,
                    the equation of the centre ought to be the same in both observations. Now, a
                    similar observation is furnished by an eclipse which happened in 1717, on the
                    9th of September, at 6 hours 2 minutes, the moon’s anomaly being very nearly the
                    same as in the Babylonian observation. In the interval between the two
                    observations the moon had therefore completed a whole number of revolutions,
                    with regard to her mean as well as her true motion. The interval between the
                    eclipses is 2437 years and 174 days minus 46 minutes, which expressed in days is
                    890287∙9680555... days. In this interval it is found, from the approximate value
                    of 29∣ days, that 30148 synodic revolutions had happened; hence the mean length
                    of . <hi rend="subscript"> κ</hi>,. , . 890287∙968055</p>

                <p>To deduce the other revolutions, let N = the number of days in a synodic month,

                    better to assume as the basis of the calculation the mean motion of the moon in

                    thence to deduce the time of the mean tropical revolution.</p>
                <p>The mean motion of the moon in 100 Julian years, or 36525 days, is found to be

                <p>According to Ptolemy, the synodic month is 29 days 12 hours 44 min. 3⅜ see.,
                    which differs from the above Ί only by half a second. The same great astronomer
                    madethe tropical month to consist of 27 days 7 hours 43 min. ’ 7į see. which
                    exceeds the true time by 2∣ seconds; an error into which he was led by assigning
                    too great a value to the mean motion of the sun.</p>
                <p>The ancient astronomers paid great attention to these different revolutions, for
                    the purpose of regulating their lunisolar calendar, and of avoiding the
                    calculation of eclipses, which is attended with difficulties that to them must
                    have proved almost insuperable. Their object was therefore to assign composite
                    periods, after the revolution of which the eclipses would again return in the
                    same order. Now, it is easy to see that a period which will bring back eclipses
                    of the same magnitude and duration, on the same day of the year and at the same
                    longitude, must be an exact multiple of the different lunar months. The return
                    of the moon to the same distance from her node will give an eelipse , of the
                    same magnitude; if she returns at the same time to the same point of her orbit,
                    the eelipse will also be of the same duration; and if, in addition to these
                    circumstances, she has also returned to the same longitude, the eelipse will
                    take place on the same day of the year. But the numbers in the above table being
                    incommensurable, it is impossible to find any period, however long, that will
                    embrace all these conditions; the ancients therefore formed periods of different
                    lengths, according as they aimed at satisfying the different conditions with a
                    greater or less degree of precision. For an account of some of the most
                    remarkable of the ancient lunisolar periods, see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Calendar.</hi></p>
                <p>On account of the acceleration of the mean motion of the moon, the ratios of the
                    different species of months are constantly undergoing alterations, and therefore
                    the different eyeles, supposing them exact at the time of their formation,
                    cannot continue so for an indefinite length of time. This circumstance is,
                    however, little to be regretted; for, in the present state of astronomical
                    science, they are not of any great use, inasmuch as we are in possession of
                    surer methods of predicting eclipses, the calculation of which, from the
                    ephemerides, is now a matter of comparative facility. They are, however,
                    interesting in an historical point of view, and their formation was a principal
                    object of the labours of the early astronomers. (On this subject see Lalande,

                <p>THEORETICAL ASTRONOMY.</p>
                <p>OF THE MOON.</p>
                <p>WHEN we reflect on the immense addition that has been made to our knowledge of
                    the constitution of the universe by means of the telescope, we may reasonably
                    indulge an expectation that the further advances yet to be made will be closely
                    connected with the extension of the power of that invaluable instrument.</p>
                <p>Besides the power which the telescope gives of penetrating into remote space, it
                    enables us to discover the nature and constitution of the bodies which are
                    nearer to us. The admirable discoveries of Newton, as will be explained in the
                    sequel, have taught us that the planets are not all composed of matter of the
                    same density. But besides the property of weight, which belongs to all matter
                    whatever, it has others which are peculiar to certain bodies, such as solidity,
                    fluidity, &amp;c. The Newtonian law of gravity reveals nothing of these; and it
                    is only by the aid of the telescope that we can ever hope to acquire the
                    slightest knowledge of the constitution of the planetary matter.</p>
                <p>The structure of the more remote planets is probably beyond our knowledge, even
                    when aided by the most improved telescopes; but it seems not unreasonable to
                    indulge a hope of going some way in ascertaining the nature of the bodies nearer
                    to us. Jupiter’s belts have with great probability been supposed to be masses of
                    clouds in the region of his equator; and Herschel discovered, to the great
                    delight of astronomers, that the polar regions of Mars assumed a whiteness of
                    appearance when obliquely exposed to the light of the sun, just as if, like
                    those of the earth, they were covered with snow. Above all, the moon presents to
                    the astronomer an extensive field, not barely for conjecture, but for
                    instructive observation. The solar spots have given occasion to much ingenious
                    speculation; but the distance of the moon is only one four hundredth part of the
                    distance of the sun from the earth, and in the same proportion our power of
                    becoming acquainted with the constitution of the latter exceeds that of ever
                    knowing intimately the constitution of the former. It is no wonder, then, that
                    the attention of astronomers in all ages has been directed to the companion of
                    our earth, whose structure may with great probability be supposed to resemble
                    considerably the body round which it revolves, and of which it is not improbable
                    that it may have once been a part.</p>

                    Libration of the Moon.</hi></p>
                <p>The surface of the moon is diversified by dark patches, the number of which
                    appears prodigiously increased in the telescope. These patches or dark spots
                    present no changes of form like those of the sun, but permanently exhibit the
                    same uniform appearances, and.retain their relative situations with regard to
                    each other, and also, with some slight variations, to the apparent centre of the
                    moon. The moon, therefore, at all times presents very nearly the same face to
                    the earth. But if this were rigorously the case, it would follow that the moon
                    revolves about an axis, perpendicular to the plane of her orbit, in the same
                    time in which she completes a sidereal revolution about the earth, and that the
                    angular velocities of the two motions are exactly equal. It is, however, proved
                    by observation, that there are some variations in the apparent position of the
                    spots on the lunar disk. Those which are situated very near the border of the
                    disk alternately disappear and become visible, making stated periodical
                    oscillations. But as they suffer no sensible changes in their respective
                    positions, and always re-appear under the same form and magnitude when they
                    return to the same position, it is inferred that they are permanently fixed to
                    the surface of the moon; and their oscillations consequently seem to indicate a
                    sort of vibratory motion of the lunar globe, which is known by the appellation
                    of its <hi rend="italic">libration.</hi> This motion has, however, no real
                    existence. The phenomenon is the complicated result of several optical
                    illusions, and does not depend in any degree on the rotation of the moon, which,
                    relatively to us, is perfectly equable; or at least, if it be subject to
                    irregularities, they are too minute to be appreciated.</p>
                <p>In order to form a precise idea of the phenomenon of the libration, we must
                    consider that the disk of the moon, seen from the centre of the earth, is
                    terminated by the circumference of a great circle of the moon, the plane of
                    which is perpendicular to a line drawn from the earth’s centre to that of the
                    moon. The lunar hemisphere is projected on the plane of this circle turned
                    towards the earth; and if the moon did not revolve round her axis, the
                    projection would incessantly present different appearances to us, inas <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193189341" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9341-0002"/> much as the
                    radius vector drawn from the centre of the earth by which the plane of
                    projection is determined, would intersect the surface of the moon in a different
                    point, at every new position in her orbit. But in consequence of her rotation,
                    the radius vector is always directed to nearly the same point of the lunar
                    surface, and would be always directed exactly to the same point if the angular
                    velocity of rotation corresponded exactly with the angular velocity in the
                    orbit. But the rotation of the moon is sensibly uniform; while the motion of
                    revolution, being affected by the periodic inequalities, is sometimes slower and
                    sometimes more rapid. The apparent rotation occasioned by the revolution of the
                    moon round the earth is consequently in such cases not exactly counterbalanced
                    by the real rotation, which remains constantly the same. Hence the different
                    points of the lunar globe must appear to turn about her centre, sometimes in one
                    direction, and sometimes in the contrary, and the same appearances be produced
                    as would result from a small oscillation of the moon, in the plane of her orbit,
                    about the radius vector drawn from her centre to the earth. The spots near the
                    eastern or western edge of her disk disappear according as her motion in her
                    orbit is more or less rapid than her mean motion. This is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Libration in Longitude.</hi></p>
                <p>Further; the axis of rotation of the moon is not exactly perpendicular to the
                    plane of her orbit. If we suppose the position of this axis fixed, during a
                    revolution of the moon it inclines more or less to the radius vector, so that
                    the angle formed by these two lines is acute during one part of her revolution,
                    and obtuse during another part of it; hence the two poles of rotation and those
                    parts of her surface which are near these poles are alternately visible from the
                    earth. This is the <hi rend="italic">Libration in Latitude.</hi></p>
                <p>Besides all this, the observer is not placed at the centre of the earth, but at
                    its surfaced It is the radius drawn from his eye to the centre of the moon which
                    determines the middle point of her visible hemisphere. But, in consequence of
                    the lunar parallax, it is obvious that this radius must cut the surface of the
                    moon in points sensibly different according to the height of that luminary above
                    the horizon. An observer at the surface of the earth perceives points on the
                    upper part of the moon’s disk, at the time of her rising, which could not be
                    seen from the centre. In proportion as the moon acquires a greater elevation,
                    these points approach the border of the disk, and finally disappear, while new
                    ones become visible on the eastern part of the disk, which increase in number as
                    the moon descends towards the horizon; so that in the course of a day she
                    appears to oscillate about her radius vector in the direction of the earth’s
                    rotation. This phenomenon constitutes what is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diurnal Libration,</hi> and is evidently the effect of the lunar parallax.</p>
                <p>The libration in latitude and the diurnal libration were discovered by Galileo
                    soon after the invention of the telescope. It was Hevelius who discovered the
                    libration in longitude, and explained it by the equable rotatory motion of the
                    moon combined with her unequal velocity in her orbit.</p>
                <p>To the inhabitants of the moon, if such there be, the earth will appear as a
                    species of moon, much larger than the moon appears to us, but visible only to
                    that hemisphere which is turned towards the earth. At those places which are
                    situated near the border of her visible disk, the earth will sometimes rise a
                    few degrees above the horizon; and an inhabitant of the moon placed near the
                    middle of the hemisphere presented to the earth will always see the earth near
                    his zenith, making oscillations of only a few degrees in consequence of the
                    libration. But an inhabitant of the other hemisphere will never see the earth at
                    all; so that while one hemisphere of the moon is constantly enlightened, during
                    her long night, by the light reflected from the earth, the other remains in
                    constant darkness. In regard, therefore, to the distribution of light, one of
                    the lunar hemispheres enjoys very great advantages over the other.</p>
                <p>The elements of the rotation of the moon, that is to say, the position of her
                    equator, the place of its nodes, and its inclination to the plane of the
                    ecliptic, are found by the same methods which have been explained for
                    determining the corresponding elements relatively to the sun. The geocentric
                    positions of the spots are observed in the same manner; and in converting them
                    into selenocentric latitudes and longitudes, the same formulae maybe employed,
                    with a slight modification rendered necessary by the inclination of the lunar
                    orbit to the ecliptic. One circumstance, not less remarkable than the
                    coincidence which obtains between the times of rotation and sidereal revolution,
                    is, that the nodes of the lunar equator coincide with those of the moon’s orbit,
                    if not exactly, at least so nearly, that the differences are so small as to fall
                    within the probable errors of observation and calculation. All the observations
                    since the time of Hevelius agree in showing that the longitude of the descending
                    node of the equator is very nearly equal to the mean longitude of the ascending
                    node of the orbit; whence it follows that the nodes of the equator have a
                    retrograde motion equal to that of the nodes of the orbit. With regard to the
                    inclination of the lunar equator to the ecliptic, Mayer states it to be 1° 29',
                    and Lalande 1° 43'. According to the latest computations made from the
                    observations of Bouvard, the mean inclination of the lunar equator to the
                    ecliptic is 1° 28' 42". Mr Baily makes it 1° 30' 10"∙8. Since the descending
                    node of the equator coincides with the ascending node of the orbit, it is
                    evident that its plane must be situated between the planes of the ecliptic and
                    orbit, making an angle of about 1° 30' with the first, and of 3° 39' with the
                    second.</p>
                <p>Suppose three planes to pass through the centre of the moon, one of which
                    represents her equator, the second the mean plane of her orbit, and the third
                    parallel to the ecliptic. It is evident, from what precedes, that these three
                    planes have a common section; that the first falls between the other two, making
                    with them respectively the angles 3° 39' and 1° 30'. In the space of 6793 days,
                    the time of a revolution of the nodes of the lunar orbit, the poles of the first
                    two planes describe about the pole of the ecliptic, in a direction contrary to
                    the order of the signs, two small circles parallel to the ecliptic, and of which
                    the semidiameters are respectively the arcs 1° 30' and 5° 9'. Hence the
                    difference between the longitudes of these two poles is constantly 180°, and the
                    three poles are situated on the same great circle, that of the ecliptic being
                    between the two others.</p>
                <p>These results, which rank among the most curious discoveries of modern astronomy,
                    were first obtained by Dominic Cassini: they were shown by Lagrange to be
                    necessary consequences of the attraction which the earth exercises on the lunar
                    spheroid.</p>
                <p>The positions of the spots on the moon’s surface are determined by their distance
                    from the lunar equator, and from a conventional meridian, that is, by their
                    selenocentric latitudes and longitudes, after the manner in which the position
                    of places is determined on the surface of the earth. The first meridian is
                    assumed to be that which passes through the pole of the visible hemisphere when
                    the true place of the moon in her orbit is equal to her mean place; hence the
                    first meridian is always very near the middle of the face which the moon turns
                    towards the earth, never deviating from it farther than by a quantity <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193189354" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9354-0003"/> equal to the
                    equation of the moon, or her libration in longitude. The rotatory motion being
                    equal to that of revolution, the selenocentric longitude of the first meridian,
                    at any epoch, is found by adding 180° to the mean longitude of the moon; and
                    this gives also the distance of the first meridian from the ascending node of
                    the lunar equator. The position of the equator and first meridian being
                    determined, the co-ordinates of a spot are computed without difficulty; and in
                    this manner catalogues of the spots have been formed, and arranged according to
                    their latitudes and longitudes.</p>

                    Constitution of the Lunar Substance.</hi></p>
                <p>It has already been observed, that a slight attention to the different phases of
                    the moon is sufficient to prove that she is an opaque spherical body, shining
                    only by virtue of the light which she receives from the sun. The line bounding
                    the visible part of her surface has exactly the form which would be produced by
                    an illuminated hemisphere brought into different positions with respect to the
                    eye; and the circular contour of the obscured portion of the sun during a solar
                    eclipse could only be caused by the interposition of a spherical body. Besides,
                    the parts of her hemisphere turned towards the earth, which the sun’s rays do
                    not reach, are in some circumstances sufficiently discernible, and she has then
                    the same circular appearance which she exhibits when at the full.</p>
                <p>But if the light which comes to us from the moon is only that which she receives
                    from the sun and reflects back to the earth, how does it happen, it may be
                    asked, that the portion of her disk not directly exposed to the solar rays is
                    distinctly visible for some days after the new moon? This phenomenon was
                    ascribed by the ancients to the native light of the moon, to which, on account
                    of its pale ashy hue, they gave the name of <hi rend="italic">lumen
                    incinero-sum.</hi> The explanation which is now generally given was first
                    suggested by a celebrated painter, Leonard da Vinci. It consists in supposing
                    that a portion of the light which is reflected from the illuminated hemisphere
                    of the earth to the moon undergoes a second reflection at the lunar surface, and
                    is transmitted back to the earth. The ancients were confirmed in their opinion
                    respecting the native light of the moon, by observing that she is not altogether
                    invisible in her eclipses. Plutarch, indeed, ingeniously ascribes her appearance
                    under these circumstances to the light of the stars reflected from the moon; a
                    cause, however, totally inadequate to produce the effect. This phenomenon is now
                    generally ascribed to the scattered beams of the sun bent into the earth’s
                    shadow by the refraction of its atmosphere.</p>
                <p>The opinion that the moon’s light is chiefly, if not wholly, caused by the
                    reflection of the sun’s rays at the lunar surface, has prevailed in all ages;
                    and indeed no other explanation seems to have been thought of till it was
                    suggested by Licetus, professor of philosophy at Bologna, as being more probable
                    that the moon possesses a phosphorescent quality, and that the sun’s influence
                    is only wanted to occasion the propulsion of the light which lies absorbed in
                    her substance. This idea has been adopted by Professor Leslie, whose arguments
                    in its support are at least extremely plausible and ingenious. So far as the
                    appearances, and the explanation of the phases, are concerned, it is evidently
                    matter of indifference whether we suppose that the solar rays are reflected from
                    the surface of the moon, or that they exert an action in virtue of which the
                    moon emits rays of her own. In either case it is that part of her surface only
                    which is exposed to the impact of the solar rays that sends forth light to the
                    earth.</p>
                <p>The principal argument in favour of the phosphorescent nature of the moon is
                    founded on the quantity of light which proceeds from her surface. It is evident
                    that the moon does not act as a polished speculum, and reflect the whole of the
                    incident rays; for in that case, as is known from the laws of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catoptrics,</hi> she would merely reflect an image of the sun, equally bright,
                    varying in size according to her different positions relatively to the sun and
                    the earth, and increasing till she arrives at her opposition, when her diameter
                    would appear equal to about the 458th part of its real dimensions. Her phases
                    could never be distinguished, and she would only appear to approach to or recede
                    from the earth, in proportion as her diameter increased or diminished. It
                    follows, therefore, that the moon’s surface must be irregular, or what is termed
                    a <hi rend="italic">mat surface,</hi> that is, of such a nature, that from every
                    point of it the rays of light are reflected in all directions indifferently.
                    According to the experiments ofBouguer, a white surface of this sort, for
                    instance paper, or plaster of Paris, reflects only about the 150th part of the
                    rays which fall upon it in a perpendicular direction; and the proportion is less
                    as the angle of incidence becomes more oblique. Making allowance for the
                    irregular surface and obscure spots of the moon, Mr Leslie computes that the
                    solar light which she remits to the earth must be attenuated at least 105
                    million times; but Bouguer’s experiments show that the moon’s light is between
                    the 250,000th and 300,000th part of the direct light of the sun, or about 350
                    times greater than the computed amount of reflected light. If every part of the
                    moon’s surface reflected the light in the most perfect manner, it may be shown
                    that only the 210,000th part of the rays which she receives from the sun would
                    be thrown off in the direction of the earth; a quantity not much exceeding that
                    which, according to Bouguer’s estimate, we actually receive from her. Mr Leslie
                    states that he found the intensity of the moon’s light to approach the 150,000th
                    part of the direct light of the sun; a result which, if admitted, must be
                    entirely decisive of the question; for as the utmost possible quantity of
                    reflected light cannot exceed the 210,000th part, it follows that the excess
                    must be owing to the spontaneous light of the moon. Hence this ingenious
                    philosopher concludes that the body of the moon is a phosphorescent substance,
                    like the <hi rend="italic">Eolognian Stone,</hi> which possesses the property of
                    shining for some time when carried into a dark room, after having been exposed
                    to the light of the sun. A fact first observed by the celebrated Arago seems to
                    increase the probability of this opinion. All rays reflected from a surface not
                    metallic acquire a peculiar modification, or become <hi rend="italic"
                    >polarized</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but as the rays of the moon are not so
                    modified, it is inferred that they have not undergone a reflection at her
                    surface.</p>
                <p>The secondary light of the moon, of which we have already made mention, affords
                    arguments in favour of her native light precisely similar to the above. If the
                    earth reflected, like a mirror, the whole of the incident rays, the illumination
                    produced by the reflection would amount to about a 16,000th part of that which
                    is caused by the sun; but as the sea reflects only about a 55th part of those
                    rays, and the land a still smaller proportion, we may suppose that the reflected
                    light of the earth does not exceed a millionth part of the direct light of the
                    sun. It is extremely doubtful whether a light so greatly attenuated would
                    suffice to render the moon visible. The lucid bow, or silvery thread of light,
                    which, proceeding from the extremities of the lunar crescent, seems to embrace
                    her unenlightened orb, is easily explicable on this hypothesis; <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193189367" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9367-0004"/>whereas it can hardly be
                    satisfactorily accounted for by ascribing it to the secondary illumination from
                    the earth. “I should rather refer it,” says Mr Leslie, “to the spontaneous light
                    which the moon may continue to emit for some time after the phosphorescent
                    substance has been excited by the action of the solar beams. The lunar disk is
                    visible although completely covered by the shadow of the earth: nor can this
                    fact be explained by the inflection of the sun’s rays in passing through our
                    atmosphere; for why does the rim appear so brilliant? Any such inflection could
                    only produce a diffuse light, obscurely tinging the boundaries of the lunar orb;
                    and, in this case, the earth, presenting its dark side to the moon, would have
                    no power to heighten the effect by reflection. But even when this reflection is
                    greatest about the time of conjunction, its influence seems extremely feeble.
                    The lucid bounding arc is occasioned by the narrow <hi rend="italic"
                    >lunula,</hi> which, having recently felt the solar impression, still continues
                    to shine; and from its extreme obliquity, glows with concentrated effect.” <hi
                    rend="italic">{Inquiry into the Nature and Propagation of Heat.')</hi></p>
                <p>Although these arguments go far to support the ancient opinion of the native
                    light of the moon, they are not entirely conclusive; and indeed cannot be easily
                    reconciled with some of the phenomena. If the moon shines in virtue of her
                    native light, rays will be emitted in all directions from every point of her
                    surface; whence, since a visual angle of a given magnitude includes a much
                    larger portion of a spherical surface near the extremities of its apparent disk
                    than towards the centre, and as the number of rays is proportional to the
                    surface from which they proceed, it follows that the intensity of the moon’s
                    light ought to be greater near the border than at the centre of her disk. The
                    reason why this is not the case with regard to the sun is, that a greater
                    proportion of the rays are absorbed in passing through a greater extent of the
                    solar atmosphere; but the moon, having no atmosphere, ought to be sensibly most
                    brilliant near the circumference of her orb. The contrary is, however, the case;
                    her light is greatest at the centre, and less intense towards the circumference,
                    exactly as it ought to be on the supposition of its being occasioned by the
                    reflection of the solar rays. With regard to the ingenious argument of Arago, it
                    cannot be held to be conclusive till we become more certainly acquainted with
                    the nature of the lunar substance. The only property which we can safely ascribe
                    to it as yet is <hi rend="italic">density</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> whether
                    in its physical properties it resembles the substances with which we are
                    acquainted, is a question hardly within the bounds of legitimate
                    investigation.</p>
                <p>The spots of the moon, affording grounds for conjectures relative to her physical
                    constitution and the nature of her surface, have been observed with great
                    interest since the discovery of the telescope; and as they are of some service
                    in the observation of eclipses, astronomers have been at much pains to determine
                    their selenographic positions. On account of their number, it has been found
                    necessary to distinguish them by particular names. Riccioli designated the most
                    conspicuous of them by the names of astronomers, and other eminent men. Hevelius
                    gave them the names belonging to countries, islands, seas, and regions on the
                    earth, without reference to situation or figure. The nomenclature of Riccioli
                    has, however, been deservedly preferred by Schroeter and o’thers who have
                    particularly observed the phenomena of the lunar surface, and is now universally
                    followed. Mayer gave a catalogue of 89 of the most remarkable of the spots, with
                    their selenographic latitudes and longitudes referred to a first meridian,
                    namely, that which passes through the centre of the moon’s apparent disk,
                    perpendicular to the lunar equator, accompanied by an accurate map of her
                    surface. Delineations of the lunar disk have also been given by Hevelius in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Selenographia</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> by Cassini, Russel,

                <p>That there are prodigious inequalities on the surface of the moon, is proved by
                    looking at her through a telescope at any other time than when she is full; for
                    then there is no regular line bounding the dark and illuminated parts, but the
                    confines of these parts appear as it were toothed and cut with innumerable
                    notches and breaks; and even in the dark part, near the borders of the
                    enlightened surface, there are seen some small spaces enlightened by the sun’s
                    beams. Upon the fourth day after new moon there may be perceived some shining
                    points, like rocks or small islands, within the dark body of the moon; but not
                    far from the confines of light and darkness there are observed other little
                    spaces which join to the enlightened surface, but run out into the dark side,
                    which by degrees change their figure, till at last they come wholly within the
                    illuminated face, and have no dark parts round them at all. Afterwards many more
                    shining spaces are observed to arise by degrees, and to appear within the dark
                    side of the moon, which, before they drew near to the illumined portion of the
                    disk, were invisible, being totally immersed in the shadow. The contrary is
                    observed in the decreasing phases, where the lucid spaces which <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193189380" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9380-0005"/>joined the illuminated
                    surface recede gradually from it, and remain for some time visible after they
                    are quite separated from the confines of light and darkness. Now it is
                    impossible that this should be the case, unless these shining points were higher
                    than the rest of the surface, so that the rays of the sun may illumine their
                    summits before they reach their bases. Portions of considerable extent are also
                    perceived on the lunar surface, which are never brilliant like the other parts,
                    but remain constantly obscure. These are supposed to be deep valleys or
                    cavities: they were formerly supposed to be seas, but, for reasons about to be
                    given, this idea has been abandoned.</p>
                <p>These phenomena render it certain that the surface of the moon is covered with
                    mountains of a great height, with rocks or masses of unknown matter, but
                    possessing the property of reflecting the sun’s light. The height of the lunar
                    mountains may be determined in the following manner.</p>
                <p>Let ABO (fig. 48) be the illuminated hemisphere of the moon, SO the tangential

                    the enlightened from the obscure hemisphere. All the part OD will be in
                    darkness; but if this part contain a mountain <hi rend="smallcaps">öM</hi> so
                    elevated that its summit M reaches the solar ray SO, the point M will be
                    enlightened. Now, if the line OM can be determined by observation, it will be
                    easy to deduce the arc <hi rend="italic">Oa,</hi> and thence the height of the
                    mountain βM, in terms of the moon’s radius. Let E be the place of an observer on

                    O<hi rend="italic">m</hi> perpendicular to EM. The distance of the moon from the
                    earth being known, we have the distance EO: the angle Oem is measured by the

                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi> of the semidiameter of the moon. Schroeter, who
                    estimated the heights of the lunar mountains by measuring the projections of
                    their shadows at the time the sun was near their horizon, makes it in some cases

                    terrestrial radius; the lunar mountains, therefore, in proportion to the
                    diameters of the earth and moon, are nearly five times higher than those of our
                    globe. Their absolute height is above five English miles. It is easy to see that
                    these determinations are susceptible of very little accuracy.</p>
                <p>Not only is the moon’s surface rendered irregular by high and precipitous
                    mountains, but numerous cavities appear in every part of her surface, some of
                    which, according to Schroeter, are upwards of four English miles in depth, and
                    forty in circumference at the orifice. An insulated mountain is frequently
                    observed to rise in the centre of these enormous pits or caverns; and they are
                    surrounded by high annular ridges, the masses of which would exactly fill the
                    inclosed cavities. From this circumstance, it is probable that the elevations
                    and hollows which abound on the surface of the moon have been produced by
                    volcanic eruptions. Herschel imagined that he even observed volcanoes in
                    activity. At the time of the new moon he perceived on different parts of her
                    obscure disk three luminous points, resembling pieces of burning charcoal,
                    covered with a thin coat of white ashes, one of which, by a comparison with the
                    third satellite of Jupiter, appeared to be upwards of three miles in diameter.
                    Their brilliancy continued during several days, undergoing variations altogether
                    independent of the increase of the moon’s apparent magnitude, and at the end of
                    that time they appeared to become extinct.</p>
                <p>The existence of a lunar atmosphere has been a fertile subject of controversy
                    among astronomers. It has been urged that, as the brightness of the moon is
                    sensibly equal at all times when she is not obscured by clouds in the
                    terrestrial atmosphere, she cannot be surrounded by an atmosphere similar to
                    that of our earth, so variable in its density, and so liable to be obscured by
                    clouds and vapours. The assumption of an equable brightness in the appearance of
                    the moon has not, however, been allowed to pass uncontroverted. Hevelius relates
                    that he has several times found in skies perfectly clear, when even stars of the
                    sixth and seventh magnitude were visible, that, at the same altitude of the
                    moon, at the same elongation from the earth, and with the same telescope, the
                    moon and her maculae do not appear equally lucid and clear at all times, but are
                    much brighter and more distinct at some times than at others. Several other
                    observers have noticed that the moon is not always equally conspicuous during
                    total eclipses; a fact which is held to be indicative of accidental variations
                    in the state of the lunar atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Another objection against the existence of a lunar atmosphere is derived from the
                    circumstance that, if it existed, its influence would be perceptible in the
                    occultations of the planets, or fixed stars, by the moon. When the moon
                    approaches so near to a star that part of her atmosphere (supposing she has one)
                    is interposed between the star and the eye of the observer, the star, it is
                    contended, ought to suffer a change in its colour in consequence of the
                    absorption of some of its light in traversing the denser parts of the moon’s
                    atmosphere. But when we consider that the region of the vapours and clouds in
                    the terrestrial atmosphere does not exceed the height of four miles, or the
                    1980th part of the earth’s diameter, and that consequently the obscure part of
                    the lunar atmosphere, supposing it to be similarly constituted, would not
                    subtend an angle of one second (the mean apparent diameter of the moon being
                    1889 seconds), and that this space is passed over by the moon in less than two
                    seconds of time, it will scarcely be expected that observation will be able to
                    decide whether the supposed obscuration takes place or not. Some observers have,
                    however, remarked instances of stars, when about to be occulted, presenting an
                    evident diminution of light. (See a Paper by Mr Ramage of Aberdeen, in the 2d
                    vol. of the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Astronomical Society.')</hi></p>
                <p>The existence of a lunar atmosphere cannot increase or diminish the apparent
                    diameter of the moon, because its effect on the rays of light when they enter it
                    will be exactly counteracted at the time of their emergence. Itmightseem,
                    therefore, that in order to determine whether the light of a star or planet is
                    inflected when it passes very near the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189393"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-9393-0006"/>border of the lunar disk, it would be sufficient
                    to compare; the observed duration of the occultations of the stars, or eclipses
                    of the sun, with the time, calculated from the theory of the moon’s motion,
                    which she consumes in passing through a space equal to her apparent diameter.
                    But if, as is generally supposed, a certain irradiation is produced around
                    luminous objects, by which their image is dilated, the apparent diameter of the
                    moon will thereby be augmented when she is projected on the dark sky. On the
                    contrary, when the disk of the moon is projected on that of the sun in annular
                    eclipses, the irradiation, by dilating the luminous ring which seems to surround
                    the moon, will cause her apparent diameter to appear smaller than it actually
                    is. On this account it becomes very difficult to ascertain by direct measurement
                    the amount of the inflection of light at the border of the lunar disk, or even
                    to be certain of its existence. An indirect method of arriving at the desired
                    object was, however, imagined by Dionis du Séjour, who regarded the irradiation
                    and inflection as two unknown quantities to be determined simultaneously from
                    the observations of the phases of eclipses, upon which their effects are
                    different. The observations best adapted for this purpose arc those of the
                    magnitude of the luminous crescent, and its successive increase in annular
                    eclipses. Du Séjour calculated with great care the annular eclipse of the sun
                    which took place in the year 1764, and was visible over all Europe; and which,
                    by reason of the extent and variety of its phases, presented a great many points
                    of comparison. He particularly employed the observations made in different
                    places of the instants of the formation and rupture of the ring. He likewise
                    confirmed these observations by measurements made by Mr Short, at London, of the
                    distance between the horns of the crescent at divers instants. It resulted, from
                    the comparison of an immense number of observations, that the measurements could
                    not be reconciled without supposing an irradiation of 3" on the semidiamcter of
                    the sun, and an inflection of nearly the same amount round the disk of the moon,
                    produced by her atmosphere. According to this result, the horizontal refraction
                    at the surface of the moon amounts to 1''∙5. The mean horizontal refraction
                    observed at the surface of the earth is 0° ∙585, and consequently about 1400
                    times greater than that at the moon. Hence, supposing the moon’s atmosphere of
                    the same nature as that of the earth, its density must be 1400 times less, and
                    consequently rarer than the most perfect vacuum which can be produced by the
                    best pneumatic machines.</p>
                <p>The existence of a lunar atmosphere, though of small extent, is indicated with
                    considerable probability by the observations of Schroeter, who perceived that
                    some ranges of lunar mountains, when in the dark hemisphere, are illuminated
                    more feebly in proportion as they recede from the boundary of light and
                    darkness; an effect which would be produced by the partial absorption of the
                    rays of light which pass near the moon’s surface. He also remarked the same
                    circumstance with regard to the cusps, and perceived other indications of an
                    atmosphere in some changes of tint, which induced him to think that a twilight
                    might be discernible towards the cusps. With a view to prove the accuracy of
                    this conjecture, he examined the moon with great care under the most favourable
                    circumstances, and at length descried a faint glimmering which he took to be
                    crepuscular light, extending from the cusps into the dark body of the moon.' Its
                    greatest breadth was 2"; and it extended 1' 20" from <hi rend="superscript">
                    i</hi> the cusps, along the circumference of the lunar disk? From these data he
                    computed that the height of the lunar atmosphere, to the limit where it ceases
                    to inflect the rays of light or diminish the brightness of a star, does not
                    exceed 5742 English feet. A ring of this breadth, at the distance of the moon,
                    will subtend an angle of only 0"∙94; hence the almost imperceptible influence of
                    the lunar atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Some observations, related by Mr Ramage of Aberdeen, in a memoir already alluded
                    to, of occultations of Jupiter and his satellites, with an excellent reflecting
                    instrument, also tend to confirm the existence of a small lunar atmosphere. On
                    the approach of the satellites no diminution of their light was perceptible. On
                    coming into contact with the moon’s limb they did not disappear instantly, like
                    fixed stars, but formed an indentation or notch in the limb, as if imbedded in
                    it, but at the same time <hi rend="italic">separated from it by a fine line of
                    light.</hi> The indentation continued visible till about half their diameters
                    were immersed, when it disappeared. <hi rend="italic">(Memoirs of the
                    Astronomical Society of London·,</hi> vol. ii. p. 87.)</p>
                <p>The dark spots on the moon’s surface were formerly supposed to be water; but as
                    elevations and cavities are distinctly perceptible in them, that hypothesis is
                    evidently erroneous. Besides, the extreme tenuity of her atmosphere is
                    inconsistent with the existence of water at her surface. It is only by the
                    weight of the terrestrial atmosphere that the liquids at the surface of the
                    earth are prevented from being dissipated in vapours. If the present atmosphere
                    were removed, every liquid would continue to be dissipated in this manner till a
                    new atmosphere was formed, to which each would contribute in proportion to its
                    elastic force; and the evaporation would only cease when the tension of the
                    vapour of each liquid was equal to its elastic force in a vacuum at the same
                    temperature. But if the vapours were removed as they arose, by any absorbing
                    cause, the evaporation would continue till the liquids entirely disappeared. Now
                    we may suppose this to have been the case with respect to the moon, and that at
                    one time she may have had an atmosphere, which the attractive force of the
                    earth, aided by some accidental circumstance, may have swept away and united
                    with our own. (Biot, <hi rend="italic">Asir. Phys,</hi> tome ii. p. 413.)</p>
                <p>Under these circumstances it is evident, that no animal, similarly constituted to
                    those which inhabit the earth, could respire at the surface of the moon.<note

                    volcanic eruptions; or that, having fulfilled its destiny, it is now in a state

                    the moon, which, for anygiven place on the earth, are much more frequent than
                    those of the sun, and, by reason of certain circumstances about to be explained,

                <p>The earth being an opaque, round body, much smaller than the sun, must project
                    behind it in space a conical shadow, limited by straight lines drawn from the
                    extremities of the sun’s disk to touch the surface of the earth. When the moon
                    enters this shadow, and a portion of her disk is still enlightened by the sun,
                    the enlightened part will necessarily have the form of a luminous crescent, the
                    concavity of which is turned to the conical shadow of the earth; and this
                    appearance will likewise be exhibited when the moon begins to emerge from the
                    shadow. As she approaches towards the shadow, her light is not suddenly
                    eclipsed, but passes insensibly through all the successive gradations of
                    obscurity, till the darkness attains its greatest intensity. The reason of this
                    will be easily comprehended by considering that when an opaque body is placed
                    between an object and the sun, so as to conceal only a part of his disk, the
                    object is then less enlightened than when none of the solar rays are
                    intercepted; and this in proportion as more or less of the sun is concealed.
                    Between full illumination and total obscurity there are consequently
                    intermediate tints and gradations of light, which are denominated the <hi
                    rend="italic">Penumbra,</hi> in contradistinction to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Umbra</hi> which covers those places to which the sun’s rays are completely
                    intercepted. Let S and E (fig. 49) be the centres of the sun and earth, and
                    ABB'A' any plane whatever passing through the axis SE, in which, Iet AB, A'B' be
                    tangents to the sun and earth on opposite sides of the axis SE; these tangents
                    will meet the prolongation of the axis in a point C. Let also AB ʹ, A ʹ B touch
                    the sun and earth on opposite sides of SE, and let C ʹ be their intersection. If
                    we now suppose the plane to turn round the axis SC, a conical shadow or umbra,
                    of which the apex is C, will be formed behind BB'; and if the moon is situated
                    within any part of the cone BCB ʹ, the sun will be entirely invisible. As soon
                    as the moon emerges from this cone, a part at least of the sun’s rays will fall
                    upon her, and she will be in the penumbra. If situated, for example, at M, and
                    MN be drawn to touch the earth and meet the solar disk in N, then the part of
                    that disk between A and N will be visible at M. The extent of the penumbra is
                    therefore determined by the angle DBC. When M is situated in the straight line
                    BD, the whole of the sun’s disk is visible; when M is in BC the sun entirely
                    vanishes, and his visible portion diminishes from the instant M passes BD till
                    it reaches BC. The intensity of the penumbra, therefore, goes on increasing from
                    the first of these limits to the second, where it is confounded with the total
                    darkness. This explains the progressive obscuration of the moon’s disk in her
                    eclipses.</p>
                <p>If we now attempt to determine the circumstances under which an eclipse of the
                    moon can take place, it is obviously necessary to inquire, in the first place,
                    into the length of the conical shadow BCB ʹ; for an eclipse can only happen on
                    the supposition of its extending beyond the orbit of the moon. For this purpose
                    let L’F (fig. 50) be drawn .parallel to AB, and meeting SA in F. We have then
                    sin. T'Γ'Γ&gt; ∙ CΓΓ SF SA— EB ∙ τ&gt; ∙ τ&gt; LCB = sm. SEF = ≈= = = sm. R —
                    sm. ®, R</p>
                <p>SE SE - <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> being the apparent semidiameter of the
                    sun, and∕&gt; his horizontal parallax. By reason of the smallness of these
                    angles the arcs may be substituted for the sines; hence the angle EB</p>
                <p>ECB = R — <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> But CE = —- <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> √∕⅛,
                    therefore making' sin. LCB <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi></p>
                <p>L’B, the radius of the earth, = <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> CE = —— ..</p>
                <p>sin. (R — <hi rend="italic">p)</hi> From this expression it is evident that the
                    value of CE depends on the horizontal parallax, and therefore varies with the
                    sun’s distance from the earth. On calculating, by means of the values of R, <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> given in the preceding
                    sections, the values of CE at the perigean, mean, and apogean distances, the
                    following results will be obtained:—</p>
                <p>Lengths of CE.</p>
                <p>Sun in perigee 212∙896 terrestrial radii.</p>
                <p>at mean distance 216 ’ 531</p>
                <p>in apogee 220∙238</p>
                <p>Now the greatest distance of the moon from the earth is less than 64 terrestrial
                    radii (sect, ii.), consequently the shadow of the earth is projected into space
                    between three and four times farther than the distance of the moon. Hence it
                    appears, that if the moon moved in the ecliptic she would traverse the earth’s
                    shadow and be eclipsed every revolution. On account of the inclination of her
                    orbit to that plane, the eclipses can only happen when she is in or near her
                    nodes. The greatest distances from the nodes at which they can take place are
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Lunar Ecliptic Limits.</hi></p>
                <p>In order to determine these limits, it is necessary first of all to know the
                    apparent diameter of a section of the earth’s shadow, at the place where it is
                    traversed by the orbit of the moon. Let ZMZ ʹ (fig. 50) be a part of the moon’s
                    orbit, intersecting the lines AC and A ʹ C in <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">m';</hi> then <hi rend="italic">mm'</hi> is the geocentric
                    diameter of the shadow, the half of which is measured by the angle <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> EC. Now the angle mEC is the difference between the angles
                    EmA and ECA, the first of which, namely, EmA, is the apparent semidiameter of
                    the earth seen from the moon, or, ’ in other words, the moon’s horizontal
                    parallax. Let this angle, therefore, be denoted by P. It has already been shown
                    that EC A = R— <hi rend="italic">p;</hi> consequently we have w?EC = P + <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> — R in all cases; that is to say, <hi rend="italic">the
                    semidiameter of the shadow is equal to the sum of the horizontdl parallaxes of
                    the sun and moon, diminished by the apparent semidiameter of the sun.</hi> On
                    calculating the amount of this expression from the values of P and <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> given above, the following table will be obtained,
                    exhibiting the magnitude of the apparent diameters of the earth’s shadow for
                    different distances of the sun and moon.</p>
                <p>Apparent diameters of earth’s shadow.</p>

                <p>in perigee 1 31 44*30</p>
                <p>The greatest apparent diameter of the moon being only 33′ 31 ″ ∙07, which is
                    about a third part of the diameter of the earth’s shadow, it follows that the
                    moon may not only be completely enveloped in the shadow, but, since she passes
                    over a <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> space nearly equal to her own breadth in
                    an hour, that she may continue to be totally eclipsed during a space of about
                    two hours.</p>
                <p>The above determination refers only to the umbra or cone of total darkness; but
                    the diameter of the penumbra is obtained in a manner exactly similar. In the
                    same <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189419" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9419-0008"/>diagram
                    the semidiameter of the penumbra is measured •by the visual angle ZEC; but ZEC =
                    E∕C' + EC'ζ and EC? = EC? = C'EA + C'AE; therefore ZEC = EZC'+ C'E A + C'AE; or,
                    retaining the same denominations as above, ŻEC = P+ <hi rend="italic">p</hi> +
                    R. Hence, <hi rend="italic">the semidiameter of the penumbra is equal to the
                    horizontal parallaxes of the moon and sun, augmented by the apparent
                    semidiameter of the sun.</hi></p>
                <p>All the different numerical values of the semidiameter of the. penumbra
                    corresponding to particular positions of the sun and moon may be computed
                    exactly in the same manner as in the case of the umbra.</p>
                <p>The two expressions for the semidiameters of the umbra and penumbra, viz. P + <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> R, and P + <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    + R, give immediately the distance of the moon’s centre from the axis of the
                    cone when her disk comes into contact with the shadow. Representing the apparent
                    semidiameter of the moon by <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> her disk will just touch
                    the umbra when the distance of her centre from the axis SE is equal to P+∕&gt;—R
                    + ^; and it will touch the penumbra when the distance is P+, p + R∙ + r. But on
                    account of the very feeble obscurity of the penumbra towards its extreme border,
                    it is impossible to observe with any degree of precision the time at which the
                    moon enters it. In computing the ecliptic limits, therefore, it is only
                    necessary to have regard to the umbra.</p>
                <p>In the table given above, the extreme values of P + <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> R, the. apparent semidiameter of the earth’s shadow, are ⅜
                    (1° 15' 24"∙30) = 37' 42''∙15, and ⅜ (1° 31' 44"∙30) = 45' 52"·15; and the least
                    and greatest values of <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> the apparent semidiameter of
                    the moon, are respectively 14' 45" and 16' 45" (sect, ii.); therefore the least
                    distance of the moon’s centre from the axis of the shadow at the time of her
                    immergence or emergence is 37' 42"∙15 + 14' 45" = 52' 27"∙15, and the greatest
                    45' 52"∙15 + 16' 45'' = 62' 37"∙15. The first is the limit within which an
                    eclipse must necessarily happen; the last that beyond which it cannot
                    happen.</p>
                <p>It is now easy to ascertain the limits of the moon’s distance from her node,
                    within which the eclipses take place. Let NC (fig. 51) be a portion of the
                    ecliptic, NM part of tfie moon’s orbit, N its node, C the centre of a section of
                    the earth’s shadow, Μ the centre of the moon; the verge of the lunar disk
                    touching, but not penetrating, the shadow at <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> It is
                    evident that, if the moon be at a greater distance than CM from NC, there can be
                    no eclipse. The greatest value of CM, as we have just seen, is 62' 37"∙15, from
                    which the corresponding ecliptic limit NC is easily computed by means of the
                    formula rad. × sin. CM = sin. NC × sin. CNM. Supposing the angle CNM, that is,
                    the inclination of the moon’s orbit to the ecliptic, to be 5°, which is its
                    minimum value, the value of NC is found from the logarithmic tables to be 12° 2'
                    nearly. Hence an eclipse of the moon can only happen when she is within about
                    12° 2' ofher node. Under the most favourable circumstances, however, the limits
                    may extend to 13° 21'. A lunar eclipse will certainly take place if the moon’s
                    distance from her node, at the time of her mean opposition, is not greater than
                    7° 4'.</p>
                <p>When the moon’s disk only comes into contact with the shadow, as in fig. 51, the
                    phenomenon is called an <hi rend="italic">appulse;</hi> when the disk only
                    enters into the shadow in part, the eclipse is said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >partial;</hi> it is called <hi rend="italic">total</hi> if the moon entirely
                    disappears, and <hi rend="italic">central</hi> when her centre coincides with
                    the axis of the cone, or if at the time of the eclipse the moon is exactly in
                    her node.</p>
                <p>In the preceding determinations the shadow has been supposed to be conical,
                    whereas, on account of the compression of the earth at the poles, it is not
                    exactly a cone, but a conoid on. an elliptic base; and it varies at every
                    instant by reason of the earth’s rotation. To determine rigorously the figure of
                    the cone at every instant, and the diameter of its section where the moon enters
                    and leaves it, would require calculations of great complication and prolixity.
                    Such precision is, however, unnecessary; and indeed it is impossible to attain
                    to absolute accuracy so long as the figure of the earth is not exactly known. It
                    is usual and natural to employ the largest diameter which the shadow can have at
                    the distance of the moon.</p>
                <p>It has also been supposed that the shadow is terminated by tangents to the sun
                    and the earth; that is to say, that all the rays of light which are not
                    obstructed by the globe of the earth pass in straight lines from the sun to the
                    moon. But the earth being surrounded by an atmosphere which near the surface
                    exerts a powerful action on the solar rays, it is to be presumed that those rays
                    which, if unobstructed, would glance by the surface of the earth, are absorbed
                    by the lower strata of the atmosphere. The effect of this will be to enlarge the
                    diameter of the shadow; and the requisite correction may be regarded as an
                    augmentation of the earth’s radius, by adding to it a part of the atmosphere;
                    or, which amounts to the same thing, an augmentation of the lunar parallax. Now,
                    it is found by experience that such a correction is necessary; and, according to
                    Mayer, the lunar parallax must be augmented by a 60th part in order to satisfy
                    the observations.</p>
                <p>Another effect of the action of the earth’s atmosphere on the solar rays is to
                    render the moon dimly visible even when she is totally eclipsed,—a circumstance
                    to which allusion was made in the preceding section. Let the circle <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi><hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic">lι i</hi> (fig.
                    52) concentric to the earth include that part of the atmosphere which is
                    sufficiently dense to produce a sensible refraction of the rays of light. All
                    those rays which do not fall within that circle, such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >N</hi> ∖ <hi rend="italic">fw, Niv,</hi> proceed in their direct course without
                    suffering any refraction; but those which enter the atmosphere between <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> and <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> and between <hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">l,</hi> on opposite sides of the earth, are
                    gradually more bent inward as they go through a greater portion of the
                    atmosphere, until the rays W7eand V/, touching the earth at <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> are bent so much as to meet at <hi
                    rend="italic">q,</hi> a little short of the moon; and therefore the dark shadow
                    of the earth is contained in the space <hi rend="italic">mopqm,</hi> where none
                    of the sun’s rays can enter; all the rest, R, R, being mixed by the scattered
                    rays which are refracted as above, is in some measure enlightened by them; and
                    some of those rays falling on the moon, give her the colour of tarnished copper,
                    or of iron almost red-hot; so that if the earth had no atmosphere, the moon
                    would be as invisible in total eclipses as she is when new. If the moon were so
                    near the earth as to go into its dark shadow, suppose about <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> or <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> she would be invisible during her stay in
                    it, but visible before and after in the fainter shadow R R.</p>
                <p>After having pointed out the general phenomena of the lunar eclipses, and the
                    limits within which they take place, it only remains to show in what manner the
                    time of their commencement, end, and duration, and also their magnitude, may be
                    determined by computation.</p>
                <p>Let the line NE (fig. 53) represent the ecliptic, NO the orbit of the moon, C the
                    centre of the terrestrial· shadow, and Μ the centre of the moon at the instant
                    of the opposition; then CM will be the circle of latitude on which the
                    opposition takes place. The centre of the shadow C being always in opposition
                    with the sun, moves along the ecliptic from west to east, or from N towards E,
                    with the same velocity as the sun. The moon also, at the same time, moves in her
                    orbit from west to east, or from N towards 0. Now the velocities of these two
                    motions are given by the astronomical tables, and the question is to determine
                    the instant of time at which the circles <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189432"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-9432-0009"/>representing sections of the moon and the earth s
                    shadow • meet each other either before or after the opposition.</p>
                <p>' At the time of an eclipse the apparent distance of the centre of the shadow
                    from the moon is very small, consequently CM, and also the differences of the
                    respective longitudes and latitudes of C and Μ, may be regarded as straight
                    lines. During the short iuterval between the commencement and end of an eclipse,
                    the motion of the sun, and consequently that of the centre of the shadow, may
                    likewise be regarded as uniform. By these suppositions, sufficiently accurate
                    for our present purpose, the problem is considerably simplified.</p>
                <p>Suppose now that C' and Μ' are two simultaneous positions of the shadow and moon
                    at any instant before or after the opposition. Let Μ' P be perpendicular, and MQ
                    parallel, to NE. The velocities of the moon and terrestrial shadow being known
                    from the tables, the lines C' P and Q M', which represent the mutions of the
                    centre of the moon relatively to that of the shadow in longitude and latitude,
                    are known also; whence C' P and P Μ' are given, and consequently C' Μ' the
                    distance of the centres. Let us assume</p>
                <p>λ = CM or ]) ’s latitude when in opposition, s = ø’s motion in longitude, <hi

                    the distance of the centres.</p>
                <p>Now, since we suppose that CP and QM' are the 5 ’s motion in longitude and
                    latitude respectively in the time <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> it is evident that
                    CP = <hi rend="italic">m t,</hi> and QM' = <hi rend="italic">n t.</hi> But CC'
                    is the sun’s motion, or the motion of the terrestrial shadow in longitude during
                    the same time; therefore CC'= <hi rend="italic">st.</hi> We have then C'P = <hi

                <p>In this quadratic equation, if <hi rend="italic">t</hi> is regarded as the

                <p>The first of these denotes the time at which the moon enters, and the second that
                    at which she quits, the umbra or penumbra.</p>
                <p>The time at which the different phases of the eclipse happen, are calculated
                    directly from this equation. If, for example, we wish to determine the time at
                    which the moon’s disk begins to enter the shadow, we make c = P <hi
                    rend="italic">+ p</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> R + r (neglecting the small
                    augmentation of the shadow occasioned by the refraction of the atmosphere). In
                    the case of the penumbra we must take <hi rend="italic">c = PA-p-Ļ-</hi> R + r;
                    and it is evident that, if in either case λ is of such a magnitude that <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> is less than λ cos. <hi rend="italic">β,</hi> the value of
                    <hi rend="italic">t</hi> will be impossible; in other words, no eclipse can take
                    place.</p>
                <p>If we suppose P+77 — R+r = λ cos. <hi rend="italic">ô,</hi> the two values ' of
                    <hi rend="italic">t</hi> will be equal, and the duration of the phase will only
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> be for an instant, as in the case of the appulse,
                    in which the <hi rend="superscript"> κ</hi> moon’s limb just touches the shadow
                    without entering it. In general, the portion of the diameter of the eclipsed
                    part is P +77—R∙ + r — λ cos. <hi rend="italic">ô</hi>; and consequently the
                    diameter of the part not eclipsed is equal to the diameter of the moon, or <hi
                    rend="italic">2r,</hi> minus this quantity, that is, equal to λ cos. ∂ — P —77 +
                    R + r. When this expression is equal to nothing the eclipse is just a total one;
                    when negative, the upper boundary of the moon’s limb will be under the upper
                    boundary of the section of the shadow, and the total eclipse will continue for
                    some time.</p>
                <p>The instant at which the middle of the eclipse happens will evidently be that at
                    which the two values of <hi rend="italic">t</hi> are equal, or when the radical
                    disappears, that is, when c = λ cos. <hi rend="italic">ô.</hi> In this case ŕ =—

                <p>will be ⅛-pp × 12 = 8∙96 digits.</p>
                <p>The obscurity of the penumbra renders observations of the commencement and
                    termination of the lunar eclipses extremely uncertain. To obviate in some degree
                    this inconvenience, care is taken to observe as accurately as possible the
                    instants at which the shadow arrives at or passes different known spots on the
                    moon’s disk; so that the same eclipse offers in fact a great number of different
                    observations, the mean of which may be regarded as more certain than any
                    individual one. But after all the precautions that can be taken, the eclipses of
                    the moon are far from affording results equally precise and certain as those of
                    the sun. They were formerly of much greater importance than they are in the
                    present state of astronomy; for the ancients had no other means of determining
                    the geographical longitudes of places on the earth. In fact, as the eclipse is
                    occasioned by the moon’s being deprived of her light, the different phases of
                    the eclipse happen at exactly the same physical instant of time to all observers
                    to whom the moon is visible. The difference of the time reckoned by two
                    observers at the instant of the phenomenon will therefore give the difference of
                    the horary angles, or of their meridians; but supposing each to have made a
                    mistake of 4 minutes of time in an opposite sense (and the ancients could
                    scarcely guarantee a greater degree of accuracy), the resulting error in the
                    difference of longitude would amount to 2°. The geographical tables of Ptolemy
                    contain errors of still greater magnitude.</p>
                <p>2.— <hi rend="italic">Eclipses of the Sun.</hi></p>
                <p>The eclipses of the sun are caused by the interposition of the moon between the
                    sun and the earth, and their general phenomena may be explained in the same
                    manner as those of the moon. When the conical shadow which the moon projects
                    behind her in space reaches the earth, those points of the earth’s surface on
                    which it falls are completely deprived of the light of the sun, and involved in
                    total darkness. Those parts of the earth which aré covered by the penumbra arc
                    only partially deprived of the sun’s light, because the moon does not conceal
                    the whole, but only a part of the solar disk.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189445" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9445-0010"/>
                <p>In order to appreciate the different circumstances of a solar eclipse, the
                    procedure to be adopted is in many respects the same as that which has been
                    explained in regard to the eclipses of the moon. The length of the moon’s
                    shadow, the first object of inquiry, is found exactly in the same manner as that
                    of the earth; and it is only necessary to substitute in the formulae already
                    given the values of the apparent diameter and parallax of the sun which they
                    would have at the surface of the moon. Now, these values are easily found, for
                    the diameter of the sun as seen from the moon is equal to his diameter as seen
                    from the earth, increased in the ratio of the distances of the moon and earth
                    from the sun. In the same manner the parallax of the sun relatively to the moon
                    is equal to his parallax relatively to the earth, augmented in the ratio of the
                    distances, and diminished in the ratio of the diameters, of the moon and earth.
                    Thus, let D represent the distance of the earth from the sun, <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> the moon’s distance from the sun, <hi rend="italic">m</hi> the moon’s
                    true semidiameter, and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> the semidiameter of the earth;
                    the sun’s apparent semidiameter as seen from the moon will be R ∙ (R being his
                    apparent semidiameter as seen from the earth), and his horizontal parallax will

                    shadow CE (fig. 50), namely, ——-∕ r, adapted to the case of the moon, becomes
                    sm. (R— <hi rend="italic">p)</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> r</hi></p>

                <p>tween the centre of the moon and the apex of her shadow. By means of this formula
                    the following results, which refer to the extreme cases in which the length of
                    the shadow is a maximum and minimum comparatively with the moon’s distance from
                    the earth, may be computed.</p>
                <p>Length of Moon’s shadow. distance.</p>
                <p>Sun in apogee, Moon in perigee, 59∙730 55∙902</p>
                <p>Sun in perigee, Moon in apogee, 57*760 63∙862</p>
                <p>In the first case the shadow of the moon will reach beyond the centre of the
                    earth; in the second it will not reach even to the surface. It follows,
                    therefore, that even if the orbit of the moon coincided with the ecliptic, she
                    would not produce a total obscurity every time she comes between the sun and the
                    earth. At her greatest distances, where the shadow does not reach the earth, the
                    effect of her interposition would be to conceal only a part of the sun’s
                    disk.</p>
                <p>By introducing into the other formulae modifications similar to the above, we
                    shall find the apparent diameter of the shadow and the solar ecliptic limits.
                    The apparent semidiameter of the earth’s shadow has been shown to be equal to P
                    + <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> R; consequently the
                    semidiameter of the lunar shadow at the distance of the earth, as seen by an
                    observer placed on the moon, is equal to the parallax of the earth, plus the
                    parallax of the sun relatively to the moon, minus the apparent semidiameter of
                    the sun seen from the moon. The parallax of the earth means simply the apparent
                    semidiameter of the moon seen from the earth; and if we neglect the parallax of
                    the sun, which cannot influence the result to the extent of half a second, we
                    shall have the following theorem: <hi rend="italic">The semidiameter of the
                    lunar shadow is equal to the excess of the apparent semidiameter of the moon

                <p>If to the apparent semidiameter of the shadow at the point where it is ouched by
                    the earth, we add the apparent semidiameter of the earth as seen from the moon,
                    that is to say, the moon’s horizontal parallax (P), the distance between the
                    centres of the moon’s shadow and of the earth will be p</p>

                    readily computed. The result of the computation is, that a solar eclipse may
                    take place if the moon’s distance from her node, at the time of her mean
                    conjunction with the sun, does not exceed 19° 44'. If her distance from the node
                    is less than 13° 33', the sun will certainly be eclipsed in some part of the
                    world.</p>
                <p>The solar eclipses present a great variety of appearances, depending on the
                    relative positions of the sun, the moon, and the spectator. If the apparent
                    diameter of the moon happens to surpass that of the sun, the eclipse will be <hi
                    rend="italic">total</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but if the moon’s diameter be
                    the smaller, the observer will see a luminous ring, formed by that part of the
                    sun’s disk which exceeds that of the moon, and the eclipse will in that case be
                    <hi rend="italic">annular.</hi> If the centre of the moon is not in the same
                    straight line which joins the observer and the centre of the sun, the eclipse
                    can only be <hi rend="italic">partial,</hi> as the moon can only conceal a <hi
                    rend="italic">part</hi> of the sun’s disk. When the moon merely touches without
                    penetrating the solar disk, the phenomenon is called an <hi rend="italic"
                    >appulse</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the eclipse is <hi rend="italic"
                    >central</hi> if the observer is placed at the centre of the shadow, on the
                    straight line joining the centres of the sun and moon.</p>
                <p>When the change happens within 17 degrees of the node, and the moon is at her
                    mean distance from the earth, the point of her shadow just touches the earth,
                    and she eclipses the sun totally to that small spot whereon her shadow falls;
                    but the darkness is not of a moment’s continuance.</p>
                <p>The moon’s apparent diameter, when largest, exceeds the sun’s, when least, only
                    two minutes of a degree; so that in the greatest eclipse of the sun that can
                    happen at any time and place, the total darkness continues no longer than whilst
                    the moon passes over two minutes in her orbit, that is, about 3 minutes and 56
                    seconds of an hour.</p>
                <p>The moon’s shadow covers only a spot on the earth’s surface about 180 English
                    miles broad, when her diameter appears largest, and the sun’s least; and the
                    total darkness can extend no farther than the limits of the dark shadow. Yet the
                    partial shadow or penumbra may then cover a circular space 4900 miles in
                    diameter, within all which the sun is more or less eclipsed, as the places are
                    less or more distant from the centre of the penumbra. When the moon changes
                    exactly in the node, the penumbra is circular on the earth at the middle of the
                    general eclipse, because at <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189458"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-9458-0011"/>that time it falls perpendicularly on the earth’s
                    surface; but at every other moment it falls obliquely, and will therefore be
                    elliptical; and the more so as the time is longer before or after the middle of
                    the general eclipse; and then much greater portions of the earth’s surface are
                    involved in the penumbra.</p>
                <p>To make several of the above and other phenomena plainer, let S (fig. 52) be the
                    sun, E the earth, M the moon, and AMP the moon’s orbit. Draw the straight line W

                    of the earth, because in this figure the moon is supposed to be at her mean
                    distance from the earth. Had the moon been in her perigee, the shadow would have
                    covered a space on the surface of the earth of about 180 miles in diameter, to
                    all places within which space the eclipse would have been total. Had she been in
                    her apogee, the shadow would have terminated in a point above <hi rend="italic"
                    >e,</hi> and to an observer at <hi rend="italic">e</hi> the sun would have been
                    eclipsed annularly. Draw the straight lines WXtZΛ and VXcy, touching the

                    when the moon is at M, and the sun’s eclipse begins at <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but at the same moment of absolute time, to an
                    observer at <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> the western edge of the moon at c leaves
                    the eastern edge of the sun at V, and the eclipse ends. At the very same
                    instant, to all those who live on the circle next to <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi>
                    the moon cuts off or darkens a twelfth part of the sun, and eclipses him one
                    digit; to those who live on the next interior circle, the moon cuts off two
                    twelfth parts of the sun; to those on the following circle, three parts; and so
                    on to the centre at <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> where the sun is centrally
                    eclipsed. The different appearances of the eclipse, as seen by spectators in
                    these different situations, with regard to the centre of the shadow, are
                    represented in fig. 54, under which figure there is a scale of hours and
                    minutes, to show at a mean state how long it is from the beginning to the end of
                    a central eclipse of the sun on the parallel of London, and how many digits are
                    eclipsed at any particular time from the beginning at A to the middle at B or
                    the end at C. Thus, in 16 minutes from the beginning, the sun is two digits
                    eclipsed; in an hour and five minutes, eight digits; and in an hour and 37
                    minutes, 12 digits.</p>
                <p>Having determined the diameter of the moon’s shadow at the earth, and the limits
                    within which eclipses of the sun can take place, the next object is to determine
                    the time of their commencement and termination. If the position of the observer
                    were on the moon instead of the ' surface of the earth, our solar eclipses would
                    appear to <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> him as eclipses of the earth, and they
                    would commence at the instant when the earth’s disk began to penetrate the lunar
                    shadow. A spectator so situated might therefore compute all the circumstances of
                    a terrestrial eclipse in exactly the same manner in which we compute those of
                    the moon; the same formulae would suffice, with the slight modifications which
                    have already been made. But relatively to an observer placed on the earth the
                    case is altogether different. To him the eclipse does not begin when the moon’s
                    shadow comes into contact with the earth’s disk, but when it begins to obscure
                    his station. This, therefore, is one circumstance which renders the computation
                    of solar more complicated and difficult than that of lunar eclipses; for it is
                    necessary not only to determine generally what portion of the terrestrial disk
                    is covered by the shadow, but also its position relatively to the equator and to
                    a given meridian, and likewise the path described by the centre and contour of
                    the umbra and penumbra on the surface of the earth. There is another
                    circumstance which still further augments the difficulty of the computation,
                    namely, the position of the observer, on account of which it is necessary to
                    introduce the particular conditions which depend on the parallax. In the case of
                    a lunar eclipse, it is only necessary that the moon’s disk enter the earth’s
                    shadow in order that the eclipse may be visible to any part of the terrestrial
                    hemisphere opposite to the moon; but a solar eclipse may happen in some parts of
                    the earth without being visible at others—a circumstance which is occasioned
                    entirely by parallax.</p>
                <p>When we abstract from the effects of parallax, or suppose the observer to be
                    placed at the centre of the earth, the problem of determining the different
                    circumstances of a solar eclipse is exactly the same as that relative to an
                    eclipse of the moon. But when the spectator is supposed to be placed at the
                    surface, the latitudes and longitudes corresponding to his situation are
                    different from the geocentric latitudes and longitudes; and in order to adapt
                    the formula from which the time is given to these new circumstances, it is
                    necessary, as a preliminary step, to compute the corrections which must be
                    applied in consequence of the effects of parallax in longitude and latitude. The
                    chief circumstance, therefore, in which the calculation of solar eclipses
                    differs from that of lunar, consists in its being necessary to compute the
                    effect of parallax in the direction of the angular distances which form the data
                    of the problem, in order to apply the requisite correction to the values of
                    those distances furnished by the tables. The development of these computations
                    belongs to Practical Astronomy.</p>
                <p>The sun’s ecliptic limits exceeding 17° 21', while those of the moon are only 11°
                    26', it follows that the eclipses of the sun must be much more frequent than
                    those of the moon. Yet the lunar eclipses being visible to every part of the
                    terrestrial hemisphere opposite to the sun, and those of the sun visible only to
                    the small portion of the hemisphere on which the moon’s shadow falls, it happens
                    that for any particular place on the earth the lunar eclipses are much more
                    frequently visible.</p>
                <p>In any year the number of eclipses of both luminaries: cannot be less than two,
                    nor more than seven: the most <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> usual number is
                    four, and it is very rare to have more than <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> six;
                    for the sun passes through both the nodes but once a year, unless he passes
                    through one of them in the beginning of the year; and if he does, he will pass
                    through the same node again a little before the year is finished; because, as
                    these points move 19^ degrees backwards every year, the sun will come to either
                    of them 173 days after the other; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189471"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-9471-0012"/>and. when either node is within 17 degrees of the
                    sun, at the time of new moon, the sun will be eclipsed. At the subsequent
                    opposition, the moon will be eclipsed in the other node, and come round to the
                    next conjunction again ere the former node be 17 degrees past the sun, and will
                    therefore eclipse him a second time. When three eclipses take place about either
                    node, the like number generally happens about the opposite, as the sun comes to
                    it in 173 days afterwards; and six lunations contain but four days more. Thus,
                    there may be two eclipses of the sun and one. of the moon about each of her
                    nodes. But when the moon changes in one of the nodes, she cannot be near enough
                    the other node at the next full to be eclipsed; and in six lunar months
                    afterwards she will change nearer the other node: in these cases there can be
                    but two eclipses in a year, and they are both of the sun.</p>
                <p>The eclipses of the sun being of great importance for the determination of
                    geographical longitudes, it is of consequence to be in possession of some easy
                    method of assigning the time at which they may be expected to occur, in order to
                    avoid the necessity of long and tedious calculations. This may be done in a very
                    simple manner, by considering that if a time can be assigned after which the sun
                    and moon occupy exactly or nearly the same positions with regard to the nodes of
                    the lunar orbit, their motions after that interval will recommence under the
                    same circumstances, and the eclipses be reproduced in the same order. Now, it
                    has been shown (chap. iii. sect. 2) that the nodes of the lunar orbit retrograde
                    at the rate of 19° ∙3286 in a year, consequently the time in which the sun
                    returns to the moon’s node is that which he requires to describe an arc of 360°
                    — 19° ∙3286, or, as is found by a simple proportion, 346*619851 days. On
                    comparing this with 29∙5305887 days, the time of a lunation, it will be observed
                    that these, numbers are nearly in the ratio of 223 to 19, so that after 223
                    synodic revolutions the moon has returned 19 times to the same position
                    relatively to the sun. But 223 synodic revolutions are completed in 18 mean
                    solar years and 10 or 11 days, consequently after that interval all the
                    eclipses, whether of the sun or the moon, return again in nearly the same order;
                    which gives a very simple means of predicting them, since only 18 years of
                    observation are required. This period was known to the astronomers of the
                    remotest ages, and is generally supposed to be that which the Chaldeans
                    distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic">Saros.</hi> (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Part</hi> I. of this article.)</p>
                <p>But the ratio of 223 to 19 is not exact, and it is besides subject to variation
                    from the secular inequalities of the sun and moon, by reason of which the rates
                    of their mean motions are sensibly changed. Discordancies will hence arise; and
                    in the course of time the order of eclipses observed in one of these periods
                    will require correction. But the variations are slow and gradual; the lunisolar
                    periods may, therefore, continue to be employed when approximative results only
                    are required. When rigorous accuracy is wanted, recourse must be had to
                    computation from the astronomical tables.</p>
                <p>Occultations of planets and stars by the moon are phenomena of which the
                    calculation depends on exactly the same principles, and is even made by the help
                    of the same formulae,’as the eclipses of the sun. Let E (fig. 55) denote the
                    centre of the earth, Μ that of the moon, and S a star or planet concealed by the
                    moon; the straight line SM will represent the axis of the lunar shadow, that is
                    to say, the portion of space which the rays proceeding from the star cannot
                    reach in consequence of their being intercepted by the moon; and the angle EMO
                    (EO being perpendicular to SM) will be the apparent distance of the centre of
                    the .shadow from the centre of the earth.</p>
                <p>The expression for this angle m a function of the time is obtained in exactly the
                    same manner as in solar eclipses; and by equating it with the different values
                    of the angle which correspond to the different phases of the occultation, and
                    regarding the time as the unknown quantity, the epochs will be obtained at which
                    the phases take place. There is only one circumstance which renders a slight
                    modification of the formulae necessary. In computing the angle SEM, or the
                    apparent distance of the centres of the star and moon seen from the centre of
                    the earth, that distance may be regarded in solar eclipses as the hypothenuse of
                    a right-angled triangle, the sides of which are respectively the latitude of the
                    moon, and the difference between the longitudes&gt;of the moon and sun. But, in
                    occultations of the planets or stars, the star may be. out of the ecliptic, and
                    consequently its latitude not zero; so that the sides of the right-angled
                    .triangle, of which the apparent distance of the centres is the hypothenuse, are
                    the difference of latitude of the star and moon, and the difference of longitude
                    reduced to the moon’s place, that is to say, multiplied by the cosine of the
                    moon’s latitude. It is evident that any of the planets may suffer an.
                    occultation by the moon; but with regard to the fixed stars, it is only those
                    which are situated at a distance from the, ecliptic not greater than the moon’s
                    extreme latitude, that can ever be hid by the interposition of the lunar
                    disk.</p>
                <p>The following is a list of all the solar eclipses that will be visible in this
                    country during the present century. The time of the commencement of the eclipse,
                    and the number of digits eclipsed, are computed for the middle of England. (Sec

                    <hi rend="italic">General Phenomena of the Planetary Motions.</hi></p>
                <p>Having now described the motions and explained the phenomena of the sun and moon,
                    our attention will be next occupied by the planets, those no less interesting
                    bodies, whose remarkable peculiarities of apparent motion have attracted the
                    curiosity, and formed a principal object of the labours, of astronomers in all
                    ages. The sun and moon move among the stars always in the same direction, and
                    with velocities nearly uniform; but the planets, though their apparent motions
                    are most frequently from west to east, sometimes appear to have no proper
                    motions, or to remain stationary among the fixed stars; at other times they
                    appear to move in a contrary direction, or to retrograde; and hence the earth
                    cannot be the centre of the planetary orbits. The determination of that centre,
                    and the order of distance in which the orbits of the different planets are
                    placed around it, is comparatively an easy task since the telescope and
                    micrometer have made us acquainted with the phases and variations of the
                    apparent diameters of the planets; but the ancients, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >who</hi> were guided by the apparent motions alone, found greater difficulty in
                    extricating the elements of their theories from observations, and in framing
                    hypotheses by which the phenomena could be represented with tolerable accuracy.
                    The different hypotheses which have been proposed for this purpose are called,
                    with sufficient impropriety, <hi rend="italic">Systems of the World.</hi></p>
                <p>In order to obtain a general notion of the path traced by a planet in the
                    heavens, it is necessary to attend closely to the various phenomena which it
                    exhibits. As an example, we may take Venus, the most brilliant and remarkable of
                    all the planets.</p>
                <p>A slight attention to the position of Venus, continued a few days, suffices to
                    show that she changes her place with considerable rapidity among the fixed
                    stars. If we observe her in the evening, we shall soon find that her greatest
                    distance from the sun never exceeds an arc of about 47°; that after attaining
                    this distance she begins again to approach the sun, the time which she continues
                    above the horizon after sunset gradually diminishing, till at last she sets
                    simultaneously with the “un, and is lost in the effulgence of his rays. From the
                    circumstance of her appearing in the evening, and not remaining visible more
                    than about three hours after the sun has descended below the horizon, Venus has
                    obtained the name of ’ E&lt;mgoc, Hesperus, or the evening star; sometimes also
                    she is called the shepherd’s star.</p>
                <p>A few days after the evening star has disappeared, a brilliant star is observed
                    in the morning preceding the sun in the east, which was not seen while Venus
                    followed him in the west. At first it rises only a few minutes before the sun,
                    but every succeeding morning somewhat earlier, till its distance from him is
                    between 45 and 47 degrees. It then begins gradually to fall back; its elongation
                    or distance from the sun becomes less and less, till it approaches so near to
                    him as to be again lost in his rays. This has been called Φωff⅛sogoj, Lucifer,
                    or the morning star.</p>
                <p>Hesperus and Lucifer were long regarded as different stars. It could not fail,
                    however, to be remarked, that during the time the first continues to shine in
                    the evening, the other is invisible in the morning, and as soon as the bright
                    harbinger of day makes its appearance, the evening star ceases to be visible. It
                    was, besides, observed that the one star disappears within a very short distance
                    from the sun, and that the other, wnen first seen after its periodical
                    disappearance, is equally near to him on the opposite side. The distance which
                    each recedes from the sun was likewise remarked to be the same; and the times
                    during which they are alternately visible were found to be equal. These
                    phenomena led some bolder genius to affirm that Hesperus and Lucifer are the
                    same star, which is alternately visible in the morning and evening, according as
                    it precedes or falls behind, the sun. Obvious as this conclusion is, it was not
                    arrived at till after many <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> ages of reflection and
                    experience.</p>
                <p>Since Venus never appears at a greater distance from the sun than about 47°, it
                    is evident that the earth is neither the centre of her orbit, nor included
                    within it; for in either case she would sometimes, like the moon, be seen in
                    opposition to the sun. From the appearances which have as yet been described, it
                    can only be inferred that Venus is a satellite of the sun, and that her orbit is
                    carried along with him in his annual revolution in the ecliptic; but the
                    phenomena which she presents when seen through the telescope afford the means of
                    deducing more definite conclusions.</p>
                <p>When Venus, after having been for some time visible in the evening, begins to
                    approach the sun, she appears through the telescope as a fine luminous crescent,
                    the horns of which are turned towards the east, and which becomes narrower as
                    her distance from the sun diminishes. After she has passed the sun, and begins
                    to appear in the morning, the horns of the crescent are turned towards the west,
                    and its breadth gradually enlarges in proportion as the planet recedes from the
                    sun, till she has gained her greatest elongation, when her disk becomes a
                    semicircle. After this she begins to approach the sun with an accelerated
                    motion, and her disk becomes gibbous, the illuminated or visible part being
                    greater than a semicircle; and when she overtakes the sun, her disk has attained
                    the dimensions of a full orb. Having passed the sun, the orb begins again to
                    contract, and passes through the same gradation of changes on the eastern side
                    of the sun, till the planet comes again into conjunction, when it vanishes
                    entirely. All these phases, which nearly resemble those of the moon, are
                    illustrated∙by fig. 56. When Venus is in the superior conjunction at A, or in
                    the same straight line with the sun, she presents the full orb, because the
                    hemisphere enlightened by the sun is turned directly towards the earth at E∙
                    Arrived at B, the illuminated hemisphere is not turned exactly towards the
                    earth, and consequently one side of her orb must appear elliptical, the major
                    axis being to the minor as radius to the cosine of the inclination of the planes
                    of illumination and vision, as was shown in explaining the phases of the moon.
                    (Chap. iii. sect. 1.) At C, where the straight lines drawn from the planet to
                    the earth and sun form a right angle, the minor axis of the ellipse vanishes,
                    and we have the half-illuminated orb. At D only a small portion of the
                    enlightened hemisphere is visible from E; and when the planet arrives at F, the
                    inferior conjunction, her dark side is wholly turned towards the earth, and she
                    is invisible.</p>
                <p>Mercury exhibits phenomena exactly analogous to those of Venus. Like Venus, he
                    oscillates on opposite sides of the sun; but his oscillations are much quicker,
                    and performed in a much smaller arc. His greatest elongation or distance from
                    the sun does not exceed 28° 20'; so that he never appears above the horizon
                    longer than an hour and 50 minutes after sunset or before sunrise. He emits a
                    very vivid white light; but, by reason of his proximity to the sun, he is seldom
                    visible to the naked eye. His phases resemble those of Venus, and he is
                    frequently seen as a dark spot passing over the sun’s disk.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189497" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9497-0014"/>
                <p>From these phenomena several important conclusions may be drawn. In the first
                    place, Mercury and Venus are opaque bodies, which are only visible in
                    consequence of the sun’s rays reflected from their surfaces. In the second
                    place, their orbits are described about the sun, and do not embrace the earth,
                    because both planets pass between the sun and the earth, and their digression
                    from the sun never exceeds a certain limit. For this reason they are called <hi
                    rend="italic">Inferior Planets.</hi> In the third place, since the digressions
                    of Venus are much more considerable than those of Mercury, it is obvious that
                    her orbit includes that of Mercury. This last fact is established by other
                    phenomena. Their angular velocities may be compared by means of the times which
                    they respectively employ in returning to their conjunctions; and in this way it
                    is found that the angular velocity of Mercury is nearly three times greater than
                    that of Venus—a circumstance of itself sufficiently indicative of his greater
                    proximity to the sun. But the occultation of one of these planets by the other
                    furnishes a decisive evidence of the disposition of their orbits. On the 17th of
                    May 1737 Mercury was observed to be eclipsed by Venus near their inferior
                    conjunction; whence it follows that Venus is nearer the earth, and consequently
                    at a greater distance from the sun. This fact was known to the Egyptians, and
                    the name of the <hi rend="italic">Egyptian System</hi> given to that theory
                    according to which Mercury and Venus were regarded as satellites of the sun; but
                    as the ancient astronomers were unacquainted with one of its strongest proofs,
                    namely, the transits, and could only form inferences from the digressions, it
                    was not generally adopted by them.</p>
                <p>The revolution of Venus and Mercury about the sun may also be inferred from the
                    variations of their apparent diameters, although, on account of the unequal
                    distances of the sun from the earth, these variations are subject to
                    considerable irregularities. When Venus approaches nearest to the earth, her
                    apparent diameter subtends an angle of about 61", while it does not amount to
                    lö" when she is at her greatest distance. The apparent diameter of Mercury
                    varies from 12" to 5", indicating corresponding variations of distance. These
                    variations of his apparent diameter are not sensible to the naked eye, on
                    account of the irradiation which surrounds the disks of the planets, and which
                    renders it impossible to form any correct judgment respecting the magnitudes of
                    small luminous objects seen from so great a distance.</p>
                <p>The phenomena of the other planets differ in some respects from those of Mercury
                    and Venus. Instead of remaining constantly within a certain distance from the
                    sun, their angles of elongation assume all possible values, and they are
                    frequently seen in opposition, and consequently more distant from him than the
                    earth is. Their orbits, therefore, embrace the earth; and as they are never
                    observed in their conjunctions to pass, like the inferior planets, over the
                    sun’s disk, even when the direction of their motion traverses the sun, it
                    follows that the sun is also included within their orbits. This fact is rendered
                    certain by the appearance of their disks at the time when they are in
                    conjunction. If they were then placed between the sun and the earth, their disks
                    would appear cornicular, like those of Mercury and Venus; but they uniformly
                    present a full orb at the time of their conjunction, and consequently the same
                    hemisphere is presented to the earth and the sun, at least if, as is certain,
                    they derive their light from him. They must therefore be situated beyond the
                    sun. From the circumstance that their orbits, include both the earth and the
                    sun, they are called <hi rend="italic">Superior Planets.</hi> In order to
                    determine whether the sun or the earth is the centre of their motions, it will
                    be convenient to have recourse to observations of their apparent diameters,
                    which, if their orbits are circular, and have the earth in their centre, will
                    always be of the same magnitude. But the apparent diameter of Mars gradually
                    increases from his conjunction to his opposition; and therefore, since the
                    distance of the planet is directly proportional to the magnitude of its apparent
                    diameter, Mars is nearer to the earth at his opposition than at his conjunction.
                    The variations of the apparent diameter of this planet are very considerable,
                    the limits being 18"∙28 and 3"∙6; so that Mars is five times farther from the
                    earth at his greatest distance than at his least. His orbit, therefore, cannot
                    be a circle described about the earth. We might indeed suppose it to be an
                    ellipse, or other elongated curve; but the enormous eccentricity which it would
                    be necessary to assign to it renders this supposition extremely improbable. The
                    analogy of Venus and Mercury will rather lead us to infer that the sun is the
                    centre of his motion; and of this we have a geometrical proof in the
                    circumstance that the difference of his greatest and least distances is equal to
                    the diameter of the earth’s orbit. Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus, present exactly
                    similar phenomena. We therefore conclude in the same manner that they are
                    superior planets, circulating about the sun.</p>
                <p>The order of distance in which the superior planets are disposed about the sun
                    and the earth may be inferred either from the rate of their motion when they are
                    in opposition with the sun (it being natural to suppose that their velocities
                    will diminish in proportion to their distances or the magnitude of the orbit
                    which they describe), or it may be determined from the variation of their
                    apparent diameters. Now, the apparent diameters at the conjunctions and
                    oppositions are nearly in the following ratio: those of Mars as 1 to 5, of
                    Jupiter as 10 to 15, of Saturn as 1 to 1∙23; hence the diameter of the
                    terrestrial orbit is to the diameters of the orbits of Mars, Jupiter, and
                    Saturn, as the difference of the preceding numbers is to their sum, or as unity
                    to the numbers 1∣, 5, and 9ļ. In this manner we find that Jupiter is at a much
                    greater distance from the earth than Mars, and Saturn than Jupiter.</p>
                <p>It has already been remarked that the apparent motions of the planets are not
                    always in the same direction. Through the most considerable part of their orbits
                    they move from west to east, according to the order of the signs; and their
                    motion is most rapid when they are at the greatest distance from the earth. It
                    gradually relaxes until the planet has reached its greatest eastern digression
                    if it is an inferior planet, or its eastern quadrature if a superior one; after
                    which its proper motion is slower than the sun’s motion in the ecliptic. In the
                    course of a short time the planet seems stationary among the stars for some
                    days, its right ascension undergoing scarcely any variation. In the course of a
                    few days more, however, it begins again sensibly to change its place, and now
                    moves in an opposite direction, or retrogrades. This retrograde motion continues
                    to be accelerated as the planet approaches its inferior conjunction, or its
                    opposition, at which point it attains its maximum. After this it begins to be
                    retarded; the planet becomes a second time stationary, and then assumes its
                    direct motion, to pass through another series of similar changes. The arc and
                    time of retrogradation are different for each of the planets, being greatest in
                    the case of those which are nearest the earth, and least for those which are at
                    the greatest distance.</p>
                <p>. These phenomena, which are called the <hi rend="italic">Stations</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Petrogradations</hi> of the planets, were observed with great
                    attention by the ancients and the astronomers of the middle ages, to whom their
                    explanation gave much embarrassment on account of their being incompatible with
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189510" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9510-0015"/> the
                    supposition that the earth is the centre of the celestial motions. In fact, if
                    the earth is supposed immovable, the path described by the planets is a curve so
                    extremely complicated and irregular, that Aristotle, and even Riccioli, who
                    lived in an age when the celestial motions were much better known, were reduced
                    to the necessity of supposing a genius or angel to reside in each of the
                    planets, directing its motions as the mind of man directs the motions of his
                    body. Suppose the earth to be at rest in E (fig. 57), the orbit of a superior
                    planet will resemble the curve <hi rend="italic">abcdef,</hi> &amp;c. When the
                    planet arrives at <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> before it comes into opposition with
                    the sun at A it becomes stationary. From <hi rend="italic">b</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> it retrogrades, and is again stationary at c. Its motion
                    then becomes direct, and its distance from the earth continues to increase while
                    it runs through the arc <hi rend="italic">defgh,</hi> and till it arrives at <hi
                    rend="italic">h,</hi> and is in conjunction with the sun at B. It is then at its
                    greatest distance, and in passing through the arc <hi rend="italic">him</hi>
                    continues to approach the earth till it arrives at <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> in
                    opposition with the sun at C. Here it exhibits the same phenomena as at the
                    former opposition, becoming stationary, retrograding, &amp;c.; and at every
                    succeeding opposition describes a sort of node or loop, similar to <hi
                    rend="italic">lrnn.</hi> Its path is thus made up of an infinity of nodes, and
                    presents a sufficiently striking resemblance to an epicycloid. Fig. 58, which
                    has been copied from Cassini into most of the elementary treatises of astronomy,
                    represents the apparent motions of Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars, in respect of the
                    earth.</p>
                <p>Such are the general phenomena presented by the motions of the planets. We must
                    next endeavour to determine the nature of the curve described by each of them,
                    and the law according to which it is described, in order to arrive at the
                    solution of the principal problem of astronomy, viz. to express the position of
                    the heavenly bodies in terms of the time reckoned from a given instant.</p>
                <p>The first successful attempt to frame a system by means of which the motions of
                    the planets might be numerically calculated, was made by Apollonius of Perga.
                    Apollonius supposed that a planet, instead of describing a circle about the
                    earth, moves in the circumference of a second circle, the centre of which is
                    carried round the circumference of the first. Let us suppose two unequal
                    circles, situated in the same plane, the greater of which ACB (fig. 59), which
                    is called the <hi rend="italic">deferent,</hi> carries on its circumference the
                    centre of the smaller PRP'S, which is called the epicycle; and let us also
                    suppose that each of these circles turns uniformly about its centre, according
                    to the order of the signs, that is, from west to east. The earth is situated at
                    E the centre of the deferent,, and the planet whose motions we consider is
                    placed on the circumference of the epicycle. The phenomena resulting from this
                    disposition will be different according to the ratio of the velocities of the
                    two circles. In the first place, suppose the velocities to be equal, and that at
                    the first instant the planet is placed at P, the extremity of the straight line
                    which joins the centres of the deferent and epicycle: the planet is then at its
                    apogee, and it is evident that its apparent velocity is the greatest possible,
                    being the sum of the velocities in the two circles. It is evident also that the
                    apparent velocity of the planet will diminish as it approaches the lower
                    extremity P' of its epicycle, or its perigee, and that in this point it will
                    vanish altogether, because the perigee is carried backwards in the direction
                    RP'S by the motion of the epicycle with a velocity equal to that by which it is
                    carried forward by the motion of the deferent. From this point the apparent
                    motion will receive a gradual augmentation of velocity, till the planet arrives
                    again at its apogee, where it will recommence a course perfectly similar to the
                    preceding. In this case, therefore, the apparent motion of the planet, though
                    alternately accele- <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> rated and retarded, will
                    always be direct.</p>
                <p>Let us next suppose that the velocity of the epicycle is greater than that of the
                    deferent, which is the hypothesis adopted by Apollonius and Ptolemy. From P to R
                    the motion of the planet is direct. At the point R its path coincides with the
                    tangent RE, and it would be stationary if the epicycle were immovable; but as
                    the epicycle advances according to the order of the signs, the planet will
                    continue to move directly till it arrives at the point -τ, where its retrograde
                    motion in the epicycle, in the direction <hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                    &lt;ĩĩ</hi> P', is equal to the direct motion in the deferent. At the perigee P'
                    the planefr <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> will retrograde, because the
                    directions of the two motions are diametrically opposite, and the retrograde
                    motion in the epicycle is greater than the direct motion in the deferent. At π'
                    it becomes a second time stationary, after which it resumes its direct motion,
                    precisely according to the actual phenomena.</p>
                <p>Lastly, if we suppose the velocity of the deferent to be greater than that of the
                    epicycle, there will be neither station nor retrogradation, and the planet will
                    always advance in the same direction, but contrary to that of the motion of the
                    deferent. This, in the Copernican system, would be the motion of the moon with
                    reference to a spectator placed on the sun, and regarding the orbit of •the
                    earth about the sun as the deferent, and that of the moon about the earth as the
                    epicycle; for then the velocity of the earth about the sun would be about thirty
                    times greater than that of the moon about the earth.</p>
                <p>This method of representing the geocentric motions of the planets was adopted and
                    fully developed by Ptolemy, who assigned the ratios of the radii of the
                    epicycles and deferents of each of the planets, and disposed the orbits in the
                    manner most conformable to the apparent motions. It may be remarked that the
                    absolute lengths of the radii are immaterial; it is only their relative lengths
                    to which it is necessary to have regard. As observations were multiplied, and
                    new inequalities in the motions of the planets detected, the system of simple
                    epicycles was in most instances found insufficient to explain the phenomena.
                    Double and triple systems were therefore introduced, in which the first epicycle
                    was regarded as a second deferent carrying its own epicycle, the second epicycle
                    as a third deferent, and so on, till every irregularity of motion was explained.
                    It is easy to conceive all this mechanism, and even to reduce it to general
                    ſormulae; but although it affords considerable facility for calculation, it is
                    much too complicated to have place in nature. It is now well known that the
                    orbits of the planets are not epicycloids, but ellipses: nevertheless, at a time
                    when the circle and straight line alone were admitted in the solution of
                    geometrical problems, it was extremely natural to inquire whether any
                    construction could be found, without employing other curves, to represent the
                    planetary motions; and the system of epicycles which resulted from this inquiry
                    will remain a perpetual monument of the ingenuity of its authors, Apollonius and
                    Ptolemy.</p>
                <p>In arranging the planetary system, Ptolemy placed the earth at the centre of the
                    universe, and nearest to it the moon, whose synodic revolution is the shortest
                    of all, being performed in 29⅜ days. Next to the moon he placed Mercury, who
                    returns to his conjunctions in 116 days. After Mercury followed Venus, whose
                    periodic time is 584 days. Beyond Venus he placed the sun, then Mars, next
                    Jupiter, and lastly Saturn, beyond which is the sphere of the fixed stars. (See
                    fig. 60.) Plato and some other philosophers had placed the orbit of the sun
                    immediately after that of the moon, and Mercury and Venus beyond the sun, on
                    account that these planets <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189523"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-9523-0016"/>lwere never seen on the solar disk. Ptolemy,
                    however, • remarked that this reason was inconclusive, because the planets might
                    easily be supposed to pass between the sun and the earth, without appearing
                    exactly on the sun’s disk, in the same manner as the new moons do not always
                    cause a solar eclipse. In the system of Ptolemy, it is, however, a matter of
                    absolute indifference whether the orbits of these planets are placed above or
                    below that of the sun, inasmuch as the phenomena are exactly the same in both
                    dispositions. This fact doubtless furnishes a strong objection to his system,
                    and might have led him, we are apt to suppose, to adopt the system of the
                    ancient Egyptians with regard to Mercury and Venus, and place the sun at the
                    common centre of their orbits. But it must be recollected that Ptolemy had no
                    means of measuring the diameters of the planets, or of forming any accurate
                    notions of their distances; he was unacquainted with the phases of Venus, which
                    demonstrate the revolution of that planet about the sun; and, in short, knew of
                    no phenomenon which could not be reconciled with his system. His object was
                    solely to represent the apparent motions by a geometrical construction, and by
                    such means as geometry at that time could legitimately employ; and this object
                    he fully accomplished. He never regarded his system in any other light than as a
                    mere hypothesis, by means of which the celestial phenomena could be reduced to
                    calculation.</p>
                <p>But while thus much must be conceded in favour of the system of Ptolemy, it must
                    be confessed that scarcely any thing could well be imagined more complicated and
                    cumbersome; more at variance with the simplicity which pervades the economy of
                    nature, or, in a physical point of view, more absurd. Yet so prone is the human
                    mind to cling to the ideas which have been first presented to it, and with so
                    much difficulty are errors which have once obtained a firm footing eradicated,
                    that, till the beginning of the 16th century, it was implicitly followed by
                    astronomers of all countries. The glory of bursting the fetters of prejudice and
                    authority, and of building the true system of the world on the ruins of a fabric
                    which had been erected with so much address and labour, was reserved for
                    Copernicus. This great man was led, by a profound meditation on the different
                    hypotheses which had been imagined to account for the apparent motions of the
                    heavenly bodies, to adopt the ideas of some of the ancients, and remove the
                    earth from the centre of the world, ascribing to it a double motion of rotation
                    about its own axis and of revolution about the sun. From some scattered hints
                    contained in the writings of the ancient philosophers, Copernicus composed the
                    system which retains his name; a system of the truth of which the complete
                    development of the planetary theory has furnished the most convincing and
                    satisfactory proofs. According to this system the sun is the common centre of
                    the orbits of all the planets, which revolve around him in the following order
                    :—Mercury, Venus, the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Far beyond the orbit of
                    Saturn he supposed the fixed stars to be placed, which formed the boundaries of
                    the visible creation.</p>
                <p>Although the great simplicity and beauty of the Copernican system soon
                    recommended it to the adoption of the most philosophical of the astronomers of
                    that period, yet for a long time it met with considerable opposition. The most
                    eminent of its opponents was the celebrated Tycho Brahe, who could never bring
                    himself to adopt the supposition of the motion of the earth. The principal
                    objections which he urged against it were the immense distance at which it is
                    necessary to suppose the fixed stars to be placed, in order to account for the
                    smallness, or rather the entire absence, of the annual parallax; the
                    improbability that a heavy mass like the earth should have so rapid a motion;
                    and some passages of Scripture which seem to suppose the motion of the sun and
                    the immobility of the earth. Tycho, therefore, proposed another system, in which
                    he endeavoured to retain the most essential advantages of the Copernican theory,
                    and at the same time preserve the earth’s stability. In the system of Tycho the
                    earth is supposed to be the centre of the solar and lunar orbits, anti the sun
                    to be the centre of all the planetary orbits, the orbits of the two inferior
                    planets being smaller, and those of the superior larger, than the orbit of the
                    sun; a distinction which is necessary for the explanation of the conjunctions
                    and oppositions. This disposition of the orbits will be understood by referring
                    to fig. 61. The system of Tycho is far less philosophical than that of
                    Copernicus, and he has therefore exposed himself to the charge of having made a
                    retrograde movement in science; but it must be confessed that it affords a
                    satisfactory explanation of all the phenomena, and that the objections which can
                    be urged against it are not of an astronomical, but of a physical or mechanical
                    nature. In fact, if the planets are supposed to revolve about the sun, it is
                    absolutely indifferent, so far as regards the phenomena, whether the annual
                    motion is ascribed to the sun or the earth; but it is a physical absurdity to
                    suppose that the sun, with its whole train of attendant planets, revolves about
                    the earth, which, in comparison of them, is a mere atom.</p>
                <p>Taking the truth of the Copernican theory for granted, let us consider what
                    effect the motion of the earth has upon the apparent motions of the other
                    planets. Were the earth to stand still in any part of its orbit, the places of
                    conjunction both in the superior and inferior semicircle, as also of the
                    greatest elongation, and consequently the places of direct and retrograde
                    motion, and of the stations of an inferior planet, would always be in the same
                    part of the heavens; whereas, on account of the earth’s motion, the places where
                    these appearances happen are continually advancing forward in the ecliptic,
                    according to the order of the signs. In fig. 62 let ABCD be the orbit of the
                    earth; <hi rend="italic">efgh</hi> that of Mercury; © the sun; GFKI an arc of
                    the ecliptic extended to the fixed stars. When the earth is at A, the sun’s
                    geocentric place is at F; and Mercury, in order to be in conjunction, must be in
                    the line AF; that is, in his orbit he must be at <hi rend="italic">f</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">h.</hi> Suppose him to be at/in his inferior semicircle: if the
                    earth stood still at A, his next conjunction would be when he is in his superior
                    semicircle at <hi rend="italic">h;</hi> the places of his greatest elongation
                    also would be at <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> and in
                    the ecliptic at E and G. But supposing the earth to go on in its orbit from A to
                    B; the sun’s geocentric place is now at K; and Mercury, in order to be in
                    conjunction, ought to be in the line BK at <hi rend="italic">m.</hi> As by the
                    motion of the earth the places of Mercury’s conjunctions are thus continually
                    carried round in the ecliptic according to the order of the signs, so the places
                    of his greatest elongations must also be carried forward in the same direction.
                    Thus, when the earth is at A, the places of his greatest elongation from the sun
                    are in the ecliptic E and G; the motion of the earth from A to B advances them
                    forward from G to L and from E to I. But the geocentric motion of Mercury will
                    best be seen in fig. 63. Here we have part of the extended ecliptic marked <hi
                    rend="superscript"> c</hi> γ&gt;, b , ∏, &amp;c., in the centre of which S
                    represents the sun, and round him are the orbits of Mercury and the Earth. The
                    orbit of Mercury is divided into 11 equal parts, such as he goes through once in
                    eight days; and the divisions are marked by numeral figures, I, 2, 3, &amp;c.
                    Part of the orbit of the earth is like <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189536"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-9536-0017"/>wise divided into 22 equal arcs, each are being as
                    much •as the earth goes through in eight days. The points of division are marked
                    with the letters α, <hi rend="italic">b, c, d, e,f,</hi> &amp;c. and show as
                    many several stations from whence Mercury may be viewed from the earth. Suppose
                    then the planet to be at 1 and the earth at <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> draw a line from <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to 1, and it
                    shows Mercury’s geocentric place at A. In eight days he will have advanced to 2,
                    and the earth to <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> draw a line
                    from 2 to <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and it shows his geocentric place at B. In
                    other eight days he will have proceeded to 3, and the earth to c; a line drawn
                    from 3 to <hi rend="italic">c</hi> will show his geocentric place at C. In this
                    manner, going through the figure, and drawing lines from the earth at <hi
                    rend="italic">d, c,fg</hi><hi rend="italic                     subscript">
                    i</hi> &amp;c. through 4, 5, 6, 7, &amp;c. we shall find his geocentric places
                    successively at the points D, E, F, G, &amp;c. where we may observe, that from A
                    to B, and from B to C, the motion is direct; from C to D, and from D to E,
                    retrograde. In this figure 22 stations are marked in the earth’s orbit from
                    whence the planet may be viewed, corresponding to which there ought to be as
                    many in the orbit of Mercury; but as the periodic time of that planet does not
                    include so many intervals of eight days, his place is marked at the end of every
                    eight days for two of his periodical revolutions; and to denote this, two
                    numeral figures are placed at each division.</p>
                <p>The geocentric motion of Venus may be explained in a similar manner; only, as the
                    motion of Venus is much slower than that of Mercury, her conjunctions,
                    oppositions, elongations, and stations, all return much less frequently than
                    those of Mercury.</p>
                <p>To explain the stationary appearances of the planets, it must be remembered, that
                    the diameter of the earth’s orbit, and even that of Saturn, are but mere points
                    in comparison of the distance of the fixed stars; and therefore any two lines,
                    though absolutely parallel, drawn at the distance of the diameter of Saturn’s
                    orbit from each other, would, if continued to the fixed stars, appear to us to
                    terminate in the same point. Let, then, the two circles fig. 64 represent the
                    orbits of Venus and of the Earth; let the lines AE, BF, CG, DH, be parallel to
                    SP, we may nevertheless affirm, that if continued to the distance of the fixed
                    stars, they would all terminate in the same point with the line SP. Suppose,
                    then, Venus at E while the earth is at A, the visual ray by which she is seen is
                    the line AE. Suppose again, that while Venus goes from E to F, the earth goes
                    from A to B, the visual ray by which Venus is now seen is BF parallel to AE; and
                    therefore Venus will be all that time stationary, appearing in that point of the
                    heaven where SP, if extended, would terminate: this station is at her changing
                    from direct to retrograde. Again, suppose, when the earth is at C, Venus is at
                    G, and the visual line CG; if, while the earth goes from C to D, Venus goes from
                    G to H, so that she is seen in the line DH parallel to CG, she will be all that
                    time stationary, appearing in the point of the celestial sphere determined by
                    the prolongation of SP. This station is at her changing from retrograde to
                    direct; and both are in her inferior semicircle.</p>
                <p>As the superior planets move in larger orbits than the earth, they can only be in
                    conjunction with the sun when they are on the side opposite to the earth; as, on
                    the other hand, they are in opposition to him when the earth is between the sun
                    and them. They are in quadrature when their geocentric places are 90° distant
                    from that of the sun. In order to understand their apparent motions, we shall
                    suppose them to stand still in some part of their orbit while the earth makes a
                    complete revolution; in which case any superior planet would have the following
                    appearances;—1. While the earth is in its most distant semicircle, the motion of
                    the planet will be direct. 2. While the earth is in its nearest semicircle, the
                    planet will be retrograde. 3. While the earth is near those places of its orbit
                    where a line drawn from the planet would be a tangent, it would appear to be
                    stationary. Thus, in fig. 65, let <hi rend="italic">abed</hi> represent the
                    orbit of the; earth, S the Sun, EFG an arc of the orbit of Jupiter, ABC an arc
                    of the ecliptic projected on the sphere of the fixed stars. Suppose Jupiter to
                    continue at F, while the earth goes round in its orbit according to the order of
                    the letters <hi rend="italic">abed.</hi> While the earth is in the semicircle
                    most distant from Jupiter, going from <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> and from <hi rend="italic">b</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                    >c,</hi> his motion in the heavens would appear direct, or from A to B and from
                    B to C; but while the earth is in its nearest semicircle <hi rend="italic"
                    >cde,</hi> the motion of Jupiter would appear retrograde from C to B and from B
                    to A; for α, <hi rend="italic">b, c, d,</hi> may be considered as so many
                    different stations from whence an inhabitant of the earth would view Jupiter at
                    different seasons of the year; and a straight line drawn from each of these
                    stations through F, the place of Jupiter, and continued to the ecliptic, would
                    show his apparent place there to be successively at A, B, C, B, A. While the
                    earth is near the points of contact <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">c,</hi> Jupiter would appear stationary, because the visual ray
                    drawn through both planets does not sensibly differ from the tangent Fα or Fc.
                    When the earth is at <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> a line drawn from <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> through S and F to the ecliptic shows Jupiter to be in
                    conjunction with the sun at B. When the earth is at <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> a
                    line drawn from <hi rend="italic">d</hi> through S, continued to the ecliptic,
                    would terminate in a point opposite to B; which shows Jupiter then to be in
                    opposition to the sun; and thus it appears that his motion is direct when he is
                    in conjunction, but retrograde when he is in opposition with the sun.</p>
                <p>The direct motion of a superior planet is more rapid the nearer it is to a
                    conjunction, and slower as it approaches to a quadrature with the sun. Thus, in
                    fig. 66, let Θ be the sun, the little circle round it the orbit of the earth, of
                    which <hi rend="italic">abcdefg</hi> is the most distant semicircle, OPQ an arc
                    of the orbit of Jupiter, and ABCDEFG an arc of the ecliptic in the sphere of the
                    fixed stars. If we suppose Jupiter to stand still at P, by the earth’s motion
                    from <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to <hi rend="italic">g</hi> he would appear to
                    move directly from A to G, describing the unequal arcs AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FG,
                    in equal times. When the earth isat√, Jupiter is in conjunction with the sun at
                    D, and there his direct motion is swiftest. When the earth is in that part of
                    its orbit where a line drawn from Jupiter would touch it, as in the points <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> or <hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    i</hi> Jupiter is nearly in quadrature with the sun; and the nearer the earth is
                    to any of these points, the slower is the geocentric motion of Jupiter; for the
                    arcs CD and DE arc greater than BC or EF, and the arcs BC and L’F are greater
                    than AB or FG.</p>
                <p>The retrograde motion of a superior planet is more rapid the nearer it is to an
                    opposition, and slower as it approaches to a quadrature with the sun. Thus, let
                    Θ,fig. 67, be the sun, the little circle round it the orbit of the earth,
                    whereof <hi rend="italic">ghihlmn</hi> is the nearest semicircle, OPQ an arc of
                    the orbit of Jupiter, NKG an arc of the ecliptic. If we suppose Jupiter to stand
                    still at P, by the earth’s motion from <hi rend="italic">g</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> he would appear to move from G to N, describing the unequal
                    arcs GH, HI, IK, KL, LM, MN, in equal times. When the earth is at <hi
                    rend="italic">h,</hi> Jupiter appears at K in opposition with the sun, and there
                    his retrograde motion is swiftest. When the earth is either at <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi> or <hi rend="italic">n</hi> (the points of contact of the tangents <hi
                    rend="italic">Pg</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pn),</hi> Jupiter is nearly in
                    quadrature with the sun: and the nearer he is to either of these points the
                    slower is his retrogradation; for the arcs IK and KL are greater than HI or LM,
                    and the arcs HI and LM are greater than GH <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189549"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-9549-0018"/>lor MN. Since the direct motion is swiftest when
                    the earth is at <hi rend="italic">d</hi> (fig. 66), and continues diminishing
                    till it changes to retrograde, it must be insensible near the time of change;
                    and, in like manner, the retrograde motion being swiftest when the earth is in
                    <hi rend="italic">k</hi> (fig. 67), and diminishing gradually till it changes to
                    direct, must also at the time of that change be insensible; for any motion
                    gradually decreasing till it changes into a contrary one gradually increasing,
                    must at the time of the change be altogether insensible.</p>
                <p>The same changes in the apparent motions of this planet will also take place if
                    we suppose him to advance slowly in his orbit; only they will happen
                    successively when the earth is in different parts of its orbit, and consequently
                    at different times of the year. Thus (fig. 65), let us suppose that while the
                    earth goes round its orbit, Jupiter goes from F to G; the points of the earth’s
                    orbit from which Jupiter will now appear to be stationary will be <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y;</hi> and consequently his stations
                    must be at a time of the year different from the former. Moreover, the
                    conjunction of Jupiter with the sun will now be when the earth is at <hi
                    rend="italic">f,</hi> and his opposition when it is at <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for which reason these also will happen at times
                    of the year different from those of the preceding opposition and conjunction.
                    The motion of Saturn is so slow, that it occasions but little alteration either
                    in the times or places of his conjunction or opposition; and the same will take
                    place in a more eminent degree in Uranus; but the motion of Mars is so much
                    swifter even than that of Jupiter, that both the times and places of his
                    conjunctions and oppositions are thereby very much altered.</p>
                <p>Fig. 68 exemplifies the geocentric motion of Jupiter in a very intelligible
                    manner. In this figure Θ represents the sun; the circle 1, 2, 3, 4, the orbit of
                    the earth, divided into twelve equal arcs for the twelve months of the year; PQ,
                    an arc of the orbit of Jupiter, equal to that which he describes in a year, and
                    divided in like manner into twelve equal parts, each representing the arc he
                    describes in a month. Now suppose the earth to be at 1 when Jupiter is at <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> a line drawn through 1 and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> shows
                    Jupiter’s place in the celestial ecliptic to be at A. In a month’s time the
                    earth will have moved from 1 to 2, Jupiter from <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and a line drawn from 2 to <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> will show his geocentric place to be in B. In another month
                    the earth will be in 3, and Jupiter at c, and consequently his geocentric place
                    will be at C; and in like manner his place may be found for the other months at
                    D, E, F, &amp;c. It is likewise easy to observe that his geocentric motion is
                    direct in the arcs AB, BC, CD, DE; retrograde in EF, FG, GH, HI; and direct
                    again in IK, KL, LM, MN. The inequality of his geocentric motion is likewise
                    apparent from the figure.</p>
                <p>Supposing the orbits of the planets to be circular, the points of station, and
                    the extent and duration of the retrogradations, may be geometrically determined
                    with great facility; but if we attempt to take into consideration all the
                    inequalities of the orbits, the problem becomes one of extreme complication and
                    difficulty. This, however, is the less to be regretted, on account that it is
                    more a problem of curiosity than of any real importance, and the mean values
                    which result from the supposition of circular orbits are more than sufficiently
                    accurate for all the uses which are now made of these phenomena.</p>
                <p>Let S, fig. 69, be the sun, E and V two planets (which we may suppose to be the
                    Earth and Venus) revolving in their respective orbits in the times T and <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> the problem is, to determine those
                    points at which one of them, as seen from the other, will become stationary, and
                    the extent of the arc through which it will appear to retrograde. Suppose the
                    spectator to be placed at E, and V to be the point at which Venus is stationary.
                    Also let the semidiame- ' ters of their orbits SE and SV be R and <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> respectively, the ∙ angle of digression SEV=p, and the
                    angle SVE=∙ψ. During a short time, at the station, the lines EV and <hi
                    rend="italic">cv</hi> (Ee and <hi rend="italic">Nν</hi> being very small arcs)
                    may be considered as parallel; therefore <hi rend="italic">&lt;p=Suv=</hi> Sey +

                    ESe. In like manner ∙ψ=Sire=Sve—VS-υ=ψ + δ∙ψ—VSv; whence δ∙ψ=VSv. But as the
                    orbits are described uniformly, T: <hi rend="italic">t</hi>:: VSw: ESe, and
                    consequently T: <hi rend="italic">t</hi>:: δ∙ψ: <hi rend="italic">δ&lt;p.</hi>
                    Now, the triangle SEV gives the equa tion sin. ∙ψ=- sin. p,from which, by
                    differentiating, we get</p>

                    periodic time of the planet are known. Thus, relatively to Venus, the quantity
                    ?, that is, the ratio of the diameter of her orbit to that of the earth, is, as
                    will be shown in next section, equal to 0*723, and</p>

                <p>0∙48208; and &lt;p=28° 49'. The angle -ψ is obtained from the equation sin.
                    ∙ψ=-^' -, which gives &gt;ψ=138° IP. The angle VSE at the sun, or the
                    heliocentric distance of Venus and the Earth, which we shall designate by χ, is
                    180° — (p + +)=13°. From this angle we likewise obtain the time from the station
                    to the conjunction; for since the mean daily motion of Venus is 1° 36' 7"∙8, and
                    that of the earth 59’ 8"∙3, the relative daily motion is 36' 59"∙5, 13°</p>
                <p>therefore the time from conjunction will be √ <hi rend="subscript">

                    of Venus will continue about 42 days.</p>

                    Planets.</hi></p>
                <p>In determining the elements of the orbits of the sun and moon, the labour of the
                    astronomer is facilitated by the circumstance that the earth, at which his
                    observations are made, either is, or may be regarded as, the centre of motion.
                    But in the case of the planets, the sun, and not the earth, is situated in the
                    centre of their orbits, and consequently the elements of those orbits must be
                    determined from the measurement of certain linear and angular distances from the
                    sun: it is therefore necessary, as a preliminary step, to convert the geocentric
                    into heliocentric observations, that is, to deduce the true place of a planet as
                    seen from the sun, from its apparent place as seen from the earth. On this
                    account the determination of the planetary orbits is attended with somewhat
                    greater difficulties than those which present themselves in the cases of the suñ
                    and moon.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Nodes and Inclinations of the Planetary Orbits.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> Conformably with the plan which has been followed in the
                    two preceding chapters, we will first consider those elements which determine
                    the position of the plane of the orbit of a planet; and then those which regard
                    the orbit itself, that is to say, the elements and position of the ellipse which
                    the planet describes. When these are known, and the astronomer is also
                    acquainted with the mean motion, or the time of the periodic revolution of the
                    planet, and the instant at which it occupied any given point of its orbit, he is
                    in a condition to assign the epoch at which it will again occupy the same or any
                    other given point; and this comprehends the complete solution of the problem
                    which he proposes to himself. It is proper, however, to remark here, that
                    although this method of considering the elements separately is extremely
                    convenient, perhaps indispensable, for the purpose of illustration, it is
                    neither that which the practical astronomer follows, nor that by which the
                    various truths which compose the actual system of theoretical astronomy were
                    discovered. No discovery in astronomy has perhaps ever been made by a direct
                    process. The elements first obtained from the observations are imperfect and
                    inexact, and it is only by successive and frequently laborious approximations
                    that they are advanced to accuracy. Hypotheses are first framed to account for
                    or classify the phenomena; the results of these arbitrary suppositions are
                    computed and compared with new observations; and the differences which are found
                    to exist between the computed and observed quantities serve to verify or correct
                    the assumption, or suggest other approximations still nearer the truth. In
                    astronomy, as Woodhouse remarks, scarcely one element is presented simple and
                    unmixed with others. Its value, when first disengaged, must partake of the
                    uncertainty to which the other elements are subject, and can be supposed to be
                    settled to a tolerable degree of exactness only after multiplied observations
                    and many revisions. There are no simple theorems for determining at once the
                    parallax of the sun, or the heliocentric latitude of a planet.</p>
                <p>To give a general idea of the method of reducing geocentric to heliocentric
                    longitudes and latitudes, let S (fig. 70) be the sun, E the earth, P the place
                    of a planet in its orbit NP, NA the ecliptic, and N the ascending node, or that
                    point of the ecliptic through which the planet passes when it comes to the north
                    of that plane. Let Sɤ, Eɤ, be drawn from S and E to the first point of Aries;
                    and because the parallax of the fixed stars is insensible, their distance being
                    infinitely great in comparison of the distance of the earth from the sun, S ɤ
                    and E ɤ are considered as parallel to one another. Let also PL be drawn
                    perpendicular to the ecliptic, and the other lines as in the figure. It is easy
                    to see that as NPC, NLA are regarded as the intersections of the planes of the
                    orbits of the earth and the planet with the celestial sphere, the centre of
                    which is occupied by the sun, they are portions of great circles; and
                    consequently every question relative to the position of the planet may be
                    resolved by the formulae of spherical trigonometry. In fact, PL being a circle
                    of latitude, the arc &lt;y&gt;NL is the <hi rend="italic">Heliocentric
                    Longitude</hi> of the planet, ɤ N the longitude of the ascending node, and the
                    spherical angle PNL the inclination of the orbit. In order that the longitude of
                    the planet in its orbit may not differ greatly from its longitude referred to
                    the ecliptic, the former is not reckoned from the node N, but from another point
                    equally distant from the node with the vernal point &lt;v; so that the longitude
                    of the planet is obtained by adding NP to the longitude of the node. The
                    latitude also depends immediately on the distance NP of the planet from the
                    ascending node; hence NP is called the <hi rend="italic">Argument of the
                    Latitude</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the difference between the longitudes
                    in the orbit and ecliptic, that is, NP—NL, is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reduction to the Ecliptic.</hi> The angle PEL, or the planet’s apparent

                    and ɤSL are the geocentric and heliocentric longitudes respectively. The angles
                    of the triangle ESL, from which the reductions are computed, being of very
                    frequent use in practical astronomy, have received certain technical
                    denominations with which it is convenient to be acquainted. The angle LES, which
                    is the difference between ɤEL and &lt;γΕS, the geocentric longitudes of the
                    planet and the sun, is called the angle of <hi rend="italic">Elongation</hi><hi

                    difference between the heliocentric and geocentric longitudes, is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Annual Parallax,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Prosthaphoeresis of

                    have any value between zero and 360°; but if the planet be a superior one, the

                    from the planet to the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189575"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-9575-0020"/> earth is a tangent to the earth’s orbit. In any
                    other situation of the planet the sine of the annual parallax will be to the
                    sine of the elongation as SE to SL.</p>
                <p>In order to determine the position of the orbit of a planet relatively to the
                    ecliptic, it is necessary to discover in the first place the place of the nodes.
                    The longitude of the node is the heliocentric longitude of the planet at the
                    instant when it is in the ecliptic, and its geocentric and heliocentric
                    latitudes are consequently both equal to zero. If then, at the same instant, the
                    planet should happen to be in opposition with the sun, or (if an inferior one)
                    in its inferior conjunction, its geocentric longitude, which is equal to the
                    longitude of the sun + 180°, would be the heliocentric longitude of the node.
                    But it can happen very rarely that the latitude of a planet is zero at the time
                    of its opposition or conjunction, especially with regard to those of which the
                    periodic times are considerable. Mercury and Venus, indeed, by passing oftener
                    through their nodes within a given time, afford more chances of the occurrence
                    of the phenomenon; and it does occur occasionally under very favourable
                    circumstances when those planets pass over the disk of the sun, for at such
                    times the latitude must be very small, that is, the planet must be very near its
                    node. But this simple method of determining the heliocentric longitude of the
                    node, although it may frequently be had recourse to in the case of Mercury, can
                    seldom be practised with regard to Venus, and is of no use whatever in the cases
                    of the other planets, because, on account of the greater length of their times
                    of revolution, the oppositions and passages through the node take place
                    simultaneously only after very long intervals.</p>
                <p>Leaving, therefore, out of consideration the circumstance of. opposition, let us
                    inquire what other means are in our possession for determining the longitude of
                    the node. It would be by an extraordinary chance that a planet should happen to
                    be observed at the precise instant of its passage through its node; but if
                    observed when very near it, the diurnal variations of latitude afford data for
                    determining that instant by interpolation. Suppose, then, the planet to be in
                    its node at Ń: the angle ɤ EN is obtained from observation, being the geocentric
                    longitude of the node; and ɤES, the longitude of the sun, is known from the
                    solar tables. Hence, in the triangle ENS the angle SEN = ɤEN—ɤES is known, as is
                    also the side SE, which is the sun’s distance from the earth. If, therefore, the
                    angle at the planet, that is ENS, can be found, every part of the triangle will
                    be determined, and we shall then have the heliocentric longitude ɤSN (equal to
                    180° —ESN + ɤES), and also the radius vector SN, or the distance of the planet
                    from the sun. Now, the sides of a triangle being proportional to . <hi

                    inasmuch as it contains two unknown quantities, SN and ɤ SN. Suppose, however,
                    that the planet is observed a second time in its passage through the same node,
                    and that the earth is then in another part of its orbit at <hi rend="italic"

                    we suppose the place of the node has not sensibly changed in the interval
                    between the two observations, this last equation will furnish a second relation
                    between the two unknown quantities SN and ɤSN, by combining which with the
                    former, the values of both those ' quantities may be determined. By repeating
                    the same; observation, it will be seen whether the place of the node ' is fixed,
                    or is subject to any other variation than that which arises from the precession
                    of the equinoxes. Its variation, if it does vary, can only be determined by
                    observations made at distant epochs.</p>
                <p>When the longitude of the node has been determined in this manner, it will be
                    easy to deduce the inclination of the orbit. For this purpose the planet may be
                    observed at the time when the sun’s longitude is equal to that of the node, and
                    the earth is consequently situated in the line of the nodes. By this observation
                    the elongation of the planet, which is then PEN (fig. 71), is given, as also its
                    geocentric latitude PEL. Now, by reason of the right-angled triangles PEL and
                    PSL, we have PL = EL tan. PEL = SL tan. PSL, consequently tan. PSL</p>

                    rules for circular parts, the right-angled spherical triangle PNL gives also
                    sin. NL = cot. PNL tan. PL; whence tan. PL = sin. NL tan. PNL; or, since tan. PL
                    = tan. PSL, and sin. NL = sin. LSN, therefore tan. PSL = sin. LSN tan. PNL. By
                    equating these two values of tan. PSL, we have</p>

                <p>that is, the inclination of the orbit is given in terms of the geocentric
                    latitude and the longitude of the node.</p>
                <p>The instant at which the sun is in the node of a planet’s orbit cannot be easily
                    seized; but the sun’s mean motion being known, if his longitude is observed when
                    it is nearly equal to that of the node, the time at which he passes through it
                    may be determined with all the necessary accuracy by a simple proportion. It
                    requires also to be remarked that the above method of determining the
                    inclination takes it for granted that the position of the node is exactly known;
                    but even should some uncertainty remain regarding this element, the resulting
                    inclination would scarcely be affected in any sensible degree by a slight error,
                    especially if at the time of the observation the planet is not very distant from
                    its quadratures. In fact, if we make PNL = I, PEL = λ, and LES = p, the above
                    equation becomes tan. I =^L^, which being differentiated</p>

                <p>From this it is evident that the error of inclination resulting from an erroneous

                <p>The process now explained for determining the position of the nodes gives at the
                    same time the length of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189588"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-9588-0021"/>the radius vector SN; and, in consequence of
                    certain rela- ∙tions which will be pointed out in the present section, all 'the
                    other elements of the orbit may be deduced from simple observations of the
                    passages of a planet through its nodes. But when approximate values of these
                    elements are known, the heliocentric longitudes and latitudes may be found from
                    geocentric observations of various kinds. If, therefore, the planet is observed
                    several times before and after its passage through the node, the diurnal
                    variations of longitude and latitude (which we at present suppose to be known
                    very nearly) will give by interpolation the instant at which the latitude was
                    nothing, and the heliocentric longitude, computed for that instant, will give
                    the place of the node. By means of this more accurate determination the other
                    elements may be corrected; and on repeating the same process with the corrected
                    values, the longitude of the node will be obtained with still greater precision.
                    These indirect methods of correcting the elements by one another were first
                    employed by Kepler, and are of extensive application in every department of
                    astronomy. They lead to more exact values of the elements of the planetary
                    orbits than could be obtained from any direct method whatever.</p>
                <p>As the passage of a planet through either of its nodes takes place only once
                    during each periodic revolution, a remote planet, like Uranus, which moves very
                    slowly, can very seldom be observed in those positions. Astronomers have
                    therefore sedulously employed themselves in devising other methods by which all
                    the elements of a planet’s orbit may be discovered when a very small portion of
                    it has been made known by observation. But these methods are the results of
                    profound mathematical theory, based on the principle of Universal Gravitation,
                    and could not therefore be properly explained in this place. Their application
                    belongs to Practical Astronomy.</p>
                <p>When the longitudes of the nodes of the planetary orbits are deduced by the
                    methods explained above from ancient andmodern observations,it is found that the
                    nodes are not altogether fixed, but that, in respect of the fixed stars, they
                    retrograde, or move from east to west; buttheir motion is so slow, that,
                    although it is in reality, like every motion of the system, alternately
                    accelerated and retarded, it may be regarded as uniform during a very long
                    period of time. The inclinations of the orbits also undergo small variations,
                    scarcely sensible to observation. The retrograde motion of the nodes of the
                    planets, exactly analogous to that of the nodes of the moon, is a necessary
                    consequence of the mutual gravitation of all the planetary bodies. The same is
                    the case with the variations of inclination, of which the period and limits can
                    only be calculated from the same theory to which we owe the knowledge of their
                    existence. It is only indeed by the aid of the theories of Physical Astronomy
                    that the greater part of these smalI secular variations can be disengaged from
                    the periodic inequalities.</p>
                <p>The following table exhibits the inclinations of the orbits of the planets, the
                    positions of their nodes, and the variations of those elements. For the old
                    planets the epoch is the commencement of the present century, that is to say,
                    midnight preceding the 1st of January 1801. For Vesta, Juno, Ceres, and Pallas,
                    the epoch is 1820. The annual increment of the longitude of the node is referred
                    of course to the equinoctial point of Aries: to find its motion in respect of
                    the fixed stars, it is only necessary to subtract the precession of the
                    equinoxes, or 50"∙1, from the numbers given in the table.</p>

                    After the position of the plane of a planet’s orbit in space has been
                    determined, it remains to trace its path on that plane, or to determine the
                    figure and elements of the orbit itself. This, it is evident, may be
                    accomplished, if we are in possession of the means of assigning, at any instant,
                    the planet’s distance from a fixed point in the plane of its orbit, and likewise
                    the angle formed by the radius vector with a straight line given by position on
                    the same plane. With these data a series of points may be laid down,
                    representing the positions successively occupied by the planet; and the curve
                    formed by joining them together will represent the orbit. Now, when the place of
                    the nodes and the inclination are known, the radius vector and elongation may be
                    computed by the rules of spherical trigonometry from a single observation of the
                    planet’s geocentric latitude and longitude at any epoch whatever; but by making
                    the observations when the planet occupies certain situations of its orbit with
                    respect to the earth, the difficulties attending the computation may be in a
                    great measure eluded. If a planet, for example, is observed at the time of its
                    opposition or conjunction, there will be no occasion for a previous deduction of
                    the heliocentric from the geocentric longitude; because, in either of those
                    cases, the radius vector of the planet, and the straight line EP (fig. 72) drawn
                    from it to the observer, are projected on the plane of the ecliptic in the same
                    straight line ESL; and consequently the planet, whether seen from the earth or
                    the sun, is referred to the same point of the ecliptic, excepting indeed the
                    inferior planets, which in their inferior conjunctions are referred to points
                    diametrically opposite. Let P, therefore, be the place of a planet in
                    opposition; then, in the spherical triangle PNL, right-angled at L, the side NL,
                    being the longitude of the planet minus that of the node, is given by
                    observation (the longitude of the node being supposed to be previously
                    determined); the inclination PNL is also known; therefore, by Napier’s rules,
                    <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi>, <hi rend="subscript"> xτ</hi> tan. NL tan. PN =
                    <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi>-- <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi>; cos. PNL</p>
                <p>that is, the elongation of the planet is given in terms of its longitude and the
                    inclination of its orbit. The same <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189601"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-9601-0022"/>triangle PNL also affords data for determining the
                    radius vector; for tan. PL = tan. PNL sin. NL; but PL is the measure of the
                    angle PSL, and consequently PSL, the heliocentric latitude, also becomes known.
                    Now, in the triangle PES the angle PES is given by observation, therefore EPS (=
                    PSL — PES) is also given; but</p>
                <p>PS: SE:: sin. PES: sin. EPS, whence PS = SE</p>
                <p>sin. EPS or the radius vector is found in terms of the sun’s distance from the
                    earth and given angles.</p>
                <p>In consequence of the incommensurable relation subsisting between the times of
                    the periodic revolutions of the planets and that of the earth, the successive
                    oppositions and conjunctions never take place at the same points of the orbits;
                    therefore, by making a number of similar observations, as many different angles
                    of elongation and radii vectores will be found, which, unless the orbits are
                    circular, will all have different values. By computing, therefore, the values of
                    these radii vectores in terms of the greater axis of the earth’s orbit, and
                    laying them down in their true positions round the sun, we shall obtain an
                    approximation to the curve described by the planet on the plane of its orbit. A
                    few observations of this sort will suffice to show that the orbit is eccentric;
                    and as we have already seen that the solar orbit is an ellipse, analogy will
                    immediately suggest the probability that that of the planet is also an ellipse,
                    having the sun in one of its foci. It is easy to determine whether this be the
                    case or otherwise. Three points given by position on a plane completely
                    determine an ellipse of which a focus is known: having therefore computed an
                    ellipse which satisfies three observations of a planet, its periphery, if the
                    hypothesis of elliptic motion is correct, will comprehend all the places of the
                    same planet computed from any other observations. Now, it is found that this is
                    what takes place with regard to every one of the planets; hence results the
                    first of the three laws discovered by Kepler which form the basis of the whole
                    system of modern astronomy, namely, that the <hi rend="italic">orbits of the
                    planets are ellipses, of which the sun occupies one of the foci.</hi></p>
                <p>By a comparison of the sectors formed by two contiguous radii vectores and the
                    arcs included between them, with the time consumed by the planet in describing
                    those arcs, Kepler was led to the discovery of the second great law of the
                    planetary motions, namely, that <hi rend="italic">the areas described by the
                    radius vector of a planet are proportional to the times employed in describing
                    them.</hi> The data from which this important conclusion was deduced were not
                    rigorously exact; but the fact itself has been confirmed by an infinity of
                    observations since the time of Kepler; and Newton, by the application of
                    geometry to dynamics, demonstrated that it is <hi rend="italic">necessarily</hi>
                    true of all motions regulated by a central force, whatever the nature of that
                    force may be.</p>
                <p>Kepler having, by means of the most laborious computations, established the
                    existence of these two laws with regard to each of the planets separately, next
                    undertook to discover whether any analogy could be found regulating their mean
                    distances from the sun. As there were only six planets known in his time, he
                    commenced his investigation by comparing the intervals between their respective
                    orbits with the five regular geometrical solids. Having failed in this
                    speculation, and in various others suggested by a mind equally fertile and
                    persevering, he at length, by a happy inspiration of genius, thought of
                    comparing the mean distances of the planets with their respective periods of
                    revolution, and soon perceived that the numbers which represent the periodic
                    times of the planets, beginning with Mercury and ending with Saturn, increase in
                    a much greater ratio than those representing their mean distances from the sun.
                    Jupiter, for example, <hi rend="italic">vs four</hi> times more distant from the
                    sun than the earth is; but his period is <hi rend="italic">twelve</hi> times
                    greater than that of the earth. Kepler then tried the various powers of the
                    distances and periods. Unfortunately an error of computation for some time
                    concealed the discovery from him; but having resumed the subject, he at length
                    found, on the 15th of May 1618 (and few days, as Mr Playfair has remarked, are
                    more memorable in the annals of science), with all the delight which a great and
                    important discovery gives rise to, that <hi rend="italic">the squares of the
                    numbers which ' express the times of revolution are to one another as the
                    cubes</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">of those which
                    express the mean distances of the planets from the sum</hi></p>
                <p>These three general laws, which are necessary consequences of the law of
                    gravitation, directly as the masses, and inversely as the squares of the
                    distances, greatly facilitate the investigation of the orbit of a newly
                    discovered planet, and may even be regarded as more accurate than the results
                    obtained from any moderate number of observations, however exact. Thus, instead
                    of having recourse to observation for the determination of the radius vector,
                    which cannot be found by direct observation but with considerable difficulty, it
                    is preferable to deduce it by means of the third law from the planet’s periodic
                    time, which can always be determined with great precision, and with much greater
                    facility. They also afford a strong analogical proof of the annual motion of the
                    earth. In fact, if we compute from the third law the periodic time of a body
                    placed at the same distance from the sun as the earth is known to be, the result
                    will give exactly the sidereal year. It is therefore certain that the earth
                    obeys the same laws as the planets; and, when classed among them, the most
                    perfect analogy pervades the whole system.</p>
                <p>The periodic time of a planet may be determined by observing the interval which
                    elapses between two consecutive passages through the same node. The retrograde
                    movement of the nodes being, as we have seen, inconsiderable, the planet, in
                    returning to its node, also returns to the same position very nearly with
                    reference to the fixed stars, and therefore has in the interval completed a
                    sidereal revolution. Hence the mean sidereal motion is known, and consequently,
                    from the third law of Kepler, the planet’s mean distance from the sun, the
                    double of which is the transverse axis of the orbit. But the observation of the
                    passages through the nodes not only gives the time of a sidereal revolution, but
                    also approximate values of the eccentricity and the position of the line of the
                    apsides; for, unless the orbit is circular, or the line of the apsides coincides
                    with that of the nodes, the time the planet consumes in passing from the
                    ascending to the descending node, or from ♯ to ö, will be different from that in
                    which it passes from S to $2; and, by a comparison of this difference with the
                    theory of elliptic motion, it is easy to deduce the greatest difference between
                    the true and mean anomalies, that is, the greatest equation of the centre, and
                    thence the eccentricity. The method is exactly similar to that which has already
                    been described in chap. ii. sect. 2.</p>
                <p>But as these methods lead to results of no great accuracy, and as the passages
                    through the nodes in the case of the distant planets occur only after
                    considerable intervals of time, the astronomer requires some more accurate and
                    expeditious means of determining the elements of an orbit; and three geocentric
                    observations of the planet in any part of its orbit whatever are sufficient to
                    determine these elements, when the nodes and inclination, mean motion and mean
                    distance, are known. Having already <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189614"

                    geocentric are converted into heliocentric longitudes, and reduced to the plane

                    the semi-axis major, or mean distance found by the third law of Kepler.</p>
                <p>In this manner approximate values of the different elements are obtained, but no
                    method can be proposed which will give them, without repeated corrections, so
                    accurately as to accord with the precise observations of the present day; and
                    the great object of the practical astronomer is to advance them gradually nearer
                    and nearer to the truth. From the laws of Kepler applied to a few observations,
                    formulae arc constructed which represent the <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> values
                    of the elliptic elements nearly; every successive observation gives a geocentric
                    latitude and longitude; and by comparing these with the corresponding latitude
                    and longitude computed from the formulae, equations of condition are obtained,
                    by means of which the formulae are corrected and rendered still more exact. New
                    observations give new equations of condition, to be joined with the former; and
                    after a great number of such equations have been obtained, geometry teaches us
                    how to combine them so that each may have its just influence in the
                    determination of the final result. Thus the tables are gradually approximated to
                    perfection, or to such a state that they differ only insensibly from the mean of
                    a great number of observations.</p>
                <p>But the great difficulty of obtaining an exact conformity between observation and
                    the results of computation arises from the circumstance that the different
                    elements of the orbits have no fixed values, but are incessantly though slowly
                    varying, in consequence of the mutual disturbances which the planets occasion to
                    the motions of each other. If the planets had no mutual attraction, and obeyed
                    only the central force of the sun, the problem of determining the different
                    circumstances of their motion would be one of easy solution, and each of them
                    would accurately describe an ellipse on the plane of its orbit, according to the
                    laws of Kepler. In consequence, however, of their mutual attraction, every
                    planet is compelled to deviate more or less from its ellipse; so that when the
                    matter is viewed with mathematical precision, the laws of Kepler belong only to
                    an ideal system, and have no actual existence in nature. It is in the
                    determination of the amount of these causes of perturbation, and the secular
                    variations they give rise to, that the most profound and intricate theories of
                    physical astronomy find their application; for it is from theory alone that we
                    can derive any knowledge of the laws and periods of changes which are completed
                    only after many hundreds or thousands of years. The planets whose motions are
                    most disturbed by their mutual attractions are Jupiter and Saturn; and even with
                    respect to them, observation, although it makes <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193189627" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9627-0024"/>Known the existence of
                    inequalities, can neither detect their laws nor assign their periods. The only
                    elements which are exempted from secular changes occasionedby the perturbing
                    forces are the greater axes of the orbits, and the mean motions depending on
                    them according to the third law of Kepler. The eccentricities of the orbits vary
                    slowly. With regard to Mercury, Mars, and Jupiter, those elements are at the
                    present time increasing; in the cases of Venus, the Earth, Satura, and Uranus,
                    they are diminishing. The perihelia are also gradually shifting their places on
                    the planes of the orbits. These motions are direct in the case of all the
                    planets excepting Venus, the perihelion of whose orbit, when referred to the
                    fixed stars, moves in a direction contrary to that of the signs.</p>

                    Transits of Venus and Mercury over the Suns Dish.</hi> —In what has hitherto
                    been said respecting the mean distances of the planets from the sun, those
                    distances have been estimated in parts of the semi-axis major of the earth’s
                    orbit; a convenient scale, which enables us to form a very precise idea of the
                    relative dimensions of the several orbits, and likewise serves to express their
                    absolute dimensions, provided we can determine the distance between the sun and
                    the earth in terms of any measure with which we are familiar. It is evident,
                    indeed, in consequence of the relation that subsists between the mean distances
                    and mean motions, that it is only necessary to determine the mean distance of
                    any one of the planets from the sun, in order to determine the mean distances of
                    all the others, and assign the dimensions of the whole solar system. Now there
                    are various ways of determining the sun’s distance from the earth in terms of
                    the earth’s semidiameter. The distance of a planet from the sun may likewise be.
                    obtained if we can find the means of measuring its distance from the earth at
                    any epoch; for the geocentric positions of the sun and the planet being known
                    from the theory of their motions, the radius vector of the orbit, or planet’s
                    distance from the sun at that epoch, may be found by a simple trigonometrical
                    computation. To determine the distance of a planet from the earth, it might seem
                    only necessary to determine its horizontal parallax; but in general the
                    parallaxes of the planets are quantities by far too small to be directly
                    observed. That of Mars, however, becomes very appreciable in particular
                    circumstances, that is to say, when Mars is in opposition with the sun, and at
                    the same time near the perihelion of his orbit. Thus, in the year 1751, on the
                    6th of October, that planet, being near his opposition, was observed at the same
                    instant of time by Lacaille at the Cape of Good Hope, and by Wargentin at
                    Stockholm; and the horizontal parallax deduced from the two observations, in the
                    manner explained in chap. i. sect. 2, was found to amount to 24"∙6. Now the
                    distance of the planet being equal to unity divided by the sine of the
                    horizontal parallax, the distance of Mars from the earth at the time of the
                    observation was consequently</p>
                <p>24"∙6 × 3∙1416 648000 <hi rend="subscript"> o ol</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1

                    rend="superscript"> 8381 terrestnal radii</hi> ∙</p>
                <p>But the distance of Mars from the earth at that time, as computed from the theory
                    of his elliptic motion, was 0 ’ 435 parts of the radius of the earth’s orbit;
                    consequent-</p>
                <p>1 × 8381</p>
                <p>ly the whole length of that radius is — <hi rend="subscript"> 7r</hi>-. -- <hi
                    rend="subscript"> r</hi>-- = 19226 <hi rend="superscript"> ; o</hi> 0∙435</p>
                <p>semidiameters of the earth. Hence the distance of Mars from the sun = 19226 +
                    8381 = 27607 semidiameters of the earth. It will be remarked that these numbers
                    are only approximative, our present object being to explain the method, and not
                    to determine the exact quantities.</p>
                <p>But besides the inconvenience attending the determination of a planet’s distance
                    by this method, which requires observations to be made simultaneously on
                    opposite sides of the earth, the method is in itself liable to great
                    uncertainty. The error of a resùlt is always in a certain proportion to the
                    error of observation, and in the present case a very large quantity is to be
                    determined from a very small one; hence a very slight error of observation will
                    occasion a very erroneous result in the computation of the mean distance. It
                    would be difficult in a single observation of this nature to answer for an error
                    of 2"; but here 2" is a twelfth part of the whole parallax; consequently an
                    uncertainty amounting to a twelfth part affects the mean distance.</p>
                <p>A much more accurate method of determining the sun’s distance, and thence the
                    dimensions of the planetary orbits, is afforded, though rarely, by the transits
                    of Venus over the sun’s disk. When Venus is at her inferior conjunction, and at
                    the same time very near her node, her body will be projected on the disk of the
                    sun; and through the effect of her proper motion, combined with that of the
                    earth, she will appear as a dark spot passing over the disk, and describing a
                    chord which will be seen under different aspects by spectators placed at
                    different points on the earth, because, by reason of the parallax, they refer
                    the planet, to different points on the solar disk. The position of the spectator
                    not only occasions a difference in the apparent path described by the planet,
                    but has also a very sensible influence on the duration of the transit, in
                    consequence of which the parallaxes both of Venus and the sun can be determined
                    with great exactness. In order to illustrate this, let E (fig. 73) represent the
                    earth, V Venus, and S the sun. An observer placed at E, the centre of the earth,
                    would see Venus in the direction<pb break="no" facs="nls:193189640"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-9640-0025"/> of the visual ray EV: she would consequently;
                    appear to him projected on the sun’s disk at S, and in her successive positions
                    would appear to describe the line DS. Other observers placed at O' and 0" on the
                    earth’s surface would see the planet at V' and V": to the first she would appear
                    to describe the chord D'V', and to the second D''V". This is a necessary result
                    of the difference of the parallaxes of Venus and the sun; and as the chords
                    D'V', D''V" differ in length according as they are more or less remote from the
                    centre of the disk, the duration of the transit will be longer or shorter
                    according to the situation of the observer and the geocentric latitude of the
                    planet. If by reason of the relative parallax the time of a transit is longer
                    than the true time in one hemisphere, it will be shorter in the opposite; and
                    hence the difference of the times (which may be observed with great accuracy) at
                    places having very different latitudes may serve to determine the relative
                    parallax, or the difference between the parallax of Venus and that of the sun.
                    But the parallaxes are reciprocally proportional to the distances; and the ratio
                    of the distances being known, therefore the ratio of the parallaxes is also
                    known; and having thus the ratio and the difference of the two parallaxes, it is
                    easy to compute the separate amount of each.</p>
                <p>This particular application of the transits of Venus to the determination of the
                    sun’s distance was first pointed out by Dr Halley, when he announced the
                    transits of 1761 and 1769. Kepler had before announced the occurrence of a
                    transit, but he regarded it only as a curious, and till that time unobserved,
                    phenomenon.</p>
                <p>The transit of Venus which occurred in 1769 was anxiously expected by
                    astronomers, and observed in many different parts of the world. The result of
                    the whole of the observations renders it extremely probable that the parallax of
                    the sun is included within the limits of 8"∙5 and 8"∙7. The mean 8"∙6 has been
                    adopted by Delambre and Lalande. From the following table, computed from the
                    different observations, and published by Delambre in the second volume of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Astronomie,</hi> p. 505, an idea may be formed of its probable
                    accuracy. Delambre, indeed, remarks that the sun’s parallax is now sufficiently
                    well known for all the practical purposes of astronomy.</p>

                <p>The transits of Venus being phenomena of great importance, in consequence of
                    their practical application to the problem of the sun’s distance, it becomes
                    interesting to determine the periods at which they successively occur. It is
                    evident that, by reason of the inclination of the orbit, they can only take
                    place when Venus is very near one of her nodes. Two conditions must therefore be
                    satisfied: Venus must be within a short distance of her node, and at the same
                    time in her inferior conjunction. Now, the interval between two successive
                    conjunctions, that is, the period of a synodic revolution, is easily deduced
                    from the sidereal revolutions of the planet and the earth. Thus, generally, let
                    A and B be two planets, T and <hi rend="italic">t</hi> the times of their

                <p>Let us next attend to the other condition which must be satisfied before a
                    transit can take place, namely, that the planet has returned to its node as well
                    as to its inferior conjunction. If we represent by rothe number of revolutions
                    of the earth in the required period, and by <hi rend="italic">n</hi> the number
                    of synodic revolutions of the planet in the same time, it is evident that we

                    and Mercury will be again in conjunction, occupying the same points of their
                    orbits as at the commencement of the period, supposing the nodes fixed. But
                    periods of such enormous length are of no practical use: it is necessary to find
                    an approximating ratio expressed by smaller numbers. For this purpose it is
                    convenient to have recourse to the method of continued fractions, from which the
                    following series is obtained :—</p>
                <p>87969 _1 <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi></p>

                <p><hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> ^ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> 1079’</p>
                <p>Here the first approximating fraction is ⅛, which denotes that in one year,
                    during which there will happen three synodic periods, Mercury will not be very
                    far from his conjunction, nor from the same point of his orbit in which he was
                    at the commencement of that time. The</p>
                <p>Į_ i θ</p>
                <p>next approximation is 3 + θ = τθ, showing that after six years, during which
                    there will have been 19 conjunctions, Mercury will be again nearly in
                    conjunction at the same point of his orbit. By continuing the process we obtain
                    the following series of fractions, each approaching nearer</p>

                    corresponding number of synodic revolutions.</p>
                <p>Approximative fractions might be found in the same manner to express the ratio of
                    the number of revolutions of Mercury to those of the earth, or of ∙^ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> r</hi>; but it is unnecessary to have recourse again to
                    division, inasmuch as they are easily obtained from the above. For example,
                    since the fraction ∣∙ denotes that Mercury has <hi rend="italic">gained</hi>
                    three revolutions on the earth in one year, it is evident that he must have
                    completed 3+1=4 revolutions. In the same way, in six years Mercury gains 19 on
                    the earth, or completes 19 + 6 = 25. Hence, in the series required the
                    numerators of the fractions will continue the same as in the series above, while
                    the denominators will be the sums of the terms of the corresponding fractions.
                    The new series will therefore be</p>

                <p>the numerators being the number of years, and the denominators the corresponding
                    periods of Mercury.</p>
                <p>Applying to the case of Venus and the earth the for- <hi rend="italic subscript">

                <p><hi rend="italic">η</hi> 1405555</p>
                <p>The series of fractions approximating to this ratio, obtained in the manner
                    indicated above, is</p>
                <p>1 2 3 8 227 235 243 1’ 1’ 2’ 5’ 142’ 147’ 152’ <hi rend="superscript">
                    &amp;C</hi> ’ the numerators of which, as before, express the years, and the
                    denominators the synodic periods. Taking the fourth fraction of the series, it
                    appears that after eight years, in which there are five synodic periods, Venus
                    will again occupy nearly the same position with respect to the earth and the
                    nodes of her orbit. This will take place more nearly after 227 years, and more
                    nearly still after 235; consequently, 235 years after a transit has taken place,
                    the occurrence of another may be expected with great probability. The
                    alteration, however, which takes place in the position of the line of the nodes,
                    which in the preceding computations we have regarded as fixed, renders the
                    numbers a little uncertain.</p>
                <p>Since Venus returns to her conjunction at nearly the same point of her orbit
                    after eight years, it may happen, and sometimes indeed actually does happen,
                    that a transit will take place in about eight years after the occurrence of a
                    former one. But in that time the latitude of Venus, in consequence of the
                    inclination of her orbit, undergoes a variation amounting to 20' or 24 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>; in sixteen years the change of latitude increases to
                    40 ’ or 48', which is considerably greater than the diameter of the sun. It
                    cannot happen, therefore, that three transits will take place within sixteen
                    years. From the above series of fractions we might infer that another could not
                    take place before 227 years; but that series was obtained on the supposition
                    that the transits only happen when Venus returns to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >same</hi> node; and it is evident that they may equally occur when the planet
                    is near the other node, and consequently after an interval of half the length of
                    the former, or 113 years. If, at the occurrence of the first transit, Venus has
                    passed her node, the next will happen eight years sooner; or, if she has not
                    reached the node, eight years later. Hence, after two transits have occurred
                    within eight years, another cannot be expected before 105, 113, or 121 years,
                    that is, 113 <hi rend="italic">z±z</hi> 8 years. But these periods sometimes
                    fail: that of 235 brings about the phenomenon with greater certainty, and 243
                    (which is the double of 121) is the surest of all. The periods of 235 and 251
                    are that of 243 diminished or augmented by 8. The whole calculation, therefore,
                    reduces itself to periods of 121 and =±∑ 8 years. The last transits took place
                    in 1761 and 1769; the next will not happen till the years 1874 and 1882; and
                    thus the infrequency of these phenomena adds to the interest they derive from
                    their real importance.</p>
                <p>Delambre has given a list of all the transits of Venus for a period of 2000
                    years, from which the following is extracted. <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Mercury is a small star, but emits a very bright white light, though, by reason
                    of his always keeping near the sun, he is seldom to be seen; and when he does
                    make his appearance, his return to the sun is so rapid, that he can only be
                    discerned for a short space of time. Delambre was able to observe him only twice
                    with the naked eye.</p>
                <p>Mercury is about 3140 English miles in diameter, and his mean distance from the
                    sun about 37 millions of miles. On account of his smallness and brilliancy it is
                    extremely difficult to find any spot on his disk so distinctly marked as to
                    afford the means of determining his rotation. Besides, by reason of his
                    proximity to the sun, an observation of a spot, if made in the evening, can
                    scarcely be well begun before the planet sets; or, if in the morning, before the
                    increasing twilight renders the spot invisible. Hence it is only possible to
                    observe daily a very small arc of a small circle; and if the spot re-appears on
                    the succeeding day, it is doubtful whether the arc which it has passed over
                    exhibits the whole motion, or if one or more circumferences ought to be added.
                    By an attentive observation of the variations of the phases of Mercury,
                    Schroeter has, however, remarked that he revolves about his axis in the space of
                    24 hours 5 minutes 30 seconds. Μ. Harding discovered in 1801 an obscure streak
                    on the southern hemisphere of the planet, the observations of which, together
                    with those of a spot discovered by Schroeter, gave the same period of rotation.
                    The results of Schroeter’s researches on Mercury may be summed up as follows:
                    Isŕ, The apparent diameter of Mercury at his mean distance is 6"∙02; <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">2ćZ,</hi> His form is spherical, exhibiting no sensible

                    shadows, and of which the height bears a greater proportion to the diameter of
                    the planet than those of the Earth, the Moon, or even of Venus. The height of
                    Chimboraço is - <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ∙ <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi><hi

                    earth; one of the mountains in the moon has been estimated at of her radius; the
                    highest in Venus at ψ⅛i and one in Mercury at <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> +y.
                    The highest mountains are in the southern hemisphere, which is also the case in
                    respect of the Earth and Venus. There are no observations to prove decisively
                    whether Mercury is surrounded by an atmosphere.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Venus.</hi></p>
                <p>Venus, the most beautiful star in the heavens, is about 7700 English miles in
                    diameter, and placed at the distance of 68 millions of miles from the sun.
                    Although the oscillations of this planet are considerably greater than those of
                    Mercury, and she is seldom invisible, yet on account of the uniform brilliancy
                    of her disk, it is extremely difficult to ascertain the period of her rotation.
                    Dominic Cassini, after having long fruitlessly attempted to discover any object
                    on her surface so well defined as to enable him to follow its motions, at
                    length, in 1667, perceived a bright part, distant from the southern horn a
                    little more than a fourth part of the diameter of the disk, and near the eastern
                    edge. By continuing his observations on this spot, Cassini concluded the
                    rotation of Venus to be performed in about 23 hours; but he does not seem to
                    have considered this conclusion as deserving of much confidence. In the year
                    1726 Bianchini, an Italian astronomer, made a number of similar observations for
                    the same purpose, from which he inferred that the rotation of the planet is
                    performed in 24 days 8 hours. The younger Cassini has shown, however, that the
                    observations of Bianchini, as well as those of his father, could be explained by
                    a rotation of 23 hours and 21 or 22 minutes, whereas the rotation of 24 days 8
                    hours cannot be reconciled with the appearances observed by the elder Cassini.
                    The determination of Cassini was regarded by astronomers as the more probable of
                    the two, particularly as Bianchini was not able to make his observations in a
                    connected manner, on account that a neighbouring building intercepted his view
                    of the planet, and obliged him to transport his telescope to a different
                    situation. The question of the rotation of Venus was finally settled by
                    Schroeter, who found it to be performed in 23 hours 21 minutes 19 seconds. Each
                    of the three observers found the inclination of the axis of rotation to the axis
                    of the ecliptic to be about 75°. Some doubt, however, still exists with respect
                    to the value of this element.</p>
                <p>Schroeter’s observations on this planet were principally directed to a mountain
                    situated near the southern horn. The line which joins the extremities of the
                    horns is always a diameter; and the horns of the crescent of a perfect sphere
                    ought to be sharp and pointed. Schroeter remarked that this was not always the
                    case with regard to the horns of Mercury and Venus. The northern horn of the
                    latter always preserved the pointed form, but the southern occasionally appeared
                    rounded or obtuse,—a circumstance which indicated that the shadow of a mountain
                    covered the part Bo (fig. 74), so that the line joining the extremities of the
                    horns appeared to be Ao, and not AB (perpendicular to CD, the axis of the
                    ecliptic); but at <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> beyond oB, he remarked a luminous
                    point, which he supposed to be the summit of another mountain, illuminated by
                    the sun after he had ceased to be visible to the rest of that hemisphere. Now,
                    in order that the horn of the crescent may appear obtuse in consequence of the
                    shadow of a mountain falling upon it, and another mountain <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> present a luminous point, the two mountains must be at the same time
                    both at the edge of the disk and on the line separating the dark from the
                    enlightened part of the planet. But this position cannot be of long continuance;
                    for the rotation will cause <hi rend="italic">d</hi> to rise into the
                    enlightened part, or sink into the dark hemisphere, and in either case the
                    mountain will cease to be visible. If, however, the rotation is completed in 23
                    hours 21 min., the mountain <hi rend="italic">d</hi> will appear 39 min. sooner
                    than it did on the previous day; for in the course of a day the boundary of
                    light and darkness will hardly have shifted its position on the surface of the
                    planet through the effects of the orbital motion. Hence it is possible to obtain
                    several consecutive observations, from which an approximate value of the period
                    may be found; and this being once obtained, it may be rendered still more exact
                    by observations separated from each other by a longer interval. Thus Schroeter
                    found that an interval of 20 days 11 hours 15 min. between two apparitions of
                    the mountain being divided by 23 hours 21 min., gave 21 ’ 005 revolutions. That
                    intervals of 121 days 14 hours 25 min., 142 days 1 hour 40 min., 155 days 18
                    hours 11 min., divided each by 23 hours 21 min., gave 125∙01, 146Ό2, 165*09
                    revolutions respectively. All these comparisons prove that the revolution of 23
                    hours 21 min. is somewhat too short. They ought to have given 21, 125, 146, and
                    165 revolutions exactly, supposing the observations to have been perfectly
                    accurate. On dividing the intervals by 21, 125, 146, and 165 respectively, the
                    quotients will be each the time of a revolution very nearly; and by taking a
                    mean among the whole, the most pro <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189679"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-9679-0028"/>bable result at least will be obtained. In this
                    manner •Schroeter found the period of rotation already stated, namely, 23 hours
                    21 min. 19 sec.</p>
                <p>Since the time of rotation of Mercury and Venus is nearly equal to that of the
                    earth, the compression of these planets at the poles, which results from the
                    centrifugal force, ought also to be nearly in the same proportion. But at the
                    distance of the earth the compression must be imperceptible even in the case of
                    Venus; for, supposing it to amount to the difference between the radius of her
                    poles and that of her equator would only amount to a tenth of a second as seen
                    from the earth.</p>
                <p>During the transits of Venus over the sun’s disk in 1761 and 1769 a sort of
                    penumbral light was observed round the planet by several astronomers, which was
                    occasioned, without doubt, by the refractive powers of her atmosphere. Wargentin
                    remarked that the limb of Venus which had gone off the sun showed itself with a
                    faint light during almost the whole time of emersion. Bergman, who observed the
                    transit of 1761 at Upsal, says that at the ingress the part which had not come
                    upon the sun was visible, though dark, and surrounded by a crescent of faint
                    light, as in fig. 75; but this appearance was much more remarkable at the
                    egress; for as soon as any part of the planet had disengaged itself from the
                    sun’s disk, that part was visible with a like crescent, but brighter (fig. 76).
                    As more of the planet’s disk disengaged itself from that of the sun, the part of
                    the crescent farthest from the sun grew fainter, and vanished, until at last
                    only the horns could be seen, as in fig.77. The total immersion and emersion
                    were not instantaneous; but as two drops of water, when about to separate, form
                    a ligament between them, so there was a dark shade stretched out between Venus
                    and the sun, as in fig. 78; and when this ligament broke, the planet seemed to
                    have got about an eighth part of her diameter from the limb of the sun (fig.
                    79). The numerous accounts of the two transits which have been published abound
                    with analogous observations, indicating the existence of an atmosphere of
                    considerable height and density. Schroeter calculated that its horizontal
                    refraction must amount to 3 O' 34'', differing little from that of the
                    terrestrial atmosphere. A twilight which he perceived on the cusps afforded him
                    the data from which he deduced this conclusion.</p>
                <p>Cassini and Montaigne imagined that they had observed a satellite accompanying
                    Venus; but this appears to have been an optical illusion arising from the strong
                    light of the planet reflected back from the convex surface of the eye upon the
                    eye-glass of the telescope, and thence reflected a second time back to the eye.
                    This hypothesis at least will explain the appearances which they have described;
                    and although astronomers have sought tor this pretended satellite with great
                    care, they have neither observed it on the sun during the transits of Venus in
                    1761 and 1769, nor in any other part of her orbit.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mars.</hi></p>
                <p>After Venus, Mars is the planet whose orbit is nearest to the earth. His diameter
                    is about one half, and his volume only about one fifth part of that of our
                    globe. He is of a dusky reddish colour, by reason of which he is easily
                    recognised in the heavens. His mean distance from the sun is about 142 millions
                    of miles.</p>
                <p>The rotation of Mars was suspected before the year 1643 by Fontana, a Neapolitan
                    astronomer; but it was reserved for Cassini to demonstrate its existence and
                    assign its period. Cassini began to observe the spots on the surface of Mars at
                    Bologna in 1666; and after having continued his observations for a month, he
                    found they returned to the same situation in 24 hours and 40 min. The planet was
                    observed by some astronomers at Rome with longer telescopes; but they assigned
                    to it a rotation of 13 hours only. This, however, was afterwards shown by
                    Cassini to have arisen from their not distinguishing between the opposite sides
                    of the planet, which, it seems, have spots pretty much alike. He made further
                    observations on the spots of this planet in 1670; which confirmed his former
                    conclusion respecting the time of rotation. The spots were again observed in
                    subsequent oppositions, particularly for several days in 1704 by Maraldi, who
                    took notice that they were not always well defined, and that they not only
                    changed their shape frequently in the interval between two oppositions, but even
                    in the space of a month. Some of them, however, continued of the same form long
                    enough to allow the time of the planet’s rotation to be determined. Among these
                    there appeared that year an oblong spot, resembling one of the belts of Jupiter
                    when broken. It did not reach quite round the body of the planet; but had, not
                    far from the middle of it, a small protuberance towards the north, so well
                    defined that Maraldi was thereby enabled to fix the period of its revolution at
                    24 hours 39 min., only one minute less than what Cassini had determined it to
                    be.</p>
                <p>The near approach of Mars to the earth in 1719 afforded an excellent opportunity
                    of observing him, as he was then within 2ģ-° of his perihelion, and at the same
                    time in opposition to the sun. His apparent magnitude and brightness were thus
                    so much increased, that he was by the vulgar taken for a new star. His
                    appearance at that time, as seen by Maraldi through a telescope of 34 feet long,
                    is represented in fig. 80. There was then a long belt that reached half-way
                    round, to the end of which another shorter belt was joined, forming an obtuse
                    angle with the former, as in fig. 81. This angular point was observed on the
                    19th and 20th of August, a little to the east of the middle of the disk; and 37
                    days after, on the 25th and 26th of September, it returned to the same
                    situation. This interval, divided by 36, the number of revolutions contained in
                    it, gives 24 hours 40 minutes for the period of one revolution; a result which
                    was verified by another spot of a triangular shape, one angle whereof was
                    towards the north pole, and the base towards the south, and which on the 5th and
                    6th of August appeared as in fig. 82. After 72 revolutions it returned to the
                    same situation on the 16th and 17th of October. Some of the belts of this planet
                    are said to be parallel to his equator; but that seen by Maraldi was very much
                    inclined to it.</p>
                <p>Besides these dark spots on the surface of Mars, astronomers had noticed that a
                    segment of his globe about the south pole exceeded the rest of his disk so much
                    in brightness, that it appeared to project as if it were the segment of a larger
                    globe. Maraldi informs us that this bright spot had been taken notice of for 60
                    years, and was more permanent than the other spots on the planet. One part of it
                    is brighter than the rest, and the least bright part is subject to great
                    changes, and has sometimes disappeared.</p>
                <p>A similar though less remarkable brightness about the north pole of Mars was also
                    sometimes observed, the existence of which has been confirmed by Sir W.
                    Herschel, who examined the planet with telescopes of much greater power than any
                    former astronomer ever was in possession of. A very full account of Herschel’s
                    observa-] tions on this planet is given in the 74th volume of the∑ <hi

                    83—88. The magnifying powers he used were sometimes as high <pb break="no"

                    south polar spot was found to •be 4P" in diameter. Fig. 96 shows the connection
                    of the other figures marked 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, which Complete the whole
                    equatorial succession of spots on the disk of the planet. “The centre of the
                    circle,” Herschel observes, “marked 90, is placed on the circumference of the
                    inner circle, by making its distance from the circle, marked 92, answer to the
                    interval of time between the two observations, properly calculated and reduced
                    to sidereal measure. The same is done with regard to the circles marked 91, 92,
                    &amp;c.; and it will be found by placing any one of these connected circles in
                    such a manner as to have its contents in a similar situation with the figures in
                    the single representation, which are marked with the same number, that there is
                    a sufficient resemblance between them; though some allowance must be made for
                    the distortions occasioned by this kind of projection.”</p>
                <p>From these observations Herschel concluded that the diurnal rotation of Mars is
                    accomplished in 24 hours 39 minutes 21-∣ seconds; that his equatoris inclined to
                    his orbit in an angle of 28° 42', and his axis of rotation to the axis of the
                    ecliptic in an angle of 30° 18'. Hence the time of rotation and the seasons of
                    this planet are little different from those of the earth.</p>
                <p>The bright appearance so remarkable about the poles of Mars is ascribed by
                    Herschel to the reflection of light from mountains of ice and snow accumulated
                    in those regions. “The analogy between Mars and the earth,” says he, “is perhaps
                    by far the greatest in the whole solar system. Their diurnal motion is nearly
                    the same, the obliquity of their respective ecliptics not very different; of all
                    the superior planets, the distance of Mars from the sun is by far the nearest
                    alike to that of the earth; nor will the length of the Martial year appear very
                    different from what we enjoy, when compared to the surprising duration of the
                    years of Jupiter, Saturn, and the Georgium Sidus. If we then find that the globe
                    we inhabit has its polar region frozen and covered with mountains of ice and
                    snow, that only partly melt when alternately exposed to the sun, I may well be
                    permitted to surmise, that the same causes may probably have the same effect on
                    the globe of Mars; that the bright polar spots are owing to the vivid reflection
                    of light from frozen regions; and that the reduction of those spots is to be
                    ascribed to their being exposed to the sun.”</p>
                <p>Since the discovery of the flattened form of the earth, it was to be presumed
                    that the rotation of the other planets would produce a similar effect on their
                    figures, and this supposition has been fully confirmed by observation. The time
                    of the rotation of Mars is nearly equal to that of the earth, but his diameter
                    being only about half that of the earth, the velocity of a point on his equator
                    is consequently only half as great as that of a point on the earth’s equator:
                    hence we might expect that the deviation of his figure from a perfect sphere
                    would be much less considerable. The contrary, however, appears to be the case;
                    and his compression seems to be much greater than that of the earth. According
                    to Herschel, the ratio of his equatorial and polar axes is 103 to 98. Schrocter
                    estimates the same ratio to be that of 81 to 80. This remarkable compression at
                    the poles of Mars arises in all probability from considerable variations of
                    density in the different parts of his globé</p>
                <p>it has been commonly related by astronomers, that the atmosphere of this planet
                    is possessed of such strong refractive powers as to render invisible the small
                    fixed stars near which it passes. Dr Smith relates an observation of Cassini, in
                    which a star in the water of Aquarius, at the distance of six minutes from the
                    disk of Mars, became so faint before its occultation, that it could not be seen
                    <hi rend="superscript"> b</hi> y the naked eye, nor even with a three feet
                    telescope. This would indicate an atmosphere of a very extraordinary size and
                    density; but the following observations of Herschel seem to show that it is of
                    much smaller dimensions. “1783, Oct. 26th. There are two small stars preceding
                    Mars, of different sizes; with 460 they appear both dusky red, and are pretty
                    unequal; with 218 they appear considerably unequal. The distance from Mars of
                    the nearest, which is also the largest, with 227, measured 3' 26" 20'". Some
                    time after, the same evening, the distance was 3' 8" 55"', Mars being
                    retrograde. Both of them were seen very distinctly. They were viewed with a new
                    20 feet reflector, and appeared very bright. October 27th: the small star is not
                    quite sobright in proportion to the large one as it was last night, being a good
                    deal nearer to Mars, which is now on the side of the small star; but when the
                    planet was drawn aside, or out of view, it appeared as plainly as usual. The
                    distance of the small star was 2' 5" 25'". The largest of the two stars,” adds
                    he, “on which the above observations were made, cannot exceed the 12th, and the
                    smallest the 13th or 14th magnitude; and I have no reason to suppose that they
                    were any otherwise affected by the approach of Mars, than what the brightness of
                    its superior light may account for. From other phenomena it appears, however,
                    that this planet is not without a considerable atmosphere; for, besides the
                    permanent spots on its surface, I have often noticed occasional changes of
                    partial bright belts, and also once a darkish one in a pretty high latitude; and
                    these alterations we can hardly ascribe to any other cause than the variable
                    disposition of clouds and vapours floating in the atmosphere of the planet.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta.</hi></p>
                <p>The commencement of the present century was rendered remarkable in the annals of
                    astronomy by the discovery of four new planets circulating between Mars and
                    Jupiter. Kepler, from some analogy which he found to subsist among the distances
                    of the planets from the sun, had long before suspected the existence of one at
                    this distance; and his conjecture was rendered more probable by the discovery of
                    Uranus, with regard to which the analogy of the other planets is observed. So
                    strongly, indeed, were astronomers impressed with the idea that a planet would
                    be found between Mars and Jupiter, that, in the hope of discovering it, Baron
                    Zach formed an association of 24 observers, who divided the sky into as many
                    zones, and undertook each to explore one carefully. A fortunate accident
                    anticipated a discovery which might have required years of toil. An error in the
                    catalogue of Wollaston, who had laid down a star in a position in which it is
                    not to be found, engaged Piazzi, the superintendent of the observatory at
                    Palermo, to observe for several successive days all the small stars in the
                    neighbourhood of the place indicated. On the first day of the present century,
                    the 1st of January 1801, he observed a small star in Taurus, which, on the day
                    following, appeared to have changed its place. On the 3d he repeated his
                    observation, and was then satisfied that it had a diurnal motion of about 4' in
                    right ascension, and 3'⅜ in declination towards the north pole. He continued to
                    observe it till the 23d, when he communicated his discovery to MM. Bode and
                    Oriani, giving them the positions of the star on the 1st and 23d, and only
                    adding, that between the 11th and 13th its motion had changed from retrograde to
                    direct. Before the communication reached them, however, the planet was lost in
                    the sun’s rays; and, owing to its extreme<pb break="no" facs="nls:193189705"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-9705-0030"/> smallness, the difficulty of finding it after its
                    emergence was so great, that it was not again seen till the 31st of the
                    following December, when it was detected by Zach. In this was recognised the
                    planet which Kepler bad suspected to circulate between Mars and Jupiter. Piazzi,
                    in honour of Sicily, gave it the name of the tutelary goddess of that country,
                    <hi rend="italic">Ceres</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and her emblem, the sickle,
                    , has been adopted as its appropriate symbol.</p>
                <p>Ceres is of a reddish colour, and appears to be about the size of a star of the
                    eighth magnitude. The eccentricity of her orbit is somewhat greater than that of
                    Mercury; and its inclination to the ecliptic greater than that of any of the old
                    planets. The distance of Ceres from the sun is about 3∙2 times that of the
                    earth, or nearly 270 millions of miles. Schroeter found her apparent diameter to
                    be 2", corresponding to about 1624 miles; but Herschel reduced this measurement
                    to 0"∙5, which would indicate a diameter of about 160 miles. The nebulosity
                    which surrounds the planet renders it almost impossible to distinguish the true
                    disk; and hence arises the great discrepancy between the above estimates of its
                    magnitude. From a great number of observations, Schroeter inferred that Ceres
                    has a dense atmosphere, rising to the height of no less than 675 English miles
                    above the planet, and subject to numerous changes. On this account he conceives
                    that there is little chance of discovering the period of its rotation.</p>
                <p>The difficulty of finding Ceres induced Dr Olbers of Bremen to examine with
                    particular care the configurations of all the small stars situated near her
                    geocentric path. On the 28th of March 1802 he observed a star of the seventh
                    magnitude, which formed an equilateral triangle with the stars 20 and 191 of
                    Virgo in Bode’s catalogue. He was certain that he had never seen a star in that
                    place before, and at first imagined it might be one of those which are subject
                    to periodical changes of brilliancy; but after examining it for two hours, he
                    remarked that its right ascension was diminishing, while its northern
                    declination continued to augment nearly in the same manner as had been the case
                    with Ceres when that planet was first seen by him in almost the same position.
                    On the following day he found its right ascension had diminished 10', while its
                    northern declination had increased 20'. From observations continued during a
                    month, Μ. Gauss calculated an elliptic orbit, the eccentricity of which amounted
                    to ∙24764, much greater than that of any of the other planets. He also found its
                    inclination to be 34° 39', exceeding the aggregate inclinations of all the other
                    planetary orbits; and its mean distance 2*770552, almost the same as that of
                    Ceres. On account of these three circumstances, the new planet, otherwise of
                    little importance, became the most singular in the whole system. One planet had
                    been suspected to exist between Mars and Jupiter, and two were now discovered.
                    The great inclination of the last rendered it necessary to enlarge the
                    boundaries of the zodiac; but the extent of the zodiac is entirely arbitrary,
                    and had been limited by the extreme latitudes of Venus. There is no reason, as
                    Delambre remarks, why it may not be extended even to the poles. Dr Olbers gave
                    the new planet the name of Pallas, choosing for its symbol the lance, γ , the
                    attribute of Minerva.</p>
                <p>The most surprising circumstance connected with the discovery of Pallas was the
                    existence of two planets at nearly the same distance from the sun, and
                    apparently having a common node. On account of this singularity Dr Olbers was
                    led to conjecture that Ceres and Pallas are only fragments of a larger planet,
                    which had formerly circulated at the same distance, and been shattered by some
                    internal convulsion. Lagrange made this hypothesis the subject of an ingenious
                    memoir, in which he determined the explosive force necessary to detach a
                    fragment from a planet with a velocity that would cause it to describe the orbit
                    of a comet. He found that a fragment detached from the earth in this manner,
                    with a velocity equal to 121 times that of a cannon-ball, would become a direct
                    comet; and if with a velocity equal to 156 times that of a cannon-ball, its
                    motion would be retrograde. For</p>
                <p>121 or 156</p>
                <p>other planets the velocity must be —;—— ·. , and</p>
                <p>√mean distance consequently less as the mean distance of the planet from the sun
                    is greater. A smaller velocity would be required to cause the detached fragment
                    to move in an elliptic orbit; and with regard to the four small planets we are
                    now considering, an explosive force less than twenty times that of a cannon-ball
                    would have sufficed to detach them from a primitive planet, and cause them to
                    describe ellipses similar to their actual orbits. This hypothesis served also to
                    explain the great eccentricities and inclinations by which these planets are
                    distinguished from the others belonging to the system; for it is evident that
                    the explosive force must have projected the different fragments in all
                    directions, and with different velocities. It followed also, that other
                    fragments of the original planet might probably exist, revolving in orbits
                    which, however they might differ in respect of inclination and eccentricity,
                    would still intersect each other in the same points, or have common nodes, in
                    which the several fragments would necessarily be found at each revolution. Dr
                    Olbers therefore proposed to examine carefully every month the two opposite
                    parts of the heavens in which the orbits of Ceres and Pallas intersect each
                    other, with a view to the discovery of other planets, which might be sought for
                    in those parts with greater chance of success than in a wider zone embracing the
                    whole limits of their orbits. Subsequent discoveries demonstrated the soundness
                    of his conjecture, and gave a degree of probability to his hypothesis.</p>
                <p>According to Herschel, the diameter of Pallas is only about 80 English miles, or
                    about one half of that which he assigned to Ceres, while Schroeter estimates it
                    at 2099 miles, Schroeter also found the atmosphere of Pallas to be about two
                    thirds of the height of that of Ceres, or about 450 miles. The light of the
                    planet undergoes considerable variations, the cause of which is uncertain.</p>
                <p>While Μ. Harding, of the observatory of Lilienthal, near Bremen, was engaged in
                    forming a complete zodiac of the small telescopic stars near the orbits of Ceres
                    and Pallas, with which these planets were likely to be confounded, he
                    determined, on the 22d of September 1804, the position of a small star, by
                    comparing it with the two stars marked 93 and 98 of Pisces in Bode’s catalogue.
                    These two stars are situated very near the equator, and at a small distance from
                    one of the nodes of Ceres and Pallas, and exactly in that sort of <hi
                    rend="italic">defile</hi> where, according to Dr Olbers, an observer would be
                    certain of detecting in their passage the other fragments of the original planet
                    of which Ceres and Pallas are parts. On the 4th the star was no longer in the
                    same position, but had moved a little to the south-west. On the 5th and 6th Μ.
                    Harding, by means of a circular micrometer, determined the rate of its motion to
                    be 12' 42" in declination to the south, and 7' 30" in right ascension,
                    retrograde, the interval between the observations being 24 hours 14 min. 12 sec.
                    From this it was evident that the body belonged to the planetary system. It had
                    then the appearance of a star between the eighth and ninth magnitudes. It was
                    without any nebulosity, and of a whitish colour. A few days <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193189718" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9718-0031"/>afterwards the elements of
                    its orbit were computed by Gauss. This planet has received the name of Juno, and
                    for its symbol ÿ, the starry sceptre of the queen of Olympus.</p>
                <p>Juno is distinguished from the other planets by the great eccentricity of her
                    orbit, which is so considerable, that she describes that half of it which is
                    bisected by the perihelion in about half the time which she employs to describe
                    the other half. This planet is somewhat smaller than Ceres and Pallas, and,
                    though free from nebulosity, must have, according to Schroeter’s observations,
                    an atmosphere of greater density than that of any of the old planets.</p>
                <p>The success of Μ. Harding encouraged Dr Olbers to renew the plan of research
                    which he had pointed out on the discovery of Pallas; and on the 29th of March
                    1807 he perceived, in the constellation of Virgo, a star of the fifth or sixth
                    magnitude, which he suspected from the first observation to be a new planet. A
                    few subsequent observations rendered this conjecture certain. Dr Olbers left to
                    Gauss the care of giving a name to the new planet, and of determining the
                    elements of its orbit. Gauss named it Vesta, and chose for its symbol Jį, an
                    altar surmounted with a censer holding the sacred fire. Vesta is the smallest of
                    all the celestial bodies known to us. Her volume is only about a fifteen
                    thousandth part of that of the earth, and her surface is about equal to that of
                    the kingdom of Spain. She is distinguished by the vivacity of her light, and the
                    luminous atmosphere with which she is surrounded.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Jupiter.</hi></p>
                <p>Jupiter is by far the largest planet in the system. His diameter is about 11
                    times, and his volume 1281 times, greater than that of the earth. His distance
                    from the sun is <hi rend="italic">5Í</hi> times the radius of the ecliptic, or
                    nearly 125,000 terrestrial semidiameters, and consequently above 490 millions of
                    miles. His apparent diameter, which, at his mean distance, is 36"∙7, and varies
                    between 45"∙8 and 30", would subtend an angle of 3' 17" if seen at the same
                    distance as the sun. From Jupiter the sun will appear under an angle of &amp; at
                    most; the sun’s disk will appear to be 27 times smaller than when seen from the
                    earth, consequently the light and heat which Jupiter receives from the sun will
                    be only the 27th part of what is received by our globe. His density is ∙99239,
                    that of the sun being considered as unity, or is about one fourth of the density
                    of the earth; and a body which weighs one pound at the equator of the earth,
                    would weigh 2∙444 pounds if removed to the equator of Jupiter.</p>
                <p>Jupiter has the same general appearance with Mars, only the belts on his surface
                    are much larger and more permanent. Their usual appearance, as described by Dr
                    Long, is represented fig. 97-100; but they are not to be seen but by an
                    excellent telescope. They are said to have been first discovered by Fontana and
                    two other Italians, but Cassini was the first who gave a good account of them.
                    Their number is very variable, as sometimes only one, but seldom more than
                    three, may be perceived. Messier at one time saw so great a number that the
                    whole disk seemed to be covered by them. They are generally parallel to one
                    another, but not always so, and their breadth is likewise variable, one belt
                    having been observed to grow narrow, while another in its neighbourhood has
                    increased in breadth, as if the one had flowed into the other: and in this case
                    a part of an oblique belt lay between them, as if to form a communication for
                    this purpose. The time of their continuance is very uncertain: sometimes they
                    remain unchanged for three months, at other times new belts have been formed in
                    an hour or two. In some of these belts large black spots have appeared, which
                    moved swiftly over the disk from east to west, and returned in a short time to
                    the same place; whence the rotation of this planet about its axis has been
                    determined. On the 9th of May 1664, Dr Hooke, with a twelve feet telescope,
                    observed a small spot in the broadest of the three obscure belts of Jupiter; and
                    observing it from time to time, found that in two hours it had moved from east
                    to west about half the visible diameter of the planet. In 1665 Cassini observed
                    a spot near the largest belt of Jupiter, which is most frequently seen. It
                    appeared round, and moved with the greatest velocity when in the middle, but
                    appeared narrower, and moved slower, the nearer it was to the circumference;
                    showing that the spot adhered to the body of Jupiter, and was carried round upon
                    it. This principal, or ancient spot as it is called, is the largest and the most
                    permanent of any hitherto known; it appeared and vanished no fewer than eight
                    times between the years 1665 and 1708: from the year last mentioned it was
                    invisible till 1713. The longest time of its continuing to be visible was three
                    years, and the longest time of its disappearing was from 1708 to 1713. It seems
                    to have some connection with the principal southern belt; for the spot has never
                    been seen when that disappeared, though the belt itself has often been visible
                    without the spot. Besides this ancient spot, Cassini, in the year 1699, saw one
                    of less stability, that did not continue of the same shape or dimensions, but
                    broke into several small ones, whereof the revolution was but 9 hours 51 min.;
                    and two other spots that revolved in 9 hours 52ļ min. The changes in the
                    appearance of the spots, and the difference in the time of their rotation, make
                    it probable that they do not adhere to Jupiter, but are clouds transported by
                    the winds, with different velocities, in an atmosphere subject to violent
                    agitations.</p>
                <p>By means of the spots, which can be easily observed, the rotation of Jupiter has
                    been determined with considerable precision. The time of rotation, according to
                    Cassini, Maraldi, and others, is 9 hours and between 55 and 56 minutes:
                    Schroeter makes it 9 hours 55 min. 33 see. The inclination of his equator to his
                    orbit is only 3° 5' 30", so that the variations of his seasons must be almost
                    insensible.</p>
                <p>The radius of Jupiter being nearly 11 times (10*86) that of our earth, and his
                    rotation being 2*4 times more rapid, it follows that the space passed over by a
                    point on his equator is 26 times greater than that passed over by a point of the
                    terrestrial equator in the same time. Hence the centrifugal force is 26 times
                    greater; and if the spheroidal form of the earth is occasioned by the diurnal
                    motion, we may expect to find the same effects on a much larger scale exhibited
                    in the form of Jupiter. And this is in fact observed to be the case; for the
                    compression of Jupiter is about ∙⅛th of his radius, the diameter of his equator
                    being to that of his poles as 15 to 14 nearly, while that of the earth is only
                    <hi rend="subscript"> κ</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>-th. According to
                    Struve, the equatorial diameter at tĥe mean distance subtends an angle of
                    38"∙327, the polar 35"∙538; and the ellipticity is 0Ό728 = ļ <hi
                    rend="strikethrough">ĝſÿļ·</hi></p>
                <p>The annual parallax of Jupiter is less than 12°, consequently the earth, as seen
                    from Jupiter, will never appear at a greater distance than 11° or 12° from the
                    sun. The digressions of Mars would be 17° 2', those of Venus 8°, and those of
                    Mercury only 4° 16'. An inhabitant of Jupiter must therefore be probably
                    ignorant of the existence of Mercury, which will be almost constantly plunged in
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189731" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9731-0032"/> the sun’s
                    rays, and likewise greatly diminished in splendour, on account of his great
                    distance. From this we may infer the possibility of the existence of planets
                    inferior to Mercury, and invisible to us, for similar reasons.</p>
                <p>On observing Jupiter through the telescope, he is seen accompanied by four little
                    stars, which oscillate on both sides of him, and follow him in his orbit as the
                    moon follows the earth. On this account they are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >satellites</hi> or attendants. They were first noticed by Galileo within a year
                    after the discovery of the telescope; and it was soon perceived that they
                    revolve around Jupiter in narrow circles, the planes of which deviate little
                    from that of the equator of the planet. They are distinguished from one another
                    by the denomination of <hi rend="italic">first, second, third,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">fourth,</hi> according to their relative distances from Jupiter,
                    the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> being that which is nearest to him. Their
                    apparent motion is oscillatory, like that of a pendulum, going alternately from
                    their greatest elongation on one side to their greatest elongation on the other,
                    sometimes in a straight line and sometimes in an elliptic curve, according to
                    the different points of view in which we observe them from the earth. They have
                    also their stations and retrogradations, and exhibit in miniature all the
                    phenomena of the planetary system.</p>
                <p>Since the satellites revolve in orbits about the huge orb of Jupiter, it is
                    evident that occultations of them must frequently happen, by their going behind
                    their primary, or by coming in between us and it; in the former case when they
                    proceed towards the middle of their upper semicircle, and in the latter when
                    they pass through the same part of their inferior semicircle. Occultations of
                    the former kind happen to the first and second satellites at every revolution;
                    the third very rarely escapes an occultation; but the fourth more frequently, by
                    reason of its greater distance. It is seldom that a satellite can be discovered
                    upon the disk of Jupiter, even by the best telescopes, excepting at its first
                    entrance, when, by reason of its being more directly illuminated by the rays of
                    the sun than the planet itself, it appears like a lucid spot upon it. Sometimes,
                    however, a satellite in passing over the disk appears like a dark spot, and can
                    be easily distinguished. This is supposed to be owing to spots on the body of
                    these secondary planets; and it is remarkable that the same satellite has been
                    known to pass over the disk at one time as a dark spot, and at another appearing
                    so luminous that it could not be distinguished from Jupiter himself, except at
                    its coming on and going off. To account for this diversity of appearance, we
                    must suppose either that the spots are subject to change, or, if they be
                    permanent, like those of our moon, that the different portions of the surfaces
                    of the satellites are not equally luminous, and that at different times they
                    turn different parts of their globes towards us. Possibly both these causes may
                    contribute to produce the phenomena just mentioned. By reason of the spots,
                    also, both the light and apparent magnitude of the satellites are variable; for
                    the fewer spots there are upon that side which is turned towards us, the
                    brighter it will appear; and as the bright parts only can be seen, a satellite
                    must appear larger the more of its bright side it turns towards the earth, and
                    smaller the more it happens to be covered with spots. The fourth satellite,
                    though generally the smallest, sometimes appears larger than any of the rest.
                    The third sometimes seems least, though usually the largest; nay, a satellite
                    may be so covered with spots as to appear less than its shadow passing over the
                    disk of the primary, though we are certain that the shadow must be smaller than
                    the body from which it is projected. To a spectator placed on the surface of
                    Jupiter, each of these satellites would put on the phases of the moon; but as
                    the distance of any of them from Jupiter is but small when compared with the
                    distance of that planet from the sun, the satellites are illuminated by the sun
                    very nearly in the same manner with the primary itself; hence they appear to us
                    always round, having constantly the greater part of their enlightened half
                    turned towards the earth; and, indeed, on account of their small size, their
                    phases can scarcely be discerned even through the best telescopes. Their spots,
                    or rather the observed variations of their brilliancy at different times, have
                    afforded the means of determining the fact and the period of their rotation; and
                    it is a very remarkable circumstance that they all, like the moon, constantly
                    turn the same face towards their primary, or complete a rotation about their
                    respective axes in the same time in which they perform a revolution in their
                    orbits.</p>
                <p>When the satellites pass through their inferior semicircles, they may cast a
                    shadow upon their primary, and thus cause an eclipse of the sun; and in some
                    situations this shadow may be observed going before or following the satellite.
                    On the other hand, in passing through their superior semicircles, the satellites
                    may be eclipsed in the same manner as our moon, by passing through the shadow of
                    Jupiter. And this is actually the case with the first, second, and third of
                    these bodies; but the fourth, by reason of the greater magnitude and inclination
                    of its orbit, passes sometimes above or below the shadow, as is the case with
                    the moon. The beginnings and endings of these eclipses are easily seen through
                    the telescope, when Jupiter is at a sufficient distance from the sun. The same
                    satellite disappears at different distances from the planet, according to the
                    relative situations of Jupiter, the sun, and the earth; but always on that side
                    of the disk where the shadow of the planet is known from computation to be. With
                    regard to the first and second satellites, the immersions only are visible while
                    Jupiter is passing from his conjunction to his opposition with the sun, and the
                    emersions while he passes from his opposition to his conjunction. The third and
                    fourth sometimes disappear, and again appear on the same side of the disk; and
                    the time during which the satellite continues invisible is exactly that in
                    which, according to computation, it would pass through the planet’s shadow. When
                    Jupiter is near his opposition, the eclipses take place when the satellites are
                    close to his disk; because the eye of the spectator is then nearly in the axis
                    of the dark cone formed by his shadow.</p>
                <p>These various phenomena will be better understood by referring to fig. 101, where
                    A, B, C, D, represent the earth in different parts of its orbit; J Jupiter in
                    his orbit MN, surrounded by his four satellites, the orbits of which are marked
                    1, 2, 3, 4. At <hi rend="italic">a</hi> the first satellite enters the shadow of
                    the planet; at <hi rend="italic">b</hi> it emerges from it, and advances to its
                    greatest eastern elongation at <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> It appears to pass over
                    the disk of Jupiter like a dark spot at <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and attains
                    its greatest western elongation at <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> Similar phenomena
                    take place with respect to the other satellites. Now, since the shadow of
                    Jupiter is always directed away from the sun, the immersions only will be
                    visible to the earth when the earth passes from the position C to the position
                    A; for the eastern limit of Jupiter conceals the satellite at the time of
                    emersion, as is evident by drawing <hi rend="italic">f 9</hi> in the direction
                    of the visual ray. For the same reason the emersions only are visible while the
                    earth is passing from A to C, or when Jupiter advances from his opposition to
                    his conjunction. This, however, is only strictly true of the first satellite;
                    for the third and. fourth, as we have already remarked, and sometimes even the
                    second, owing to their greater distances from Jupiter, occasionally disappear
                    and re-appear on the same side of the disk.</p>
                <p>The disks of the satellites having no sensible magnitude<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193189744" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9744-0033"/> except in the very best
                    telescopes, their diameters have only recently been determined by direct
                    measurement. Schroeter and Harding attempted to measure them by observing the
                    time which the satellite takes to pass over the disk of Jupiter; but such
                    observations are liable to great uncertainty, by reason of differences in the
                    magnifying power of the telescopes, the sight of the observer, the state of the
                    atmosphere, the distance of the satellites from the primary, their altitude
                    above the horizon, and even on account that, by reason of their rotation, they
                    do not always present to us the same hemisphere. Schroeter estimates their
                    diameters relatively to Jupiter as follows :—That of the first =∙⅛, of the
                    second =⅛, of the third —⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> ^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ιe</hi> f° <hi rend="superscript"> urt</hi> b = ⅛∙ The
                    following are the results of a series of micrometrical measurements made by
                    Professor Struve at the Dorpat observatory, with the great refractor of
                    Fraunhofer :—</p>
                <p>Diameter of the first 1"∙015</p>
                <p>Diameter of the second 0 ∙911</p>
                <p>Diameter of the third 1 *488</p>
                <p>Diameter of the fourth 1 ∙273</p>
                <p>These dimensions are adapted to the mean distance of Jupiter, namely 5∙20279.
                    Compared with the earth, the diameters of the satellites are approximately as
                    follows :— I. = ⅜, II. = <hi rend="italic">į,</hi> III. = ⅜, IV. = + As seen
                    from Jupiter, the apparent magnitude of the first will be nearly equal to that
                    of our moon seen from the earth; the second and third somewhat greater than
                    half; and the fourth nearly equal to a quarter of that of the moon. These four
                    moons must present to the inhabitants of Jupiter a spectacle of endless variety,
                    on account of the rapid rotation of the planet, the short period of their
                    revolutions, and their eclipses, which happen almost daily.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Saturn.</hi></p>
                <p>Saturn, the remotest of the planets known to the ancient astronomers, circulates
                    round the sun at a distance equal to about 9∣ times the semidiameter of the
                    terrestrial orbit, or nearly 900 millions of miles. His apparent diameter at his
                    mean distance is only about 16"∙2, yet his true diameter is nearly 10 times, and
                    his volume about 995 times, that of our globe. The area of the sun’s disk, as
                    seen from Saturn, is only of its apparent magnitude as seen from the earth;
                    consequently the light and heat which any point on his surface receives from the
                    great luminary is 80 times less than that which we enjoy. His density, compared
                    with that of the sun considered as unity, is supposed to be ∙55, or about J of
                    the density of the earth; and a body which weighs one pound at the equator of
                    the earth, would weigh about P01 pound if transferred to the equator of
                    Saturn.</p>
                <p>This planet, in consequence of a luminous double ring with which he is
                    surrounded, presents one of the most curious phenomena in the heavens. This
                    singular appendage was first noticed by Galileo, to whom the planet presented a
                    <hi rend="italic">triple</hi> appearance, the large orb being situated between
                    two small bodies or <hi rend="italic">ansoe.</hi> Sometimes the ansae are so
                    enlarged as to present the appearance of a continuous ring; at other times they
                    entirely disappear, and Saturn appears round like the rest of the planets. After
                    a certain time they again become visible, and gradually increase in magnitude;
                    and they evidently do not adhere to the surface of the planet, inasmuch as a
                    vacant space between them is distinctly perceived even in ordinary
                    telescopes.</p>
                <p>These curious appearances were shown by Huygens to be occasioned by an opaque,
                    thin, circular ring, surrounding the equator of Saturn, and at a considerable
                    distance from the planet. Saturn moving in the plane of his orbit carries the
                    ring along with him, which, presenting itself to the earth under different
                    inclinations, occasions all the phenomena which have been described. The ring
                    being only luminous in consequence of its reflecting the solar light, it is
                    evident that it can be visible only when the sun and the earth are both on the
                    same side of it: if they are on opposite sides it will be invisible. It will
                    likewise be invisible in two other cases, namely, 1sZ, when its plane produced
                    passes through the centre of the earth, for then none of the light reflected
                    from it can reach us; and, 2d, when its plane passes through the sun, because
                    its edge is then only enlightened; and being very thin, the whole quantity of
                    reflected light will scarcely be sufficient to render it visible. It is,
                    however, evident that in these two cases the effect will be modified in some
                    degree by the power of the telescope. In ordinary telescopes the ring disappears
                    sometimes before its plane comes into either of the situations mentioned; but
                    Herschel never lost sight of it, either when its plane passed through the earth
                    or the sun. In the last case the edge of the ring appeared as a luminous line on
                    the round disk of the planet, measuring scarcely a second in breadth; but at the
                    distance of Saturn a second corresponds to 4000 miles, which is equal to the
                    semidiameter of the terrestrial globe. The reason of the ring’s disappearance
                    will be easily understood by referring to fig. 102, where the circle <hi
                    rend="italic">abed</hi> represents the orbit of the earth, A B C D that of
                    Saturn 9 <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> times more distant from the sun. When
                    Saturn is at A, the earth and sun are both in the plane of the ring; its edge is
                    consequently turned towards us, and it will be invisible unless telescopes of
                    very high power are used. As Saturn advances from A to B the ring gradually
                    opens, and it attains its greatest breadth at C, where its face is turned more
                    directly towards us, or a straight line perpendicular to its plane makes a more
                    acute angle with the visual ray than in any other situation. As the planet
                    advances towards D, the plane of the ring becomes more oblique to the visual
                    ray; the breadth of the ring consequently contracts, and it again disappears at
                    Ľ. From E to F, G, and A, the same phenomena will be repeated, only in this case
                    it is the southern side of the ring which is visible to the earth, whereas,
                    while Saturn was in the other half of his orbit, it was the northern side.</p>
                <p>The successive disappearances of the ring form a period of about 15 years, with
                    some variations arising from the different positions of the earth in its orbit.
                    At present (1830) the south side is presented to us; it will be invisible in
                    1833; its northern side will become visible in 1838; it will again disappear in
                    1847, and show its southern side in 1855.</p>
                <p>Sir W. Herschel’s observations have added greatly to our knowledge of Saturn’s
                    ring. According to him, the ring is separated into two annular portions by a
                    dark belt or zone, which he has constantly found on the north side. As this dark
                    belt is subject to no change whatever, it is probably owing to some permanent
                    construction of the surface of the ring; and it is evidently contained between
                    two concentric circles, for all the phenomena correspond with the projection of
                    a circular zone. The matter of the ring Herschel thinks no less solid than that
                    of Saturn, and it is observed to cast a strong shadow upon the planet. The light
                    of the ring is also generally brighter than that of the planet; for it appears
                    sufficiently luminous when the telescope affords scarcely light enough for
                    Saturn, It is remarkable that the outer ring is much less brilliant than the
                    inner. Herschel concludes that the edge of the ring is not flat, but spherical
                    or spheroidal. The dimensions of the ring, or of the two rings with the space
                    between them, he gives as follows :—</p>

                <p>Breadth of the vacant space, or dark zone 2839</p>
                <p>The following measures were taken by Professor Struve, at Dorpat in Russia, in
                    1828, with a repeating wire-micrometer attached to the large refracting
                    telescope of Fraunhofer, belonging to the observatory at that place, and may be
                    regarded as decidedly the most accurate of any that we possess. (See <hi

                <p>Outer diameter of the outer ring 40"∙095</p>

                <p>Distance of the ring from the ball 4 ∙339</p>
                <p>Equatorial diameter of Saturn 17 ∙991</p>
                <p>These dimensions are adapted to the mean distance of Saturn, 9∙53877. According
                    to the same excellent astronomer, the inclination of the plane of the ring to
                    the ecliptic is 28° 5'∙9.</p>
                <p>In observing the ring with very powerful telescopes, some astronomers have
                    remarked, not one only, but several dark concentric lines on its surface, which
                    divide it into as many distinct circumferences. In common telescopes these are
                    not perceptible; for the irradiation, by enlarging the space occupied by each
                    ring, causes the intervals between them to disappear, and the whole seems
                    blended together in one belt of uniform appearance. (See fig. 103.) Struve,
                    however, noticed no trace of the division of the ring into many parts.</p>
                <p>By means of some spots observed on the surface of the ring, Herschel found that
                    it revolves in its own plane in 10 hours 32 minutes 15 ’ 4 seconds; and Laplace
                    arrived at the same result from theory. It is particularly worthy of remark,
                    that this is the period in which a satellite, having for its orbit the mean
                    circumference of the ring, would complete its revolution according to the third
                    law of Kepler. This circumstance furnishes a physical explanation of the reason
                    why the ring is able to maintain itself about the planet without touching it; or
                    at least brings the fact within the general law by which the planets are
                    sustained in their orbits. The centrifugal force resulting from its rotation,
                    and the attraction of the planet, suffice to maintain its equilibrium.</p>
                <p>From observations of some obscure belts, and a very conspicuous spot on the
                    surface of Saturn, Herschel concluded that his rotation is performed in 10 hours
                    16 minutes, on an axis perpendicular to the belts and to the plane of the ring;
                    so that the planes of the planet’s equator and ring coincide. According to the
                    same astronomer, the ratio of the equatorial and polar diameters of Saturn is
                    2281 to 2061, or nearly 11 to 10. But it is very remarkable that the globe of
                    Saturn appears to be flattened at the equator as well as at the poles. The polar
                    compression extends to a great distance over the surface of the planet, and the
                    greatest diameter is that of the parallel of 43° of latitude, where,
                    consequently, the curvature of the meridians is also the greatest. The disk of
                    Saturn, therefore, resembles a square of which the four corners have been
                    rounded off. According to the latest observations of Herschel, the axis of
                    rotation, the diameter of the equator, and the greatest diameter under the
                    parallel of 43°, are to one another as the numbers 32, 35, 36. (See the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1806, Part II.)</p>
                <p>Saturn is attended by seven satellites, but so small that they can only be seen
                    by the help of powerful telescopes. Huygens first discovered one of these
                    satellites in 1655. It is the sixth in the order of distance, and is the largest
                    of them all. Four others were discovered about twenty years afterwards by
                    Dominic Cassini; and, lastly, SirW. Herschel, in 1789, discovered two new
                    satellites, at a time when the ring was visible only in a telescope of forty
                    feet. The orbits of these are interior to those of the five satellites formerly
                    discovered, but exterior to the ring, though so near to it that it is only when
                    the ring disappears that they can be seen. All the satellites appear to revolve
                    in the plane of the ring, with the exception of the two last. The inclinations
                    of their orbits are, however, not known with much certainty.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Uranus.</hi></p>
                <p>Uranus is the remotest planet belonging to the system, and is scarcely visible
                    excepting through the telescope. His distance from the sun is nineteen times the
                    radius of the ecliptic, or about 1800 millions of miles; and his sidereal
                    revolution is performed in 83 years 150 days and 18 hours. His diameter is about
                    35,112 English miles, or nearly six and a half times that of the earth, and,
                    seen from the earth, subtends an angle of only 4", even at the time of his
                    opposition. The apparent diameter of the sun, seen from this planet, is 1' 40";
                    consequently the surface of the sun will there appear 400 times less than it
                    does to us, and the light and heat which is received will be less in the same
                    proportion. Analogy leads us to infer that Uranus is opaque and revolves on his
                    axis, but of this there is no direct proof. Laplace has concluded from theory,
                    that the time of his diurnal rotation cannot be much less than that of Jupiter
                    and Saturn, and that the inclination of his equator to the ecliptic is very
                    inconsiderable. His density is supposed to exceed somewhat that of the earth.
                    Schroeter thinks that certain variations in the appearances of his disk indicate
                    that great changes are going on in his atmosphere.</p>
                <p>This planet was discovered by Sir W. Herschel atBath on the 13th of March 1781.
                    His attention was attracted to it by the largeness of its disk in the telescope,
                    which exceeded that of stars of the first magnitude, while to the naked eye it
                    appeared only as a star of the seventh magnitude. In the course of a few days
                    its proper motion became sensible, consequently it could not be a fixed star.
                    Herschel at first took it for a comet, but it was soon perceived that it
                    described a path which, instead of resembling the eccentric orbits of the
                    comets, was almost circular, like that of the planets. It was then recognised to
                    be one of the principal planets of the solar system; and the observations of the
                    last fifty years have not only confirmed this fact, but afforded data from which
                    the elements of its orbit have been determined with great precision. Herschel
                    gave it the name of the <hi rend="italic">Georgium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sidus,</hi> in honour of his royal patron George III. Foreigners for some time
                    generally called it the <hi rend="italic">Herschel,</hi> after its discoverer;
                    but the mythological name of <hi rend="italic">Uranus,</hi> suggested by the
                    late Professor Bode of Berlin, is now generally adopted. In 1787 Herschel
                    discovered that it was attended by two satellites: he subsequently discovered
                    four others, so that Uranus is accompanied by six satellites; and the whole
                    number of satellites now known to belong to the system is consequently
                    eighteen.</p>
                <p>Before concluding this section, it will be proper to take notice of the following
                    curious relation of the numbers <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189770"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-9770-0035"/>which express, approximately at least, the
                    distances of the planets from the sun. It was first pointed out by Bode, and,
                    though purely empirical, and not even very accurate, served to confirm the
                    German astronomers in their anticipations of the discovery of a new planet
                    between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.</p>
                <p>Let the number 10 be assumed to represent the semidiameter of the earth’s orbit;
                    then the semidiameters of the orbits of the other planets may be expressed in
                    round numbers as follows :—</p>

                <p>It will be remarked that every succeeding term of this series of numbers, after
                    the second, is the double of the preceding, minus 4; the general term being 4 +

                <p>In order to establish a theory of the motions of the satellites, the first thing
                    necessary is to ascertain the directions in which they move with reference to
                    the primary planet. Now, it is observed that their motion is sometimes towards
                    the east, and at other times towards the west; but that the satellites are never
                    eclipsed except in passing from the west to the east of the planet. When an
                    eclipse takes place the satellite is always moving eastward; on the other hand,
                    the satellite is always moving westward when it appears on the planet’s disk.
                    From this it results that the true motions of the satellites around the planets
                    are from west to east, according to the order of the signs, or in the same
                    directions as the motions of the planets about the sun. This fact, which holds
                    true of the moon, and the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn, is one of the most
                    remarkable in the planetary system. With regard to the satellites of Uranus,
                    their motions are performed in orbits almost perpendicular to the ecliptic; they
                    cannot therefore with propriety be said to be either direct or retrograde.</p>
                <p>The eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter present an easy method of determining
                    their mean motions and periodic ' times; and, by reason of the small
                    inclinations of the or- <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> bits, these are of very
                    frequent occurrence; for the first three satellites traverse the shadow of
                    Jupiter in every revolution, and the fourth only passes by it sometimes, in
                    consequence of the greater inclination of its orbit. If the instants can be
                    observed at which a satellite enters and emerges from the shadow, the middle
                    point of time between these two instants will be that of the heliocentric
                    conjunction of the satellite with its primary. The interval between two central
                    eclipses gives the <hi rend="italic">synodic period</hi> of the satellite;
                    whence, since the motion of the primary is known, the <hi rend="italic">sidereal
                    period</hi> of the satellite, and its mean angular motion with regard to the
                    straight line joining the centres of the sun and the planet, are easily deduced.
                    Instead of two successive eclipses, it is preferable to compare two that are
                    separated from each other by a long interval of time; the interval divided by
                    the number of sidereal revolutions will give the mean time, unaffected by any
                    periodic inequalities which may exist in consequence of the mutual action of the
                    satellites on one another. In order to render the result as accurate as
                    possible, those eclipses are chosen which take place when the planet is nearly
                    in opposition.</p>
                <p>The distances of the satellites from their primary are ascertained by measurement
                    with the micrometer, at the time of the greatest elongations. On comparing the
                    distances with the times of revolution, the beautiful law of Kepler is found to
                    prevail; and, as in the system of the planets, so in the various systems of the
                    satellites, the squares of the periodic times vary as the cubes of the mean
                    distances from the central body. The distances of the satellites of Jupiter and
                    Saturn, compared with the diameters of their respective primaries, are
                    represented in fig. 105.</p>
                <p>The inclinations of the orbits of the satellites of Jupiter, and the positions of
                    their nodes, together with the other elements of their elliptic motion, are
                    determined by means of their eclipses. The plane of the orbit of the first
                    satellite nearly coincides with the plane of the equator of Jupiter, the
                    inclination of which to the plane of his orbit is 3° 5' 30". The inclination of
                    the orbit of the second to the plane of the planet’s equator is 27' 49"∙2. Its
                    nodes have a retrograde motion on that plane, and go through an entire circuit
                    in the space of 30 years. The orbit of the third is inclined to the equator of
                    Jupiter in an angle of 12' 20"; and the line of the nodes retrogrades through a
                    whole circumference in 142 tropical years. Hence tĥe inclinations of the orbits
                    of these two satellites to the orbit of Jupiter are variable; that of the second
                    varying between 3° 19' 24"∙6 and 2° 51' 35"∙4, and that of the third between 3°
                    17' 50'' and 2° 53' 10". The inclination of the orbit of the fourth satellite to
                    the orbit of Jupiter is also variable. Its nodes have a retrograde motion, and
                    complete a revolution in 531 years. Since the middle of the last century the
                    inclination of this satellite has been observed to increase, and the motion of
                    its nodes to diminish. (Laplace, <hi rend="italic">Mécanique Céleste,</hi> tome
                    iv. livre viii.)</p>
                <p>The orbits of the four satellites are doubtless elliptical, but those of the
                    first and second are so small that it has been found impossible to determine
                    their eccentricity. The eccentricity of the third is perceptible, that of the
                    fourth much more so. According to Laplace, the greatest equation of the centre
                    of the third, at its maximum in 1682, amounted to 13' 16"∙4, and at its minimum
                    in 1777, only to 5' 7"∙5. The eccentricity of the orbit of the fourth is still
                    greater, and also subject to considerable variations. The line of the apsides
                    has a direct motion, amounting to 42' 58"∙7 annually. The great in <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193189783" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9783-0036"/> fluence of the
                    compressed figure of Jupiter on these elements gives each of the orbits an
                    eccentricity peculiar to it; but each also participates in the eccentricities of
                    the others. The mutual perturbations of the satellites greatly affect their
                    motions, and render their analytical theory exceedingly complicated and
                    difficult.</p>
                <p>On comparing the mean longitudes with the mean motions of the first three
                    satellites of Jupiter, Laplace discovered the two following relations, which, by
                    reason of their remarkable simplicity, may perhaps be regarded as among the most
                    curious discoveries cver made in astronomy. Denoting by <hi rend="italic">m',
                    m", nι"',</hi> the mean motions of the three satellites respectively, and their
                    mean longitudes by <hi rend="italic">t, l”, l'",</hi> these laws are expressed
                    by the formulae, <hi rend="italic">ml + 2m'"</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">3m''</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> 0</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">l'</hi> +2Z <hi rend="superscript"> w</hi> — 3Z" =180°; that is
                    to say, the mean sidereal motion of the first, added to twice that of the third,
                    is equal to three times that of the second; and the mean longitude of the first
                    satellite, plus twice that of the third, minus three times that of the second,
                    is always equal to a semicircumference. The first of these relations is true of
                    the synodical as well as of the sidereal revolutions; and it follows from the
                    second, that the first three satellites can never be eclipsed at the same time,
                    because in that case their longitudes would be equal, or Z' + 2Z'"— 3Z''=0.
                    These results of theory agree so nearly with observation, that we are tempted to
                    regard them as rigorously exact, and to ascribe the slight differences that may
                    be perceptible to the unavoidable errors of observation, and to the periodic
                    inequalities in the motions of the satellites, by reason of which their true
                    motions are alternately greater and smaller than their mean motions. We must
                    therefore infer that these relations depend on a physical cause, by which they
                    will be preserved for ever, or at least during a long series of ages,
                    notwithstanding the small oscillations to which, from various sources of
                    perturbation, the mean longitudes of the satellites are subject.</p>
                <p>From observations of the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites, Roemer was led to the
                    very important discovery of the successive propagation of light. The times at
                    which these eclipses happen are found to differ from the times computed from the
                    sidereal revolutions of the satellites, being sometimes earlier and sometimes
                    later, according to the position of Jupiter relatively to the sun and the earth.
                    When Jupiter is in opposition with the sun, and his distance from the earth
                    consequently less than his distance from the sun by the whole radius of the
                    earth’s orbit, the satellites are eclipsed sooner than they ought to be
                    according to computation. On the contrary, when Jupiter is in conjunction, and
                    his distance from the earth greater than his distance from the sun by the same
                    quantity, the eclipses happen later. These differences, which are exactly the
                    same for all the satellites, cannot be ascribed either to the eccentricity of
                    the orbit of Jupiter, or to inequalities in their motion; for the oppositions
                    and conjunctions of the planet correspond successively to all the different
                    points of his orbit, and the eclipses also happen when the satellite is at
                    different points of its own orbit. The simplest and most natural way of
                    explaining the phenomenon is to suppose that the light reflected from the
                    satellites is not transmitted to the earth instantaneously, but occupies a
                    sensible portion of time in traversing the diameter of the terrestrial orbit.
                    When Jupiter is near his conjunction, the eclipses are observed to happen about
                    16 minutes 26 seconds later than when he is near his opposition; the difference
                    between his distances from the earth in these two positions is equal to the
                    diameter of the earth’s orbit, supposing the orbits to be circular: it follows,
                    therefore, that light employs 16 minutes 26 seconds in traversing the
                    terrestrial orbit, and consequently the half of that time, or 8 minutes 13
                    seconds, in coming from the sun to the earth. The exact agreement of this
                    hypothesis with observation renders its truth unquestionable. The fact of the
                    successive transmission of light led to another discovery of the utmost
                    importance in astronomy, namely, the aberration.</p>
                <p>The eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites are useful in determining the longitude of
                    places on the earth, and on this account the theory of the motions of these
                    bodies has been cultivated with the most laborious care. The epochs at which the
                    eclipses take place are calculated in advance, and inserted in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ephemerides.</hi> On comparing these epochs, computed for a given
                    meridian, with the immediate results of observation made in another place at a
                    given hour, the difference of time is obtained, whence the difference of
                    longitude is immediately deduced. The method is the same as for the eclipses of
                    the moon. Unfortunately, by reason of the magnifying power required to render
                    the satellites visible, it cannot be employed at sea, the instability of the
                    vessel rendering the telescopes unserviceable. The tables of Delambrc, which
                    were computed from the theory of Laplace, and the comparison of an immense
                    number of observations, give the places of the satellites with all the precision
                    which it is perhaps possible to obtain.</p>
                <p>The satellites of Saturn have not the practical utility of those of Jupiter,
                    because, by reason of their great distance, their eclipses are invisible; and
                    indeed some of them cannot be perceived at all, excepting through telescopes of
                    extraordinary power. Their periods, mean motions, and some of the other elements
                    of their orbits, are determined by the micrometrical measurement of their
                    greatest digressions from their primary. At the time of their greatest
                    digressions they are always situated in the same straight line with the greater
                    axis of the ring, and their distances from Saturn are then equal to the
                    semitransverse axes of their apparent orbits. In their conjunctions the minor
                    axes of their apparent ellipses seem only half as great as their transverse
                    axes, whence it is inferred that the sine of their inclination is one half, and
                    consequently that the inclination itself is about 30°, which is nearly the
                    inclination of the ring. Hence the satellites seem to move in the plane of the
                    ring. The only one which deviates considerably from that plane is the seventh.
                    From certain observations made by Bernard in 1787, Lalande makes the inclination
                    of this satellite 22° 42' to the orbit of Saturn, or 24° 45' to the ecliptic.
                    There exists, however, considerable uncertainty with regard to the inclination
                    of the orbits of the satellites, as well as with regard to that of the ring.</p>
                <p>According to the theory of Laplace, the spheroidal figure of Saturn must maintain
                    the ring, and the orbits of the interior satellites, in the plane of his
                    equator. But the amount of the compression is unknown: all that is certain is,
                    that the inclination of the orbits of the first five satellites to the equator
                    of the planet is insensible at the distance of the earth; consequently all the
                    satellites, excepting the seventh, and probably also the sixth, will appear, as
                    well as the ring, to move in the plane of the equates. The orbit of the seventh
                    satellite preserves the same mean inclination to the plane of the equator of the
                    planet; and the line of its nodes has a retrograde motion nearly uniform.</p>
                <p>The orbit of the sixth satellite is elliptical. For the meridian of Paris its
                    longitude in 1800 was 67° 25' 47"; that of its inferior apside 203° 35' 7". Its
                    mean motion in 36525 days is 2290 revolutions + 202° 12'; in one day <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193189796" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9796-0037"/> 22° 34' 37"∙186.
                    The eccentricity is Ό4887; and its greatest equation 5° 36' 8". By particular
                    observations on this satellite, Bessel found its inclination to the ecliptic to
                    be 24° 30', or 25° 55'; differing very sensibly from that of the ring or the
                    equator of the planet. It is, however, not improbable that these two planes may
                    have some inclination to each other. (Delambre, <hi rend="italic">Astronomie

                <p>The satellites of Uranus can be perceived with still greater difficulty than
                    those of Saturn. The orbits of these satellites are almost perpendicular to the
                    ecliptic. The elements of the second and fourth have been determined by actual
                    measurement; the periods of the two others have been theoretically deduced from
                    the third law of Kepler. The inclination of the fourth is 89° 30', or 90° 30',
                    and the ascending node 171° or 249°, according as it is conceived to be direct
                    or retrograde.</p>

                <p>OF COMETS.</p>
                <p>The comets form a class of bodies belonging to the solar system, distinguished
                    from the planets by their physical appearances and the great eccentricity of
                    their orbits. By reason of the smallness of their diameters, and a nebulosity
                    which renders them ill adapted to reflect the rays of light, the greater part of
                    them are only visible in the telescope, and continue to be so only during a
                    short period of time; for as they advance to and recede from the sun almost in
                    straight lines, and with prodigious velocities, they are soon carried far beyond
                    the limits of vision. They have received the name of comets <hi rend="italic"
                    >{coma,</hi> hair) from the <hi rend="italic">bearded</hi> appearance which they
                    frequently exhibit.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Orbits of
                    Comets.</hi></p>
                <p>The comets are not more remarkably contrasted with the planets in the singularity
                    of their physical appearances, than in the directions of the paths which they
                    follow in space. While the orbits of all the planets are confined within a
                    narrow zone, or to planes not greatly inclined to the ecliptic, those of the
                    comets are inclined in all possible angles, and some of them are even observed
                    to be perpendicular to the ecliptic. Nor is the contrast less striking with
                    regard to the figures of the orbits, which, instead of being nearly circular,
                    like those of the planets, have the appearance of being almost rectilinear.
                    Kepler was of opinion that the cometary orbits are straight lines; Cassini
                    supposed them to be very eccentric circles; and Tycho was for some time of the
                    same opinion, but he afterwards found that the hypothesis of the eccentric
                    circle would not satisfy the observations of the comet of 1577. Hevelius seems
                    to have been the first who discovered, by means of a geometrical construction,
                    that the orbits might be represented by parabolas; and Dörfel first calculated
                    their elements on this hypothesis. After it was known, however, that certain
                    comets return to the sun in the same orbits, it became necessary to adopt an
                    opinion, already probable from analogy, that, in conformity with the laws of
                    Kepler, the cometary orbits are ellipses having the sun in one of the foci. This
                    hypothesis is now universally admitted; but as the ellipses are in general
                    extremely elongated, and the comets are only visible while they describe a small
                    portion of their orbits on either side of their perihelia, their paths during
                    the time of their appearance differ very little from parabolas; whence it is
                    usual, on account of the facility of computation, to assume that they really
                    move in parabolic curves. Newton employed the hypothesis of an elliptic motion
                    to compute the orbit of the famous comet of 1680. Since that time the orbits of
                    more than a hundred and fifty different comets have been computed on the
                    elliptic hypothesis, and their elements determined so as to satisfy all the
                    observations. It is possible that the orbits of some comets may be in reality
                    parabolic; but in this case the comet, after having passed its perihelion, would
                    recede to an infinite distance from the sun, and never again visit our system.
                    Burckhardt imagined that the observations of the comet of 1771 were best
                    represented by supposing the orbit to be an hyperbola. In fact, it is
                    demonstrated in the <hi rend="italic">Principia,</hi> and every treatise on
                    Physical Astronomy, that the species of curve which one body describes about
                    another, in virtue of an attractive force varying inversely as the square of the
                    distance, depends only on its velocity of projection. The curve must necessarily
                    be a conic section; but it may be an ellipse, a parabola, or an hyperbola,
                    according as the primitive impulsive force falls within or exceeds certain
                    assignable limits.</p>
                <p>If the comets moved in parabolas or hyperbolas, and had consequently only a
                    temporary connection with the solar system, the determination of their orbits
                    would be a matter of mere curiosity, and of no consequence whatever to
                    astronomy. But it is only by the accurate determination of the elements of their
                    orbits that it can be discovered whether those bodies ever revisit the system;
                    for the appearances which they exhibit, depending on the situation of the earth
                    in its orbit with relation to them at the time they are visible, are far too
                    variable and uncertain to afford any sure means of recognising them. The comet
                    of 1811 was scarcely visible in the months of April and May; it was subsequently
                    lost in the sun’s rays, and, having passed its perihelion, re-appeared in August
                    with a splendour and magnificence that rendered it an object of admiration. It
                    is therefore only by observing that a comet follows the same orbit in its
                    successive returns to the sun that we can be assured of its identity. But even
                    the determination of the orbit is not always sufficient to lead to the detection
                    of a comet in a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189809" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9809-0038"

                    within the sphere of attraction of Jupiter, or any of the larger planets, the
                    elements of its orbit may have been greatly or entirely changed. The orbit of
                    the comet of 1770 was calculated by Lexell, and subsequently by Burckhardt, and
                    both these astronomers found that the observations could only be represented by
                    an ellipse in which the time of revolution was five years and a half; yet the
                    comet has never been seen since, or at least seen moving in the same orbit.
                    Hence it is concluded with certainty that the attraction of Jupiter, near which
                    planet it approached, was so great as to compel it to move in a totally
                    different ellipse. Other causes also conspire to render the chances of the
                    discovery of periodic comets extremely small. In the first place, it is only
                    within a very small portion of their orbits that they are visible; and this, on
                    account of its proximity to the sun, is passed over with inconceivable rapidity.
                    But in proportion as they recede from their perihelia the solar action
                    diminishes; and, towards the aphelion of its orbit, a comet may be almost
                    motionless, and for this reason not return for thousands of years. In the second
                    place, it may happen, that during the greater part of the time the comet
                    continues in the visible portion of its orbit, it may rise above the horizon
                    only during the day, in which'case it will be invisible, and may consequently
                    pass through our system without being observed. The comet of 1818 was present in
                    all its splendour long before it became visible, but in full day. Seneca relates
                    a very curious instance of one having been seen during a total eclipse of the
                    sun, in the year 60 before our era. A third cause of uncertainty consists in the
                    difficulty of observing their true places with sufficient precision to enable
                    the elements of their orbits to be exactly determined. The small comets are only
                    nebulous points, which can be distinguished with difficulty; the larger ones are
                    surrounded with a variable, ill-defined, and indistinct nebulosity. The comet of
                    1729 continued visible during six months: its orbit was computed by three
                    different astronomers, whose results were far from coinciding. The same
                    uncertainty exists with regard to the orbits of several other comets. When,
                    therefore, all these circumstances are taken into consideration, it will not
                    appear surprising that, although the elements of above 150 comets have been
                    computed, there are only three which are certainly known to have been observed
                    in their successive revolutions.</p>
                <p>The first of the three periodic comets with which we are yet acquainted was made
                    known to astronomers by Dr Halley. That active and indefatigable genius, having
                    perceived that in 1682 the elements of its orbit were nearly the same as those
                    of two comets which had respectively appeared in 1531 and 1607, concluded that
                    the three orbits belonged to the same identical comet, of which the periodic
                    time was about 76 years. After a vague estimate of the perturbations it must
                    sustain from the attraction of the planets, Dr Halley predicted its return for
                    1757,—a bold prediction at that time, but justified by the event, for the comet
                    again made its appearance as was expected, though it did not pass through its
                    perihelion till the month of March 1759, the attraction of Jupiter and Saturn
                    having caused, as was computed by Clairaut previously to its return, a
                    retardation of 618 days. This comet had been observed in 1006; and the accounts
                    which have been preserved represent it as having then appeared to be four times
                    the size of Venus, and to have shone with a light equal to a fourth of that of
                    the moon. History is silent respecting it from that time till the year 1456,
                    when it passed very near to the earth: its tail then extended over 60° of the
                    licavens, and had the form of a sabre. An object so striking and so terrific
                    could not fail, in a superstitious age, to excite universal dismay, and be
                    regarded as portentous of the greatest calamities to the human race, if not of
                    the destruction of the world. Accordingly Pope Calixtus ordered public prayers
                    to be said over Christendom, in which he exorcised the comet, and the Turks, who
                    had at that time made themselves masters of Constantinople, and overthrown the
                    eastern empire. Dr Halley’s comet will return to its perihelion in 1835; but
                    whether on this occasion it will present any resemblance to its former
                    appearances, or whether it will even be visible in Europe, cannot be certainly
                    determined. The following table of its elements in 1835 is given by Pontécoulant
                    (<hi rend="italic">Théorie Analytique</hi><hi rend="italic">du Systeme du

                <p>The two other comets whose periodic returns have been verified by observation
                    have received the names of Encke and Biela, the astronomers who first computed
                    their orbits, or recognised them as having been observed in their previous
                    revolutions. The first returns to its perihelion in 1208 days, and the second in
                    2440 days. Encke’s comet, although its identity was not discovered till 1818,
                    has been frequently observed, as in 1789, 1795, 1801, and 1805, and on these
                    occasions it exhibited very different appearances, having been seen with and
                    without a nucleus, with and without a tail,—circumstances which account for its
                    having so long escaped being recognised as a regular attendant on the sun. In
                    its returns to its perihelion in 1808, 1812, and 1815, it escaped detection; but
                    it re-appeared in 1818, and it was from the observations of this year that Encke
                    computed the elliptic elements of its orbit. On its next return, in 1822, it was
                    invisible in Europe; but it was observed at Paramatta, in New South Wales,
                    during the whole month of June, and the time of its perihelion passage was found
                    to differ only by about three hours from that previously computed by Encke. On
                    its returns in 1825 and 1828 its observed and computed places agreed equally
                    well. The following, according to Pontécoulant, are its elements for 1829-30,
                    computed from the observations at Paramatta:</p>
                <p>Passage through the perihelion, 1829, January 10 <hi rend="superscript"> d</hi>
                    ∙573 Mean diurnal motion 1069 ∙5570</p>

                <p>Longitude of ascending node 334 24 15</p>
                <p>Inclination 13 22 34.</p>
                <p>Encke’s comet presents in some respects a considerable analogy with the planet
                    Ceres, the inclination and greater axis of its orbit being the same, while its
                    sidereal revolution is only 46 days shorter than that of Vesta. The orbit is,
                    however, greatly more elongated, for its perihelion falls within the orbit of
                    Mercury, and its aphelion is situated between Jupiter and the new planets. The
                    perturbations it sustains are chiefly occasioned by the attraction of Jupiter,
                    that of the earth and Venus being extremely small, while the action of Mercury
                    is insensible.</p>
                <p>The third periodic comet with which our knowledge of the solar system has
                    recently been enriched receives its name from Biela, by whom it was first
                    perceived in Bohemia, on the 25th of February 1825. The parabolic elements
                    computed from the first observations presented a striking resemblance with those
                    of two comets <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189822" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9822-0039"
                    />which had been observed in 1772 and 1806, which induced MM. Clausen and
                    Gainbart, the first at Marseilles and the second at Altona, to compute the
                    elements of the three comets on the hypothesis of elliptic orbits; and, after
                    some attempts, each found an ellipse which represented all the observations so
                    accurately as to leave no doubt of the identity of the comet. Its period is six
                    years and about nine months, and it will return to its perihelion in November
                    1832, about the same time with Encke’s. The following table of its elements has
                    been computed from the observations of 1826, and the theory of the perturbations
                    (Pontécoulant, tome ii. p. 158):</p>

                <p>Such is the present state of astronomy with respect to periodic comets. There are
                    two others besides, of which the orbits are supposed to be known, though their
                    returns to their perihelia have not yet been verified. The first is that which
                    appeared in 1680, and of which Newton computed the period to be 575 years. It
                    may therefore be identical with those which are recorded in history to have
                    appeared in 1106,∙ 531, 34 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> and 619 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> The second is that which appeared in 1556, and is
                    supposed to have made a former visit in 1264. This comet is expected to appear
                    again in 1848.</p>
                <p>The following table, taken from one given by Delambre in the third volume of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Astronomie,</hi> shows the comparatively small distances
                    within which the greater part of the comets hitherto observed approach to the
                    sun, and the apparently fortuitous inclinations of the planes of their orbits to
                    that of the ecliptic. Supposing the sun’s distance from the earth to be unity,

                <p>The motions of the above 61 are direct; those of the remaining 59 are retrograde,
                    and their orbits are distributed over the whole quadrant in the same random
                    manner. This circumstance sufficiently indicates that the mechanical causes,
                    whatever they were, which gave the same direction to the two motions of
                    translation and rotation of all the planets and satellites, exercised no
                    influence on the comets. Hence many astronomers have entertained the idea that
                    these bodies have only a casual or transient connection with the planetary
                    system. , <hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Of the
                    Appearances and Physical Constitution of Comets.</hi></p>
                <p>Of all the celestial phenomena, those of the comets are the most striking, and
                    the most calculated to impress the ignorant with the idea of supernatural
                    agency. Appearing suddenly in the heavens, and under aspects the most uncommon
                    and terrific, they have been almost universally regarded as visible
                    demonstrations of the wrath, and harbingers of the vengeance, of offended
                    deities. These superstitious terrors, arising from thatγain propensity of the
                    mind of man to regard the universe as created for himself alone, have only been
                    dissipated by the progress of sound philosophy, and a more extended acquaintance
                    with the riches of nature, and the endless variety of her productions.</p>
                <p>The appearances exhibited by the comets are exceedingly diversified, and
                    sometimes extremely remarkable. That which appeared in the year 130 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.,</hi> at the birth of Mithridates, is said to have had a
                    disk equal in magnitude to that of the sun. Ten years before this, one was seen,
                    which, according to Justin, occupied a fourth part of the sky, that is, extended
                    over 45°, and surpassed the sun in splendour. Another, equally remarkable,
                    appeared in the year 117 of our era; and in 479 there was one of which the disk,
                    according to Freret, was of such magnitude that it might have occasioned the
                    extraordinary eclipse of the sun which took place about that time. In 400 one
                    was observed, which is said, on the authority of Gainas, to have resembled a
                    sword, and to have extended from the zenith to the horizon. That of 531 was of
                    greater magnitude still, and its appearance more terrific. Those which appeared
                    in 1066 and 1505 exhibited disks larger than that of the moon. It is, however,
                    highly probable that all these accounts have been greatly exaggerated, through
                    the ignorance and credulity of the historians by whom they are related; for,
                    since comets have been observed by astronomers, no instances have occurred in
                    which their magnitudes and appearances have been so extraordinary. The most
                    remarkable among those of which we possess accurate accounts appeared in the
                    years 1456, 1618, 1680, 1744, 1759, 1769, 1807, and 1811.</p>
                <p>Fig. 106 is a representation of the celebrated comet of 1680, taken from
                    Lemonnicr’s <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">Celeste.</hi> It
                    exhibits the nucleus or disk with its surrounding atmosphere. Above is a sort of
                    ring, wider at the summit, and narrower towards the sides. A <hi rend="italic"
                    >coma</hi> or beard succeeds the ring; and lastly, an immense train of luminous
                    matter, somewhat less vivid than the nucleus. This luminous train, or tail as it
                    is called, is by far the most singular and striking feature presented by the
                    comets. That of the comet of 1744 was one of the most remarkable. It was divided
                    into six branches, all diverging, but curved in the same direction; and between
                    the branches the stars were visible. It is represented in fig. 107. The tail of
                    the comet of 1811 was composed of two diverging parts inclined to each other in
                    an angle which varied from 90 to 15 or 20 degrees. These branches were curved in
                    opposite directions, and descended from the nucleus like a veil: between the <pb

                    surrounding the nucleus, was a space comparatively obscure.</p>
                <p>The nucleus, which is the densest and most luminous part, may be said to form the
                    true body of the comet. It is, however, so far from having the dense and solid
                    appearance of the planets, that some astronomers have imagined it to be
                    diaphanous, and even supposed that they have observed stars through it. But
                    supposing such an observation certain, it may be accounted for with much greater
                    probability by the effects of refraction; and it is besides extremely difficult
                    to distinguish the nucleus from the surrounding nebulosity. If the nucleus were
                    an opaque globular body, it would exhibit phases like Venus or Mars, according
                    to its different positions with relation to the sun and the earth; and such were
                    observed, or at least were supposed to be observed, in the case of the comet of
                    1682, by Hevelius, Picard, and Lahire. But the nebulosity renders the phases
                    exceedingly obscure and indistinct, and prevents the true-body of the comet from
                    being seen; in the same way as a globe of roughened glass prevents us from
                    distinguishing the form of the flame of an inclosed lamp. The real nucleus has
                    probably never been observed by any astronomer; and, from the appearances, we
                    are led to infer that a comet, at least near its perihelion, is only an
                    agglomerated mass of vapours. As it recedes from the perihelion, the vapours may
                    be condensed by cold into a solid substance. This hypothesis is also favoured by
                    the extreme smallness of the density of the comets, which is known certainly
                    from the circumstance that they produce no' appreciable effect on the motions of
                    the planets. The comet of 1770 traversed the system of Jupiter’s satellites
                    without causing any sensible perturbation of those small bodies. This comet also
                    passed very near the earth; and Laplace calculated, that if its mass had been
                    equal in density to that of the earth, the effect of its attraction would have
                    increased the length of the sidereal year by two hours and twenty-eight minutes.
                    But since its influence was altogether insensible, it is certain that its mass
                    was not equal to the five thousandth part of that of the earth, and probably
                    much inferior even to this quantity.</p>
                <p>If the nuclei of comets are solid, the matter of which they are composed must be
                    extremely fixed in order to enable them to resist the intense heat they
                    necessarily experience in their approaches to the sun. According to the
                    computation of Newton, the great comet of 1680, at its perihelion, was only
                    distant from the sun by the 163d part of the semidiameter of the earth’s orbit,
                    where it would be exposed to a heat above 2000 times greater than that of
                    red-hot iron,—a temperature of which we can form no conception, and which would
                    instantly dissipate any substance with which we are acquainted.</p>
                <p>In order to explain the singular phenomena of the train of light which frequently
                    attends the comets, the following theory was proposed by Newton. The comets move
                    in very eccentric orbits, and consequently, towards their perihelia, approach
                    very near to the sun. The excessive degree of heat they sustain near this point
                    of their orbits must convert into vapour every substance capable of
                    vaporization; and hence the prodigious extent of their atmosphere in comparison
                    of the smallness of their nuclei. When this atmosphere has acquired all the
                    volatility of which it is susceptible, the impulsion its vapours receive from
                    the solar rays, however feeble that force may be conceived to be, is sufficient
                    to put them in motion, and drive them off in a direction opposite to the sun.
                    Thus it is remarked, that the tail becomes most conspicuous after the comet has
                    passed the perihelion, and that its direction, as was first observed by Appian,
                    is the straight line joining the centres of the sun and comet. The Slight
                    curvature which is generally observed may be accounted for by combining the
                    motion given to the vapours by the impulsion of the sun’s rays with the motion
                    of the comet in its orbit; for the detached vapours arc driven by the impact of
                    the luminous particles beyond the sphere of the comet’s attraction, and
                    consequently cease to follow the direction of the nucleus. Hence the curvature
                    of the tail must be greatest towards its extremity; and this is observed to be
                    actually the case. It may be remarked, however, that although this hypothesis
                    serves to explain the phenomena when all the branches of the tail are bent in
                    the same direction, it is inapplicable when the directions of the curvature are
                    opposite, as was the case with regard to the comet of 1811. In fact, no ultimate
                    reasons for several of the phenomena exhibited by comets have yet been given
                    which can be considered as entirely satisfactory.</p>
                <p>The discovery of the periodic returns of certain comets necessarily put an end to
                    the apprehensions and terrors which their unusual appearances were well
                    calculated to excite, and proved them to be permanent bodies belonging to the
                    same system, and acted on by the same laws, as the planets. But this very
                    discovery gave rise to apprehensions of another kind, more natural, though, when
                    closely examined, hardly more reasonable. Since the comets are so numerous, and
                    their orbits traverse the planetary system in all directions, and come within
                    the orbit of the earth, is there not a probability that some of them may come
                    into contact with our globe, and destroy it by the direct collision; or at least
                    approach so near as to produce the most disastrous effects by their attraction?
                    Halley found that the comet of 1680 had approached its perihelion about the time
                    of the universal deluge, and thought it probable that that great catastrophe
                    might have been immediately occasioned by the earth’s being enveloped in the
                    aqueous vapours of its tail,—an idea which was afterwards more fully developed
                    by Whiston. Lalande and Maupertuis have minutely detailed the terrible effects
                    which might be produced by the shock of a comet, or even by its approach to our
                    earth. The vapours brought by the tail would mingle with the atmosphere, and
                    render it less respirable. The attraction of the nucleus would destroy the
                    equilibrium of the ocean, and cause extraordinary inundations, which might sweep
                    off the greater part of the human species. The direct shock might change the
                    position of the earth’s axis, or even cause the earth to leave its present
                    orbit. It might then become a satellite of the comet, and be carried away with
                    it to the extreme limits of the sun’s attractive influence: or, as the mass of
                    the comet would probably be inferior to that of the earth, the earth would carry
                    the comet along with it in its orbit, and thus acquire a second moon; and it has
                    even been surmised that the moon we actually enjoy may owe its origin to an
                    accidental occurrence of this kind. But all these reveries have disappeared
                    before the calculus, by which it is demonstrated that the orbit of the moon can
                    never at any time have been greatly different from what it now is. The collision
                    of a comet with the earth is not an impossible event; though so infinitely
                    little probable, that it can never excite any just cause of alarm. The
                    conjunctions of the planets anciently caused terrors still more unreasonable;
                    and the eclipses, which now scarcely attract the notice of the vulgar, long
                    rivalled the comets in the terrors which they occasioned to the inhabitants of
                    the earth.</p>
                <p>Various opinions have been entertained respecting the nature, and formation, and
                    uses of the comets. Newton supposed that, as some of them pass so near to the
                    sun ⅛ <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189848" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9848-0041"/>to be
                    involved in all probability within his atmosphere, the resistance they must
                    consequently experience will cause them to approach nearer and nearer to the
                    great luminary at every successive revolution, till at last they are
                    precipitated into his substance; hence their use in the system may possibly be
                    to repair the losses which the sun sustains from the constant emission of light.
                    Whatever destinies they may be appointed to fulfil, the recent discovery of two
                    comets of short periods must be regarded as of great importance to astronomy,
                    inasmuch as the frequency of their appearance will enable observers to take
                    notice of any great changes with which either their masses or orbits may be
                    affected.</p>
                <p>With regard to the actual number of comets belonging to the solar system, there
                    are no data from which we can form any probable conjecture. Those only (with two
                    or three exceptions) which come within the orbit of the earth are visible to us,
                    and upwards of 150 have been observed since the discovery of the telescope. If,
                    then, we suppose them to be equally distributed throughout the whole system, it
                    would follow that the number of comets coming within the sphere of Uranus, the
                    radius of which is twenty times that of the earth’s orbit, amounts to 1,200,000
                    (the cube of 20 multiplied into 150), assuming the average period of their
                    revolutions to be that in which 150 have come within the sphere of the earth.
                    Such computations, however, are scarcely deserving of notice.</p>

                <p>OF THE FIXED STARS.</p>
                <p>After having treated of the different classes of bodies which compose the solar
                    system, it only remains for us to inquire what observation has been able to
                    discover respecting that innumerable host which “studs the galaxy,”—that
                    multitude of brilliant points which, on account of their always sensibly
                    retaining the same relative positions, have received the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Fixed Stars.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi
                    rend="italic">Of the Arrangement of the Fixed Stars.</hi></p>
                <p>The great multitude of stars visible even to the naked eye renders it impossible
                    to distinguish each by a particular name: astronomers have accordingly, for the
                    sake of reference, formed them into groups, to which they give the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Constellations</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Asterisms.</hi> To the
                    different constellations the early astronomers gave the names of men, and
                    animals, and other familiar objects, from some fancied resemblances or
                    analogies, which, for the most part, are not easily traced. These denominations,
                    consecrated by ancient usage, are preserved in modern catalogues; and the
                    practice of delineating the object itself on celestial globes and charts has
                    been only recently, if it has yet altogether, been abandoned. The ancients
                    likewise distinguished some of the brightest stars in the different
                    constellations by particular names; but when it was wished to include others
                    less conspicuous, it became necessary to have recourse to a different mode of
                    proceeding. According to the usual method, first introduced by Bayer in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Uranometria,</hi> each of the stars in every constellation is
                    marked by a letter of the Greek alphabet, commencing with the most brilliant,
                    which is designated by α, the next most conspicuous is called /3, the third <hi
                    rend="italic">γ,</hi> and so on. When the Greek letters are exhausted, recourse
                    is had to the Roman or Italic; but even with the help of these the nomenclature
                    cannot be extended far, and the simplest and most comprehensive method is
                    undoubtedly to employ the ordinal numbers to particularize the stars belonging
                    to each constellation. It requires to be remarked, that the order of the letters
                    indicates only the relative brilliancy of the stars in the same constellation,
                    without any reference to those in other parts of the heavens. Thus <hi
                    rend="italic">α Aquarii</hi> is a star of the same order of brightness as y <hi
                    rend="italic">Virginis.</hi> The stars of the first order of brightness are
                    likewise denominated stars of the <hi rend="italic">first magnitude</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> those of a degree inferior in brightness are said to be of
                    the <hi rend="italic">second magnitude</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and so on
                    with the third, fourth, &amp;c. Below the sixth the same denominations an©
                    continued; but the stars of the seventh and inferior magnitudes are no longer
                    visible to the naked eye, and are therefore called <hi rend="italic">telescopic
                    stars.</hi> It is obvious that, in conferring these denominations, it has been
                    assumed that the brilliancy of the stars is proportional to their magnitudes,—an
                    hypothesis at least extremely doubtful. The terms are however only used for the
                    sake of distinction, and no exact ideas can be attached to the numbers.
                    Observers are even at variance on the subject, certain stars being regarded by
                    some of them as being of the first, which are considered by others as being only
                    of the second magnitude.</p>
                <p>A few stars have preserved the names conferred on them by the Greek or Arabian
                    astronomers. Some of those names, belonging to stars of the first magnitude, are
                    the following :— <hi rend="italic">Sirius,</hi> in the right shoulder of Orion;
                    <hi rend="italic">Bigel,</hi> in his left foot; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aldebaran,</hi> or the eye of the Bull; <hi rend="italic">Capella;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Lyra; Arcturus; Antares; Spica Virginis; Begulus,</hi> or the

                <p>One of the most important objects of practical astronomy is the formation of
                    catalogues of the fixed stars, in which their positions are determined for a
                    given epoch for it is only by means of registered observations that the <hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi> state of the heavens can be compared at different times/
                    and any changes which take place be detected. The apparent place of a star is
                    easily determined by observation; but in order to render such observations
                    available for the purposes of comparison, the mean place of the observed star
                    must be computed and reduced to a given epoch; and this reduction, which
                    involves a knowledge of the precession, nutation, aberration, and in general of
                    all the motions which affect the star’s apparent place, is only accomplished by
                    a laborious process of calculation.</p>
                <p>The principal catalogues-of the stars which we possess are the following :—</p>
                <p>Ptolemy’s catalogue, which contains 1022 stars. The positions are referred to the
                    ecliptic, and the longitudes are for the year 137 of our era. It is supposed
                    that the greater part of the observations on which it is founded were made and
                    computed by Hipparchus 267 years before, and that Ptolemy merely reduced them to
                    his epoch by adding to each of the longitudes 2° 40', which, according to him,
                    was the amount of the precession of the equinoxes in that interval. This
                    catalogue forms part of the Almagest.</p>
                <p>The catalogue of Ulugh Beigh, containing 1017 stars.</p>
                <p>Tycho’s catalogue, which contains only 777 stars, in 45 constellations.</p>
                <p>Riccioli’s catalogue, which contains 1468 stars. Part of it, however, was merely
                    copied from more ancient catalogues.</p>
                <p>Bayer’s catalogue, containing 1762 stars, in 72 constellations. It was published
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Uranometria</hi> in 1603. The third edition of this
                    work appeared at Ulm in 1661.</p>
                <p>The catalogue of Hevelius, which contains 1888 stars, of which it gives the
                    latitudes, longitudes, right ascensions, and declinations, for the year 1661.

                <p>Bradley’s catalogue, containing 587 stars. This was published in the first volume
                    of his observations, edited by Hornsby, in 1798. The positions of 389 stars,
                    calculated from Bradley’s observations, had been given by Mason in the <hi

                    3000 stars, but the greater part of them remained useless to astronomy till they
                    were reduced and made the subject of discussion by Bessel in his <hi

                    equal number. Astronomers are now aware of the importance of extending their
                    researches to the most minute sidereal objects.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Parallax, Distance,
                    Magnitude, and Number of the Fixed Stars.</hi></p>
                <p>The fixed stars being the points of departure from which all the celestial
                    motions are estimated, one of the first objects in astronomy is to determine the
                    amount and law of all the minute variations of position, real or apparent, to
                    which they are subject. One of the most obvious consequences of the hypothesis
                    of the annual motion of the earth is the existence of an annual parallax of the
                    stars; but on account of the enormous distances of these bodies, this effect of
                    the earth’s motion is so small that it cannot be easily measured; and it is even
                    doubtful, after all the attempts that have been made to detect it, whether it is
                    at all sensible to the best instruments. The longest line which nature has
                    furnished us with the means of actually measuring, is the circumference of our
                    own globe. From this geometry teaches us how to find its diameter; and the
                    diameter we employ as a scale with which to compare the distances of the sun and
                    moon, and the other bodies of the solar system. But experience shows us that
                    this scale, large as it is in our conceptions, is only an insensible point in
                    comparison of the distances of the fixed stars. Astronomy has furnished us with
                    another base, about 24,000 times longer than the former, or above 190 millions
                    of miles. This is the diameter of the earth’s orbit, which is most conveniently
                    used for expressing the distances of the planets and comets from the sun. Yet
                    even this immense line is insensible when compared with the distances of the
                    stars; for, on observing the same star from its two extremities, at the end of
                    six months, no variation whatever is perceptible in the star’s position, after
                    the proper corrections have been made for the small effects produced by
                    different and known causes. The limits of the errors of modern observations
                    cannot well be supposed to exceed 1". It follows, therefore, that, seen from the
                    distance of the fixed stars, the diameter of the ecliptic, which exceeds 190
                    millions of miles, subtends an angle of less than 1". Had the annual parallax
                    exceeded this small quantity, it could scarcely have escaped the multiplied
                    efforts that have been made to detect it, not only by Bradley, whose
                    observations, undertaken for the express purpose of determining the parallax of
                    the stars, conducted him to the grand discoveries of the aberration and
                    nutation, but also by other observers furnished with the more delicate
                    instruments of the present day; and particularly the observations made with the
                    splendid circle of the Greenwich Observatory, the <hi rend="italic">chef
                    d’oeuvre</hi> of Troughton. Astronomers are, however, not entirely agreed as to
                    the fact that the parallax is altogether insensible; and Dr Brinkley of the
                    Dublin Observatory has perceived indications of its existence with regard to
                    several stars. Dr Brinkley could discover no parallax in his observations on the
                    circumpolar stars, with regard to which the changes of declination resulting
                    from the precession are most appreciable. He did not even observe it in the case
                    of the stars of the constellation ĉ <hi rend="italic">Cygni,</hi> some of which,
                    having a very sensible proper motion, may, with great probability, be considered
                    as being ata less distance from the earth; but in <hi rend="italic">Wega</hi> (α
                    Lyrae) he found a parallax of 1"∙13, and one of 1"∙42 in the star <hi
                    rend="italic">Athair,</hi> in the Eagle. Bradley supposed the parallax of Sirius
                    to amount to 1". These facts are, however, disputed by other eminent observers.
                    In a series of 14 stars Struve found the parallax to be negative; that is, the
                    small change of position which the observations seemed to indicate was in a
                    direction contrary to what it would have been if it had arisen from the annual
                    motion of the earth. Mr Pond, the Astronomer Royal, thinks the probable value of
                    the parallax cannot exceed 0"∙018, a quantity so extremely minute as to be
                    altogether lost in the uncertainties of instrumental errors, and the errors of
                    refraction, which are at least 20 times greater.</p>
                <p>Let us concede for a moment the disputed parallax of 1", and inquire what must be
                    the corresponding distance of the star. The semidiamcter of the terrestrial
                    orbit being taken at 95 millions of miles, the distance of a star whose parallax
                    is P'will be expressed by <hi rend="strikethrough">∙∙τ</hi>, × 95000000=206264
                    ×</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> r j</hi> sin. 1"</p>
                <p>95000000 = 19,595,080,000,000, or about 20 billions of English miles. To assist
                    the imagination in forming some idea of this almost inconceivable distance, we
                    may calculate that a ray of light which darts from the sun to the earth in the
                    space of 8 min. 7 sec., would require 206264 X 8 min. 7 sec., or 3 years and 216
                    days, to reach us from the star. A spider’s thread before the eye of a spectator
                    placed at the same distance would suffice to conceal the orbit of the earth; and
                    the breadth of a hair would blot out the whole planetary system. But a star
                    having a parallax of 1" is at a moderate distance in comparison of innumerable
                    others, in which no parallactic motion whatever can be distinguished. Supposing
                    the distance of one of these to be only a thousand times greater, a ray of light
                    darted from it would travel between 3000 and 4000 years before it reached the
                    earth; and if the star were annihilated by any sudden convulsion, it would
                    appear to shine in its proper place during that immense period, after it had
                    been extinguished from the face of the heavens. Pursuing speculations of this
                    kind, we may conceive, with Huygens, that it is not impossible that there may
                    exist stars placed at such enormous distances, that their light has not yet
                    reached the earth since their creation.</p>
                <p>When viewed with the naked eye, the magnitudes of the stars appear to be very
                    different,—a circumstance which may be attributed either to a real diversity of
                    magnitude, or, which is more probable, to the great differences in their
                    distances. The sensible magnitudes which they exhibit when viewed in this manner
                    are owing only to the numerous reflections of the rays of light from the aerial
                    particles surrounding the eye; as is proved by looking at them through a long
                    tube, which prevents any rays from reaching the eye excepting those which come
                    directly from the star. In the telescope their dimensions are entirely
                    inappreciable: the greater the power with which they are viewed, the smaller are
                    their apparent diameters, because they are then more completely divested of the
                    effects of irradiation. A star having a diameter of 1", and an annual parallax
                    of 1", would be more than a million of times larger than the sun. Nevertheless,
                    Sir W. Herschel assures us, that, by means of the great powers which his
                    telescopes carried, he had seen the disks of some stars perfectly round, and had
                    even succeeded in measuring <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189887"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-9887-0044"/>their apparent diameters. He found the diameter of
                    ’ <hi rend="italic">Wega</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Aldebaran</hi> 1"∙5, and that of <hi rend="italic">Capella</hi>
                    2"∙5. Supposing the measurement accurate, and the annual parallax of this last
                    not to exceed 1", its volume would be equal to 20 million times that of the
                    sun.</p>
                <p>With regard to the number of the stars, it is altogether impossible to form any
                    satisfactory conjecture. Of those which are visible to the naked eye, the number
                    does not, probably, at any time, exceed 1000, although, from the effect of their
                    twinkling, and the confused manner in which they are seen, one is apt to suppose
                    them to be much more numerous; but in the telescope they are prodigiously
                    multiplied. Within the limits of a space extending 15° by 2°, Herschel counted
                    no fewer than 50,000. In the single constellation of the Pleiades, instead of 6
                    or 7, which can be distinguished by the unassisted vision, Hooke, with a
                    telescope of 12 feet, counted 78; and in telescopes of greater power the number
                    appears to be vastly larger. Although, by reason of their very unequal
                    distribution, no accurate estimate can be formed of the number contained in the
                    whole sphere by the examination of any small portion of it, yet there is some
                    reason to conclude that there cannot be less than 75 millions of stars
                    altogether visible in a good telescope. Baron Zach estimates that there may be
                    at least a thousand millions of stars in the entire heavens, without reckoning
                    (what may probably exist) opaque bodies which cannot be perceived, and stars
                    whose light has been extinguished. It is, however, evident that all estimates of
                    this sort have no other limit than such as is imposed by the imagination. If an
                    observer could be transported to the remotest star visible in his telescope, he
                    would probably see extending before him in the same direction, a firmament
                    equally rich and splendid as that which he beholds from our own insignificant
                    planet.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Proper Motions of
                    the Stars.</hi></p>
                <p>In Chap. II. four different causes of apparent motion with regard to the stars
                    have been explained; namely, the precession of the equinoxes, the nutation of
                    the earth’s axis, the secular diminution of the obliquity of the ecliptic, and
                    the aberration of light; all which are occasioned by the various motions proper
                    to the earth, and for that reason arc called apparent motions. But if, after due
                    allowance has been made for the effects produced by them, it should happen that
                    the observed place of any star, or number of stars, does not correspond with
                    former observations, a new and peculiar motion would be indicated, which must be
                    explained by a new hypothesis. Now there are obviously two ways of accounting
                    for such a phenomenon, namely, a parallactic motion and a proper motion, from
                    either of which the observed variation of position may result. It has already
                    been shown that the annual parallax, or that apparent alteration in the places
                    of the fixed stars which might be expected from the motion of the earth in its
                    orbit, is insensible; but we may suppose, and indeed observation has even
                    rendered it probable, that the sun, accompanied by his whole train of planets
                    and comets, is in motion in space; and if this is the case, the stars must
                    appear to change their relative situations as soon as the sun has described a
                    space bearing a sensible ratio to their distance. The resulting motion would
                    thus partake of the nature of parallax, and is hence termed parallactic. The
                    other method of accounting for any observed alteration in the mutual position of
                    the stars, is to ascribe to them a proper motion, instead of supposing them to
                    be absolutely fixed. On this supposition the motion is real; yet it may happen
                    that the observed changes of position result from the combined effects of a real
                    and parallactic motion. The effects of these motions are in their nature
                    sufficiently distinct, although, on account of the extremely minute quantities
                    to be determined, and the uncertainty that still exists as to the exact amount
                    of some of the apparent motions with which they are blended, it may for
                    centuries to come be found impossible to separate them. If all the stars forming
                    a group, or situated in the same quarter of the heavens, appear to recede from
                    or approach to each other, their motions may with reason be ascribed to the
                    translation of the solar system in space, and consequently be parallactic: but
                    if, on the contrary, some appear stationary, while others appear to move in
                    different directions, the phenomena will indicate a real change in the positions
                    of the stars.</p>
                <p>From the analogy of our own system we arc naturally induced to extend the
                    principle of gravity to the sphere of the stars, and to suppose, as a necessary
                    consequence, that none of the celestial bodies are in a state of absolute
                    repose. Their mutual attraction must communicate to them a motion which would
                    end in uniting them all in the same mass unless it were counteracted by a
                    centrifugal force: hence the stars are supposed to move about distant centres in
                    orbits analogous to those of the planets. But if the stars are not absolutely at
                    rest in space, their motions must be extremely slow, inasmuch as the actual
                    state of the heavens corresponds entirely with the descriptions that have been
                    given of it by Hipparchus and Ptolemy. Ptolemy has transmitted to us a great
                    number of observations on the relative situations of the fixed stars, made by
                    Hipparchus, whose method was to observe those which are situated in an arc of
                    the same circle, or which can be intersected by the same straight line; and he
                    assures us that he himself, after an interval of 260 years, could perceive no
                    alteration. In order to furnish posterity with the means of pursuing similar
                    inquiries, Ptolemy added the positions of many other stars determined by his own
                    observations; and we owe to his labours the certain knowledge that the relative
                    positions of the stars, notwithstanding the numerous displacements of the
                    ecliptic and equator, are at present nearly the same as they were 2000 years
                    ago. The ancient observations were, however, of too rude a nature to admit of
                    any satisfactory conclusion being deduced from them respecting the minute
                    quantities in question. The accurate instruments of the present day have enabled
                    observers to remark some changes of position too decided to admit of doubt;
                    hence astronomers have inferred a proper motion in several stars, as well as a
                    translation of the sun and the planets in space. From the comparison of a great
                    number of observations, Sir W. Herschel was of opinion that many of the proper
                    motions might be explained by supposing the solar system to have a motion
                    directed towards the star λ in the constellation Hercules. This conjecture has
                    not, however, been confirmed, or rather it has been entirely overthrown, by
                    subsequent observations. Bessel, having subjected to a rigorous comparison a
                    much greater number of the proper motions indicated by comparing the catalogues
                    of Bradley, Mayer, Piazzi, &amp;c. arrived at the conclusion that many points
                    might be assigned in the sphere, some of them even diametrically opposite to
                    each other, situated in the direction of those motions; but that, in whatever
                    direction the sun is supposed to move, so many proper motionswill remain
                    unaccounted for, that there is no reason for preferring one point to another.
                    The proper motions of the stars which have hitherto been remarked are evidently
                    subject to no one assignable law, and are directed to many different points in
                    space. It is therefore infinitely probable that they are due, in part at least,
                    to a real dis <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189900" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9900-0045"
                    />placement of the stars, and not to a general translation of the solar
                    system.</p>
                <p>Some recent observers have supposed they have detected proper motions in a great
                    number of stars, the rates of which they have inserted in their catalogues along
                    with those of the precession; but there is great discordancy in the
                    determinations of different astronomers. Baron Zach, comparing Maskelyne’s
                    observations of the right ascensions of the Greenwich stars, reduced to 1802,
                    with those of Bradley, reduced to 1760, found results which differ from those of
                    Maskelyne himself, not only in <hi rend="italic">amount,</hi> but in several
                    instances even in the <hi rend="italic">direction</hi> of the supposed proper
                    motions. For example, the proper motions (in right ascension) of <hi
                    rend="italic">γ Pegasi, α Ceti, Rigel, Sirius, Spica, γ</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">β Aquilae, α Cygni, a Aquarii,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a
                    Pegasi,</hi> are all <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> according to Zach, while
                    Maskelyne considers them as being all <hi rend="italic">negative.</hi> Such is
                    the uncertainty respecting the proper motions even of the Greenwich stars,
                    which, by reason of the frequent observations they have undergone, and the
                    rigorous scrutinies to which they have been subjected, are probably those whose
                    places are the most accurately determined of any in the whole heavens. But the
                    motions are so slow that they must remain, for a considerable number of years at
                    least, blended with <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> the errors of observation.
                    The double star 61 <hi rend="italic">Cygni</hi> is indeed supposed by Bessel to
                    have an annual proper motion' of + 5"O6 in right ascension, and 3"∙34 in
                    declination; but in general the rates are confined within much narrower limits,
                    and appear to amount only to a fraction of a second. The number of stars in
                    which this proper motion has been supposed to be observed is, as we have already
                    noticed, very considerable. Μ. Bessel, by a comparison of 2959 stars out of
                    Bradley’s catalogue, with the same stars in the catalogue of Piazzĩ, found that
                    425 of them had an annual proper motion, amounting to more than 0"∙2, in the arc
                    of a great circle. The following table, published by Mr Baily in the. second
                    volume of the Memoirs of the Astronomical Society, contains a list of all those
                    stars observed by Bradley and Mayer, whose annual proper motions, according to
                    Piazzi, as given in his catalogue, amount to 0"∙5 either in right ascension or
                    declination. The <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> sign, in the column of
                    declinations, denotes a motion towards the north, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >negative</hi> a motion towards the south. The numbers prefixed are those of
                    Flamsteed, unless when inclosed within a parenthesis, in which case they are
                    those of Piazzi.</p>

                <p>The proper motions of the stars are not susceptible of direct observation or

                    For all these reasons it is easy to see that the determination of the proper
                    motions must be attended with considerable uncertainty, and that hundreds,
                    probably thousands, of years will be required to develope their rates and
                    directions, and assign the distant centres round which they are performed.</p>

                    Stars, Nebulce, and the Milky Way.</hi></p>
                <p>The periodical variations of brilliancy to which some of the fixed stars are
                    subject, may be reckoned among the most remarkable of the phenomena exhibited by
                    those bodies. Several stars, formerly distinguished by their splendour, have
                    entirely disappeared; others are now conspicuous which do not seem to have been
                    visible to the ancient observers; and there are some which alternately appear
                    and disappear, or of which the light at least undergoes great periodic
                    variations. Some seem to become gradually more obscure, as δ in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Great Bear</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> others, like <hi
                    rend="italic">β</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Whale,</hi> to be increasing in
                    brilliancy. Some stars have all at once blazed forth with great splendour, and,
                    after a gradual diminution of their light, have again become extinct. The most
                    remarkable instance of this sort is that of the star which appeared in 1572, in
                    the time of Tycho. It suddenly shone forth in the constellation Cassiopeia with
                    a splendour exceeding that of stars of the first magnitude, even of Jupiter and
                    Venus at their least distances from the earth, and could be seen with the naked
                    eye on the meridian in full day. Its brilliancy gradually diminished from the
                    time of its first appearance, and at the end of sixteen months it entirely
                    disappeared, and has never been seen since. During the whole time of its
                    apparition its place in the heavens remained unaltered, and it had no annual
                    parallax; its distance was consequently of the same order as that of the fixed
                    stars. Its colour, however, underwent considerable variations. Tycho describes
                    it as having been at first of a bright white; afterwards of a reddish yellow,
                    like Mars or Aldebaran; and, lastly, of a leaden white, like Saturn. Another
                    instance of the same kind was observed in 1604, when a star of the first
                    magnitude suddenly appeared in the right foot of Ophiuchus; it presented
                    phenomena analogous to the former, and disappeared in like manner after some
                    months. Kepler wrote a book on this singular apparition. These instances
                    sufficiently prove that the stars are subject to great physical revolutions.</p>
                <p>A great number of stars have been observed whose light seems to undergo a regular
                    periodic increase and diminution, and these are properly called <hi
                    rend="italic">variable</hi> stars. One in the <hi rend="italic">Whale</hi> has a
                    period of 334 days, and is remarkable for the magnitude of its variations. From
                    being a star of the second magnitude, it becomes so dim as to be seen with
                    difficulty through powerful telescopes. Some are remarkable for the shortness of
                    the period of their variation. <hi rend="italic">Algol</hi> has a period of
                    between two and three days, ð <hi rend="italic">Cephei</hi> one of 5ģ days, <hi
                    rend="italic">β Lyrce</hi> one of 6ŷ days, <hi rend="italic">μ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Antinoi</hi> one of 7 days. The regular succession of these
                    variations precludes the supposition of their being occasioned by a real or
                    permanent destruction of the stars; neither can they be supposed to arise from a
                    change of distance; for as the stars invariably retain their apparent places, it
                    would be necessary to suppose that they approach to and recede from the earth in
                    straight lines,—an hypothesis which is at least extremely improbable. The most
                    probable supposition is, that the stars revolve, like the sun and planets, about
                    an axis; and that the surfaces of the variable stars are unequally covered with
                    dark spots, or unequally fitted to emit light; whence their dark sides will be
                    turned towards us after certain intervals by the effect of rotation. In this way
                    Newton accounted for the phenomena. Other astronomers have devised different
                    explanations. Maupertuis supposed that the figure of the stars is not globular,
                    but flat, and that the variations of brilliancy depend on the angle which their
                    flat sides make with the visual ray,—an angle which will be constantly varying
                    if the stars are endowed with a rotatory motion. Others, again, have imagined
                    that the partial obscurations of the stars may be occasioned by their being
                    eclipsed by opaque bodies or planets revolving round them.</p>
                <p>On examining the stars with telescopes of considerable power, many of them are
                    found to be composed of two or more stars placed contiguous to each other, or of
                    which the distance subtends a very minute angle. This appearance is probably in
                    many cases owing solely to the optical effect of their position relative to the
                    spectator; for it is evident that two stars will appear contiguous if they are
                    placed nearly in the same line of vision, although their real distance may be
                    immeasurably great. There are, however, many instances in which the angle of
                    position of the two stars varies in such a manner as to indicate a motion of
                    revolution about a common centre; and in this case the two stars form a binary
                    system, performing to each other the office of sun and planet, and connected
                    together by gravity or some equivalent principle. The recent observations of
                    Messrs Herschel and South have placed this singular fact beyond doubt. Motions
                    have been detected so rapid as to become measurable within very short periods of
                    time; and at certain epochs the satellite or feebler star has been observed to
                    disappear, either on passing behind or before its primary, or by approaching so
                    near to it that its light has been absorbed by that of the other. The most
                    remarkable instance of a regular revolution of this sort is that of the double
                    star ξ <hi rend="italic">Ursoe</hi><hi rend="italic">Majoris,</hi> in which the
                    angular velocity is 6° ∙4 annually, so that the two stars complete a revolution
                    about one another in the space of 60 years; and above three fourths of a circuit
                    have been already described since its discovery in 1781. The double star <hi
                    rend="italic">p Ophiuchi</hi> presents a similar phenomenon, and the satellite
                    has a motion in its orbit still more rapid, α <hi rend="italic"
                    >Castoris,</hi><hi rend="italic">γ Virginis,</hi> ξ <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cancri,</hi><hi rend="italic">ξ Bootis,</hi> δ <hi rend="italic"
                    >Serpentis,</hi> and that remarkable double star 61 <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cygni,</hi> together with several others, exhibit similar variations in their
                    respective angles of position.</p>
                <p>The examination of double stars was first undertaken by Sir W. Herschel, with a
                    view to the question of parallax; for it is evident, and indeed had been
                    remarked by Galileo, that the apparent distance of two stars which are very near
                    each other will vary with the position of the earth in its orbit, unless they
                    are both so remote that, in comparison of their distance from the earth, the
                    diameter of the terrestrial orbit is insensible. His attention was, however,
                    soon arrested by the new and unexpected phenomena which these bodies presented.
                    Sir W. Herschel observed in all 2400 of them. Messrs South and Herschel have
                    given a catalogue of 380 in the Transactions of the <pb break="no"

                    South added 458 to the list •in the volume for 1826. Mr Herschel has published
                    three series of observations in the Memoirs of the Astronomical Society,
                    containing altogether 1000 double stars; and the catalogue of Μ. Struve of
                    Dorpat contains 3063 of the most remarkable. The object of these catalogues is
                    not merely to fix the place of the star within such limits as will enable it to
                    be easily discovered at any future time, but also to record a description of the
                    appearance, position, and mutual distances, of the individual stars composing
                    the system, in order that subsequent observers may have the means of detecting
                    their connected motions, or any changes with which they may be affected. Μ.
                    Struve has also taken notice of 52 triple stars, among which No. 11 of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Unicon, ξ</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Cancer,</hi> and ξ of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Balance,</hi> appear to be ternary systems in motion. Quadruple
                    and quintuple stars have likewise been observed, which also appear to revolve
                    about a common centre of gravity. Every region of the heavens furnishes examples
                    of these curious phenomena, especially those which abound in stars; though Μ.
                    Struve remarks that some parts of the milky way contain very few, while others
                    present them in great abundance.</p>
                <p>Some of the double stars present curious instances of contrasted colours, and
                    generally assume the complementary tints,—a circumstance which, Mr Herschel
                    thinks, may be owing in some degree, at least in cases where red and green,
                    yellow and blue stars are combined in a double star, to the influence of optical
                    deception. “When I first observed,” says that ingenious philosopher, “the double
                    star No. 881, AE. 19 hours 8 minutes 56 seconds, P. D. 95° 45' 33", I remarked
                    it as a case of contrasted colour, the large star being ruddy, and the small one
                    blue. But on closer attention I perceived the small star itself to be double;
                    yet each of the two very minute stars of which it consists appeared equally blue
                    while the eye continued under the influence of the large one; but when this was
                    withdrawn from the field, they appeared of no particular colour, but just like
                    other small stars in the neighbourhood. It may be remarked further, too, that
                    yellow stars are, generally speaking, accompanied by blue small ones, blue being
                    the complementary tint of yellow; but when the large star has an excess of red
                    rays, the blue verges to green, as it ought on the hypothesis of contrast. A
                    most remarkable instance is that of No. 895 (Struve’s catalogue), AE. 6 hours 12
                    minutes, P. D. 84° 12', in which the large star is of a full ruby red, and the
                    smaller one of a fine green, but which colour it also loses when the large star
                    is concealed behind the cross of the wires.” <hi rend="italic">(Memoirs of the
                    Astronomical Society,</hi> vol. iii. p. 186.)</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Nebulae,</hi> so called from their dim cloudy appearance,
                    form another class of objects which furnish matter for curious speculation and
                    conjecture respecting the formation and structure of the sidereal heavens. When
                    examined with a telescope of moderate powers, the greater part of the nebulae
                    are distinctly perceived to be composed of clusters of little stars,
                    imperceptible to the naked eye, because, on account of their apparent proximity,
                    the rays of light proceeding from each are blended together, through the effects
                    of irradiation, in such a manner as to produce only a confused luminous
                    appearance. In others, however, no individual stars can be perceived, even
                    through the best telescopes; and the nebula exhibits only the appearance of a
                    self-luminous or phosporescent patch of matter in a highly dilated or gaseous
                    state; though it is possible that even in this case the appearance may be owing
                    to a congeries of stars so minute, or so distant, as not to afford singly
                    sufficient light to make an impression on the eye. In some instances the nebula
                    presents the appearance of a faint luminous atmosphere, of a circular form, and
                    of large extent, surrounding a star of considerable brilliancy. One of the most
                    remarkable nebulae is that which is situated in the sword-handle of Orion. It
                    was discovered by Huygens in 1656, and described and figured by him in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Systema Saturnium.</hi> Since that time it has been examined and
                    described by various observers, particularly Fouchy, Mairan, Le Gentil, and
                    Messier, who have given engravings of it; and if any trust can be placed in
                    their descriptions of so indistinct and difficult an object, it must have
                    undergone great changes in its form and physical appearances. Unfortunately,
                    however, no satisfactory inference can be drawn from the comparison of the
                    different descriptions; for it is found that the same nebula, viewed on the same
                    night with different telescopes, presents appearances so different as to be
                    scarcely recognizable as the same object. The effects of atmospherical
                    variations also cause great differences in its appearance, even when it is
                    viewed through the same telescope at different times; so that it is scarcely
                    possible that any two observers will be found to agree in their delineations of
                    its outline. Mr Herschel, in the second volume of the Memoirs of the
                    Astronomical Society, has given a detailed description of this nebula as it
                    appeared in his twenty feet reflector in 1824, together with a drawing which, on
                    account of the superiority of his telescope, is probably a much more correct
                    representation of the object than any which previously existed. Fig. 108 is
                    copied from that drawing. Of that portion of the nebula which he calls the
                    Huygenian region Mr Herschel gives the following account: “I know not how to
                    describe it better than by comparing it to a curdling liquid, or a surface
                    strewed over with flocks of wool, or to the breaking up of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >macharel shy</hi> when the clouds of which it consists begin to assume a
                    cirrous appearance. It is not very unlike the mottling of the sun’s disk, only
                    (if I may so express myself) the grain is much coarser, and the intervals
                    darker; and the flocculi, instead of being generally round, are drawn out into
                    little wisps. They present, however, no appearance of being composed of small
                    stars, and their aspect is altogether different from <hi rend="italic"
                    >resolvable nebulae.</hi> In the latter we fancy that we see stars, or that,
                    could we strain our sight a little more, we should see them; but the former
                    suggests no idea of stars, but rather of something quite distinct from
                    them.”</p>
                <p>Another very remarkable nebula is that in the girdle of Andromeda, which, on
                    account of its being visible to the naked eye, has been known since the earliest
                    ages of astronomy. It was re-discovered in 1612 by Simon Marius, who describes
                    it as having the appearance of a candle seen through horn, that is, a diluted
                    light, increasing in density towards a centre. Le Gentil mentions that its
                    figure had appeared to him for many years round, but that in 1757 it had become
                    oval. He also remarks that its light was perfectly uniform in all parts,—a fact
                    which is quite at variance with its present appearance, and which, if true,
                    argues that the nebulous matter is in a rapid state of condensation. “At
                    present,” says Mr Herschel, in the volume above referred to, “it has not,
                    indeed, a star or any well-defined disk in its centre; but the brightness, which
                    increases by regular gradations from the circumference, suddenly acquires a
                    great accession, so as to offer the appearance of a nipple, as it were, in the
                    middle, of very small diameter (10" or 12"), but totally devoid of any distinct
                    outline, so that it is impossible to say precisely where the nucleus ends and
                    the nebula begins. Its nebulosity is of the most perfect milky, absolutely
                    irresolvable kind, without the slightest tendency to that separation <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193189939" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9939-0048"/> into flocculi
                    above described in the nebula of Orion; nor; is there any sort of appearance of
                    the smallest star in the centre of the nipple. This nebula is oval, very bright,
                    and of great magnitude, and altogether a most magnificent object.”</p>
                <p>Sir W. Herschel, who devoted himself to the examination of every uncommon
                    appearance in the sidereal heavens, has given catalogues of 2000 nebulae and
                    clusters of stars discovered by him, and has shown that the nebulous matter is
                    distributed through the immensity of space in quantities inconceivably great,
                    and in separate parcels of all shapes and sizes, and of all degrees of
                    brightness between a mere milky appearance and the condensed light of a fixed
                    star. Finding that the gradations between the two extremes were tolerably
                    regular, he thought it probable that the nebulae form the materials out of which
                    nature elaborates suns and systems, and conceived that, in virtue of a central
                    gravitation, each parcel of nebulous matter becomes more and more condensed, and
                    assumes a rounder form; that from the eccentricity of its shape, and the effects
                    of the mutual gravitation of its particles, it acquires gradually a rotatory
                    motion; that the condensation goes on increasing till the mass acquires
                    consistency and solidity, and all the other characters of a comet or planet;
                    that by a still further process of condensation the body becomes a real star,
                    self-shining; and that thus the waste of the celestial bodies, by the perpetual
                    diffusion of their light, is continually compensated and restored by new
                    formations of such bodies, to replenish for ever the universe with planets and
                    stars. (See the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1811.)
                    These hypotheses or conjectures give no doubt a mechanical reason for the
                    formation of stars, but· the answer to them is exceedingly obvious. Has any
                    instance as yet been observed of a nebula being succeeded by a star, or cluster
                    of stars, or even of becoming so much more condensed as absolutely to change its
                    form? Till a change of this sort has been observed, the inferences are drawn
                    from analogies too slender to entitle them to be regarded as any thing more than
                    mere fancies and speculations. Even if every link in the chain were perfect, and
                    the gradation distinctly traced from the most diffuse nebula to the most compact
                    star, the facts would still be insufficient to warrant the conclusion that the
                    celestial' matter had actually undergone a transition from the nebulous to the
                    stellar state, or that any star or nebula in the heavens ever existed in a state
                    different from its present. Though there is little reason to hope that we shall
                    ever obtain a full knowledge of the mysterious processes which the great
                    Architect of the universe has employed in the formation of the celestial bodies,
                    yet a long series of observations with such instruments as are now constructed
                    may lead to the detection of changes sufficiently indicative of the nature of
                    the forces by which they are produced. These cosmological speculations, however,
                    it may be well to remark, are not of the slightest value to astronomy.</p>
                <p>That great luminous tract which encompasses the sky. like a girdle, and is called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Galaxy</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Milhy-Way,</hi> is
                    supposed by Sir W. Herschel to be a nebula of which the sun forms one of the
                    component stars; and hence it appears immensely greater than other nebulae only
                    in consequence of our situation with respect to it, and of its greater proximity
                    to our system. On examining any part of it with a good telescope, we perceive a
                    prodigious multitude of small stars, whose blended light occasions the whitish
                    appearance which forms so remarkable an object in the heavens. Yet
                    notwithstanding the apparent contiguity of the stars which crowd the galaxy, it
                    is certain that their mutual distances cannot be less than a hundred thousand
                    times the radius of the terrestrial orbit. From this we may attempt to form some
                    notion of the inconceivable distances of the other nebulae, some of which,
                    probably not inferior in magnitude to the milky-way, appear only as small
                    luminous patches in the telescope.</p>

                    contributed by the late Professor Playfair to the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>PHYSICAL ASTRONOMY.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> whole science of astronomy may be reduced to two
                    general problems. The first is to express the position of all the heavenly
                    bodies in terms of the time reckoned from a given instant, either in the past or
                    the future duration of the world. The same may be otherwise stated by saying,
                    that the thing required is, to express the position of any one of the heavenly
                    bodies in a function of the time, the time being considered as the only variable
                    quantity, though combined with other known quantities, which enter into the
                    function as the co-efficients of the different terms. This is the most general
                    view of that which is usually called descriptive, or sometimes geometrical
                    astronomy. The solution of this problem enables us to determine for any time the
                    places of the heavenly bodies, relatively to one another, and Relatively to any
                    point on the earth’s surface. It contains under it an endless variety of
                    subordinate problems, embracing a long series of successive generalizations,
                    from the first observations to the determination of the orbits of the heavenly
                    bodies, and the final reduction of all that concerns their motions into the form
                    of astronomical tables. The second problem is, to compare the laws of motion in
                    the heavens, as discovered from the preceding investigations, with the laws of
                    motion as already known on the surface of the earth, in order to find out
                    whether or not they are the same; and, if not, in what their difference
                    consists. The solution of this problem constitutes what is called Physical
                    Astronomy: it is the same with inquiring into the causes of the celestial
                    motions; for by <hi rend="italic">causes</hi> we mean the general facts
                    concerning the motion of bodies which are observed to take place on the surface
                    of the earth.</p>
                <p>Though the first of these two problems goes necessarily before the second, for
                    the solution of which it affords the <hi rend="italic">data,</hi> yet, after
                    this solution is obtained, it affords great assistance to many of the researches
                    involved in the first, and exemplifies, in a most remarkable manner, the use of
                    theory in the investigation of facts, and the re-action, as it were, of the
                    second problem on the first.</p>
                <p>Taking for granted the solution of the first problem, as given under the other
                    Parts of this article, we are now to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189952"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-9952-0049"/>consider the second, and to explain the manner in
                    which it has been resolved by Newton and the philosophers who have come after
                    him.</p>
                <p>The history of the first of these two problems is long and interesting, beginning
                    from the remotest period to which the records or the traditions of mankind have
                    ventured to ascend, and coming down to the present time; and, in the ages to
                    come, it is never likely to know any limit but the movable instant which
                    separates the past from the future,—as long, at least, as science and
                    civilization are inhabitants of the earth.</p>
                <p>The history of the second comes within small compass; because, between the first
                    rude effort and the last refined investigation there is hardly any intermediate
                    step but one.</p>
                <p>The concentric orbs of the ancient philosophers were an attempt at an explanation
                    of the physical causes of the celestial motions, or at an assimilation of those
                    motions to such as we are accustomed to see on the surface of the earth. The
                    great phenomenon to be explained was the diurnal motion of the heavens, by which
                    so many bodies, very distant from one another, all describe circles round the
                    earth, keeping time so precisely with one another, that the revolutions, whether
                    great or small, arc accomplished in the same interval. This could not be, unless
                    a connection subsisted between those bodies; and the most simple idea of that
                    connection was, that the bodies were fixed in the surface of a sphere which
                    revolved on an axis, and carried them along with it.</p>
                <p>If the whole of astronomy had been confined to the single fact of the diurnal
                    revolution of the fixed stars, the hypothesis just mentioned would have been
                    quite satisfactory. But as some of the heavenly bodies, such as the sun and
                    planets, did not revolve precisely in the same time with the rest, it was
                    necessary to assign to them particular spheres of their own. Those spheres,
                    therefore, must be transparent: light must find an easy passage through them,
                    and hence they must be crystalline. By degrees, as more accurate knowledge was
                    obtained of the motion of the planets, it was found necessary so to increase the
                    number of the spheres, that the complication of the structure was burdensome to
                    the imagination; the hypothesis did not answer the very first object of a
                    theory, that of connecting the facts together; and it was so unlike any process
                    of nature with which we are acquainted, that it was highly improbable. The
                    hypothesis of the homocen-tric orbs therefore fell into discredit, and, after
                    the discovery of the earth’s motion, was entirely abandoned.</p>
                <p>The next attempt to explain the whole system of the celestial motions was that of
                    Descartes, by means of vortices of subtile matter, and the pressure which, by
                    the centrifugal force of those vortices, was produced on the grosser bodies of
                    the stars. But as a taste for accurate knowledge increased, and as men reflected
                    more on the true objects of philosophic theory, the system of vortices appeared
                    more and more defective, and at length ceased to 'ιave any followers.</p>
                <p>Newton succeeded, who, rejecting all the cumbersome machinery, both solid and
                    fluid, of his predecessors, adopted a plan far more philosophical in the design,
                    and far more difficult in the execution, than any thing yet known in the
                    physical or mathematical sciences. Assuming as true the three general facts
                    concerning the planetary system known by the name of the laws of Kepler, he
                    proceeded to inquire by what sort of action on one another the planets could be
                    made to describe orbits having the properties indicated by these three general
                    facts. The general facts to which we now refer, are,</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">That every planet moves so, that the line drawn from it to
                    the sun describes about the sun areas proportional to the times.</hi></p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">That the planets describe ellipses, each of which has one
                    of its foci in the same point, viz. the centre of the sun.</hi></p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">That the squares of the times of the revolutions of the
                    planets are as the cubes of their mean distances from the sun.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Forces which retain the
                    Planets in their</hi><hi rend="italic">Orbits.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">If a body gravitating to a fixed centre have a motion
                    communicated to it in a direction not passing through that centre, it will move
                    in a curve, and the straight line drown from the body to the centre will
                    describe areas proportional to the times.</hi></p>
                <p>Let S (fig. 109) be the centre to which the body A gravitates, at the same time
                    that a motion is communicated to it in the direction AB. And first,· let the
                    gravitating or centripetal force be supposed to act, not continually, but at
                    intervals, producing instantaneously, at the beginning of each interval, the
                    same velocity that it would have produced by acting continually during the whole
                    of that time: let AC be the space which the body would describe by the action of
                    this force alone; also let AB be the space which it would describe in the same
                    time by the projectile force acting on it alone. It will therefore describe the
                    line AD, the diagonal of the parallelogram contained by AB and AC, and at the
                    end of the first interval will be in D. If, then, no new impulse of gravity were
                    to act on it, it would in the second interval of time go on in the direction AD,
                    and describe DF equal to AD. But if, at the beginning of the second interval, an
                    impulse of the centripetal force be instantaneously impressed, sufficient to
                    carry the body in that time from D to E in the line DS, it will describe the
                    line DG, the diagonal of the parallelogram contained by DE and DF. The same is
                    true of the third interval, in which the body will go from G to L, and of every
                    subsequent interval. Join SB, SF, SK, &amp;c. The areas of the triangles ABS,
                    ADS are equal, the triangles being on the same base AS, and between the same
                    parallels AS and BD. For the same reason, the triangles DGS, DFS are equal, and
                    DFS is equal to ADS, because they have equal bases and the .same altitude. For
                    the same reason, the triangle SGL is equal to SDG, or to ADS; and the same is
                    true of all the other triangles that are described in the equal intervals of
                    time by the line drawn from the body to the centre S. This holds, however short
                    the intervals may be, and however great their number; and therefore it is true
                    when the intervals are infinitely small, and their number infinitely great, that
                    is, when the action of the centripetal force is continued.</p>
                <p>But when the intervals of time become infinitely small, the rectilineal figure
                    ADGL passes into a curve. For when these intervals diminish, the lines AB, DF,
                    &amp;c. the lengths of the parallelograms, diminish in the same proportion; but
                    the lines AC, DE, &amp;c. the breadths, diminish in a greater proportion, viz.
                    in that of the squares of these intervals. Hence, the angles which AD, DG, GL,
                    the diagonals, make with the sides AB, DF, GK, continually diminish; and
                    therefore the angles ADG, DGL, or the angle which each diagonal makes with that
                    which is contiguous, increases without limit, so that, as the diagonals diminish
                    in length, the angles they make with one another become greater than any finite
                    rectilineal angles, and therefore the figure becomes a curve line.</p>
                <p>That the lines AC, &amp;c. or the supposed effect of the centrifugal force,
                    diminish as the squares of the times, is evident from the laws of the descent of
                    heavy bodies, as explained under the head of Dynamics.</p>
                <p>2. Hence, conversely, if a body move in a curve, so that the line drawn from it
                    to a fixed point describe areas proportional to the times, the body gravitates
                    to that point, or tends continually to descend to it.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193189965" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9965-0050"/>
                <p>For, since it does not move in a straight line, it must be • continually acted on
                    by a deflecting force; and the direction of the deflecting force must always
                    pass through the same point, otherwise the areas described about that point
                    would not be proportional to the time.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Corollary.</hi> The velocities of a body in different points
                    of the curve which it describes about a centre of force, are inversely as the
                    perpendiculars drawn from the centre to the tangents of the curve at these
                    points. Let ACA', fig. 110, be the curve which a body describes about the centre
                    S. Let Aα and A'«' be two arches of the curve, described in the same
                    indefinitely small portion of time. Join Sα, Sα', then the areas of the
                    triangles AS«, A'Sα' are equal by this proposition. At A and A', draw the
                    tangents AB' A'B', and from S let fall on them the perpendiculars SB and SB'.
                    Because the areas of the triangles AS«, A'S«', are equal, A« × SB = A'«'× SB',
                    or A«: A'«':: SB': SB; but A« is to A'«' as the velocity of the body describing
                    the curve at A to its velocity at A, therefore these velocities are inversely as
                    the perpendiculars SB, SB'.</p>
                <p>The straight line AB (fig. 109), according to which the projectile motion was
                    impressed on the body, is a tangent to the curve at the point A.</p>
                <p>4. On comparing the first and second of these propositions with the first of
                    Kepler’s laws, as just enumerated, it is evident that the primary planets all
                    gravitate to the sun, and that the secondary planets gravitate every one to its
                    primary. The next thing, therefore, is to discover the law observed by this

                    whether, in that function, other variable quantities are not involved beside the
                    distance. The general fact that the orbits, or curves described by the planets
                    round the sun, are ellipses, may assist in this investigation, and in expressing
                    the velocity of a planet, in terms of the radius vector, or its distance from
                    the sun.</p>
                <p>5. Let ADBE (fig. IlD be the orbit of a planet, S the focus in which the sun is
                    placed, AB the transverse, and DE the conjugate axis, C the centre, and F the
                    superior focus. Let the planet be anywhere at P; draw a tangent to the orbit in
                    P, on which from the foci let fall the perpendiculars SG, FH. Draw also DK
                    touching the orbit in D, and let SK be perpendicular to it. Let the velocity of

                    facilitated by the following proposition:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">An equal approach to the centre of force produces an equal

                    recesses from the centre of force produce equal diminutions of the square of the
                    velocities, in whatever lines the bodies move.</hi></p>
                <p>Let ABC (fig. 112) be a curve which a body describes about a centre, S, to which
                    it gravitates, while another body descends in a straight line AS, to that
                    centre. Let BC be any arch of the curve ABC, and let BD, CH, be arches of
                    circles described from the centre S, intersecting the line AS in D and H; the
                    square of the velocity of the body, which describes the arch BC, will be as much
                    increased as the square of the velocity of that which falls through DH.</p>

                    BZ&gt;, and which is employed in accelerating the body moving ŋr in that line,
                    is G × ŋy,; and the increment of the space</p>

                <p>If the bodies moved in the opposite directions, the one from C to B, and the
                    other from H to D, it would be proved, in the same manner, that the squares of
                    their velocities would be equally diminished.</p>
                <p>7. Hence it is evident, that, if the velocities of the revolving and of the
                    falling body are equal in any one instance when they are equally distant’ from
                    the centre, their velocities will always be equal when they are equally distant

                <p>9. From the law thus found to regulate the velocity of bodies falling in straight

                    planets with their distances from the sun. It was indeed highly probable that
                    <hi rend="italic">e</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >α</hi> was a given quantity, or the same for every part of our system; but it
                    could not be considered as a thing demonstrated till the evidence of the third
                    law was introduced.</p>
                <p>13. These laws hold of the secondary planets relatively to their primary, just as
                    with the primary planets relatively to the sun. Each system of secondary
                    planets, however, has a different numerator to the fraction which expresses
                    gravity; that is, the quantity c <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> α is the same
                    for all the satellites of Jupiter, but it is a different quantity from that
                    which belongs to the satellites of Saturn, and different from that which belongs
                    to the primary planets. The quantity c <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> α seems
                    therefore to depend on the central body of each system of planets, and the
                    precise nature of this connection requires to be farther examined into.</p>
                <p>14. Let the centripetal force tending to a given centre S be inversely as the
                    squares of the distances, and let the intensity of that force at any given
                    distance from the centre be also given; then, if a body be projected from a
                    given point, with a given velocity, and in a given direction, it is required to
                    determine the conic section which it will describe.</p>

                    and let OB, taken in SB produced, be equal to this distance; then is SO equal to

                    makes with BG, and let BE = BO, then is E the higher focus. Produce SE to N, so
                    that SN = SO, and bisect EN in A, then is A the higher apsis; and if SP be made
                    equal to EA, P is the lower apsis, and AP the transverse axis; and therefore the

                    described.</p>
                <p>20. From what has been shown at Art. 9, it is evident that the primary planets
                    gravitate to the sun with forces that are inversely as the squares of the
                    distances, and that the secondary gravitate toward the primary, according to the
                    same law. This inference, however, does not apply exactly to the moon, which,
                    being a single satellite, does not by comparison with any other afford a proof
                    that, in bodies revolving round the earth, the squares of the periodic times are
                    as the cubes of the mean distances. The centripetal force at the moon, however,
                    from our knowledge of her periodic time, may be compared with the force of
                    gravity at the earth’s surface, and will determine whether that force decreases
                    as we recede from the earth in the inverse ratio of the squares of the
                    distances.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be the distance of the moon from the centre of the
                    earth, <hi rend="italic">r</hi> the radius of the earth, <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi> the velocity acquired by a heavy body at the earth’s surface by falling

                    revolution in seconds, and c the velocity of her motion. Then, by Art. 14, αc

                    <hi rend="italic">t</hi> are known, we may find</p>
                <p>—, or the ratio of the moon’s distance to the radius of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> earth, which, if it come out the same that it is known to be from
                    observations of the moon’s parallax, will prove that the force which retains the
                    moon in her orbit is the same that causes bodies to fall at the surface of the
                    earth, but diminished in the same ratio that the square of the moon’s distance
                    is greater than the square of the radius of the earth.</p>
                <p>Now <hi rend="italic">g</hi> = 32∙166 feet, <hi rend="italic">r</hi> = 3481279∙4
                    fathoms or</p>
                <p>20887676∙4 feet, and <hi rend="italic">t</hi> = 2360591∙5 seconds. Hence - <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi></p>
                <p>= 60∙218.</p>
                <p>Now the mean equatorial parallax of the moon is found by observation = 57' 0"∙9,
                    from which the mean distance, in semidiameters of the equator, is found =
                    59∙964.</p>
                <p>But it is in mean semidiameters of the earth that the moon’s distance is given in
                    the former computation; therefore, to reduce the last measure to the same scale,
                    it must be increased by a 600th part, as the mean radius of the globe is about
                    that much less than the radius of the equator; the distance 59∙964 then becomes
                    60*063, which agrees with the former number to the small fraction ∙003 of the
                    earth’s radius.</p>
                <p>Thus, from the theory of gravity, combined with the time of the moon’s sidereal
                    revolution, her distance from the earth is found to within a very small fraction
                    of the whole.</p>
                <p>21. <hi rend="italic">It is therefore a general proposition, derived from the
                    most rigorous induction, that the primary planets gravitate to the sun, and the
                    secondary planets to the primary, with forces which are inversely as the squares
                    of the distances.</hi> But since, in all communication of motion, the re-action
                    is equal to the action, when a planet gravitates to the sun, analogy forces us
                    to conclude that the sun gravitates to the planet, in such a manner, that if the
                    momentary approach of the planet to the sun, and of the sun to the planet, were
                    respectively multiplied by the quantity of matter in those bodies, the products,
                    or the <hi rend="italic">quantities of motion,</hi> would be equal. Such a
                    mutual tendency, therefore, of the great bodies of our system to the sun, and of
                    the sun to them, doubtless takes place; but whether this be in consequence of an
                    attractive force residing in their centres, as the magnetic force does in
                    certain parts of the loadstone, or if it arise from the mutual attraction of all
                    the particles of the one for all the particles of the other, does not appear
                    from the phenomena hitherto examined. We may, however, observe that the bodies
                    between which this attraction in the inverse ratio of the squares of the
                    distances takes place, are all of a round form, and are either accurately
                    spherical, or nearly approaching to that shape. It will therefore be of use for
                    resolving this question, to inquire whether, if the particles of matter did
                    attract one another with forces inversely as the squares of their distances, the
                    spherical bodies, compounded of such particles, would attract one another
                    according to the same law. If this is found to be the case, it will be
                    reasonable to conclude that the gravitation of large bodies to one another
                    arises from the mutual attraction of their particles to one another.</p>
                <p>22. In order to determine the relation between the attraction of a sphere and
                    that of the particles of which it consists, we may consider the sphere as made
                    up of plates <pb break="no" facs="nls:193190004" xml:id="kp-eb0704-0004-0053"

                    small in thickness. The attraction of each of these is to be estimated, and from
                    thence the attraction of the whole may be computed. Let AFBG (fig. 115),
                    therefore, be a circular plate, of which the centre is C; CE a straight line
                    passing through C, and perpendicular to the plane AFBG; E any particle in that
                    line attracted by each particle of the circular plate, as D, with a force
                    inversely as the square of DE, the distance between the particles; it is
                    required to find the whole force with which E is attracted in the direction
                    EC.</p>
                <p>If DC be drawn, the force with which D attracts E in the direction ED is

                <p>24. Thus, supposing that the particles of matter attract one another with forces
                    which are inversely as the squares of the distances, it is certain that the
                    spherical bodies composed of these particles would do so likewise, or would
                    attract one another with forces directly as their quantities of matter, and
                    inversely as the squares of the distances of their centres. Since, therefore, it
                    has been found that round or spherical bodies, such as the sun and the planets,
                    do attract other bodies with forces that are inversely as the squares of the
                    distances, it is reasonable to suppose that these bodies are composed of
                    particles gravitating towards one another, or attracting one another with forces
                    inversely as the squares of the distances. <hi rend="italic">Gravitation,
                    therefore, is not to be considered as a force residing in the centres of the

                    universally diffused throughout the universe.</hi></p>
                <p>And as it has been shown that between spherical bodies constituted of such
                    particles, the force of attraction is as the quantity of matter in the
                    attracting body, divided by the square of the distance between its centre and
                    that of the attracted body; if <hi rend="italic">m</hi> be the mass or quantity

                <p>Or if we make the mass of the Earth 1, that of the Sun = 329630, of Jupiter
                    330∙6, of Saturn 101∙06, and of Uranus 20*3. From this also may be derived the
                    densities of the sun and of the four planets just mentioned. Seen from a
                    distance equal to the mean radius of the earth’s orbit, the diameter of the sun
                    subtends an angle of 1923", that of the earth would subtend 17"∙4, of Jupiter
                    186"∙8, of Saturn 177"∙7, and of Uranus 74". The real diameters, therefore, are
                    in the proportion of these numbers, and the bulk in the proportion of their
                    cubes. By dividing the quantities of matter by the bulks, we have the densities;
                    and if that of the earth be 4∙713, which is its mean density, that of water
                    being = 1, then</p>
                <p>Density of the Sun =1∙1775</p>
                <p>of the Earth =4*713</p>
                <p>of Jupiter =1∙1678</p>
                <p>of Saturn =0∙4055</p>
                <p>of Uranus =1∙0348.</p>
                <p>The mean density of the earth, in respect of water, is here taken from the
                    experiments made at Schehallien. <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.</hi> 1811, p.
                    376.)</p>
                <p>27. It has been already observed, that because action is always accompanied by an
                    equal re-action, when the sun attracts a planet, the planet also attracts the
                    sun, and that the velocities impressed on the bodies by their mutual attraction
                    are in the inverse ratio of their masses.</p>
                <p>In consequence of this mutual action the sun and the planet must both move, and
                    must describe orbits about their common centre of gravity, the only point which
                    the mutual action of those bodies has no tendency to put in motion.</p>
                <p>In the solar system, therefore, the centre of gravity of the whole is the focus
                    about which all the orbits are described. Thus, if C be that centre (fig. 117),
                    Sthe sun, and P a planet; while P describes the elliptic arch PP ʹ about C, S
                    describes the arch SS ʹ similar to PP ʹ, and having to it the ratio that SC has
                    to CP, or the ratio which the mass of the planet has to the mass of the sun.</p>
                <p>The true orbits, therefore, are all described about the same immovable point; but
                    the orbit of any of the planets may be referred to the sun as a centre, by
                    supposing a body placed in that centre equal to the sum of the masses of the sun
                    and of the planet. This is true, because the bodies appear to approach one
                    another, or to recede from one another, with a force that is equal to the sum of
                    the forces with which they tend towards their centre of gravity. Thus, if S
                    denote the mass of the sun, and E that of the earth, the distances from the
                    centre being CP and CS, the orbit which each of the two bodies will appear to
                    describe round the other, is that which would be described about an immovable
                    centre C, with a centripetal force - <hi rend="superscript underline"> S</hi><hi

                    >universal gravitation,</hi> a power which pervades all nature, extending to an
                    unlimited distance, and determining the condition of every body in the universe
                    at any instant, from its state in the former instant, and from the relations in
                    which it stands to all other bodies. Whether this force can be explained upon
                    any principle more general than itself, is yet undecided, though, from the bad
                    success which has hitherto attended all attempts towards that object, it seems
                    probable that such explanation is not within the reach of the human
                    understanding. Thus much, however, we know with certainty, that the law of
                    gravity, as just announced, may be considered as a very accurate expression of
                    all the phenomena of the planetary motions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Forces which
                    disturb the Elliptic Motion of the Planets.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Of the force by which the Sun disturbs the motion of the
                    Moon round the Earth.</hi></p>
                <p>28. The motion of the moon in an elliptic orbit round the earth is disturbed by
                    the action of the sun: the gravity of the moon to the earth is increased at the
                    quadratures, and diminished at the syzygies; and the areas described by the
                    radius vector, except near these four points, are never exactly proportional to
                    the times.</p>
                <p>Let ADBC (fig. 118) be the orbit, nearly circular, in which the moon Μ revolves,
                    in the direction CADB, round the earth E. Let S be the sun, and let SE, the
                    radius of the earth’s orbit, be taken to represent the force with which the
                    earth gravitates to the sun.</p>
                <p>1 1 SE^</p>
                <p>Then:: SE: = the force by which the sun</p>
                <p>SE <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> draws the moon in the direction MS. Take MG</p>
                <p>SM <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> and let the parallelogram KF be described,
                    having MG for its diagonal, and having its sides parallel to EM and ES. The
                    force MG may be resolved into the two, MF and MK, of which MF, directed towards
                    E, the centre of the earth, increases the gravity of the moon to the earth, and
                    does not hinder the areas described by the radius vector from being proportional
                    to the times.</p>
                <p>The other force MK draws the moon in the direction of the line joining the
                    centres of the sun and earth. It is, however, only the excess of this force
                    above the force represented by SE, or that which draws the earth to the sun,
                    which disturbs the relative position of the moon and earth. This is evident, for
                    if KM were just equal to ES, no disturbance of the moon relatively to the sun
                    could arise from it. If, then, ES be taken from MK, the difference HK is the
                    whole force in the direction parallel to SE, by which the sun disturbs the
                    relative position of the moon and earth. Now, if in MK, MN be taken equal to HK,
                    and if NO be drawn perpendicular to the radius vector EM produced, the force MN
                    may be resolved into two, MO and ON, the first lessening the gravity of the moon
                    to the earth; and the second, being parallel to the tangent of the moon’s orbit
                    in Μ, accelerates the moon’s motion from C to A, retards it from A to D, and so
                    alternately in the other two quadrants.</p>
                <p>Thus the whole solar force directed to the centre of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193190030" xml:id="kp-eb0704-0030-0055"/>the earth is composed of the
                    two parts MF and MO, which are sometimes opposed to one another, but which never
                    affect the uniform description of the areas about E. Near the quadratures the
                    force MO vanishes, and the force MF, which increases the gravity of the moon to
                    the earth, coincides with CE or DE. As the moon approaches the conjunction at A,
                    the force MO prevails over MF, and lessens the gravity of the moon to the sun.
                    In the opposite point of the orbit, when the moon is in opposition at B, the
                    force with which the sun draws the moon is less than that with which the sun
                    draws the earth, so that the effect of the solar force is to separate the moon
                    and earth, or to increase their distance; that is, it is the same as if,
                    conceiving the earth not to be acted on, the sun’s force drew the moon in the
                    direction from E to B. This force is negative, therefore, in respect of the
                    force at A, and the effect in both cases is to draw the moon from the sun, in a
                    direction perpendicular to the line of the quadratures.</p>
                <p>29. The analytical values of these forces must be found if a more exact estimate
                    is to be made of their effects. Let SE, considered as constant, = <hi

                    and at this point in each quadrant the moon’s gravity to the earth is neither

                    the gravitation of the moon to the earth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Thus it appears, that at the quadratures the gravity of the
                    moon to the earth is increased by a quantity equal to the mass of the sun,
                    multiplied into the radius of the moons orbit, and divided by the cube of the

                    earth to be 1, it is found = — nearly. Hence the mean disturbing force of the
                    sun is nearly = of the moon’s gravity to the earth.</p>
                <p>31. From the disturbing force of the sun arise two kinds of inequalities which
                    affect the lunar motions; the one kind affects the form and position of the
                    orbit of that planet, the other immediately affects the motion of the planet in
                    the orbit. When any of these inequalities is expressed numerically, the measure
                    of it so obtained is, in the language of astronomy, called <hi rend="italic">an
                    Equation.</hi></p>
                <p>32. The line in which the plane of the moon’s orbit cuts the ecliptic is called
                    the line of the nodes; and this line is subject to change its position
                    continually, in such a manner as to go back annually 19° 19' 42"∙3. The way in
                    which this effect is produced may be thus conceived. That part of the solar
                    force which is parallel to the line joining the centres of the sun and earth, is
                    not in the plane of the moon’s orbit, except when the sun itself is in that
                    plane, or when the line of the nodes, being produced, passes through the sun. In
                    all other cases it is oblique to the plane of the orbit, and may be resolved
                    into two forces, one of which is at right angles to that plane, and is directed
                    towards the ecliptic. This force of course draws the moon continually towards
                    the ecliptic, or produces a continual deflection of the moon from the plane of
                    her own orbit towards that of the earth. Hence the moon meets the plane of the
                    ecliptic sooner than it would have done if that force had not acted. At every
                    half-revolution, therefore, the point in which the earth meets the ecliptic
                    advances in a direction contrary to that of the moon’s motion, or contrary to
                    the order of the signs. This retrograde motion is such that, in its mean
                    quantity, it amounts to 19° 19' 42"∙3 in a year. The manner of de <pb break="no"

                    gravity is explained by Newton, <hi rend="italic">Princip.</hi> lib. iii. prop.
                    31. This motion is subject to many inequalities, depending on the changes in the
                    quantity and direction of the solar force.</p>
                <p>If the earth and the sun were at rest, the effect of the deflecting force just
                    described would be to produce a retrograde motion of the line of the nodes till
                    that line was brought to pass through the sun, and of consequence the plane of
                    the moon’s orbit to do the same, after which they would both remain in their
                    position, there being no longer any force tending to produce a change in either.
                    The motion of the earth carries the lines of the nodes out of this position, and
                    produces, by that means, its continual retrogradation.</p>
                <p>33. The same force produces a small variation in the inclination of the moon’s
                    orbit, giving it an alternate increase and decrease within very narrow
                    limits.</p>
                <p>34. The line of the moon’s apsides, that is, the longer axis of her orbit, has
                    also a slow angular motion round the centre of the earth, which is progressive,
                    or in the same direction with the motions of the moon itself. To conceive the
                    cause of this phenomenon, we may begin with supposing the moon at the lower
                    apsis, or perigee; and it is plain, if that planet were urged by no other force
                    than its gravitation to the earth, that after the <hi rend="italic">radius
                    vector</hi> had moved over 180°, the moon would be at the higher apsis, where
                    its motion would be at right angles to the said radius. But as the mean
                    disturbing force in the direction of the radius vector tends, on the whole, to
                    diminish the gravitation of the moon to the earth, the portion of her path,
                    described in any instant, will be less bent or deflected from the tangent, than
                    if this disturbing force did not exist. The actual path of the moon, therefore,
                    will be less incurvated than the elliptic orbit that would be described under
                    the influence of gravity alone, and will not be brought to intersect the radius
                    vector at right angles, till this last have moved over an arch of more than
                    180°.</p>
                <p>Hence the solar force, by lessening the moon’s gravity to the earth, produces a
                    progressive motion in the apsides of the lunar orbit. If the disturbing force
                    had increased the moon’s gravity to the earth, the motion of the apsides would
                    have been <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">antecedentia.</hi></p>
                <p>The precise quantity of the motion of the apsides is not however easily
                    determined. Newton left this part of the lunar theory almost untouched; and the
                    only investigation he has entered into having any reference to it, assigned a
                    measure only the half of that which is known from observation to belong to it.

                    of the lunar inequalities than was to be obtained by the method which Newton had
                    followed, he at first encountered the same difficulty, and found that his
                    calculus gave the motion of the apogee only half of the real quantity. He began,
                    therefore, to suspect that gravity does not follow so simple a law as the
                    inverse of the squares of the distances, but one which is more complex, and such
                    as cannot be expressed but by a formula of two terms. The second of these terms
                    he supposed to be inversely as the fourth power of the distance, and proceeded
                    to inquire what must be the co-efficient of that term, in order to make this new
                    supposition represent the true motion of the apsides. In order to this, he found
                    it necessary to carry his approximation farther than he had yet done, and to
                    include terms which he had before neglected. When these terms were included, he
                    found that the coefficient he was seeking for came out equal to 0; the necessary
                    inference from which was, that there was no such term; and that the Newtonian
                    law of gravity, when the approximation was carried far enough, was quite
                    sufficient to explain the motion of the apsides. This doubt concerning the law
                    of gravity terminated, therefore, in the confirmation of it.</p>
                <p>35. When the doubts excited by Clairaut’s first attempt were made known, and
                    before his final solution of the difficulty was fully understood, there were
                    several mathematicians who, still following the method of Newton, endeavoured to
                    deduce the true motion of the moon’s apsides from the theory of gravity. Among
                    those who were most successful in this attempt were Dorn. Walmesley, and
                    afterwards Dr Matthew Stewart, professor of mathematics in the university of
                    Edinburgh. In his <hi rend="italic">Mathematical and Physical Tracts</hi> he has
                    demonstrated this remarkable theorem:</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">r</hi> be the radius of the moon’s orbit, supposing it to
                    be a circle, and the moon to be acted on only by F, her gravity to the earth. If
                    the mean disturbing force by which the sun diminishes the moon’s gravity be <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> then will the greatest distance to which the moon will
                    recede</p>
                <p>F</p>
                <p>from the earth be <hi rend="italic">r</hi> × = <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> —÷
                    <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>,; and the cube of this dis-f—5/</p>
                <p>tance will be to the cube of <hi rend="italic">τ,</hi> in the duplicate ratio of
                    the angle described by the moon from one apsis to the same apsis again, to four
                    right angles.</p>
                <p>Hence the angle described by the radius vector from</p>
                <p>(F 3f∖ 3.</p>
                <p>F— <hi rend="italic">bf)</hi><hi rend="italic">’</hi></p>
                <p>This proposition, which is demonstrated by Dr Stewart in the fourth of his
                    Tracts, in a manner somewhat prolix, on account of his rigorous adherence to the
                    methods of the ancient geometry, but in a way perfectly clear and elementary, is
                    employed by him to deduce the mean disturbing force from the motion of the
                    apsides as ascertained by observation. But when the mean disturbing force is
                    known from other phenomena, the same proposition may be employed to deduce the
                    motion of the apsides from that force. Accordingly, if the disturbing force be
                    taken = the motion of the apsides will come out = 3° P 20" for a sidereal
                    revolution of the moon, very near the quantity actually observed.</p>
                <p>36. Having determined the sun’s mean disturbing force from the motion of the
                    apsides, Dr Stewart proceeded to determine from the former of these the sun’s
                    distance from the earth. The resultof a very nice investigation gave the sun’s
                    parallax 6"∙9, a quantity that is no doubt too small, and makes of course the
                    sun’s distance too great. It is indeed but an inconsiderable part of the sun’s
                    disturbing force into which the parallax enters as an element, and therefore any
                    deduction founded on it must be liable to this inaccuracy, that a small error in
                    the data will produce a great one in the result.</p>
                <p>37. After the inequalities which are conceived as belonging to the moon’s orbit,
                    come those which directly affect the place of the moon in that orbit. The most
                    considerable of these, after what is called the equation of the centre, arising
                    from the elliptic figure of the lunar orbit, and independent of all disturbance,
                    is the equation or inequality called the evection, which was discovered by the
                    Greek astronomers. This depends on the position of the transverse axis of the
                    moon’s orbit in respect of the line of the syzygies. When that axis is in the
                    line just mentioned, because the quantity by which the solar force diminishes
                    the gravitation of the moon in the syzygies is, <hi rend="italic"
                    >caeterisparibus,</hi> proportional to her distance from the earth, it is
                    greatest when the moon is in the apogee, and least when in the perigee. In this
                    situation of the orbit, therefore, the greatest diminution is made from the
                    quantity of the moon’s gravitation which is already the least, and <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193190056" xml:id="kp-eb0704-0056-0057"/> the least from
                    that which is already the greatest; the gravitation at the perigee, and
                    therefore the difference, is augmented, and the orbit appears to have its
                    eccentricity increased. When the line of the apsides is in the quadratures, the
                    contrary happens; the gravitation at the apogee is most augmented, and at the
                    perigee least; the difference is therefore diminished, and the eccentricity of
                    the lunar orbit seems also to be diminished. This is conformable to observation;
                    and when the evection is accurately deduced from the theory of gravitation, it
                    appears = (1° 20' 29"∙9) sin. (2 ( ¢ —©)— <hi rend="italic">aj</hi> where ♯ is
                    the mean longitude of the moon, Θ that of the sun, and <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    the mean anomaly of the moon counted from the perigee.</p>
                <p>38. The moon’s variation is an inequality which was discovered by Tycho, and
                    found to depend on the angular distance of that planet from the sun. It is
                    derived from that part of the sun’s disturbing force which is at right angles to
                    the radius vector, and which accelerates the motion of the moon from the
                    quadratures to the syzygies, and retards it from the syzygies to the
                    quadratures. The effect of this force is found, from the theory of gravity, to
                    be represented by three terms, which, if <hi rend="smallcaps">δ</hi> be the
                    angular distance of the moon from the sun, are, + (35' 41"∙9) sin. 2 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">δ</hi> + ( 0' 2" ) sin. 3 <hi rend="smallcaps">δ</hi> + ( 0'
                    14" ) sin. 4 ∆.</p>
                <p>39. The lunar inequality, called the annual equation, arises from the variation
                    of the sun’s disturbing force according to the place which the earth occupies in
                    its orbit. It is shown above that the sun’s disturbing force is, <hi
                    rend="italic">coeteris paribus,</hi> as the cube of his distance from the earth;
                    so that when the earth is in its perihelion this force is the greatest, and at
                    the aphelion the least, its effect varying at the same rate with the equation of
                    the sun’s centre, or having everywhere the same ratio to that equation. Hence
                    this equation is nearly (IP 12") × sin. sun’s mean anomaly, with a contrary sign
                    to the equation of the sun’s centre.</p>
                <p>40. These inequalities are all phenomena which were observed before the
                    explanation of them was known. To them may be added a fourth inequality, known
                    by the name of the moon’s acceleration. It appeared to astronomers as a
                    continual increase in the velocity of the moon, or in the rate of her mean
                    motion, amounting to about 10" in a century, and its effect, like that of all
                    other constant accelerations, accumulating as the squares of the times. It did
                    not seem to"be periodical, like the other lunar inequalities, but to be a
                    constant increase of the velocity, and a corresponding diminution of the
                    periodical time of the moon, which must in the end change entirely the relation
                    of that body to the earth.</p>
                <p>It is but within these few years that Laplace discovered it to be a periodic
                    inequality, though requiring, in order to accomplish the series of its changes,
                    a length of time which science has not yet ventured to calculate. For many
                    centuries to come it may be expressed by this formula, taking <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> to denote the number of centuries reckoned from the year 1700, viz.</p>
                <p>10"∙7232 × n <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + 0"∙019361 × n <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi>.</p>
                <p>The first term includes all that was known from observation previously to the
                    discovery of Laplace. This, however, must be considered not as the true form of
                    the equation, which must include the sines or cosines of certain angles, but
                    merely a provisional formula, to serve till the true one can be rigorously
                    assigned.</p>
                <p>This inequality has in its cause a great affinity to the annual equation.</p>
                <p>Whatever changes the form of the earth’s orbit, has an effect on the disturbing
                    force of that body on the moon, which is in the inverse ratio of the cube of the
                    distance between the sun and earth. But it is found that though the mean
                    distance remains invariable, the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit changes, on
                    account of the action of the other planets, and in fact has been diminishing,
                    from a more remote antiquity than that to which the history of astronomy
                    extends. From this cause Laplace has deduced the supposed acceleration of the
                    moon’s mean motion.</p>
                <p>41. All these inequalities have been pointed out by observations, and have been
                    explained in the most satisfactory manner by the principle of universal
                    gravitation. But when all these were reduced into equations and arranged in
                    tables, yet the places of the moon calculated from them were never quite exact;
                    and there seemed a cause of error or a mass of small inequalities unknown in
                    their magnitude and form, to which this inaccuracy was to be ascribed, and which
                    operated, as it may be said, like a mist which concealed the true place of the
                    moon from the calculator, and prevented his results from agreeing completely
                    with those of the observer. The most likely way to discover these inequalities,
                    if they arose from gravity, was to push the approximation to the moon’s place
                    still farther, and to try if the terms hitherto neglected in the approximation
                    would not, when taken into account, afford a complete analysis of the circle of
                    confusion which might be said to surround the moon on all occasions.</p>
                <p>The problem on which mathematicians now entered, and which Clairaut, already
                    mentioned, Euler, and D’Alembert, all three resolved nearly about the same time,
                    has been called the <hi rend="italic">Problem of Three JBodies.</hi> The thing
                    proposed is, three bodies which attract one another with forces directly as
                    their quantities of matter, and inversely as the squares of their distances,
                    being given, and any motions whatever being impressed on them, to find the
                    orbits which they will describe round their common centre of gravity. It is,
                    however, only in certain cases that this general problem admits of solution, and
                    one of these is, when one of the bodies is at a vast distance from the other
                    two. This is exactly the case with the moon and earth in respect of the sun, the
                    orbit of the earth being nearly the same as if there only existed the sun and
                    earth, and the orbit of the moon relative to the earth being nearly the same if
                    there were only the moon and earth. This solution of the problem, however, in
                    this direct way, leads to far more exact conclusions than can be obtained from
                    the more simple but more indirect method which Newton followed. The general view
                    which leads to the most exact estimate of the merit of the two solutions is,
                    that the motions of the moon, when analytically and fully expressed, necessarily
                    form a number of different series, each of which converges with more or less
                    rapidity. The prosecution of the direct method allows the terms of these series
                    to be computed to an indefinite extent, or till the quantities omitted are too
                    small to affect observation. The method of Newton can go no farther than to
                    compute the first, or at most a few of the leading terms of each of the series.
                    Its accuracy is therefore limited; that of the other knows no limits. Though
                    this be a true estimate of the value of the methods, yet that of the original
                    inventor possesses infinite merit, as having first led the way to this arduous
                    investigation, and as still serving to carry the imagination better along with
                    it than the other, and to keep the mechanical principles more directly in
                    view.</p>
                <p>The complete solution of the problem of the <hi rend="italic">three bodies</hi>
                    has accordingly discovered a great number of new equations, each individually
                    small, which would sometimes nearly destroy one another, and, at other times,
                    having many of them the same sign, would accumulate to a considerable amount.
                    This was the triumph of the theory, and the strongest evidence of its truth. The
                    effect <pb break="no" facs="nls:193190069" xml:id="kp-eb0704-0069-0058"/>of
                    these irregularities varied so much, and depended on; so many elements, that it
                    may be doubted whether the most accurate and most constant observation would
                    ever have enabled astronomers to discover their precise quantities, and to
                    separate them from one another.</p>
                <p>The tables of the moon, in the state to which they are now brought, contain
                    twenty-eight equations for the longitude, twelve for the latitude, and thirteen
                    for the horizontal parallax of the moon. Of the first of these, twenty-three
                    have been deduced from theory alone; of the second, nine; and of the third,
                    eleven. This applies to the tables of Burg; those since published by Burckhardt
                    contain more equations, and are still more accurate.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Of the Disturbance in the Motion of the Primary Planets,
                    produced by their action on one another.</hi></p>
                <p>42. It is evidently necessary, in this inquiry, to know the quantities of matter
                    in the different planets, or, which comes to the same, the intensity of the
                    attraction of each at a given distance from its centre. With respect to those
                    planets which have satellites, the Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus, their
                    masses or quantities of matter have been already determined. The masses of Venus
                    and Mars have been estimated by Laplace, from the effects which they appear to
                    produce on the earth’s motion. The mass of Mercury has been estimated on the
                    supposition that the densities of that planet and of the earth are inversely as
                    their mean distances from the sun. This law holds with respect to the Earth,
                    Jupiter, and Saturn, and analogy renders it probable that the same law includes
                    the other planets. Thus, the mass of the Sun being 1, that of Mer- <hi

                <p>43. The effects of the action of the planets on one another is more difficult to
                    be investigated than the effects of the sun’s action on the moon, because the
                    disturbing forces are not only more numerous, but because the distance of the
                    disturbing from the disturbed body is not so great that the quantities divided
                    by higher powers of that distance can be so safely rejected. The general
                    principle, however, according to which the solar action on the moon was resolved
                    into forces either in the direction of the radius vector or at right angles to
                    it, is applicable to both questions.</p>
                <p>Thus, supposing P and P' (fig. 119) to be two planets revolving in orbits, nearly
                    circular, about the sun at S; in order to find how the motion of P' is affected
                    by the action of P, let PP', PS, and P'S be drawn, and let the line A denote the

                    parallel to PS, take NO = A; then the remaining forces OP'and P'M are those
                    which disturb the motion of P', as was proved in the case of the moon. The
                    former of these, OP', may be resolved into OQ and P'Q, of which P'Q diminishes
                    the gravity of the planet to the sun, and OQ accelerates its motion in a
                    direction perpendicular to the radius vector. Therefore, as the force P'M always
                    increases the planet’s gravity to the sun, P'M—P'Q is the whole force increasing
                    or diminishing the gravity of P' to S; and the force directly employed in
                    increasing or diminishing the angular motion of P about S, is OQ or P'T. The
                    analytical values of these quantities may be found, as in the theory of the
                    moon, though not with equal simplicity, because SP cannot always be supposed
                    great in respect of SP'.</p>
                <p>44. In consequence of these actions, the orbit of every planet may be considered
                    as an ellipsis, which is under- ^ going slowly certain changes in its form,
                    magnitude, and ’ position, or in what are called its elements. By the elements
                    of the orbit of any heavenly body, are meant the quantities that determine the
                    position and magnitude of that orbit, viz. the position of the line of the
                    nodes, the inclination of the plane of the orbit to the plane of the ecliptic,
                    the position of the line of the apsides, the eccentricity, and the mean
                    distance. These are all quantities independent of one another, and from them may
                    be deduced all other circumstances with respect to the elliptic orbit. Of these
                    five elements, which would be invariable if the planet only gravitated to the
                    sun, all except the mean distance are subject to slow but perpetual changes.</p>
                <p>45. The line of the nodes, in every one of the planets, has a retrograde angular
                    motion, which goes on continually, and of which the amount, when calculated as
                    due to each planet, agrees very well with observation. The plane of the orbit
                    also varies its inclination, by certain small periodical changes, which
                    alternately increase and diminish it, as in the case of the moon. The line of
                    the apsides, from the same cause as in the planet just mentioned, has a
                    continued motion forward, or according to the order of the signs. Thus, in
                    Mercury the node goes back about 7"∙82 annually. The aphelion goes forward about
                    5"∙84 in a year, and the inclination of the orbit in the course of a century
                    increases about 18"∙18, which, in the course of succeeding ages, will be
                    compensated by an equal diminution, so as to preserve it always nearly of the
                    same quantity. In the same planet the equation of the centre, which depends on
                    the eccentricity, increases about 1"∙6 in a century, indicating a small increase
                    of eccentricity. These variations in the orbit of Mercury arise from the action
                    of Venus, the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn; the effects of the first of
                    these planets, on account of its vicinity, being by much the most considerable.
                    The mean distance, however, of Mercury from the Sun, does not, any more than
                    that of the other planets, undergo any change whatever.</p>
                <p>46. Similar conclusions apply also to the orbit of Venus. The orbit of the earth
                    also is subject to similar changes, the line of the apsides moving forward
                    annually at the rate of 11"∙8, in respect to the fixed stars. The earth’s
                    eccentricity is also diminishing, and the secular variation of the greatest
                    equation of the centre is — 17"∙66.</p>
                <p>The motion of the earth is subject to another inequality on account of the action
                    of the moon; for, to speak strictly, it is not the centre of the earth, but the
                    centre of gravity of the moon and earth, which describes equal areas in equal
                    times about the centre of the sun. It is evident that, on this account, the
                    earth will be sometimes advanced before, and sometimes will fall behind, the
                    point which describes the circumference of the ellipsis, in conformity with the
                    general law of the planetary motions. From the same cause also, as the moon does
                    not move in the plane of the ecliptic, the earth will be forced out of that
                    plane, in order to preserve a position diametrically opposite to the moon. These
                    irregularities, however, are inconsiderable. By observers on the earth’s
                    surface, they are transferred to the sun, but in an opposite direction. The sun,
                    therefore, has a motion in longitude, by which he alternately advances before
                    the point which describes the elliptic orbit in the heavens, and falls behind
                    it; and also a motion in latitude, by which he alternately ascends above and
                    descends below the plane of the ecliptic. As the mass of the moon, however, is
                    not more than part of that of the earth, the distance of the centre of gravity
                    of the moon and earth from the centre of the latter must be <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193190082" xml:id="kp-eb0704-0082-0059"/>less than a semídiameter, and
                    therefore the inequality thus •produced in the sun’s longitude must be less than
                    his ' horizontal parallax. The alteration in latitude can hardly amount to a
                    second. This inequality in the sun’s motion is called the menstrual parallax,
                    and was first mentioned by Smeaton, <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans.</hi>
                    1768.</p>
                <p>47. In the orbit of Mars the node moves backward 23"∙3 annually, and the line of
                    the apsides moves forward 15"∙8, both in respect of the fixed stars. The
                    eccentricity of the orbit is increasing, and the secular variation of the
                    greatest equation of the centre is + 37".</p>
                <p>In the case of this planet, however, the elliptic orbit is not only changed by
                    these quantities, but the place of the planet in that orbit is sensibly affected
                    by the action of Venus, Jupiter, and the Earth. The effect of the action of
                    Venus is expressed by this formula, 5"∙7 sin. (long. ¢ — 3 long. J ); of the
                    earth, 7"∙2 sin. (long. 0 — long. Ş ). Several inequalities are produced in
                    Jupiter.</p>
                <p>48. The inequalities of the small planets <hi rend="italic">Vesta, Juno,
                    Ceres,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pallas,</hi> have not yet been computed. The
                    disturbances which they must suffer from Mars and Jupiter are no doubt
                    considerable, and, on account of their vicinity, though their masses are small,
                    they may somewhat disturb the motions of one another. Their action on the other
                    bodies in the system is probably insensible.</p>
                <p>As two of these planets have nearly the same periodic time, they must preserve
                    nearly the same distance and the same aspect with regard to one another. This
                    offers a new case in the computation of disturbing forces, and may produce
                    equations of longer periods than are yet known in our system.</p>
                <p>The motion of the apsides and the change of eccentricity in the orbits of Jupiter
                    and Saturn are chiefly produced by their action on one another, but a part also
                    depends on the action of the other planets. The node of Jupiter moves backward
                    annually 15"∙8, and his aphelion forward 6"∙96. The secular change in the
                    inclination of the orbit is 22"∙6, and in the first and last of these
                    inequalities the action of Venus has the principal share. The equation of the
                    centre increases 56"∙25 in a century, of which nearly the whole arises from the
                    action of Saturn. In Saturn again the node goes back at the rate of 19"∙4
                    annually, and the aphelion forward at the rate of 19"∙4; the secular change of
                    the inclination is — 15"∙5, and the secular diminution of the equation of the
                    centre 2'∙1.</p>
                <p>There is, besides these variations in the orbits, an inequality in the motion of
                    each of these planets, which it has been found very difficult to explain, and
                    has only lately been fully accounted for, according to the theory of gravity, by
                    the profound investigations of Laplace. These inequalities are both of a long
                    period, viz. 918 ’ 76 years, which is the time that they take to run through all
                    their changes. If <hi rend="italic">n</hi> express a number of years reckoned
                    from the beginning of 1750, S the mean longitude of Saturn, and I that of
                    Jupiter, reckoned from the same time, then the equation which must be applied to
                    the mean longitude of Jupiter, or the amount of this inequality, is +
                    (20'49"∙5-n × 0"∙042733) ×</p>
                <p>sin. (5 S — 2 I + 5° 34' 8" — <hi rend="italic">n</hi> × 58"∙88); and that which
                    must be applied to S is</p>
                <p>— (48'44"-n × 0"∙1) ×</p>
                <p>sin. (5 S — 2 I + 5° 34 8" — <hi rend="italic">n</hi> × 58"∙88).</p>
                <p>These two equations are to one another nearly in the ratio of 3 to 7. The reason
                    of the long period above mentioned is, that the argument 5S — 21 — <hi
                    rend="italic">η</hi> × 58''∙88 requires all that time to increase from 0 to
                    360°.</p>
                <p>Uranus, on account of his great distance, suffers hardly any disturbance in his
                    motion, but from Saturn and Jupiter. The node moves backward at the rate of 36"
                    annually, and the aphelion forward at that of 2"∙55. The eccentricity is
                    diminishing, and the secular variation of the greatest equation of the centre is
                    11"∙03.</p>
                <p>There is also an inequality in the longitude of this’ planet, depending on the
                    action of Saturn. If S be the longitude of this last planet, U the longitude of
                    Uranus, and A the longitude of the aphelion of Saturn, the inequality in
                    question amounts to 2' 30" × sin. (S — 2 U + A).</p>
                <p>49. <hi rend="italic">Of all these inequalities, and of many other smaller ones
                    which theory has discovered, it must be observed that they are periodical, each
                    returning after a certain time to run through the same series of changes which
                    it had formerly exhibited.</hi><hi rend="italic">Another general remarh is, that
                    one element in every planetary orbit, viz. the mean distance, is exempted from
                    all change</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">and since on the mean
                    distance depends the time of revolution, that time remains also unchanged. From
                    the invariability of the mean distance, and the periodical revolution of all the
                    inequalities, it follows that the actual condition of the planetary system can
                    never deviate far from the mean, about which, we may, therefore, conceive it to
                    be continually making small oscillations, which in the course of ages compensate
                    one another, and therefore produce nothing like disorder or permanent change. It
                    is in this manner that the stability of the planetary system is provided for by

                    their elliptic orbits round the sun, have been found to be disturbed by the
                    action of the larger planets, Jupiter and Saturn; but the great eccentricity of
                    their orbits makes it impossible, in the present state of mathematical science,
                    to assign the quantity of that disturbance for an indefinite number of
                    revolutions, though it may be done for a limited portion of time, by considering
                    the orbit as an ellipsis, the elements of which are continually changing. This
                    is the method of Lagrange, and is followed in the <hi rend="italic"

                    when he predicted the return of the comet of 1682, took into consideration the
                    action of Jupiter, and concluded that it would increase the periodic time of the
                    comet a little more than a year; he therefore fixed the time of the
                    re-appearance to the end of the year 1758, or the beginning of 1759. He
                    professed, however, to have made this calculation hastily, or, as he expresses
                    it, <hi rend="italic">levi calamo.</hi><hi rend="italic">(Synopsis of the
                    Astronomy of Comets.)</hi></p>
                <p>The effects both of Jupiter and Saturn on the return of the same comet were
                    afterwards calculated more accurately by Clairaut, who found that it would be
                    retarded 511 days by the action of the former planet, and 100 by the action of
                    the latter; in consequence of which, the return of the comet to its perihelion
                    would be on the 15th of April 1759. He admitted at the same time that he might
                    be out a month in his calculation. The comet actually reached its perihelion on
                    the 13th of March, just 33 days earlier than was predicted; affording, in this
                    way, a very striking verification of the theory of gravity, and the calculation
                    of disturbing forces. The same comet may be expected again about the year
                    1835.</p>
                <p>In some instances, the effect which the planets produce on the motion of comets
                    are far more considerable than in this example. A comet which was observed in
                    1770 had a motion which could not be reconciled to a parabolic orbit, but which
                    could be represented by an elliptic orbit of no great eccentricity, in which it
                    revolved in the space of five years and eight months. This comet, however, which
                    had never been seen in any former revolution, has never been seen in any
                    subsequent one. On tracing the path of this comet, Mr Burckhardt found that
                    between the year 1767 and 1770 it had come very near to Jupiter, and had done so
                    again in 1779. He therefore conjectured, that the action of Jupiter may <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193190095" xml:id="kp-eb0704-0095-0060"/> have so altered
                    the original orbit as to render the comet •for a time visible from the earth;
                    and that the same ' cause may have so changed it, after one revolution, as to
                    restore the comet to the same region in which it had formerly moved. This is the
                    greatest instance of disturbance which has yet been discovered among the bodies
                    of our system, and furnishes a very happy, as well as an unexpected,
                    confirmation of the theory of gravity.</p>
                <p>Though the comets arc so much disturbed by the action of the planets, yet it does
                    not appear that their reaction produces any sensible effect. The comet of 1770
                    came so near to the earth as to have its periodic time increased by 2∙246 days,
                    according to Laplace’s computation; and if it had been equal in mass to the
                    earth it would have augmented the length of the year by not less than two hours
                    and forty-eight minutes. It is certain that no such augmentation took place, and
                    therefore that the disturbing force by which the comet diminished the gravity of
                    the earth is insensible, and the mass of the comet, therefore, less than <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>-⅛θth of the mass of the earth. The same comet also
                    passed through the system of the satellites of Jupiter without causing any
                    derangement of their motions. Hence it is reasonable to conclude, that no
                    material or even sensible alteration has ever been produced in our system by the
                    action of a comet.</p>

                    from their action on one another.</hi></p>
                <p>51. The same resolution of the forces by which one satellite acts upon another,
                    into two, one directed to the centre of the primary, and the other at right
                    angles to it, serves to explain the irregularities which had been observed in
                    their motions, and to reduce under known laws several other inequalities, of
                    which the existence only is indicated by observation.</p>
                <p>An instance of this we have in the very remarkable relation which takes place
                    between the mean motions of the first three satellites; the mean motion of the
                    first satellite, together with twice the mean motion of the third, being equal
                    to three times the mean motion of the second. Laplace has shown that, if the
                    primitive mean motions of these satellites were nearly in this proportion, the
                    mutual action of these bodies on one another must in time have brought about an
                    accurate conformity to it.</p>
                <p>The first satellite moves nearly in the plane of Jupiter’s equator, and has no
                    eccentricity, except what is communicated from the third and fourth, the
                    irregularities of one of these small bodies producing similar irregularities in
                    those that are contiguous to it. The first satellite has, beside, an inequality,
                    chiefly produced by the action of the second, and circumscribed by a period of
                    437∙659 days.</p>
                <p>52. The orbit of the second satellite moves on a fixed plane, to which it is
                    inclined at an angle of 27' 13", and on which its nodes have a retrograde
                    motion, so that they complete a revolution in 29∙914 years. The motion of the
                    nodes of this satellite is one of the principal data used for determining the
                    masses of the satellites themselves, which are so necessary to be known for
                    computing their disturbances. This satellite has no eccentricity but that which
                    it derives from the action of the third and fourth. 1he third satellite moves on
                    a fixed plane, to which it is inclined at an angle of 12' 20", and its nodes
                    make a tropical revolution backwards in 141∙739 years. The equator of Jupiter is
                    inclined to the plane of his orbit at an angle of 3° 5' 30". The fixed planes on
                    which the planes of the orbits move are determined by theory, and could not have
                    been discovered by observation alone.</p>
                <p>The orbit of the third satellite is eccentric, but appears to have two distinct
                    equations of the centre; one which really arises from its own eccentricity, and
                    another which theory shows to be an <hi rend="italic">emanation</hi> from the
                    equation of the centre of the fourth satellite. The first equation is referable
                    to an apsis which has an annual motion of 2° 36' 39" forward in respect of the
                    fixed stars; the second equation is referable to the apsides of the fourth
                    satellite.</p>
                <p>These two equations may be considered as forming one equation of the centre,
                    referable to an apsis that has an irregular motion. The two equations coincided
                    in 1682, and the sum of their <hi rend="italic">maxima</hi> was 13' 16". In 1777
                    the equations were opposed, and their difference was 5' 6".</p>
                <p>The two last inequalities were perceived by Mr Wargentin, by observation alone;
                    but their exact amount, and the law which they observe in their changes, he
                    could not discover. The orbit of the fourth satellite moves on a fixed plane, to
                    which it is inclined at an angle of 14' 58"; and its nodes complete a sidereal
                    revolution backward in 531 years. The fixed plane on which the orbit moves is
                    inclined at an angle of 24' 33" to the equator of Jupiter.; the orbit is
                    sensibly elliptical, and its greater axis has an annual motion of 42' 58"∙7. The
                    motion of this axis is one of the principal data from which the quantities of
                    matter of the different satellites have been determined.</p>
                <p>If the mass of Jupiter be supposed unity, the mass of the 1st satellite =
                    ∙0000173281</p>
                <p>of the 2d = ∙0000232355</p>
                <p>of the 3d = ∙0000884972</p>
                <p>of the 4th = ∙0000426591</p>
                <p>If the mass of the earth be supposed unity, that of the third satellite will be
                    found = ∙027337; and as the mass of the moon is <hi rend="strikethrough"
                    >~ğ.Q</hi><hi rend="subscript strikethrough"> (</hi><hi rend="strikethrough"
                    >ý</hi> — ‘012517, the quantity of matter in the third satellite is about twice
                    as great as that in the moon. The fourth satellite is therefore nearly equal to
                    the moon, the second about one half, and the first somewhat more than one
                    third.</p>
                <p>53. The general result of this investigation concerning the inequalities in the
                    motion of the planets, both primary and secondary, is, that in every one of
                    these orbits two things remain secure against all disturbance, the mean distance
                    and the mean motion, or, which is the same, the transverse axis of the orbit,
                    and the time of the planet’s revolution. Another result is, that all the
                    inequalities in the planetary motions are periodical, and observe such laws that
                    each of them, after a certain time, runs through the same series of changes.
                    This last conclusion follows from the fact, that every inequality is expressed
                    by terms of the form A sin. <hi rend="italic">nt</hi> or A cos. <hi
                    rend="italic">nt,</hi> where A is a constant co-efficient, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> a certain multiplier of <hi rend="italic">t</hi> the time, so that <hi
                    rend="italic">nt</hi> is an arch of a circle, which increases proportionally, to
                    the time. Now, in this expression, though <hi rend="italic">nt</hi> is capable
                    of indefinite increase, yet, since <hi rend="italic">nt</hi> never can exceed
                    the radius, or 1, the maximum of the inequality is A. Accordingly, the value of
                    the term A sin. <hi rend="italic">nt</hi> first increases from 0 to A, and then
                    decreases from A to 0; after which it becomes negative, extends to — A; and
                    passes from thence to 0 again. If, when the inequality was affirmative, it was
                    an addition to the mean motion, when negative it will become a diminution of it;
                    and the sum of all these increments and decrements, after <hi rend="italic"
                    >nt</hi> has passed over an entire circumference, or 360°, is equal to 0; so
                    that at the endof that period the planet is in the same position as if it had
                    moved on regularly all the while at the rate of the mean motion. As this happens
                    to every one of the inequalities, the deviation of the system from its mean
                    state can never go beyond certain limits, each inequality in a certain course of
                    time destroying its own effect.</p>
                <p>It would be far otherwise if into the value of any inequalities a term entered of
                    the form A × <hi rend="italic">nt,</hi> A tan. <hi rend="italic">nt,</hi><pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193190108" xml:id="kp-eb0704-0108-0061"/> A</p>
                <p>—. The inequalities so expressed would continually sin. <hi rend="italic">nt</hi>
                    increase with the time, so as to go beyond any assignable limit, and of
                    consequence to destroy entirely the order of any system to which they
                    belonged.</p>
                <p>Lagrange and Laplace, who discovered and demonstrated that no such terms as these
                    last can enter into the expression of the disturbances which the planets produce
                    by their action on one another, made known one of the most important truths in
                    physical science. They proved that the planetary system is stable, and that it
                    does not involve any principle of destruction in itself, but is calculated to
                    endure for ever, or till the action of an external power shall put a period to
                    its existence. After the knowledge of the principle of gravitation, this may be
                    fairly considered as the greatest discovery to which men have been led by the
                    study of the heavens.</p>
                <p>The accurate compensation, just remarked, depends on three conditions, belonging
                    to the primitive or original constitution of our system, but not necessarily
                    determined, as far as we know, by any physical principle. The first of these
                    conditions is, that the eccentricities of the orbits are all inconsiderable, or
                    contained within very narrow limits, not exceeding in any instance one tenth or
                    one eighth part of the mean distance. The second condition is, that the planets
                    all move an the same direction, or from west to east. This is true both of the
                    primary and secondary planets, with the exception only of the satellites of
                    Uranus, which may be accounted retrograde; but their planes being nearly at
                    right angles to the orbit of their primary, the direction of their motion,
                    whether retrograde or otherwise, can have little effect. Lastly, the planes of
                    the orbits of the planets are not much inclined to one another. This is true of
                    all the larger planets, though it does not hold of some of the new and smaller
                    ones; of which, however, the action on the whole system must be altogether
                    insensible.</p>
                <p>Unless these three conditions were united in the constitution of the solar
                    system, terms of the kind just mentioned, admitting of indefinite increase,
                    might enter into the expression of the inequalities, which would indicate a
                    gradual and unlimited departure from the original order and constitution of the
                    universe. Now, the three conditions just enumerated do not necessarily arise out
                    of the nature of motion, or of gravitation, or from the action of any physical
                    cause with which we are acquainted. Neither can they be considered as arising
                    from chance; for the probability is almost infinite to one, that, without a
                    cause particularly directed to that object, such a conformity could not have
                    arisen in the motions of thirty-one different bodies, scattered over the whole
                    extent of the solar system. <hi rend="italic">The only explanation, therefore,
                    which remains is, that all this is the work of intelligence and design,
                    directing the original constitution of our system, and impressing such motions
                    on the parts as are calculated to give stability to the whole.</hi><hi

                <p>PRACTICAL ASTRONOMY.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">introduction.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Practical
                    Astronomy</hi> may be considered as comprehending the observations which must
                    originally have been made to determine the facts which have now been embodied in
                    a system; also those which are continually making for its farther extension and
                    improvement;—the observations which are required to make the science useful in
                    the affairs of life; and the rules and calculations which must be applied to the
                    observations, to obtain from them the required result.</p>
                <p>The division of labour in this, as in other subjects, has been attended with
                    advantage. One class of astronomers now survey the heavens by telescopes of more
                    or less power. These, within the last fifty years, have enriched the science by
                    the discovery of five new planets in addition to the six known from the most
                    remote ages. The late Sir William Herschel took the lead in this noble labour,
                    and he has been followed by many others. By their exertions various comets have
                    been observed; and the periodic times and orbits of three have now been
                    determined with such certainty as to enable us to predict their return. A second
                    class observe the heavenly bodies with instruments which combine increased
                    powers of seeing, with the means of measuring minute angular distances or
                    considerable angles with great accuracy. The established national observatories,
                    and some private observatories, conducted with not less zeal and intelligence,
                    are engaged in this important labour. These employ transit instruments, clocks,
                    mural or meridian circles, quadrants, equa-toral or azimuth and altitude
                    instruments, of the best workmanship. Their object is less to add new facts than
                    to improve and extend those which are already known.</p>
                <p>By the observations made in observatories, the science is continually advancing
                    towards perfection; but, like all knowledge founded on observation, there will
                    ever be room for further improvement.</p>
                <p>Although it is only a few individuals, comparatively speaking, that can possess
                    telescopes of such power as to give reasonable hopes of extending astronomical
                    knowledge by the discovery of new phenomena, yet, by the liberality of
                    governments, the united efforts of learned bodies, and the fortunate possession
                    of leisure, pecuniary means, and zeal for the improvement of the science evinced
                    by some private gentlemen, telescopes of extraordinary dimensions and excellence
                    have been constructed, and considerable additions have of late years been made
                    to our knowledge of the heavens in regions almost beyond the flight of human
                    imagination.</p>
                <p>The great instruments, such as are placed in national observatories, are also in
                    general beyond the reach of private astronomers; yet a few wealthy amateurs of
                    the science have rivalled these establishments, both in the acquisition of
                    instruments and in their application. With instruments of an inferior
                    construction little can be done towards improving the primary elements of
                    astronomy, because the results they give are less correct and less to be
                    depended on than those obtained by superior instruments. When the measure of an
                    angle is determined to the accuracy of a second, it is of no use to have another
                    measure which may err as much as ten seconds. However, it cannot be doubted that
                    the best instruments now employed will in time be superseded by others more
                    perfect. After a certain degree of accuracy has been obtained, it is only by
                    slow degrees and much labour that we can go beyond it; and then, like
                    differentials of different orders, every <pb break="no" facs="nls:193190121"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-0121-0062"/>addition to the accuracy of a result is small in
                    comparison to that which went before it.</p>
                <p>Another branch of practical astronomy, of no small importance, applies the
                    knowledge which the labour of many years, or even ages, has accumulated, to the
                    improvement of geography, and to navigation, and the wants of society. For this,
                    instruments are also required. These are the portable transit instrument and
                    chronometer; portable azimuth and altitude circles; reflecting and repeating
                    circles; sextants, quadrants, and other minor instruments, down to the
                    convenient garden sun-dial. These instruments are within the reach of ordinary
                    cultivators of astronomy, and they are the most useful, because the advantage
                    they yield is immediate and obvious: for by their aid the exact position on the
                    earth of every point visited by a traveller may be determined; ships may be
                    conducted in safety and with certainty to remote regions; and true time may be
                    ascertained in all places. A third department of practical astronomy may
                    comprehend the calculations required for <hi rend="italic">reducing</hi> the
                    observations made in observatories; that is, in disengaging them from the
                    effects of refraction, parallax, nutation, aberration, instrumental errors,
                    &amp;c. and fitting them for their place in the annals of the science. The time
                    spent in making an observation is in fact often small in comparison to that
                    required for its reduction. The observation is a process purely mechanical,
                    requiring only steady attention, and an expertness in observing a moving body,
                    and in estimating small portions of time by the beat of the clock, which may be
                    acquired by practice. But the reduction requires the application of much
                    theoretical knowledge of the science, and an acquaintance with some of the
                    refinements of modern analysis; at least these must be possessed by the person
                    who frames the rules and directs the operations, although a less degree of
                    knowledge may suffice for the mere numerical calculation.</p>
                <p>The observations of the traveller and navigator require also the application of
                    mathematical science. Plane and spherical trigonometry are indispensable for the
                    intelligent navigator; and the latter of these is required for the simplest
                    observations, such, for example, as are made by a quadrant or sextant, to find
                    true time. It frequently happens that the navigator is deficient in theory,
                    contenting himself with the practice of the calculation of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >lunars,</hi> as he calls observations made to ascertain the distance of the
                    moon from the stars. This is an evil which, we fear, sometimes leads to the loss
                    of many lives and much property.</p>
                <p>Another kind of calculations is required in the construction of Almanacs and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ephemerides.</hi> These are made under the direction of men well
                    versed in the theory, although the mere labour of numerical calculation can be
                    executed by correct arithmeticians according to prescribed rules; and, to insure

                <p>The attentive reader of the preceding treatise will readily understand that much
                    practical astronomy is involved in it; necessarily indeed, for the theory and
                    the practice cannot be entirely disengaged from each other. Thus, it is shown
                    (chap. II. sect. 1.) how the obliquity of the ecliptic may be derived from
                    observations of the sun’s declination on three successive days about the time of
                    the summer solstice; and again, in section 2, a formula is given for finding the
                    eccentricity of the earth’s orbit from the greatest equation of the centre, as
                    determined from observations; also another for determining the true anomaly from
                    the mean: these and various others, in chap. III. and elsewhere, may be regarded
                    as applications of practical astronomy. We shall therefore here only farther
                    give some examples of the more important problems in what may be called
                    spherical astronomy. ' ’</p>
                <p>The important and very general problem of determining what will be the position
                    of any proposed body of the sys-∙ <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> tern at any
                    given time, past or to come, belongs to the division of the subject which we are
                    now treating. Its correct solution, however, requires an apparatus of tables far
                    beyond what can be comprised in the space to which this article must be limited.
                    Even the single case of the moon would require a very considerable number of
                    tables and precepts. Such a body of tables is, however, not necessary even in
                    works professedly on astronomy. The <hi rend="italic">British Nautical
                    Almanac,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Connaissance</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Terns,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Berlin Ephemeris</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(Berliner Astronomisches</hi><hi rend="italic">Jahrbuclι),</hi> are the sources
                    from which the practical astronomer usually derives a knowledge of the phenomena
                    he expects to happen, and for the observation of which he must prepare
                    beforehand. The same observation applies to various other subsidiary tables, of
                    which there are professed collections. One of the most copious is the first of
                    two large volumes, forming a work on practical astronomy, by the Rev. Dr
                    Pearson; this contains tables expressly intended for the reduction of
                    astronomical observations, and many others of great importance to the professed
                    astronomer. There is a smaller collection, entitled <hi rend="italic">Tables to
                    be used with the Nautical Almanac,</hi> by the Rev. W. Lax, professor of
                    astronomy and geometry in the University of Cambridge. This is most essential to
                    the navigator, for whose use also a much larger work was published, viz. <hi
                    rend="italic">A complete Collection of Tables for Navigation and Nautical
                    Astronomy,</hi> by Joseph de Mendoza Rios. There is another and later work,
                    published in 1829 in France, entitled <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles Tables
                    Astronomiques et Hydrographiques,</hi> par V. Bagay, professeur d’hydrographie.
                    This must be valuable to the French navigator; but it is not less so to
                    practical astronomers of all countries, on account of its portable size,
                    considering that it contains a table of logarithmic sines and tangents to every
                    second of the quadrant. We must also notice with much approbation a neat and
                    comprehensive collection of astronomical tables and formulae by Mr Baily, late
                    president of the Astronomical Society of London. This work is chiefly adapted to
                    the practical astronomer on land. There is one part of practical astronomy which
                    at all times has, in a particular manner, excited the attention of mankind; we
                    mean the determination of the exact time of new and full moon, and the
                    prediction of eclipses. To determine these with as much accuracy as is
                    sufficient to gratify ordinary students of practical astronomy, tables have been
                    purposely constructed, and are given in the sequel; with the addition of plain
                    precepts, applicable without any considerable degree of mathematical knowledge.
                    By means of them the young astronomer may find the time of an eclipse of the sun
                    and moon, and exhibit its appearance by a geometrical construction. The places
                    of upwards of 500 fixed stars, and some tables useful in practical astronomy,
                    are also given; and the principal instruments of astronomy are described and
                    exhibited by engravings in the superior style which distinguishes the present
                    from all former editions of this work.</p>

                    declina- ∙tion, meet the ecliptic in Μ; also let ɤE, ɤP, be arcs of great

                    the poles of the ecliptic and equator respectively. Let us now make</p>
                <p>L = ɤM the longitude of S, <hi rend="italic">l</hi> = SM the latitude, <hi

                <p>1∙ Of the various methods which are employed for determining the latitude, that
                    which depends on the observation of the double transits, or upper and lower
                    culmination of a circumpolar star, is perhaps the best, being independent of the
                    star s dcdinatioιτ and of the effects of aberration and nutation. The accuracy
                    of the result depends, indeed, on the allowance made for refraction; but unless
                    the observed star at the lower culmination passes within 15° or 20° of the
                    horizon, the errors of the tables will be very inconsiderable.</p>
                <p>Let Z be the observed zenith distance, and R the refraction of the star at its
                    lower culmination; Z' and R' the same quantities at its upper culmination, and λ
                    the correct zenith distance of the pole, or the co-latitude; then λ = ⅛(Z + Z')
                    + ⅜(R + R').</p>
                <p>The quantities R and R' must be taken from the tables, regard being had to the
                    state of the barometer and thermometer.</p>
                <p>2. Another method of determining the latitude, which, by reason of the facility

                <p>The different methods which have been proposed for the solution of this problem,
                    one of the most difficult in practical astronomy, are the following: Is/, The
                    eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites; 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, the eclipses of the
                    moon; 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, the eclipses of the sun; 4∕A, the occultations
                    of fixed stars by the moon; and, <hi rend="italic">bth,</hi> the comparison of
                    the moon’s transits over the meridian with those of certain fixed stars selected
                    for the purpose. Of these five methods, the two first give results affected by
                    many causes of uncertainty; and the third can seldom be practised, because solar
                    eclipses occur very rarely for any given point on the earth’s surface. Of the
                    remaining two, the last (which is recommended by Mr Baily) seems entitled to the
                    preference, on account of its being independent of great accuracy in the rate of
                    the clock or the position of the transit instrument.</p>

                    .nonagesimal is the point of the ecliptic where that circle intersects the
                    vertical plane passing through its pole. It is consequently the highest point of
                    the ecliptic above the horizon, or 90° from the horizon measured on the
                    ecliptic.</p>
                <p>Let HH' (fig. 129) be the horizon, EO the ecliptic, EQ the equator, Z the zenith,
                    P the pole of the equator, and P' the pole of the ecliptic. The great circle
                    passing through P' and P intersects EO and EQ at right angles in C and D, whence
                    EC = ED — 90° = MQ, and therefore EM = DQ. In like manner PD = 90° — P'C,
                    consequently P'P = CD the obliquity of the ecliptic.</p>
                <p>The great circle PZNI which passes through the pole of the ecliptic and the
                    zenith is a circle of latitude and also a vertical circle; hence the angles at N
                    and I are right angles, and 0 is the pole of PZNI; consequently 01 = ON = 90°.
                    Now since ON = 90°, the point N is the nonagesimal, and its altitude IN = 90° —
                    ZN = ZP' = the complement of the altitude of the pole of the ecliptic, or the
                    co-latitude of the zenith. In like manner its longitude EN = 90° — NC = 90° —
                    ZP'P. Now in order to compute ZP' and the angle ZP'P, we have given, in the
                    triangle ZPP', the side ZP = the co-latitude, PP' = the obliquity, and also the
                    angle ZPP', for ZPP' = 180° — ZPD = 180° — MD = 180° — (ED — EM) = 180° — 90° +
                    EXI = 90° + EM, and EM (which is the right ascension of the zenith, or as it is
                    technically called, the right ascension of the mid-heaven) is given, being equal

                <p>Let A (fig. 129) be the place of the star situated on the vertical ZAR; Eα is its
                    longitude, and P'A the complement of its latitude, or its distance from the pole
                    of the ecliptic. Suppose that, through the effects of parallax, it is depressed
                    from A to B; its longitude then becomes EZ», and its distance from the pole of
                    the ecliptic P'B, so that <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> is the variation in
                    longitude, and P ’ B — PA the variation in latitude, which it is required to

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Problem</hi> XIX.— <hi rend="italic">Given the apparent
                    altitudes of the moon and the sun, or a star, and the apparent distance between
                    them, to find the true distance.</hi></p>
                <p>This is a problem of great importance in Practical Astronomy, because the
                    observed distance between the moon and the sun or a star is the surest means the
                    navigator has to determine his longitude.</p>
                <p>To obtain the apparent distance and altitudes, it is convenient to have three
                    observers: one, the most expert, takes the apparent distance of the limb of the
                    moon from that of the sun, or from the star; another observes the moon’s
                    altitude at the moment of the observation of the distance; and a third takes the
                    star’s altitude. For greater accuracy, these simultaneous operations ought to be
                    repeated several times, and a fourth assistant may, by a good watch, note the
                    intervals of time between them. A mean of the whole will then be obtained, and
                    the corresponding time by the watch, by which the true time at that place will
                    oe nearly known. If there be only one observer, he must take the altitudes
                    immediately before and after the distance, and endeavour to allow for the change
                    of altitude during the time between the observations.</p>
                <p>The observed distance between the limbs of the moon and sun must be increased by
                    their semidiameters to obtain the distance of their centres. If the distance
                    from ä star is taken, because its diameter is insensible, the dis- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> j</hi> tance is to be increased by the moon’s semidiameter
                    only.</p>
                <p>The observed altitudes thus found are affected by parallax and refraction. The
                    moon’s horizontal parallax is given in the <hi rend="italic">Nautical
                    Almanac</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> from this the parallax at the time of
                    observation may be found by Prob. XIV., but the navigator avails himself of aid
                    from <hi rend="italic">The Requisite Tables,</hi> which shorten the process of
                    calculation. The sun’s parallax is almost insensible, but it may be taken into
                    account; that of a star is accounted nothing. The altitudes are diminished by
                    the parallaxes, but they are increased by refraction. The sun’s altitude is more
                    increased by the latter than diminished by the former; but the reverse happens
                    with the moon. At sea the altitudes must be also corrected for the <hi
                    rend="italic">dip of the horizon</hi> (that is, for the height of the observer
                    above the surface of the sea), and the refraction for the height of the
                    thermometer.</p>
                <p>Supposing all this done, let S and Μ be the true places of the sun or star and
                    moon (fig. 130), Z the zenith; because parallax and refraction take place only
                    in vertical circles, the apparent place of the sun, <hi rend="italic">s,</hi>

                <p>From the observed distance, the true distance as it would appear if it could be

                    But the time of observation as reckoned at the ship may be found from the ship’s

                    their polar distances as given by the Almanac. Therefore the difference between

                <p>Hence it appears that in 3 hours the distance of the moon from the sun was
                    increased by 1° 22' 25" = 4595", and that between the time of making the
                    observation, and the 15th hour, Greenwich time, the increase of distance was 0°
                    14' 51" = 891." Now for small intervals the distances will increase nearly as
                    the times, therefore we have 4945": 894":: 3h.: 0h. ∙ 5425 = 32m. 33s.</p>
                <p>Thus it appears that the observation must have been made 32 minutes 33 seconds

                    49", and the sun’s declination, which is given in the Almanac for Greenwich,
                    noon; and from this the declination at the time of the observation is found by
                    making allowance for the difference of longitude and the hour from noon at the
                    ship, both known nearly. The declination thus found is 23° 22' 48" north. The
                    ship’s latitude, 10° 16' 40", is also known. Hence to find the hour angle by

                    not attainable in nautical practice. Delambre says, “even with the best
                    instruments, the most skilful navigators find anomalies for which they cannot
                    account. The lunar tables are in a state of continual improvement, yet we cannot
                    be sure that there is not an error of 20" in a distance, which will produce an
                    error of 40" of time. To this possible error of theory must be joined that of
                    the observation, which may be still greater. The error of the time may therefore
                    amount to 80", which is equivalent to 20', or ⅜d of a degree. This should be the
                    <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi> of the error; and, in general, this degree of
                    accuracy is sufficient. Indeed a greater accuracy than ⅜d or ith of a degree may
                    sometimes be obtained, but still it is uncertain.</p>

                    1. Write out the time of mean new moon in January for the proposed year from
                    Table I., together with the mean anomalies of the moon and sun, and the moon’s
                    mean distance from her ascending node, applying to each of these quantities the
                    secular equation found by its side by addition or subtraction, according as it
                    has the sign + or —. If you want the time of full moon in January, add the
                    half-lunation at the foot of Table IV., with its anomalies, &amp;c. to the
                    former numbers if the new moon falls before the 15th of January; but if it falls
                    after, subtract the half-lunation, with the anomalies, &amp;c. belonging to it,
                    from the former numbers, and write down the respective sums or remainders.</p>
                <p>2. In these additions or subtractions, observe that 60 seconds make a minute, 60
                    minutes make a degree, 30 degrees make a sign, and 12 signs make a circle. When
                    you exceed 12 signs in addition, reject 12, and set down the remainder. When the
                    number of signs to be subtracted is greater than the number you subtract from,
                    add 12 signs to the lesser number, and then you will have a remainder to set
                    down. In the tables, signs are marked S, degrees D, minutes Μ, and seconds
                    S.</p>
                <p>3. When the required new or full moon is in any given month after January, write
                    out from Table IV. such one of the mean lunations, with the anomalies, &amp;c.
                    as, added to the time of mean new or full moon in January, will make the mean
                    new or full moon to fall within the given month, setting them below the number
                    taken out for January.</p>
                <p>4. Add all these together, and in leap-years (which in Table I. have the letter B
                    annexed to them) subtract one day from the time of mean new or full moon when it
                    happens after 28th February. You will then have the time of the required mean
                    new or full moon, with the mean anomalies, and the moon’s mean distance from the
                    ascending node, which are the arguments for finding the proper equations.</p>
                <p>5. With the signs and degrees of the moon’s mean anomaly enter Table V., and
                    therewith take out the first equation for reducing the mean syzigy to the true;
                    taking care to make proportions in the table for the odd minutes and seconds of
                    anomaly, as the table gives the equation only to whole degrees.</p>
                <p>Observe in this and every other case of finding equations, that, if the signs are
                    at the head of the table, their degrees are at the left hand, and are reckoned
                    downwards; the equation being in the body of the table under or over Jhe signs
                    in a collateral line with the degrees. The signs + and — at the head or foot of
                    the tables where the signs are found, show whether the equation is to be added
                    to the time of mean new or full moon, or to be subtracted from it.</p>
                <p>6. With the signs and degrees of the sun’s mean anomaly enter Table VI. and take
                    out the second equation for reducing the time of mean to that of new or full
                    moon, with a proportional part of its secular variation in the column adjoining,
                    corresponding to the number of years elapsed since 1801, the whole variation
                    being adapted for a period of 100 years.</p>
                <p>7. Add together the mean anomalies of the sun and moon, and with the sum enter
                    Table VII. and take out the third equation. For this and the following equations
                    it will be sufficient to compute the arguments to minutes, neglecting the
                    seconds.</p>
                <p>8. Subtract the sun’s mean anomaly from the moon’s mean anomaly, and with the
                    remainder enter Table VIII. and take out the fourth equation.</p>
                <p>9. Subtract the moon’s mean anomaly from twice the moon’s distance from the
                    ascending node, and with the remainder enter Table IX. and take out the fifth
                    equation.</p>
                <p>10. The moon’s mean distance from the ascending node is the argument of Table X.,
                    with which take out the sixth equation.</p>
                <p>11. To twice the moon’s mean anomaly add the sun’s mean anomaly, and with the sum
                    enter Table XI. and take out the seventh equation.</p>
                <p>12. From twice the moon’s mean anomaly subtract the sun’s mean anomaly, and with
                    the remainder enter Table XII. and take out the eighth equation.</p>
                <p>13. These are all the equations for reducing the time of mean new moon to the
                    time of true new moon; but for full moon other two equations are required, the
                    argument for equation ninth being the moon’s mean anomaly, which equation is
                    exhibited in Table XIII.; and the argument of the tenth equation being the sun’s
                    mean anomaly, the equation being exhibited in Table XIV.</p>
                <p>14. Add together the equations which have the sign of addition, and also those
                    which have the sign of subtraction, and subtract the lesser sum from the
                    greater, giving to the remainder the sign of the greater; and add or subtract
                    the remainder, according as its sign denotes, to or from the time of mean new or
                    full moon, and you have the time of true new or full moon required.</p>
                <p>These tables are adapted to the meridian of Greenwich observatory; and for any
                    other place, its longitude in time is to be added to or subtracted from the time
                    given by the tables, according as it is to the east or west of Greenwich, and
                    the time as reckoned at the given place is obtained. The tables begin the day at
                    noon, and reckon forward from thence to the noon following. Thus January the
                    31st, at 22 hours 30 minutes 25 seconds of tabular time, is February 1st (in
                    common reckoning), at 30 minutes 25 seconds after 10 o’clock in the morning. It
                    is to be further observed, that the time obtained from the tables is mean time,
                    or that shown by a well-regulated clock or watch. But to make it agree with
                    solar or apparent time, or that given by a sun-dial, which is necessary in the
                    computation of solar eclipses, you must apply the equation of time contained in
                    Table XXVIII. as afterwards directed.</p>
                <p>The method of calculating the time of any new or full moon, without the limits of
                    the nineteenth century, will be shown farther on; and a few examples compared
                    with the precepts will make the whole work plain.</p>

                    on the left hand of CH, the axis of the ecliptic; then draw CM for the axis of
                    the moon’s orbit, and take the moon’s latitude 26' 2" from the scale CA in your
                    compasses, and set it from C to <hi rend="italic">y</hi> in the line CH, and

                    make marks along the path of the penumbra’s centre, and divide each space from
                    mark to mark into 60 equal parts or horary minutes by dots; and set the hours to
                    every 60th minute in such a manner that the dot signifying the instant of new
                    moon by the tables may fall into the point Z, half-way between the axis of the
                    moon’s orbit and the axis of the ecliptic; and then the rest of the dots will
                    show the points of the earth’s disk, where the penumbra’s centre is at the
                    instants denoted by them in its transit over the earth.</p>
                <p>Apply one side of a square to the line of the penumbra’s path, and move the

                    path of the penumbra’s centre; and the particular minute or instant so pointed
                    out is the instant of the greatest obscuration of the sun, at the place for
                    which the construction is made, namely, Edinburgh in the present example.</p>

                <p>Take the sun’s semidiameter, 15' 51", in your compasses, from the scale CA, and
                    setting one foot on the path of Edinburgh, at the point answering to the instant
                    of the greatest obscuration, namely, at 2∣∙ minutes past three, with the other
                    foot describe the circle UY, which represents the sun’s disk as seen from
                    Edinburgh at the greatest obscuration. Then take the moon’s semidiameter, 14'
                    50", in your compasses, from the same scale, and setting one foot on the path of
                    the penumbra’s centre at the point 2⅜ minutes past three, describe the circle TX

                    moon’s will show the quantity of the eclipse at that time; which quantity may be
                    measured on a line equal to the sun’s diameter, and divided into 12 equal parts
                    for digits. As the moon’s disk is entirely contained within the sun’s, the
                    eclipse as seen from Edinburgh will be annular.</p>
                <p>Lastly, take the sum of the semidiameters of the sun and moon, 30' 41", from the
                    scale CA, in your compasses; and setting one foot in the line of the penumbra’s
                    centre path, on the left hand from the axis of the ecliptic, direct the other
                    foot toward the path of Edinburgh, and carry that extent backwards and forwards
                    till both the points of the compasses fall into the same instants in both the
                    paths, and these instants will denote the time when the eclipse begins at
                    Edinburgh. Then do the like on the right hand of the axis of the ecliptic; and
                    where the points of the compasses fall into the same instants in both the paths,
                    they will show at what time the eclipse ends at Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>These trials give 35∣ minutes after one in the afternoon for the beginning of the
                    eclipse at Edinburgh at the points N and 0, 2⅛ minutes after three for the time

                <p>Draw the line ACB for part of the ecliptic, and CD perpendicular thereto for the
                    northern part of its axis, the moon having north latitude. (Plate XCIV. fig.

                <p>Add the semidiameters of the moon’s and earth’s shadow together, which in the
                    eclipse make 61' 16"; and take this in your compasses, from a scale of equal
                    parts, and setting one foot on the point C as a centre, with the other foot
                    describe the arch ADB, in one point of which the moon’s centre will be at the
                    beginning of the eclipse, and in another at the end thereof.</p>
                <p>Take the semidiameter of the earth’s shadow, 44' 57", in your compasses, from the
                    scale, and setting one foot in the centre C, with the other foot describe the
                    semicircle KLM for the northern half of the earth’s shadow; because the moon’s
                    latitude is north in this eclipse.</p>
                <p>Subtract the semidiameter of the moon from the semidiameter of the earth’s

                    scale, and setting one foot on the point C as a centre, with the other foot
                    describe the arch OPQ; in one point of which the moon’s centre will be at the
                    beginning of total darkness, and in another at the end thereof.</p>
                <p>Draw the line CE on the left hand of the northern axis of the ecliptic, and

                    the axis of the moon’s orbit, the moon’s latitude being north.</p>
                <p>Take the moon’s latitude, 2' 6", from the scale with your compasses, and set it
                    from C to G in the axis of the ecliptic, and through the point G draw the

                    path of the moon’s centre. Then F, in the line CE, is the point in the earth’s
                    shadow where the moon’s centre is at the middle of the eclipse; G, the point
                    where her centre is at the instant of her ecliptical conjunction; and the middle
                    between them, the point where her centre is at the time of true full moon by the
                    tables.</p>
                <p>Take the moon’s horary motion from the sun, 33' 58", in your compasses, from the
                    scale, and with that extent make marks along the line of the moon’s path; then
                    divide each space from mark to mark into 60 equal parts or horary minutes, and
                    set the hours to the proper dots, in such a manner, that the dot signifying the

                    the points F and G.</p>
                <p>The point U, where the moon’s path intersects on the right hand the arch
                    described with the sum of the semidiameters of the moon and earth’s shadow,
                    denotes the instant when the eclipse begins, namely, at 52 minutes after eight;
                    the point T, where the moon’s path intersects on the right hand the arch
                    described, with the difference of the semidiameters, denotes the instant when
                    the moon’s total darkness begins, namely, at 48 minutes after nine; the point F
                    denotes the middle of the eclipse at 39 minutes after 10; the point S, where the
                    moon’s path intersects on the left hand the arch described, with the difference
                    of the semidiameters, denotes the end of the moon’s total darkness at 30 minutes
                    after eleven; and the point R, where the moon’s path intersects the arch
                    described, with the sum of the semidiameters, denotes the end of the eclipse at
                    26 minutes after 12, all mean time according to the meridian of Greenwich. If
                    the times reckoned by any other meridian are required, apply the longitude from
                    Greenwich to the Greenwich times, by addition or subtraction, according as the
                    place is east or west of Greenwich.</p>
                <p>On F as a centre, with a radius equal to the moon’s semidiameter, describe a
                    circle which represents the moon’s disk at the middle of the eclipse.</p>
                <p>The line VX denotes the quantity eclipsed at the middle of the eclipse, which may
                    be measured on a line equal to the moon’s diameter, and divided into equal parts
                    for digits. In the present case, the eclipse being total, the quantity eclipsed
                    is said to be greater than the moon’s diameter, and is found to be 21∣
                    digits.</p>

                <p>The preceding catalogue has been selected from one containing the approximate
                    right ascensions and north polar distances of 720 stars, from observations made
                    with two microscopes. This, however, is considered by the astronomer royal, Mr
                    Pond, only as a first approximation to a more perfect catalogue, which is now
                    forming at Greenwich, from observations made with two mural circles and six
                    microscopes. A German astronomer, Bode, has published a catalogue of 17,240
                    stars, with their right ascensions and declinations, as a sequel to his <hi
                    rend="italic">Uranogra-</hi><hi rend="italic">phia,</hi> which exhibits engraved
                    figures of the constellations. The Memoirs of the Astronomical Society of London
                    contain a catalogue of nearly 3000 stars, with accompanying tables, by Mr Baily,
                    who has stated every particular relating to it in a most elaborate preface. This
                    is fully adequate to the wants of practical astronomers: but the principal
                    astronomers in Europe have undertaken a survey of the heavens, in which each has
                    chosen a section; and the completion of the labour will farther advance this
                    part of the science.</p>

                <p>The reduction of sidereal to solar time is constantly wanted in the solution of
                    the following important problem in Practical Astronomy, viz.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To find the mean solar hour when any star in the preceding
                    catalogue will be on the meridian at a given place, on a given day, in a given
                    year.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Solution</hi> —The right ascension of the star at
                    the given time is the sidereal hour of its transit. The sun’s R. A. in the
                    Nautical Almanac, for the given time, is the sidereal hour of its transit at
                    Greenwich on that day; from this, and the longitude of the given place, the
                    sun’s R. A., that is, the sidereal hour of its transit at that place, may be
                    found. Then the sidereal interval between the sun’s transit and that of the star
                    will be the difference between the R. A. of the star and that of the sun. This
                    converted into solar time will give the mean solar interval between the sun’s
                    transit and that of the star: to this the equation of time must be applied, and
                    the result will be the hour of the star’s transit reckoned from mean moon.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Example.</hi> —At what hour will α Aquilae pass the meridian
                    of Edinburgh on 1st October 1831?</p>
                <p>The proposed time is about 1^ year after the epoch of the catalogue. The
                    correction for change of R. A. by precession will therefore be + 2 <hi

                    Greenwich, and corresponding to this, the change in the sun’s R. A. will be 1

                <p>Time of star’s transit 7 ∙3 30∙2</p>

                    the R. A. of the star for aberration and nutation; but these are too small to be

                </table>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Explanation of the Table of Refractions.</hi></p>
                <p>This table is computed upon principles explained by the late Dr Young in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1819; and it appears to agree
                    more perfectly with the latest observations than any other table before
                    published.</p>
                <p>The apparent altitude being found in the first column, the second shows the
                    refraction when the barometer stands at 30 inches, which is its mean height on
                    the level of the sea, and the thermometer at 50° of Fahrenheit. The third column
                    contains the difference to be subtracted or added for every minute of altitude,
                    reckoned from the nearest number in the first column. The fourth shows the
                    number of seconds to be added for every inch that the height of the barometer
                    exceeds 30, or to be subtracted for each inch that it wants of 30: and the last
                    contains the number of seconds to be subtracted for each degree that the
                    thermometer stands above 50°, or to be added for each degree that its height
                    wants of 50°.</p>
                <p>If great accuracy be required, we must also deduct from the observed height of
                    the barometer ∙003 inch for each degree that the thermometer near it is above
                    50°, and add an equal quantity for an equal depression. In fact, however, the
                    table, as it now stands, is found to require the temperature to be estimated
                    from the height of the thermometer within; and if we employed the height of the
                    thermometer without, which would be more consistent with the theory, it would
                    probably be necessary to suppose the standard temperature of the table 48° only
                    (or rather 47°), instead of 50".</p>
