                <p><label type="entry">ARMENIA</label>, a country of Asia, anciently divided into
                    Armenia Major and Minor. Armenia Major was bounded on the south by Mesopotamia,
                    on the east by Media, on the north by Iberia and Albania, and on the west by the
                    Euphrates. The most considerable cities were Artaxata, Tigranocerta, and
                    Theodosiopolis. Armenia Minor was bounded on the east by the Euphrates; on the
                    south by Mount Taurus, which separated it from Cilicia; on the west and north by
                    a long chain of mountains, called in different places <hi rend="italic">Mons
                    Scordiscus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Amanus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antitaurus,</hi> by which it was separated from Cappadocia.</p>
                <p>Armenia is said to have been very early advanced to the rank of a kingdom.
                    Berosus makes one Sytha the first founder of this monarchy, whose successor
                    Bardanes, he says, was driven out by Ninus, king of Assyria. The Armenians were
                    in course of time subdued by the Medes, to whom Astyages made them tributaries,
                    but allowed them to be governed by their own kings; but on the dissolution of
                    the Median empire by Cyrus, the kingdom was reduced to the form of a province,
                    and they were governed by Persian prefects or lieutenants. On the destruction of
                    the Persian empire by Alexander the Great, Armenia fell into the hands of the
                    Macedonians, to whom it continued subject till the beginning of the reign of
                    Antiochus the Great. This prince having appointed two prefects, named Zadriades
                    and Artaxias, to govern Armenia, they excited the people to a revolt, and caused
                    themselves to be proclaimed kings of the provinces over which they presided.
                    Antiochus being then very young, they succeeded beyond their expectation, which
                    encouraged them to attempt the enlargement of their territories. Accordingly,
                    invading the neighbouring countries, they took from the Medes the provinces of
                    Caspiana, Phaunitis, and Basoropida; from the Iberians, Chorzena and Gogorena on
                    the other side of the Cyrus; from the Chalybes and Mossynaeci, the provinces of
                    Pareneta and Herexena, which bordered on Armenia Minor. On this occasion the
                    division of the kingdom into Armenia Major and Minor first tpok place. Artaxias
                    became king of Armenia Major, and Zadriades of Armenia Minor; and this
                    distinction subsisted to later times.</p>
                <p>By whom Artaxias was succeeded is not known; neither have we any account of the
                    transactions of his reign, farther than that Antiochus led a powerful army
                    against him and Zadriades, but without being able to recover a single province.
                    Upon this he concluded a peace, designing tø fall upon them at a proper
                    opportunity; but they having entered into alliance with the Romans, by that
                    means secured themselves in the possession of their kingdom. After this Artaxias
                    was defeated and taken prisoner by Antiochus Epiphanes, but seems to have been
                    restored to his kingdom.</p>
                <p>From this time we meet with a chasm in the Armenian history for 70 years, during
                    which all we know is, that Tigranes, the king’s son, was delivered up as an
                    hostage to the Parthians. On the news of his father’s death, the Parthians set
                    the young king at liberty, having first obliged him to give up a considerable
                    part of his kingdom by way of ransom. Tigranes, thus restored to his father’s
                    kingdom, was prevailed upon in the beginning of his reign to enter into an
                    alliance with Mithridates Eupator against the Romans, whose power began to give
                    jealousy to all the princes of Asia. By their joint arms Cappadocia was
                    conquered, and the son of Mithridates placed on the throne. Shortly after, the
                    Syrians being harassed with a long and intestine war of the Seleucidae, invited
                    Tigranes to come and take possession of their country; which he accordingly did,
                    and kept it for 18 years, till he was driven out by Pompey, and Syria reduced to
                    the form of a Roman province. Encouraged by this success, he next invaded
                    Armenia Minor, defeated and killed King Artanes, who opposed him with a
                    considerable army; and in one campaign made himself master of the whole kingdom.
                    From Armenia Minor he marched against the Asiatic Greeks, the Adiabenians, the
                    Assyrians, and the Gordians, carrying all before him, and obliging the people
                    wherever he came to acknowledge him sovereign. From this second expedition he
                    returned home loaded with booty, which he soon after increased by the spoils of
                    Cappadocia, invading that kingdom a second time at the instance of Mithridates,
                    who had been obliged by the Romans to withdraw his forces from thence. From
                    Cappadocia, Tigranes, besides other booty, brought back into Armenia no fewer
                    than 300,000 captives, having surrounded the country with his numerous forces in
                    such a manner that none could escape. These, together with the prisoners he had
                    taken in his two first expeditions, he employed in building the city of
                    Tigranocerta, which they afterwards peopled.</p>
                <p>In the mean time Mithridates, who had concluded a peace with the Romans for no
                    other end than to gain time, sent a solemn embassy to Tigranes, inviting him to
                    enter into a second alliance against the common enemy. This he at first
                    declined; but in the end was prevailed upon by his wife Cleopatra to send him
                    considerable supplies, though he never came heartily into the war, not caring to
                    provoke the Romans, who on their part kept fair with him, taking no notice for
                    the present of the supplies he had sent Mithridates. That unfortunate prince
                    being soon after defeated by Lucullus, was forced to fly for shelter into
                    Armenia, where he met with a very cold reception from his son-in-law, who would
                    neither see him, treat with him, nor own him as his relation; however, he
                    promised to protect his person, and allowed him in one of his castles a princely
                    retinue, and a table suitable to his former condition.</p>
                <p>Though this total overthrow of Mithridates might have opened the eyes of
                    Tigranes, and made him oppose with all his might the growing power of the
                    Romans, he fool-ĩshly<pb break="no" facs="nls:193103036"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-3036-0575"/> left them to finish their conquest of Pontus,
                    while he marched at the head of a very numerous army against the Parthians, with
                    a design to recover from them the dominions they had formerly extorted from him
                    before they set him at liberty. These he easily retook; and, not satisfied with
                    what formerly belonged to him, he added to them all Mesopotamia, the countries
                    that lay about Ninus and Arbela, and the fruitful province of Mygdonia; the
                    Parthians, though at that time a mighty people, flying everywhere before him.
                    From Mesopotamia Tigranes marched into Syria to quell a rebellion which had been
                    raised by Cleopatra, surnamed <hi rend="italic">Selene</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> who, after the death of her husband Antiocffus Pius, reigned jointly
                    with her sons in that part of Syria which Tigranes had not seized on. The
                    malcontents were quickly reduced; and the queen herself was taken prisoner, and
                    confined to the castle of Seleucia, where she was soon after put to death by the
                    king’s orders. From Syria Tigranes passed into Phoenicia, which he subdued
                    either entirely or in great part, spreading far and wide the terror of his arms,
                    insomuch that all the princes of Asia, except those who were in alliance with
                    the Romans, either in person or by their deputies submitted and paid homage to
                    the conqueror.</p>
                <p>• The king having now subdued all Syria to the borders of Egypt, and being elated
                    with a long course of victories and prosperous events, began to look upon
                    himself as far above the level of other crowned heads. He assumed the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">king of kings,</hi> and had many kings waiting upon him as
                    menial servants. He never appeared on horseback without the attendance of four
                    kings dressed in livery, who ran by his horse; and when he gave answers to the
                    nations that applied to him, the ambassadors stood on either side of the throne
                    with their hands clasped together, that attitude being of all others then
                    accounted among the orientals the greatest acknowledgment of vassalage and
                    servitude. In the midst of all this haughtiness, however, he was unexpectedly
                    visited by an ambassador from Lucullus the Roman general, who, without any
                    ceremony, told him, that he came to demand Mithridates king of Pontus, who had
                    taken refuge in his dominions, and, in case of his refusal, to declare war
                    against him. Notwithstanding his high opinion of himself, Tigranes returned a
                    mild answer to this message, in which, however, he refused to deliver up his
                    father-in-law; and being highly provoked at Lucullus for not giving him the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">king of kings</hi> in his letter, he did not even
                    bestow upon him the title of <hi rend="italic">general</hi> in his answer. He
                    now received with the greatest pomp imaginable his father-in-law Mithridates,
                    whom till that time he had not admitted into his presence, though he had resided
                    a year and eight months in his dominions. They had several private conferences;
                    and at last Mithridates was sent back to Pontus with 10,000 horse, to raise
                    there what disturbances he could.</p>
                <p>Lucullus, on the other hand, hearing the king’s resolution to protect
                    Mithridates, immediately began his march for Armenia, at the head of only two
                    legions of foot and 3000 horse, having left 6000 men in Pontus to keep that
                    country quiet. Having passed the Euphrates without opposition, he detached two
                    parties; one to besiege a city where he heard that Tigranes’s treasure and
                    concubines were kept; and the other, under Sextilius, to block up Tigranocerta,
                    in order to draw the king to a battle. But Tigranes, after having put to death
                    the scout that brought him the first intelligence of the approach of the Romans,
                    made towards Mount Taurus, which he had appointed for the place of the general
                    rendezvous. The Roman general then despatched Muraena in pursuit of the king;
                    and having overtaken him in a narrow pass, defeated him, and, besides all the
                    baggage, carried off a great many prisoners, the king himself having fled in the
                    beginning of the skirmish. After this he sent out several parties to scour the
                    country, in order to prevent the innumerable forces of Tigranes from joining
                    into one body. This, however, he was not able to effect: Tigranes was joined by
                    such numbers of Gordians, Medes, Adiabenians, Albanians, Iberians, &amp;c. that
                    before he left Mount Taurus, his army consisted, according to Plutarch, of
                    150,000 foot armed <hi rend="italic">cap-a-pie,</hi> 35,000 pioneers, 20,000
                    archers and slingers, and 55,000 horse.</p>
                <p>Lucullus was so far from being dismayed at this formidable army, that the only
                    fear he had was lest the king should follow the advice of Mithridates, which
                    was, not to engage the Romans, but, by ravaging the country, distress them for
                    want of provisions. In order to draw him to a battle, therefore, he formed the
                    siege of Tigranocerta, imagining that Tigranes would never suffer that fine city
                    to be taken without making an attempt to relieve it. The event fully answered
                    his expectations: Tigranes having called a council of war, it was unanimously
                    resolved to attack the Romans; and Taxilis, whom Mithridates sent to dissuade
                    the king from venturing a battle, was in danger of losing his head on account of
                    the advice he gave. The Roman general finding Tigranes disposed to come to an
                    engagement, left Muraena with 6000 men to carry on the siege, while he himself
                    marched against the king’s vast army with only 10,000 men according to some, and
                    the highest computations make them no more than 18,000. The Romans were at first
                    greatly disheartened; but beipg encouraged by Lucullus, they immediately broke
                    the Armenian army, who betook themselves to flight almost at the first onset.
                    The Romans pursued them till night, making a most terrible slaughter. Plutarch
                    informs us, that of the Armenians 100,000 foot were killed, and that very few of
                    the cavalry escaped; whereas of the Romans only five men were killed and 100
                    wounded. Antiochus the philosopher, mentioning this battle, says that the sun
                    never beheld the like; and Livy, that the Romans never fought to such a
                    disadvantage, the conquerors not amounting to a twentieth part of the conquered.
                    Tigranes in his flight having met with his son in as forlorn a condition as
                    himself, resigned to him his royal robes and diadem, desiring him to shift for
                    himself and save those royal ensigns. The young prince delivered them to a
                    trusty friend, who, being taken by the Romans, consigned them to Lucullus.</p>
                <p>While the king was making his escape after this terrible overthrow, he was met by
                    Mithridates, who was marching to his assistance at the head of a considerable
                    army. The king of Pontus cheered up his son-in-law as well as he could, and
                    encouraged him to continue the war; advising him, instead of fruitlessly
                    bewailing the present* disaster, to rally his troops, raise new supplies, and
                    renew the war, not questioning but that in another campaign he might repair all
                    the losses he had sustained: but while the two kings were consulting upon these
                    matters, Lucullus made himself master of Tigranocerta. From this city he marched
                    into the small kingdom of Gordyene, where he celebrated with the utmost pomp the
                    obsequies of king Zarbienus, whom Tigranes had put to death, lighting the
                    funeral pile with his own hand. In this kingdom, besides immense sums of gold
                    and silver, he met with such store of provisions as enabled him to carry on the
                    war without putting the republic to any charge.</p>
                <p>The two kings, having levied new forces, appointed their troops to rendezvous in
                    the spacious plains on the other side of Mount Taurus; whereupon Lucullus
                    leaving Gordyene, and passing by Mount Taurus, encamped close by the enemy.
                    Several skirmishes happened for some time between the two armies without any
                    considerable advantage; but Lucullus could by no means draw them <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193103049" xml:id="kp-eb0703-3049-0576"/>to a general engagement. Upon
                    this he decamped, as if he designed to march to Artaxata and lay siege to that
                    place, where Tigranes had left his wife and children, with great part of his
                    treasures. He had scarce formed his camp when the enemy appeared, and sat down
                    close by him. Lucullus did not allow them to fortify their camp, but immediately
                    attacked them, and having put them to flight after a faint resistance, pursued
                    them all night with great slaughter, took most of the chief officers prisoners,
                    and returned the next day loaded with booty.</p>
                <p>The Roman soldiers now, finding the cold very severe, though it was no later in
                    the year than the autumnal equinox, requested their general to allow them to
                    retire into winter quarters. This request he rejected with indignation, upon
                    which they mutinied. Lucullus did all he could to persuade them to continue in
                    their duty; and prevailed so far that they consented to lay siege to Nisibis, in
                    hopes of booty. This place they took; and Lucullus, to the great satisfaction of
                    his troops, took up his winter quarters there. The next year, however, his
                    forces again mutinied, accusing him of amassing immense wealth for himself; and,
                    throwing their empty purses at his feet, told him, that as he enriched himself
                    alone, he might carry on the war by himself. He endeavoured to appease them as
                    much as possible; but the sedition being fomented by a party who favoured Pompey
                    the Great, at that time aspiring to the command of Lucullus’s army, the latter
                    found himself obliged to sit still and see Mithridates and Tigranes overrun
                    Cappadocia, and recover all Armenia and great part of Pontus. They would have
                    gained much greater advantages, had not a son of Tigranes taken arms against his
                    father, and obliged him to divide his troops. The father and son coming to a
                    pitched battle, the latter was defeated, and forced to save himself in Parthia,
                    where he persuaded Phraates, king of that country, to assist him with a numerous
                    army against his father. Phraates having laid siege to Artaxata, Tigranes the
                    elder was obliged to hide himself in the mountainous parts of his kingdom; upon
                    which the king of Parthia returned home. Of this Tigranes the father being
                    apprised, immediately abandoned the fastnesses of the mountains; and falling
                    upon his son at Artaxata, dispersed the rebels with great slaughter, and entered
                    his metropolis in triumph. Tigranes the son first fled to Mithridates; but
                    finding him reduced to great straits, having been overcome a few days before,
                    with the loss of 40,000 men, by Pompey, he went over to the Romans, and led them
                    into Armenia against his father as an ally of Mithridates.</p>
                <p>Tigranes being now thoroughly humbled, willingly yielded to the Romans,
                    Cappadocia, Syria, Cilicia, and that part of Phoenicia which he possessed,
                    contenting himself with his paternal kingdom; and not only paid the fine of 6000
                    talents laid upon him, but made large presents to Pompey, and all the officers
                    of his army, which procured him the title of <hi rend="italic">the friend and
                    ally of the Roman people.</hi> He afterwards entered into a war with Phraates,
                    king of Parthia, by whom he was overcome, and would have been driven out of his
                    kingdom, had not a peace been brought about by the mediation of Pompey. He ever
                    after cultivated a strict friendship with the Romans. He died in the 85th year
                    of his age, and was succeeded by his son Artuasdes, called by Josephus <hi
                    rend="italic">Artabazes,</hi> by Orosius <hi rend="italic">Ar-tabanes,</hi> and
                    by others <hi rend="italic">Artoadistes.</hi></p>
                <p>From this period to the time of Trajan, Armenia was governed by its own kings;
                    but as they were plainly vassals to the Romans, though they did not take that
                    title till the reign of the emperor Nero, their history falls to be considered
                    under that of the Romans.</p>
                <p>By Trajan the kingdom of Armenia Major was reduced to the form of a Roman
                    province; but it soon recovered its liberty, and was again governed by its own
                    kings in the reigns of Constantine the Great and his successor, to whom the
                    kings of Armenia were feudatories. In the reign of Justin II. the Saracens
                    subdued and held it till the irruption of the Turks, who possessed themselves of
                    this kingdom, and gave it the name of <hi rend="italic">Turcomania.</hi> The
                    Turks, after the reduction of Armenia, invaded Persia, and other countries
                    subject to the emperors of the East; which gave the Armenians an opportunity of
                    shaking off the Turkish yoke, and setting up kings of their own, by whom they
                    were governed till the country was again subdued by Occadan, or, as some style
                    him, <hi rend="italic">Heccatα,</hi> the son of Genghis, and first khan off the
                    Tartars. The Armenians were still permitted, however, to have kings of their
                    own; for in our chronicles we find mention made of Leo, king of Armenia, who in
                    the reign of Richard II. came into England to sue for aid against the Turks, by
                    whom he had been driven from his kingdom. In the year 1472 of the Christian era,
                    Ussan Cassanes, king of Armenia, succeeding to the crown of Persia, made Armenia
                    a province of that empire; in which state it continued till the year 1522, when
                    it was subdued by Selim IL, and made a province of the Turkish empire.</p>
                <p>Respecting Armenia Minor, we find very little recorded, except what has been
                    already mentioned, and what falls under the Roman history. It was made a Roman
                    province by Vespasian, continued so till the division of the empire, when it was
                    subjected to the emperors of the East; and, on the decline of their power, was
                    subdued, first by the Persians, and afterwards by the Turks, who gave it the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Genech,</hi> and have kept it ever since.</p>
                <p>Modern Armenia comprises the greater part of the Ar-? menia Major of the
                    ancients, and is bounded on the norths by Georgia and Mingrelia, on the west by
                    the Euphrates, and on the south and east by the territories of Julamerick and
                    the Persian province of Azerbijan. It is divided among the Turks, Persians, and
                    Kurds, though their territorial rights are not very distinctly defined; nor
                    would it be possible to bind down the wandering tribes of Kurds to any fixed
                    limits. The Turkish pachalics are, Erzeroum, Akiska, Khars, Bayazid, Moosh, and
                    Diarbekir. Those pachalics are divided into districts. The country is
                    mountainous; but the mountains are finely wooded, and are interspersed with
                    extensive plains and beautiful valleys, which yield every kind of grain, and
                    abundance of the most delicious fruits, such as grapes, olives, oranges,
                    peaches, apricos, nectarines, mulberries, walnuts, melons, apples, and pears.
                    Those fertile regions are watered by the Araxes, as well as by the Euphrates and
                    Tigris, and by their numerous tributary streams, and present all the varieties
                    of beautiful scenery which arise from the combination of wood, water, and
                    mountains. Wax and honey are obtained in the mountains, as well as raw silk,
                    hemp, cotton, and tobacco, which are exported to Constantinople and Russia.
                    Manna is also produced in sufficient quantities to be exported. The mineral
                    productions are, silver, copper, loadstone, saltpetre, sulphur, and bitumen.
                    Wheat and barley are the two crops most extensively cultivated; and of these
                    three successive crops maybe obtained in two years. The principal manufactures
                    and trade of this country consist in copper and iron, silk and cotton, wine,
                    tobacco, and manna. The native Armenians are industrious and commercial in their
                    habits, and evince a strong propensity to visit foreign countries. They form the
                    commercial class in the Persian empire, as well as in Asiatic Turkey; and they
                    are scattered in various other parts of the world, where they are engaged in
                    extensive mercantile enterprises, and bear uniformly a high character for
                    integrity in their dealings. The country contains several barbarous tribes, who
                    are ruled by their own <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103062"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-3062-0577"/>independent chiefs, and who are addicted to
                    plunder rather than to trade. Armenia contains several large towns, such as
                    Erzeroum, with a population of 100,000; Diarbekir, Επί van,Van, population
                    50,000; besides others of inferior note, as Bayazid, Argish, and Betlis. Besides
                    its numerous rivers, Armenia contains the great lake Van, the Arsisa of the
                    ancients, which is 168 miles in circumference.</p>
