                    his musical improvements, lived in the 13th century. He was a native of Arezzo,
                    a city in Tuscany; and having been taught the practice of music in his youth,
                    and being probably retained as a chorister in the service of the Benedictine
                    monastery founded in that city, he became a monk professed, and a brother of the
                    order of St Benedict.</p>
                <p>In this retirement he seems to have devoted himself to the study of music,
                    particularly the system of the ancients, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193101801"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-1801-0480"/>and, above all, to reform their method of
                    notation. The difficulties that attended the instruction of youth in the church
                    offices were so great, that, as he himself says, ten years were generally
                    consumed barely in acquiring the knowledge of the plain song; and this
                    consideration induced him to labour after some amendment,—some method that might
                    facilitate instruction, and enable those employed in the choral office to
                    perform the duties of it in a correct and decent manner. Were we to credit those
                    legendary accounts that are extant in old monkish manuscripts, we should believe
                    he was assisted in his pious intention by immediate communications from heaven.
                    Some speak of the invention of the syllables as the effect of inspiration; and
                    Guido himself seems to have been of the same opinion, by his saying it was
                    revealed to him by the Lord, or, as some interpret his words, in a dream. Graver
                    historians say, that being at vespers in the chapel of his monastery, it
                    happened that one of the offices appointed for that day was the hymn to St
                    John,—</p>

                <p>During the performance of the hymn, he remarked the iteration of the words, and
                    the frequent returns of uτ, <hi rend="smallcaps">re, mi, fa, sol, la.</hi> He
                    observed likewise a dissimilarity between the closeness of the syllable <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">mi</hi> and broad open sound of <hi rend="smallcaps">fa,</hi>
                    which, he thought, could not fail to impress upon the mind a lasting idea of
                    their congruity; and immediately conceived a thought of applying these six
                    syllables to perfect an improvement either then actually made by him, or under
                    consideration, viz. that of converting the ancient tetrachords into
                    hexachords.</p>
                <p>Struck with the discovery, he retired to his study, and having perfected his
                    system, began to introduce it into practice. The persons to whom fie
                    communicated it were the brethren of his own monastery, from whom it met with
                    but a cold reception, which he ascribed to envy. However, his interest with the
                    abbot, and his employment in the chapel, gave him an opportunity of trying the
                    efficacy of his method on the boys who were training up for the choral service,
                    and it exceeded the most sanguine expectation. “To the admiration of all,” says
                    Cardinal Baronius, “a boy thereby learnt, in a few months, what no man, though
                    of great ingenuity, could before that attain in several years.”</p>
                <p>The fame of Guido’s invention soon spread abroad, and his method of instruction
                    was adopted by the clergy of other countries. We are told by Kircher, that
                    Herman-nus, bishop of Hamburg, and Elviricus, bishop of Osnaburg, made use of
                    it; and by the authors of the <hi rend="italic">Histoire Littéraire de la
                    France,</hi> that it was received in that country, and taught in all the
                    monasteries in the kingdom. It is certain that the reputation of his great skill
                    in music had excited in the pope a desire to see and converse with him; of
                    which, and of his going to Rome for that purpose, and the reception he met with
                    from the pontiff, he himself has given a circumstantial account in the epistle
                    hereafter mentioned.</p>
                <p>It seems that John XX., or, as some writers compute, the nineteenth, pope of that
                    name, having heard of the fame of Guido s school, and conceiving a desire to see
                    him, sent three messengers to invite him to Rome. Upon their arrival, it was
                    resolved by the brethren of the monastery that he should go thither attended by
                    Grimaldo the abbot, and Peter the chief of the canons of the church of Arezzo.
                    Arriving at Rome, he was presented to the holy father, and by him received with
                    great kindness. The pope had several conversations with him, in all which he
                    interrogated him as to his knowledge in music; and upon sight of an antiphonary
                    which Guido had brought with him, marked with the syllables agreeable to his new
                    invention, the pope looked upon it as a kind of prodigy, and ruminating on the
                    doctrines delivered by Guido, would not stir from his seat till he had learned
                    perfectly to sing off a verse; upon which he declared that he could not have
                    believed the efficacy of the method, if he had not been convinced by the
                    experiment he had himself made of it. The pope would have detained him at Rome;
                    but labouring under a bodily disorder, and fearing an injury to his health from
                    the air of the place, and the heats of the summer, which was then approaching,
                    Guido left that city upon a promise to revisit it, and explain to his holiness
                    the principles of his new system. On his return homewards he made a visit to the
                    abbot of Pomposa, a town in the duchy of Ferrara, who was very earnest to have
                    Guido settle in the monastery of that place; to which invitation, it seems, he
                    yielded, being, as he says, desirous of rendering so great a monastery still
                    more famous by his studies there.</p>
                <p>Here it was that he composed a tract on music, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mierologus,</hi> i. e. a short discourse, which he dedicated to Theobald,
                    bishop of Arezzo; and finished, as he himself at the end of it tells us, under
                    the pontificate of John XX., and in the 34th year of his age. Vossius speaks
                    also of another musical treatise written by him, and dedicated to the same
                    person.</p>
                <p>Most of the authors who have taken occasion to mention Guido, speak of the
                    Micrologus as containing the sum of his doctrine; but it is in a small tract,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Argumentum</hi><hi rend="italic">novi Cantus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">inveniendi,</hi> that his declaration of his use of the syllables,
                    with their several mutations, and in short his whole doctrine of solousation, is
                    to be found. This tract makes part of an epistle to a very dear and intimate
                    friend of Guido, whom he addresses thus, “Beatissimo atque dulcissimo fratri
                    Michaeli,” at whose request the tract itself seems to have been composed.</p>
                <p>Whether Guido was the author of any other tracts is not easy to determine. It
                    nowhere appears that any of his works were ever printed, except that Baronins,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Annales Ecclesiastici,</hi> tom. xi. p. 73, has given
                    at length the epistle from him to his friend Michael of Pomposa, and that to
                    Theobald, bishop of Arezzo, prefixed to the Micrologus; and yet the writers on
                    music speak of the Micrologus as of a book in the hands of every one. Martini
                    cites several manuscripts of Guido; namely, two in the Ambrosian library at
                    Milan, the one written about the twelfth century, the other less ancient;
                    another among the archives of the chapter of Pistoja, a city in Tuscany; and a
                    third in the MedicoLaurenziano library at Florence, of the fifteenth century:
                    these are clearly the Micrologus. Of the epistle to Michael of Pomposa, together
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Argumentum</hi><hi rend="italic">novi Cantus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">inveniendi,</hi> he mentions only one, which, he says, is
                    somewhere at Ratisbon. Of the several tracts above mentioned, the last excepted,
                    a manuscript is extant in the library of Baliol college in Oxford.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Aretin,</hi><hi rend="italic">Leonard,</hi> one of the most
                    learned men of the fifteenth century, was secretary to the republic of Florence,
                    and translated from the Greek into Latin some of the Lives of Plutarch, and
                    Aristotle’s Ethics. He also composed three books of the Punic war, that may
                    serve as a supplement to those wanting in Livy; the history of the transactions
                    in Italy during his time; that of ancient Greece; that of the Goths; that of the
                    republic of Florence; and many other books. He died in 1443, aged 74.</p>

                    and was so bold as to carry his invectives even against sovereigns, and from
                    thence got the title of the <hi rend="italic">Scourge of Princes.</hi> Francis
                    I., the emperor Charles V., most of the princes of Italy, several cardinals, and
                    many noblemen, courted his friendship by presents, either because they liked his
                    compositions, or perhaps from an apprehension of falling under the lash of his
                    satire. Aretin became so insolent, that he is said to have got a medal struck,
                    on one side of which he is represented, with these words, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Il</hi><hi rend="italic">divino</hi><hi rend="italic">Aretino</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and on the reverse, sitting upon a throne, receiving the
                    presents of princes, with these words, <hi rend="italic">Iprin-cipi tributati da
                    popoli, tributano</hi><hi rend="italic">il</hi><hi rend="italic">servidor
                    loro.</hi> Some imagine that he gave himself the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Divine,</hi> signifying thereby that he performed the functions of a god upon
                    earth, by the thunderbolts with which he struck the heads of the highest
                    personages. He used to boast that his lampoons did more service to the world
                    than sermons; and it was said of him, that he had subjected more princes by his
                    pen than the greatest had ever done by their arms. Aretin wrote many irreligious
                    and obscene pieces; such are his dialogues, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bagionamenti.</hi> There is likewise imputed to him another very obscene
                    performance, <hi rend="italic">De omnibus Veneris</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >schematibus.</hi> “It was about the year 1525 (says Μ. Chevillieř, <hi
                    rend="italic">Origine</hi><hi rend="italic">de ĭ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Imprimerie</hi><hi rend="italic">de Paris,</hi> p. 224) that Julio Romano, the
                    most famous painter of Italy, instigated by the enemy of the salvation of
                    mankind, invented drawings to engrave 20 plates; the subjects are so immodest
                    that I dare only name them. Peter Aretin composed sonnets for each figure.
                    George Vasari, who relates this in his <hi rend="italic">Lives of the
                    Painters,</hi> says he does not know which would be the greatest impurity, to
                    cast one’s eyes upon the drawings of Julio, or to dip into the verses of
                    Aretin.” Some say that Aretin changed his libertine principles; but however this
                    may be, it is certain that he composed several theological or pious pieces. He
                    wrote a paraphrase on the penitential psalms, and another on Genesis; the Life
                    of the Virgin Mary, and that of St Catharine of Sienna, and of St Thomas
                    Aquinas. His familiar Letters have been collected, and published in 6 vols. 8vo,
                    Paris, 1609. He was author likewise of various poetical pieces, among which is a
                    tragedy on the subject of the Horatii, possessed of considerable merit. He died
                    in the year 1556, at the age of 65.</p>
