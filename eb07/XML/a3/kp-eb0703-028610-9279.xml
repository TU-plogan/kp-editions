                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">APOLLO</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Mythology,</hi> a pagan
                    deity worshipped by the Greeks and Romans. Cicero mentions four of this name,
                    the most ancient of whom was the son of Vulcan; the second a son of Corybas, and
                    born in Crete; the third an Arcadian, called Nomian, from his being a great
                    legislator; and the last, to whom the greatest honour is ascribed, the son of
                    Jupiter and Latona.</p>
                <p>Apollo had a variety of other names, either derived from his principal
                    attributes, or the chief places where he was worshipped. He was called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Healer,</hi> from his enlivening warmth and cheering influence;
                    <hi rend="italic">Nomius,</hi> or the shepherd, from his fertilizing the earth,
                    and thence sustaining the animal creation; <hi rend="italic">Delius,</hi> from
                    his rendering all things manifest; <hi rend="italic">Pythius,</hi> from his
                    victory over Python; <hi rend="italic">Lycias,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Phcebus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Phaneta,</hi> from his purity and
                    splendour. As Apollo is almost always confounded by the Greeks with the sun, it
                    is no wonder that he should be dignified with so many attributes. It was natural
                    for the most glorious object in nature, whose influence is felt by all creation,
                    and seen by every animated part of it, to be adored as the fountain of light,
                    heat, and life. The power of healing diseases being chiefly given by the
                    ancients to medicinal plants and vegetable productions, it <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193099292" xml:id="kp-eb0703-9292-0287"/>was natural to exalt into a
                    divinity the visible cause of 'their growth. Hence he was also styled the <hi
                    rend="italic">God of Physic</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and that external heat
                    which cheers and invigorates all nature, being transferred from the human body
                    to the mind, gave rise to the idea of all mental effervescence coming from this
                    god: hence likewise, poets, prophets, and musicians, are said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">Numine afflati,</hi> inspired by Apollo.</p>
                <p>Whether Apollo was a real personage, or only the great luminary, many have
                    doubted. Vossius has taken great pains to prove this god to be only a
                    metaphorical being, and that there never was any other Apollo than the sun. « He
                    was styled the <hi rend="italic">Son of Jupiter f</hi> says this author,
                    “because that god was reckoned by the ancients the author of the world. His
                    mother was called <hi rend="italic">Latona,</hi> a name which signifies <hi
                    rend="italic">hidden,</hi> because’, before the sun was created, all things were
                    wrapped up in the obscurity of chaos. He is always represented as beardless and
                    youthful, because the sun never grows old or decays; and what else can his bows
                    and arrows imply, but his piercing beams ?” And he adds, that all the ceremonies
                    which were performed to his honour had a manifest relation to the great source
                    of light which he represented. However, though this be in general true, it
                    appears from many passages in ancient authors, that there was some illustrious
                    personage named <hi rend="italic">Apollo,</hi> who, after his apotheosis, was
                    taken for the sun; as Osiris and Orus in Egypt, whose existence cannot be called
                    in question, were, after their death, confounded with the sun, of which they
                    became the symbols, either from the glory and splendour of their reisns,'or from
                    a belief that their souls had taken up their residence in that luminary.</p>
                <p>Of the four Apollos mentioned by Cicero, it appears that the last three were
                    Greeks, and the first an Egyptian, who, according to Herodotus, was the Son of
                    Osiris and Isis, and called <hi rend="italic">Orus.</hi> Pausanias is of the
                    same opinion as Herodotus, and ranks Apollo among the Egyptian divinities. The
                    testimony of Diodorus Siculus is still more express; for in speaking of Isis,
                    after saying that, she had invented the practice of physic, he adds, that she
                    taught this art to her son Orus, named <hi rend="italic">Apollo,</hi> who was
                    the last of the gods that reigned in Egypt.</p>
                <p>It is easy to trace almost all the Grecian fables and mythologies from Egypt. If
                    the Apollo of the Greeks was said to be the son of Jupiter, it was because Orus,
                    the Apollo of the Egyptians, had Osiris for his father, whom the Greeks
                    confounded with Jupiter. If the Greek Apollo was reckoned the god of eloquence,
                    music, medicine, and poetry, the reason was, that Osiris, who was the symbol of
                    the sun among the Egyptians, as well as his son Orus, had there taught those
                    liberal arts. If the Greek Apollo was the god and conductor of the Muses, it was
                    because I Osiris carried with hiifi, in his expedition to’the Indies, singing
                    women and musicians. This parallel might be carried on still further; but enough
                    has been said to prove hat the true Apollo was that of Egypt.</p>
                <p>ſo the other perfections of this divinity the poets have added beauty, grace, and
                    the art of captivating the ear and the heart, no less by the sweetness of his
                    eloquence, than by the melodious sounds of his lyre.</p>
                <p>. The defeat of the serpent Python forms a celebrated mt in the history of
                    Apollo. The waters of Deuca-ιon s deluge, says Ovid, which had overflowed the
                    earth, eft a slime, from whence sprung innumerable monsters; and among others
                    the serpent Python, which made great ιavock in the country about Parnassus.
                    Apollo, armed <hi rend="superscript"> w</hi>. it. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    his darts, put him to death; which, physically όχι L <hi rend="superscript">

                    monsters soon disappeared: or, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ns fable be
                    referred to history, the serpent was a robber, who haunting the country about
                    Delphi, and very much infesting those who came hither to sacrifice, a prince who
                    bore the name of Apollo, or one of the priests of that god, put him to
                    death.</p>
                <p>This event gave rise to the institution of the Pythian games, so frequently
                    mentioned in the Grecian history; and it was from the legend of Apollo’s victory
                    over the Python that the god himself acquired the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pythius,</hi> and his priestess that of <hi rend="italic">Pythia.</hi> The city
                    of Delphi, where the famous oraeles were so long delivered, was frequently
                    styled <hi rend="italic">Pytho.</hi><hi rend="italic">ApοLLο Belvidere,</hi>
                    ranked the first in the first class of ancient statues, and so called from
                    having been placed in the Belvidere of the Vatican at Rome by Pope Julius IL,
                    where it remained for 300 years, and till Rome was taken and plundered by the
                    French in 1797. This celebrated statué was found in the ruins of ancient Antium
                    about the end of the 15th century. The artist is unknown.</p>
