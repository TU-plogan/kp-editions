                <p><label type="entry">ANTIPATHY</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Physiology,</hi> is
                    formed from the two Greek words, <hi rend="italic">avrι, contrary,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">&lt;nabος, passion.</hi> Literally taken, the word signifies <hi
                    rend="italic">incompatibility</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> but for the most part
                    the term <hi rend="italic">antipathy</hi> is not used to signify such
                    incompatibilities as arc merely physical; it is reserved to express the aversion
                    which an animated or sensitive being feels at the real or ideal presence of
                    particular objects. In this point of view, which is the light in which we at
                    present consider the term, <hi rend="italic">antipathy,</hi> in common language,
                    signifies a natural and involuntary aversion which a sensitive being feels for
                    some other object, whatever it is, though the person who feels this abhorrence
                    is entirely ignorant of its cause, and can by no means account for it Such is,
                    they say, the natural and reciprocal hostility between the toad and the weasel,
                    between sheep and wolves. Such is the invincible aversion of particular persons
                    against cats, mice, spiders, &amp;c., a prepossession which is sometimes so
                    violent as to make them faint at the sight of these animals. To explore the
                    matter with, out prejudice, we shall find it necessary to abstract from this
                    disquisition all such antipathies as are not ascertained, as that which is
                    supposed to be felt between the salamander and tortoise, and between the weasel
                    and the toad. We must abstract those which can be extinguished or resumed at
                    pleasure; those fictitious aversions which only certain persons feel or pretend
                    to feel. When we abstract aversions, the causes of which are known and evident,
                    we shall be surprised, after deduction of pretended antipathies, how small, how
                    inconsiderable, is the quantity of those which are conformable to our
                    definition. Will any one pretend to call by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >antipathy</hi> those real, innate, and incontestable aversions which prevail
                    between sheep and wolves? Their cause is obvious: the wolf devours the sheep,
                    and subsists upon his victims; and every animal naturally flies with terror from
                    pain or destruction: sheep ought therefore to regard wolves with horror, which,
                    for their nutrition, tear and mangle the unresisting prey. From principles
                    similar to this arises that aversion which numbers of people feel against
                    serpents, against small animals, such as reptiles in general, and the greater
                    number of insects. During the credulous and susceptible period of infancy, pains
                    have been taken to impress on our minds the frightful idea that they are
                    venomous; that their bite is mortal; that their sting is dangerous, productive
                    of tormenting inflammations or tumours, and sometimes fatal: they have been
                    represented to us as ugly and sordid; as being for that reason pernicious to
                    those who touch them; as poisoning those who have the misfortune to swallow
                    them. Is it then wonderful (if our false impressions as to this subject have
                    been corrected neither by future reflections nor experiments) that we should
                    entertain during our whole lives an aversion for these objects, even when we
                    have forgot the admonitions, the conversations, and examples, which have taught
                    us to believe and apprehend them as noxious beings? To explain these facts, is
                    it necessary to fly to the exploded subterfuge of occult qualities inherent in
                    bodies, to latent relations productive of antipathies, of which no person could
                    ever form an idea?</p>
                <p>To what then are those <hi rend="italic">antipathies</hi> of which we have heard
                    so much reducible? Either to legendary tales, or to aversions against objects
                    which we believe dangerous, or to a childish terror of imaginary perils, or to a
                    disrelish of which the cause is disguised, or to an infirmity of the stomach,—in
                    a word, to a real or pretended reluctance for things which are either invested
                    or supposed to be invested with qualities hurtful to us. Too much care cannot be
                    taken in preventing or regulating the <hi rend="italic">antipathic</hi> of
                    children; in familiarizing them with objects of every kind; in discovering to
                    them, without emotion, such as <pb break="no" facs="nls:193098876"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-8876-0255"/>are dangerous; and in teaching them the means of
                    defence and security, or the methods of escaping their noxious influence.</p>
