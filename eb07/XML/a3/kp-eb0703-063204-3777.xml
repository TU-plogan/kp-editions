                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> discovery of gunpowder by Roger Bacon in the
                    thirteenth century, and of its application to military purposes by Schwartz in
                    the fourteenth, caused a complete revolution in this branch of the art of war.
                    The term <hi rend="italic">artillery,</hi> previous to this discovery, denoted,
                    in a general sense, all kinds of missiles, and the machines used in propelling
                    them. Thus the artillery of the ancients consisted of the catapulta and balista,
                    of darts, arrows, and other purely mechanical contrivances; while, at a later
                    period, the Franks and their contemporaries used a species of small hatchet as a
                    missile, discharging it at their enemies much in the same manner as the North
                    American Indians do their tomahawks in the present day. However, the
                    signification of the term changing with the advancement of science, we
                    understand by it, in modern phrase- <hi rend="superscript"> ol</hi> °gy <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 5</hi> g <hi rend="superscript"> uns</hi> J howitzers, and
                    mortars, with their carriages, beds, ammunition, and apparatus of all kinds, and
                    the troops specially appointed for their management.</p>
                <p>In the rapid growth of scientific improvement which, during the last thirty-five
                    years, has extended through every branch of our military establishment, there is
                    nothing more remarkable or more honourable to our national ingenuity and energy
                    than the changes which have been wrought in the organization of the ordnance
                    service.</p>
                <p>These changes are such as to render the British artillery, from having been among
                    the worst in Europe, absolutely the very finest and best—an example for the envy
                    of the military powers of the Continent, and a model for the avowed imitation of
                    even that nation which has heretofore been held to excel all others in the
                    qualities of martial science. It has hitherto been admitted by universal
                    consent, that, of all the people of Europe, the French have habitually, in their
                    national character, shown most original genius and aptitude for military
                    affairs; and it is therefore not a little gratifying to the British artillerist
                    to observe these acknowledged masters of the art of war— these boasted
                    instructors of our earlier years—surpassed in their own favourite vocation, and
                    reduced to become m their turn the pupils and imitators of our military
                    knowledge and invention.</p>
                <p>This practical homage on the part of the French to the decided superiority of our
                    artillery is a circumstance publicly and candidly admitted by some at least of
                    their own writers. A memoir by the chef-de-bataillon Parizot, a skilful officer
                    of the French artillery, details six essential advantages in the British system
                    over that of his countrymen; and Dupin, who quotes this memoir, adds, m a note,
                    the following testimony of a French general officer <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193103790" xml:id="kp-eb0703-3790-0633"/>who attended the review of
                    the allied armies of occupation in France in 1818. “J’ai observé, avec beaucoup
                    d’attention, les manoeuvres d’artillerie des diverses puissances; j’ai été
                    frappé de la beauté et da luxe de toutes les troupes qui composaient l’armée, de
                    l’ordre et de la précision de leurs mouvemens et de leurs manoeuvres; <hi
                    rend="italic">mais les Anglais sont les premiers sous tous les
                    rapports.”</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>All the improvements which have raised the British artillery to its present state
                    of perfection are, as we have already said, the work of our own age. At the
                    commencement of our share in the late war in 1793, the various ordnance
                    equipments, as well as the whole composition of this branch of our military
                    service, were of the rudest kind, and on the worst organized and most defective
                    plan. The inefficiency of the whole system, indeed, was palpably betrayed
                    whenever a force was required to take the field. The guns were dispersed among
                    the infantry at the rate of two pieces, to a battalion, thereby rendering it
                    impracticable to employ them for their legitimate purpose—the concentrating a
                    powerful fire of numerous guns on any important point. They were also horsed in
                    single team, which needlessly both lengthened the column of march and diminished
                    the power of draught. The drivers were on foot with long whips, as were also the
                    gunners. The ammunition was packed in large rough deal boxes; the waggons which
                    conveyed it were heavy and ill-constructed; and the whole equipment was so
                    cumbrous, that it was impossible for the train to move out of a foot-pace,
                    except for a very short distance and if increased speed were attempted before
                    the enemy, the men came into action breathless and unable to serve their
                    guns.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >British Gunner.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>But before the commencement of the peninsular war, that active and able officer
                    the late Major Spearman had entirely re-organized this branch of the service;
                    and it is to him that the country owes the present beautiful system of field
                    artillery. The battalion guns were abolished, and the artillery was brigaded,
                    distinct from the infantry and cavalry with which it served, in divisions of six
                    pieces each; so that the fire of one or more of these powerful batteries could
                    be readily concentrated on any given point. A body of military drivers was
                    organized, while, by an ingenious contrivance of the shafts, the power of using
                    single draught in narrow roads, or when any of the horses were disabled, was
                    retained. The drivers were mounted on the near horses; and the gunriers
                    themselves, in the proportion of eight to each piece, were carried on the
                    limbers and ammunition cars. The whole of the equipment was simplified and
                    lightened to such a degree that the batteries could move at a gallop; the
                    ammunition, packed in boxes on the limbers and cars, was always up with the
                    guns; and the officers and men, being all mounted or conveyed on the carriages,
                    were sure of being brought fresh into action. Finally, a system of manoeuvres
                    for artillery in the field was introduced, which gave order and precision to
                    their own movements, and established uniformity between them and the troops of
                    other arms.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Ibid.</hi></p></note> The advantages of this system are so ably
                    described in the following observations of a general officer of the French
                    artillery, who was present at the final review of the allied army of occupation
                    in France, that we shall make no apology for introducing them in this place. “La
                    cavalerie, soutenue par des masses d’infanterie, étant sur deux lignes, dans la
                    plaine entre La Selle et l’Ecaillon, on vit à la fois se détacher des differens
                    corps, plus de cent bouches à feu d’artillerie à pied et à cheval; et se porter,
                    <hi rend="italic">avec la</hi><hi rend="italic">meine</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vitesse,</hi> à cent toises en avant de la première ligne de cavalerie. On
                    commença l’affaire par one cannonade, qui ressemblait à un feu de file. Les
                    mouvemens des batteries et les manoeuvres des bouches à feu s’exécutent avec
                    beaucoup d’ordre et de précision. La facilité avec laquelle on met et ôte
                    l’avant-train n’a pas échappé aux officiers d’artillerie. Il est survenu un
                    accident à one batterie à pied qui arrivait au galop par un chemin très-escarpé.
                    Ayant rencontré one calèche qui fermait le passage, elle n’hésita pas, dans la
                    crainte d’un retard, à se précipiter dans le champ à gauche. Une scule pièce fut
                    renversée, avec les cannoniers, dont un fut blessé. Elle fut relevée en un
                    instant, et rejoignit sa batterie. Il y cut successivement deux charges de
                    cavalerie par les deux lignes, qui, repoussées, vinrent se rallier l’une
                    derrière l’autre. On vit les cannoniers, <hi rend="italic">emmenant les
                    avant-trains,</hi> abandonner les pièces, <hi rend="italic">et revenir aussitôt
                    apres la charge, recommencer le feu.</hi> Le passage de l’Ecaillon, défendu par
                    l’armée ennemie qui occupait les villages, les ponts, et tous les points
                    importans de la position, donna lieu aux dispositions et aux manoeuvres que
                    nécessite one opération de cette importance. Le passage forcé, l’armée ennemie
                    tournée par sa gauche, pressée par les alliés, fit sa retraite, défendant le
                    terrain et les villages, pied à pied, jusque sur les hauteurs du camp de Famars.
                    L’artillerie a suivi les mouvemens des divisions, dans la vallée difficile de
                    l’Ecaillon, et dans la plaine au delà (malgré les obstacles) jusqu’au pied des
                    hauteurs de Famars, arrivant sur le terrain en même temps que les troupes; cette
                    position est couverte par un ravin profond et difficile, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>FIELD ARTILLERY.</p>
                <p>When an army is to take the field, several considerations must be attended to in
                    apportioning the number and calibre of the batteries to accompany it; as the
                    face, features, and general nature, mountainous or otherwise, of the country
                    which is to form the theatre of war,—the state of its roads, and the resources
                    which it can supply for the means of transport,—the force and description of
                    troops composing the army,—the nature of the war, whether offensive or
                    defensive,—and, lastly, the intended plan of operations.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Traité Elémentaire
                    d’Artillerie.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>In carrying on offensive operations in a champaign country, with good roads and
                    facility of transport, the artillery should consist of 9-pounder batteries, to
                    which a few 18 or 12-pounders should be added, to form on occasion batteries of
                    position. There should likewise be one or more batteries of a lighter calibre,
                    to accompany any corps of the army that may be destined by rapid marches to
                    intercept the enemy’s convoys or detachments.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>D’Antoni.</p></note> In mountainous or deep
                    hilly countries, the artillery should not be composed of heavier ordnance than
                    the 6-pounder battery; but an exact topographical acquaintance with the nature
                    of the country is absolutely necessary, and indeed affords the only satisfactory
                    guide for judging of the most appropriate calibres to be employed. When an army
                    is to remain on the defensive in a country where the roads are only tolerable,
                    and the probability of being obliged to undertake long and rapid marches is not
                    great, the artillery should be composed of a heavier description of batteries
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103803" xml:id="kp-eb0703-3803-0634"/> than would be
                    proper to accompany an army acting offensively in the same country. But if this
                    defensive system be carried on in a strong country, where the means of transport
                    are attended with difficulty, and long and rapid marches may become
                    indispensably necessary, the batteries must be so constituted as to adapt them
                    to these several circumstances, otherwise the artillery will retard the army in
                    its operations, instead of contributing to the attainment of the object in
                    view.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The following historical examples of the relative proportions of artillery acting
                    with various armies in different countries during the late war, may, with the
                    assistance of good topographical maps, enable an officer to form a tolerably
                    accurate judgment on this important branch of military study.</p>
                <p>The Austrian army, under the command of the archduke Charles in the campaign of
                    Aspergne, Essling, and Wagram, consisted of about 75,000 men, to whom were
                    attached 18 batteries of brigade, 13 of position, and 11 of horse-artillery;
                    being in the proportion of one piece of ordnance to 260 men nearly.</p>
                <p>The allied British and Portuguese army in the field in Spain, May 1813, consisted
                    of 65,000 men and 102 pieces of artillery, including the reserve; being in the
                    proportion of one piece of ordnance to 622 men nearly.</p>
                <p>The grand French army under Napoleon, for the invasion of Russia, not including
                    the Austrian contingent, consisted of 400,000 infantry, 60,000 cavalry, and 1200
                    pieces of artillery; being one piece of ordnance to 383 men.</p>
                <p>The French armies united on the Tormes in December 1812 amounted to 80,000 men
                    and 200 pieces of artillery, being in the proportion of one gun to 400 men.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103829" xml:id="kp-eb0703-3829-0636"/>
                <p>Napoleon in 1813 had 1400 pieces of artillery to 300,000 men, or one gun to 200
                    nearly. In 1815 his army consisted, as nearly as can be ascertained, by a
                    comparison of several accounts of the campaign, of 130,000 infantry, 20,000
                    cavalry, and 300 pieces of artillery; being one piece of ordnance to 500
                    men.</p>
                <p>The Prussian contingent of the grand French army for the invasion of Russia,
                    under the command of General D’York, consisted of 20,000 men and 60 pieces of
                    artillery; being in the proportion of one piece of ordnance to 333 men
                    nearly.</p>
                <p>Marshal Beresford, at the battle of Albuera, had 29,000 men and 32 pieces of
                    artillery, or one gun to 900 men. His opponent Marshal Soult, in the same
                    action, had 23,000 men and 40 pieces of artillery, or one gun to 575 men.</p>
                <p>General L’Espinasse, who commanded the artillery of Buonaparte in Italy, supposes
                    a division of an army to consist of 12,000 men, including a regiment of dragoons
                    and another of hussars, to which he allots three batteries of horse and three of
                    field artillery, each consisting of six pieces of ordnance. A battery of horse
                    and another of field artillery are at all times to be up with the army; two
                    batteries, similarly armed with the two in activity, are to remain with the
                    park; and the remaining two, also appointed in like manner, should be in depot
                    in rear of the army. These proportions of artillery to infantry, L’Espinasse
                    states, are precisely those adopted with the approbation of Buonaparte in the
                    Italian campaigns.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>The commanding officer of artillery, in order that he may choose proper positions
                    for his field batteries, should be made acquainted with the effect intended to
                    be produced, with the troops that are to be supported, and with the points to be
                    attacked, that he may place his artillery so as to support, but not incommode
                    the infantry, nor take up such situations with his guns as would be more
                    advantageously occupied by the line; that he may not place his batteries too
                    soon, nor in exposed situations; that he may cover his fronts and flanks by
                    taking advantage of the ground; and that he may not venture too far out of the
                    protection of the army, unless some very decided effect is to be obtained by so
                    doing.</p>
                <p>In a defensive position the guns of the largest calibre should be posted on those
                    points from whence the enemy can be discovered at the greatest distance, and
                    from whence may be seen the whole extent of his front. In an offensive position,
                    the weakest points of the line, and those most distant from the enemy, must be
                    strengthened by the largest calibres. Those heights on which the army, in
                    advancing, may rest its flanks, must be secured by them, as also those from
                    which the enemy may be fired upon obliquely.</p>
                <p>Artillery should never be placed in such a situation that it can be taken by any
                    enemy’s battery obliquely, in flank, or in reverse, unless a position under
                    these circumstances offers every prospect of producing a most decisive effect
                    before the guns can be destroyed, or placed <hi rend="italic">hors de
                    combat.</hi> The most elevated positions are not the best for artillery; the
                    greatest effects may be produced from a height of from 30 to 40 yards at the
                    distance of 600, and from about 16 yards high at 200 yards distant. Those
                    positions which are not likely to be shifted, but from whence an effect may be
                    produced during the whole of an action, are to be preferred, and in such
                    positions breast-works of two or three feet high should be thrown up to cover
                    the carriages.</p>
                <p>The guns must be so placed as to produce a cross-fire upon the enemy’s position,
                    and upon the ground over <hi rend="italic">i</hi> which he must pass to attack
                    you. It may sometimes be '' ’ necessary, in order to concentrate a cross-fire on
                    one particular point, to subdivide your batteries. Thus, his fire may be
                    attracted to different objects whilst your own is directed to a focus, which may
                    be the <hi rend="italic">débouché</hi> of the enemy, the head of his advancing
                    columns, or the ground in front of the weakest point in your own line. If the
                    enemy’s position is to be attacked, your fire must become direct in proportion
                    as the troops advance, otherwise it will impede them; and when you can no longer
                    fire on the point attacked, the guns must be directed on the collateral
                    points.</p>
                <p>The guns should be placed as much as possible under cover. This is easily done
                    upon heights, by keeping them so far back as that only the muzzles may be
                    perceived over them. With proper attention, many situations may be found of
                    which advantage may be taken for this purpose, such as banks, ditches, &amp;c.
                    everywhere to be met with. If an enemy’s attack is expected, the guns must be
                    posted so as to cannonade him with effect when he advances within 800 paces, and
                    particularly in situations in which his march may be retarded by ditches,
                    defiles, or other natural obstacles.</p>
                <p>The position from whence the enemy is to be cannonaded should be kept concealed
                    from him till the moment the batteries are to open. To effect this, the guns may
                    until that time be placed in any other situation. Should there be any small
                    elevations of earth in front of a defile through which the enemy may advance and
                    be cannonaded, the guns must be kept under cover of them until he comes out and
                    begins to form. The guns may also be masked by being covered by troops,
                    particularly cavalry, until the enemy is within the range of case-shot. The
                    covering party must then open right and left, and a brisk fire be kept up.</p>
                <p>Artillery should very rarely be placed in front of a line of infantry, or
                    distributed by batteries in the intervals. When the line is of great extent, it
                    may become necessary to place a strong battery in the centre. This should be
                    composed of the guns of the heaviest calibre; and it should be posted in the
                    interval between the right and left wings of the army, by which means a double
                    object is not offered to the enemy’s fire. In general, an army in order of
                    battle may be considered as a front of fortification, the infantry forming the
                    curtain, and the lateral batteries the bastions, under the fire of which the
                    troops may manoeuvre freely, and advance with confidence to attack the
                    enemy.</p>
                <p>The two following examples will serve to illustrate the preceding remarks :—</p>

                    front, and crossing their fire before the curtain. The troops are consequently
                    covered from attack, and the enemy fired upon obliquely. Wurmser having
                    prolonged his front from G to I with the intention of outflanking the French,
                    General L’Espinasse took some of the guns from C A, and placed them on the other
                    face C K, until others could be drawn from the park for that purpose, thus
                    forming a new battery destined to follow the enemy’s movements. Another battery
                    was likewise formed on the right, from D to E, in caser Wurmser had prolonged
                    his left from H to F.</p>

                    r</hi><hi rend="italic">lth and 2⅛th July</hi> 1809.—At the commencement of the
                    battle the British artillery were stationed, by batteries of six guns each, with
                    the divisions of the army to which they were respectively attached; a temporary
                    redoubt, unfinished, was thrown up at F, in which a battery of 3-pounders was
                    posted; on the hill, at A, the most commanding point of the position, two
                    batteries were posted, one of heavy 6-pounders, the other of light sixes, to
                    which two Spanish guns were afterwards added.</p>
                <p>The French had a battery of 14 guns at K, the centre of their position, also one
                    at each of the flanks G and H, independently of others which were brought up
                    during the action. On the second day, when the columns at Μ advanced, supported
                    by artillery, to attack the British right, which rested on the unfinished
                    redoubt, the three batteries E E E were formed on the oblique line L E, and thus
                    took the advancing columns in flank, whilst the redoubt kept up a direct fire in
                    their front.</p>
                <p>It must here be observed, that whenever an oblique line is formed by artillery,
                    as from*L to E, it must be directed without the extremity of the enemy’s flank,
                    otherwise the guns will be exposed to his enfilading fire.</p>
                <p>SIEGE ARTILLERY.</p>
                <p>The first duty of the commanding officer of artillery, when it is intended to
                    besiege a fortress, is to prepare an estimate of the quantity of ordnance and
                    ammunition required for its reduction. To enable him to make this estimate with
                    accuracy and precision, he should be master of certain data; that is to say, the
                    commander of the forces, or general charged with the direction of the siege,
                    should communicate to him a plan of the fortifications and environs of the
                    place, accompanied by such profiles and remarks as may enable him, in
                    conjunction with the commanding engineer, to ascertain which front or fronts are
                    most assailable, with the advantages and disadvantages attending each attack, as
                    well with respect to the works of the place, as to the nature of the soil where
                    the trenches must be opened, and the several heights and hollows in the
                    vicinity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    whether the place be amply supplied with artillery, ammunition, &amp;ċ.; if the
                    garrison be sufficiently numerous, and whether composed of veteran troops or raw
                    levies; if the governor be in high estimation for his military talents; if the
                    town be populous, and the inhabitants well affected to the garrison.<note

                    Gunner.</hi></p></note> It will thus be easy to form a tolerably accurate
                    opinion of the means of defence, and the resistance to be expected; for it is
                    not to be presumed that any government would shut up a brave and numerous force
                    in an ill-fortified and badly provisioned place, at the risk of seeing such a
                    garrison sacrificed after a short resistance.</p>
                <p>But should it be impossible to procure information on these several points
                    beforehand, particularly as to the strength of the garrison, the requisite
                    proportion of ordnance and ammunition must be regulated on the general
                    principles of attack. The officer intrusted to prepare the estimate must,
                    therefore, endeavour to ascertain, according to the fundamental maxim of all
                    besiegers, against which front or fronts the attack can be made with the least
                    exposure and greatest expedition. He should examine whether the siege can be
                    most advantageously carried on by regular approaches; by taking advantage of any
                    defect in the situation which may enable him to break ground close to the works
                    to be breached; or by battering them from a distance. By the aid of this
                    investigation, and the following general principles, the quantity of ordnance
                    and ammunition required for the siege of a place may be ascertained with the
                    greatest accuracy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">General Principles for the Attack of Fortified Places.</hi></p>
                <p>1. The number of batteries to be opened against the defences must depend upon the
                    extent of the works to be embraced by the attack, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi>
                    there must be a battery to enfilade every face that can in any way annoy or
                    retard the besiegers in their approaches.</p>
                <p>2. The length of the epaulement of these batteries need not exceed the breadth of
                    the terreplein of the works to be enfiladed, unless circumstances should render
                    it necessary to place some of the guns in a situation to take the work in
                    reverse. Each battery will only contain, therefore, five, or at most eight guns,
                    to enfilade the face of the principal work; to which must be added two others to
                    enfilade the branches of the opposite covered-way.</p>
                <p>3. The situation of the breaching batteries must be determined, as, in a regular
                    attack, they sometimes interfere with the fire of the first or enfilading
                    batteries. Should this be the case, the same artillery must be transferred from
                    one battery to the other.</p>
                <p>4. The supply of ordnance must be sufficiently liberal to enable the besiegers to
                    keep up a fire constantly superior to that of the place. This supply is
                    determined by the extent of the fortifications of the place; one piece of
                    ordnance must be allowed for every twelve or fifteen feet.</p>
                <p>5. As the <hi rend="italic">ricohet</hi> firing may be interrupted while the
                    sappers are completing the third parallel, a supply of royal and coehorn mortars
                    must be provided to harass the garrison from the second parallel, or demi-places
                    of arms, during its cessation. <hi rend="italic"/><note anchored="true"

                <p>Having thus ascertained the number of guns required, the following will be their
                    calibres, and the proportions which the remaining ordnance should bear to
                    them.</p>
                <p>Guns—of the whole number re quire d—suppose 60.</p>
                <p>24-pounders f∙ or 40</p>
                <p>12-pounders ⅛ or 20</p>
                <p>Howitzers—one for every four guns—in this case 15.</p>
                <p>10-inch ⅜ or 5</p>
                <p>8-inch ∣ or 10 <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103855" xml:id="kp-eb0703-3855-0638"
                    />Mortars—in the proportion of one-twelfth more than the number of guns—in this
                    case 65.</p>
                <p>10-inch ⅛ or 10</p>
                <p>8-inch ⅛ or 15</p>
                <p>Royal -⅛ or 20</p>
                <p>Coehorn ∙⅛ or 20</p>
                <p>In the above proportion of ordnance, it must be observed that the long 12-pounder
                    is proposed instead of the 18-pounder formerly employed, as a gun of this
                    description is conceived to be sufficiently powerful for annoyance and direct
                    fire, to dismount the enemy’s artillery, as well as for firing <hi rend="italic"
                    >en</hi><hi rend="italic">ricohet.</hi> The diminished weight of ammunition
                    attendant on the employment of the smaller calibre is an important advantage;
                    but it is an arrangement which can only be admitted in cases where an adequate
                    number of 24-pounders are provided. In all smaller equipments it would,
                    therefore, be better that all the guns should be of the heavy calibre.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">British
                    Gunner.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>The proportion of small mortars should in no case be less than that of the heavy
                    mortars and howitzers, and this proportion ought to be increased in all
                    equipments of less than thirty pieces of ordnance: indeed, when sent at all,
                    there should be at least twelve of them, to insure the necessary effect: in many
                    cases a far greater number than is here proposed could be advantageously used,
                    but this must of course depend on the nature of the service on which they are
                    likely to be employed. The royal and coehorn mortars have in the present
                    instance been taken in equal proportions, and it would be advisable to adhere to
                    this arrangement in all the larger equipments, particularly when their calibres
                    correspond with those of the guns; but in small equipments it would be more
                    convenient to confine the arrangement to one calibre, in which case the royal
                    mortar is the preferable, as it possesses the power of being used at a greater
                    distance than the coehorn. But it must at the same time be observed, that the
                    latter, from its lightness and the small weight of its ammunition, is a more
                    desirable implement for the more advanced parts of the attack.</p>
                <p>The quantity and relative calibres of the ordnance being determined, the
                    following will be the proportion and nature of ammunition.</p>

                    in favour of the 12-poun-clers, as the facility of working these guns will, at
                    an easy rate, afford the means of firing more rapidly than from 24-pounders. The
                    proportion of one half common shells and one half spherical case should always
                    be adhered to for the 8-inch howitzers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Arrangement of Artillery at a Siege.</hi></p>
                <p>The first disposition of the artillery at a siege is to the different batteries
                    raised near the first parallel. The object of the besieger in the construction
                    of these batteries is, by a direct and enfilade fire, to dismount the artillery
                    on the front attacked, destroy the embrazures, and harass the garrison in the
                    several points of defence, so that they may be compelled to abandon them, or at
                    least slacken their fire, and thereby enable the besieger to carry forward his
                    approaches with greater expedition and less danger than he otherwise could
                    do.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Essai Générale de Fortification.</hi></p></note> If thèse first batteries be
                    favourably situated, the artillery may be continued in them during the whole of
                    the siege, or until the besiegers arrive on the crest of the glacis. The
                    garrison must be perpetually harassed along the whole front attacked, with shot
                    and shells fired <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">ricohet.</hi> The
                    batteries for this purpose are erected on the prolongations of the works to be
                    enfiladed, from whence the defenders of the prolonged faces may be fired upon
                    with great precision and effect.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">British Gunner.</hi></p></note> It,
                    however, frequently happens, from local and other circumstances, that the
                    besiegers cannot avail themselves of the most advantageous situations for their
                    first batteries. There are four situations from which the defences of a place
                    may be destroyed, though not from all of them with equal facility. The best
                    positions for the first batteries are those before described as perpendicular to
                    the prolongations of the faces of the works to be enfiladed. If these positions
                    cannot be attained, the next that present themselves are on those sides of the
                    prolongations which take the faces in reverse, and under as small angles as
                    possible. If the ground or other circumstances will not admit of either of these
                    situations being occupied by enfilading batteries, the battery to destroy the
                    fire of the face must be without its prolongation, so as to fire obliquely upon
                    the outside of it: the fourth position in point of advantage is directly
                    parallel to the face. The guns must fire <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ricohet</hi> from the first two positions, and from the last two
                    with full charges.</p>
                <p>The second batteries are generally placed on the glacis, within fifteen or
                    eighteen feet of its crest; but if the foot of the revetment cannot be seen from
                    this situation, they must be placed in the covered-way, within fifteen feet of
                    the counterscarp.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    batteries being to effect practicable breaches in the works, they should be
                    combined, two and two together, so that while one batters in breach, the other
                    may play upon its defences. The breaching batteries shall commence by marking
                    out as nearly as possible, by their fire, the extent of the breach intended to
                    be made; first, by striking out a horizontal line as near as possible to the
                    bottom of the revetment; and next, by aiming at two others, perpendicular to and
                    at the extremities of this first line. Then, by continuing to deepen these three
                    cuts, and occasionally firing salvoes at the part to be brought down, the wall
                    will in time give way in a mass. The guns must begin by firing as low as
                    possible in the commencement of the operation, afterwards somewhat higher in the
                    same manner as before, and so continue advancing gradually upwards till the
                    breach is effected; for, should they fire too high at first, the rubbish would
                    cover the lower part of the wall, retard the operation, and tend to render the
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103868" xml:id="kp-eb0703-3868-0639"/> breach
                    impracticable. When the second batteries are placed on the glacis, or in the
                    covered-way, they must be sunk to such a depth that the terreplein of the one,
                    or surface of the other, may coincide with the soles of their embrazures. They
                    are in fact but an enlargement of the sap run for the lodgement on the glacis,
                    or in the coveredway, and should contain at least four guns each. If the space
                    between the traverses will not admit of this number at the usual distances, the
                    guns must be closed from twelve to fifteen feet of each other.</p>
                <p>The mortars are generally arranged at first in battery, adjoining the first gun
                    batteries, or upon the prolongations of the capitals of the works, in which
                    situations they are certainly least exposed; and upon the establishment of the
                    half parallels the howitzers are placed in battery, in their extremities, to
                    enfilade the branches of the coveredway. These batteries are in the most
                    advantageous situations, if, while the one bombards the work that the besieger
                    intends to assault, and prevents the garrison from throwing up intrenchments
                    within it, or at least retards their construction, the other directs its fire
                    against the defences of the breach, so that the garrison may, from the continual
                    shower of shells, &amp;c. be compelled to abandon them, or, if they persist in
                    remaining, be exposed to great loss. The small mortars are arranged in the third
                    parallel, to annoy the besieged in the places of arms.</p>
                <p>In the establishment of all these batteries, the great object is to make such an
                    arrangement of them, that they may not mask the fire of each other more than
                    cannot be avoided, and particularly that of the first or <hi rend="italic"
                    >ricohet</hi> batteries. The aggravation of this inconvenience may very well be
                    prevented till the establishment of the attack on the crest of the glacis, when
                    it becomes in some degree unavoidable: however, even the operations of the
                    glacis may be so arranged as not to mask the fire of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ricohet</hi> batteries, until the breaching batteries are in a state of great
                    forwardness.</p>
                <p>GARRISON ARTILLERY.</p>
                <p>The proportion of ordnance, ammunition, and stores required for the defence of a
                    fortified place depends not only on the particular situation of each individual
                    fortress, and its relations with the surrounding country; the system according
                    to which it is fortified, and the species of attack it may be possible to open
                    against it; but likewise on innumerable minor circumstances, each of which may
                    exert an important influence on the defence. If, for example, one or more of the
                    fronts of a place be covered by an inundation, a marsh, or by any other
                    impassable obstacle, it will manifestly require a much smaller proportion of
                    artillery for its defence than if it were equally accessible on every front. On
                    the contrary, a maritime fortress, which is susceptible of attack both by sea
                    and land, will require a larger proportion of ordnance supplies than if it were
                    assailable from only one of these points.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">British Gunner.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>It will be seen, therefore, from the above remarks and examples, how impossible
                    it is to lay down any general rules upon this important subject. The only
                    satisfactory guide which an officer charged with the nice and responsible trust
                    of arming a fortified place can with security follow, is to examine attentively
                    all parts of the works and of the surrounding country, and then to weigh every
                    other circumstance that can in any way influence the defence. He should consider
                    which of its fronts are most vulnerable, and what measures are best adapted for
                    their security.</p>
                <p>To effect this with accuracy and' expedition, he should, after a few days passed
                    in reconnoitring and studying his position, devote his attention to the
                    preparation of a sketch and profiles of the works and neighbouring country, as
                    far at least as a mile in every direction, and upon a scale adapted to the
                    features of the ground.</p>
                <p>With this map and profiles before him, he should recur to those fundamental
                    principles upon which every good attack and defence are based. He should not
                    only be thoroughly acquainted with his own particular branch of the service in
                    all its details, but capable of judging to the fullest extent of all operations
                    in which the other troops of the garrison can bear their part; so that every
                    supply may be adequate to its particular purpose, without deficiency on the one
                    hand or superfluity on the other. Thus two extremes, equally prejudicial, will
                    be avoided; the one, of making a provision insufficient for the defence which
                    the fortress is capable of sustaining; the other, of providing such a quantity
                    of supplies, that, on its capitulation, which, according to the natural order of
                    things, must sooner or later happen, if it be not relieved, a complete arsenal
                    would fall into the enemy’s hands.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>These observations being held in mind, the following general maxims will be found
                    of essential assistance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">General Maxims for arming Fortified Places.</hi></p>
                <p>1. The proportion of ordnance, ammunition, and stores should never exceed the
                    quantity absolutely necessary to a brave and resolute defence.</p>
                <p>2. Those fronts which are considered susceptible of attack should be completely
                    armed, and the remaining fronts only in part.</p>
                <p>3. These should be, for each of the faces of the bastions of such fronts as are
                    deemed liable to attack, five or six pieces of ordnance; for each of the flanks
                    of these bastions four pieces; and for the faces of the ravelin from five to
                    seven pieces of ordnance. When these are lunettes, four pieces should be
                    reckoned for each, and from two to three for each of the places of arms of the
                    covered-way. Supposing, therefore, one front to be completely armed, the
                    following proportion of ordnance will be required.</p>

                <p>making a total for one front of from 33 to 42 pieces of ordnance.</p>
                <p>4. In case of the place being liable to attack on two consecutive fronts, the
                    above proportion should be augmented one half; and if on two detached fronts, it
                    should be doubled. The remaining fronts should each be provided with such a
                    proportion of their full armaments as will secure them from insult. It will
                    appear from the above maxims, which are deduced from the best authorities on the
                    subject, that a hexagon, having only one front exposed to attack, requires an
                    armament of from 58 to 68 pieces of ordnance for its defence; and that for more
                    extensive places, from six to eight, or at most ten pieces of ordnance, should
                    be added for each additional front.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The next point to be considered is the proportion which the several kinds of
                    ordnance, and their relative calibres, should bear to each other; and Refe it
                    must be remembered that the higher rates are not the only descriptions capable
                    of being employed to advantage in the defence of a place. There are many cases
                    in which medium guns can oppose equal resistance with the heavier calibres, and
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103881" xml:id="kp-eb0703-3881-0640"/> they possess
                    the very important advantage of affording greater facility in manoeuvring and
                    transporting them from one situation to another; an operation of considerable
                    difficulty with the higher natures of ordnance at all times, but particularly
                    during a siege. They also consume less ammunition, and enable the besieged to
                    keep up a more determined and incessant fire.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The following are the proportions of the several kinds and calibres usually
                    adhered to in ordinary cases.</p>
                <p>Guns—in the proportion of two thirds of the whole armament—suppose 60.</p>
                <p>24-pounders ⅛ or 6</p>

                <p>Howitzers—one for every five guns—in this case 14.</p>

                <p>8-inch ⅜ or 7</p>
                <p>Mortars—in about the same proportion as the howitzers —in this case 16.</p>
                <p>10-in ch ⅛ or 8</p>
                <p>8-inch ⅜ or 8</p>
                <p>The above distribution of guns, howitzers, and mortars, applies equally to all
                    armaments of not less than sixty pieces of ordnance; and such an armament should
                    therefore consist of forty guns, eight howitzers, and twelve mortars. The
                    proportions of the several calibres of each kind, except those for the guns, are
                    calculated on a basis of not less than ninety pieces of ordnance; and in all
                    smaller armaments it would be advisable to confine the arrangement to two
                    calibres of each kind only.</p>
                <p>The following will be the proportion and nature of ammunition for each species of

                <p>The above proportion of ordnance and ammunition for the defence of a fortified
                    place is exclusive of one or more field batteries, which every place should
                    contain, according to its extent, and which should be provided with a double
                    proportion of ammunition. (See the preceding section on <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Field Artillery.)</hi></p>
                <p>This estimate and arrangement is founded upon the supposition that the place is
                    unprovided with casemated batteries, the armament for which must of course form
                    a separate estimate, calculated, however, upon the same principles as the
                    above.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Arrangement of the Artillery during a Siege.</hi></p>
                <p>The instant it is ascertained that the enemy’s troops are in motion towards the
                    place,—presuming that it is amply supplied with provisions, ammunition, and
                    stores, and that every precaution has been taken to collect from the vicinity
                    what might fall into the enemy’s hands,—the barbette batteries must be
                    established in the flanked angles of the bastions and ravelins, and a proportion
                    of the light guns and howitzers must be placed in the outworks and covered-way.
                    Should the body of the place have cavaliers, the heaviest guns should be mounted
                    on them. The following arrangement is usually made for the reception of the
                    investing corps, when it is not known from what point they may advance to
                    commence operations.</p>
                <p>There should be three guns mounted on the barbette of each bastion,—one 24 and
                    two 18-pounders, and three 9-pounders on the barbette of each of the ravelins.
                    In the salient places of arms of the bastions one 24-pounder howitzer, and in
                    those of the ravelins two 6-pounders. The heavy mortars should be placed one in
                    each bastion, and the remainder of the ordnance in reserve behind the curtains,
                    ready to move on whichever side it may be required.</p>
                <p>By this arrangement the whole of the barbette guns, and of the guns and howitzers
                    in the outworks and covered-way, will be in readiness to act in any direction,
                    till it is known on which side the enemy has determined to direct his attack,
                    and, with the addition of the reserve, will enable the besieged to open a fire
                    of thirty-five pieces of ordnance on the enemy the very first night he begins to
                    work upon the trenches. In the first moments of the investment, however, the
                    artillery of the place should not endeavour, by a useless expenditure of
                    ammunition, to disturb the besiegers in their operations: it is only when they
                    are making permanent dispositions for their establishment that the fire of the
                    place should be opened upon them. It is nevertheless necessary that some guns
                    should be loaded with reduced charges, to protect the retreat of the advanced
                    posts, and mislead the enemy as to their range. This is also the moment, if the
                    garrison be numerous, and composed of good troops, to annoy the besiegers, by
                    sorties on different points of the line of contravallation, and to retard the
                    works necessary for establishing their communications: care must, however, be
                    taken not to purchase this advantage by a loss of men and artillery, which would
                    cripple the means of defence.</p>
                <p>The day succeeding the night on which the trenches are opened, and the front of
                    attack determined, a new disposition of the artillery of the place must be made
                    as follows :—</p>
                <p>The 24 and 18-pounders must be removed to the front attacked, and the other
                    batteries, if necessary, supplied with 12-pounders. The barbettes of the
                    bastions on this front must have each five guns, three 24 and two 18- pounders,
                    and the remaining 18-pounders arranged behind the curtains,—two towards each of
                    the extremities <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103894" xml:id="kp-eb0703-3894-0641"
                    />of’the front curtain, and two at the farthest extremity of each of the
                    collateral curtains. The howitzers in reserve should be placed, two in each of
                    the salient angles of the covered-way of the bastions of this front, and two in
                    each of those of the collateral bastions, which, with those already there, must
                    fire <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">ricohet</hi> down the
                    prolongations of the capitals. There should also be three 6-pounders in the
                    salient place of arms of the ravelin of the front attacked, and three in each of
                    those of the two collateral ravelins; these guns should fire over the
                    palisading: and, lastly, there should be five 9-pounders on the barbette of the
                    front ravelin. This arrangement will bring fifty-two guns and howitzers and
                    four* mortars to fire on the approaches, after the first night. This, with a few
                    variations, will be the disposition of the artillery of the place till the
                    besiegers’ first batteries are ready to open. The instant they begin to work
                    upon these batteries, the whole fire of the place must be concentrated on them,
                    and the mortars which had previously fired at low angles must now fire with
                    greater elevation, but at all times sparingly.</p>
                <p>As soon as the enemy’s batteries are fairly established, the guns <hi
                    rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">barbette</hi> must be covered by merlons,
                    and the embrazures occasionally masked. While this work is carrying on, the
                    situations of the guns should be changed, and new directions given to them; as
                    by frequently practising this manoeuvre, the enemy will also be obliged to
                    change his dispositions of attack, and time will thereby be gained by the
                    besieged. As the enemy approaches towards the second parallel, the fire of the
                    place must be spread over all parts of his line of operations; and with a view
                    of contributing to this object, royal and coehorn mortars should be disposed in
                    the places of arms and branches of the covered-way. When the approaches are
                    carried on from the second parallel, and the enemy is about to establish the
                    demi-places of arms, the fire of the place must be concentrated on the <hi
                    rend="italic">debouches</hi> from the parallel, and multiplied with all possible
                    activity.</p>
                <p>In proportion as the besieger pushes forward his approaches to the third
                    parallel, the artillery njust be withdrawn from the covered-way to the ravelins,
                    or to the ditch, if dry, or to any other favourable situation, and by degrees,
                    as they advance, to the body of the place. During this period of the siege the
                    embrazures must be prepared in the flanks, in the curtain which joins them, and
                    in those parts of the faces of the bastions which command the ditch of the front
                    ravelin. All these embrazures must he ready to open, and the heavy artillery
                    mounted in them, the moment the enemy attempts to form a lodgment on the glacis.
                    We have now arrived at the crisis of the siege, and every effort should be made
                    to take advantage of this favourable moment, when the enemy, by his own works,
                    must mask his former batteries, and before he is able to open his new ones.</p>
                <p>EXERCISE OF ARTILLERY.</p>
                <p>The several exercises are divided into three classes, as follows :—</p>
                <p>1. Exercise of field artillery.</p>
                <p>2. Exercise of garrison or siege artillery.</p>
                <p>3. Exercise of the various machines employed in the manoeuvres of garrison or
                    siege artillery.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Exercise of Field Artillery.</hi></p>
                <p>The complement of men for the service of each gun or howitzer is, one
                    non-commissioned officer and eight gunners.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Numbering and Telling Off the Detachments.</hi></p>
                <p>The several detachments being arranged right in front, are numbered and told off
                    by their respective non-com- '. missioned officers in the following manner:</p>
                <p>The non-commissioned officer is invariably No. 1, and is responsible for the
                    proper execution of the duties of the other numbers of his detachment. The
                    right-hand man of the rear rank is named No. 2; his front-rank man No. 3; the
                    second man from the right of the rear rank No. 4; and his front-rank man No. 5;
                    and so on in succession from the right of the rear to the left of the front
                    rank, till the numbering of the whole detachment is completed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Formation in Order of March, or for Exercise.</hi></p>
                <p>When detachments are formed in the order of march, or for the purpose of
                    exercise, the even numbers are almost invariably on the right or off-side of the
                    gun, and the odd numbers on the left or near side.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Positions of the several Numbers in Action.</hi></p>
                <p>No. 1 is on the left of the handspike; No. 2 outside the right wheel, in line
                    with the muzzle; No. 3 outside the left wheel, and also in line with the muzzle;
                    No. 4 clear of the right wheel, covering No. 2, and in line with the breech; No.
                    5 clear of the left wheel, covering No. 3, and also in line with the breech; No.
                    6 five paces in rear of and covering the left wheel; No. 7 in rear of the
                    limber; No. 8 ten yards in rear of the gun, in line with the heads of the
                    leading horses of the limber; and No. 9 attends the ammunition-waggon.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Duties of the several Numbers.</hi></p>
                <p>No. 1 points and commands; No. 2 sponges; No. 3 loads; No. 4 serves the vent and
                    primes; No. 5 fires; No. 6 serves No. 3 with ammunition; No. 7 supplies No. 6
                    with ammunition, and, when firing shells, fixes the fuses; No. 8 assists No. 7,
                    and occasionally relieves No. 2, or, when attached to 5⅜ inch or 24-pounder
                    howitzers, provides No. 3 with shells; No. 9 assists in preparing
                    ammunition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Limbering up, or Retiring from Action.</hi></p>
                <p>This manoeuvre may be performed, according to circumstances, to the front, rear,
                    right, or left. In limbering up to the front, the limber drives up to the right
                    of the gun. No. 2 instantly passes his sponge over the axletree to No. 4, who
                    straps on the sponge head; No. 2 and No. 3 go round to the trail; No. 4 and No.
                    5 man the wheels, assisted by No. 7 and No. 8 with heavy guns. The right wheel
                    is run back, the left forward, and No. 1 and No. 6 throw the trail round in the
                    opposite direction to that in which the limber drives up. The instant the trail
                    is round, No. 1 unships his handspike, and No. 5 straps it on; No. 2 buckles on
                    the rammer-head of his sponge, and the whole fall in close to the wheels. No. 6,
                    No. 4, and No. 2 on one side, No. 5, No. 3, and No. 1 on the other; No. 7
                    attends the limber, and No. 8 moves up to his place. On the limber coming up
                    square to the front, No. 1 orders, “halt, limber up,” upon which No. 4 and No. 5
                    man the wheels, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 6, lift the trail and place it on the
                    pintail; No. 1 then puts in the key, and the detachment mount, or fall into the
                    order of march. The duties are precisely the same in limbering up to the rear,
                    right, or left, except that in limbering up to the right or left, the trail and
                    limber both go to the right or left; and in limbering up to the rear, the limber
                    drives up rather to the right of the trail, which is not thrown round, and then
                    reverses to the left.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Unlimbering or coming into Action.</hi></p>
                <p>This is precisely the reverse of the preceding manoeuvre. No. 1 unkeys the
                    pintail, No. 2 and No. 3 raise the trail, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103907"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-3907-0642"/>and when it is clear No. 1 gives the word, “Drive
                    on ;” upon which the limber goes off to the left about, and the trail is thrown
                    to the right about, the other numbers assisting as they arrive, the same as in
                    limbering up, No. 6 at the trail with heavy guns, and No. 4 and No. 5 at the
                    wheels. As soon as the trail is down, No. 5 unbuckles the handspike, and No. 1
                    ships it; No. 2 unstraps the rammer-head and goes to his place; No. 4 unstraps
                    the sponge, and passes it over to No. 2. When the limber is sufficiently to the
                    rear, it reverses to its left, and halts ten yards in rear of and covering its
                    gun. The ammunitionwaggon also reverses to its left, goes off in front of the
                    limber, and again reversing to its left, halts one horse’s length in rear of the
                    gun-limber. No. 1 is responsible for the correct dressing of his gun when it
                    comes into action; and for this purpose, immediately after the trail is in its
                    proper direction he should place himself in line with the axle-tree of the gun
                    upon which the formation is made, and dress his own gun with it. This position
                    will enable him to see, not only that his gun is in its true <hi rend="italic"
                    >alignement,</hi> but also that it is square to the front.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Exercise of Garrison or Siege Artillery.</hi></p>
                <p>This second branch of the exercises relates to the manner of working and serving
                    guns, howitzers, carronades, and mortars, on batteries. The complement of men
                    for the service of garrison or battery guns is, for the 42- pounder and
                    32-pounder, one non-commissioned officer and six gunners each; for the
                    24-pounder, one non-commissioned officer and five gunners; for the 18-pounder,
                    ane non-commissioned officer and four gunners; and for the 12-pounder and
                    9-pounder, one non-commissioned afficer and three gunners each. The complement
                    of men, duties, &amp;c. are precisely the same for howitzers and car- <hi

                <p>All calculations for the daily service of guns on bat- ;eries, whether in
