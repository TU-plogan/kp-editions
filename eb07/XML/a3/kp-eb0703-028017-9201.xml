                    <hi rend="superscript"> was</hi> born in the island of Cos, and flourished in
                    the time of Alexander the Great, with whom he was in high favour. He executed a
                    picture of this prince holdin" a thunderbolt in his hand,—a piece finished with
                    so much skill and dexterity, that it used to be said there were two Alexanders;
                    one invincible, the son of Philip; the other inimitable, the production of
                    Apelles. Alexander gave him a remarkable proof of his regard; for when he
                    employed Apelles to draw Campaspe, one of his mistresses, having found that he
                    had conceived an affection for her, he resigned her to him; and it was from her
                    that Apelles is said to have drawn his Venus Anadyomene.</p>
                <p>One of Apelles’s chief excellencies was his making his pictures exactly resemble
                    the persons represented; but what is called <hi rend="italic">grace</hi> was the
                    characteristic of this artist. His pencil was so famous for drawing fine lines,
                    that Protogenes discovered by a single line that Apelles had been at his house.
                    Protogenes lived at Rhodes: Apelles sailed thither, and went to his house with
                    great eagerness to see the works of an artist who was known to him only by name.
                    Protogenes was gone from home, but an old woman was left watching a large piece
                    of canvass, which was fitted in a frame for painting. She told Apelles that
                    Protogenes was gone out; and asked him his name, that she might inform her
                    master who had inquired for him. “Tell him,” said Apelles, “he was inquired for
                    by this person at the same time taking up a pencil, he drew on the canvass a
                    line of great delicacy. When Protogenes returned, the old woman acquainted him
                    with what had happened. That artist, upon contemplating the fine stroke of the
                    line, immediately pronounced that Apelles had been there, for so finished a work
                    could be produced by no other person. Protogenes, however, himself drew a finer
                    line of another colour, and, as he was going away, ordered the old woman to show
                    that line to Apelles if he came again; and to say, “This is the person for whom
                    you are inquiring.” Apelles returned and saw the line: he would not for shame be
                    overcome; and therefore, in a colour different from either of the former, he
                    drew some lines so exquisitely delicate that it was utterly impossible for finer
                    strokes to be made. Protogenes now confessed the superiority of Apelles, flew to
                    the harbour in search of him, and resolved to leave the canvass with the lines
                    on it for the astonishment of future artists.</p>
                <p>Apelles showed great liberality of mind towards Protogenes. With ideas enlarged
                    by education and literature, ĥe was incapable of harbouring little jealousies of
                    noble competitors; on the contrary, he was the first who made the works of
                    Protogenes to be valued as they deserved among the Rhodians. He acknowledged
                    that Protogenes was in some respects superior to himself; but that in one
                    particular he himself excelled, viz. in knowing when to take his hand from the
                    picture, an art which Protogenes had not yet learned, and therefore over-worked
                    his pieces. Apelles equally disapproved of too elaborate diligence, or too hasty
                    negligence if i execution. /1 studied work of Protogenes he esteemed less on the
                    one account; and on the other, when a silly painter once brought him a picture,
                    and said, “This I painted in a hurry,” he replied, “Though you had not told me
                    so, I perceived it was painted in haste; but I wonder you could not execute more
                    such pieces in the same time.”</p>
                <p>There are two stories related of Apelles, which show hm to be at once an artist
                    of modesty, in amending even trifling improprieties, when pointed out to him by
                    competent judges, and yet of self-confidence sufficient to make him know the
                    perfection and value of his own paintings. It was customary with Apelles to
                    expose to public view the works which he fiad finished, and to hide himself
                    behind the picture, in order to hear the remarks passed on it by persons who
                    chanced to view it. He once overheard himself blamed by a shoemaker for a fault
                    in the slippers of some picture: he corrected the fault which the man had
                    noticed; but on the day following the shoemaker began to animadvert on the leg;
                    upon which Apelles with some anger looked out from behind the canvass, and bade
                    him keep to his own province, “Ne sutor ultra crepidam.” It is well known that
                    Alexander forbade any one besides Apelles to paint his portrait. We are not,
                    however, to conclude from this that Alexander was a more skilful judge of
                    painting than he was of poetry. Like Augustus, he cherished the fine arts more
                    from vanity than taste. A remarkable proof is given of this prince’s inability
                    to discern merit, and of the painter’s freedom in expressing the mortification
                    he felt, when a work of his was not sufficiently commended. “Alexander,” says
                    Aelian, lib. ii. c. 3. Var. Hist. “having viewed the picture of himself which
                    was at Ephesus, did not praise it as it deserved. But when a horse was brought
                    in, and neighed at seeing the figure of a horse in the picture, as though it had
                    been a real horse, <hi rend="italic">0</hi><hi rend="italic">king!</hi> said
                    Apelles, <hi rend="italic">this horse seems to be by far a better judge of
                    painting than you.”</hi> It happened more than once that the horses drawn by him
                    were mistaken for real ones, by living horses which saw and neighed at the
                    pictures. In his finishing a drawing of this animal, a remarkable circumstance
                    is related of him. He had painted a horse returning from battle, and had
                    succeeded to his wishes in describing every other mark that could indicate a
                    mettlesome steed impatient of restraint; there was wanting nothing but a foam of
                    a bloody hue issuing from the mouth. He again and again endeavoured to express
                    this, but his attempts were unsuccessful. At last, with vexation, he threw
                    against the reins of the horse a sponge which had in it many colours; a mixture
                    of which coming out of the sponge, and tinging the reins, produced the very
                    effect desired by the painter.</p>
                <p>The works of Apelles were all admired; but the most celebrated were the picture
                    of Alexander in the temple of Diana at Ephesus, and that of Venus emerging from
                    the sea. Alexander was drawn with thunder in his hand; and such relief was
                    produced by the <hi rend="italic">chiaroscuro</hi> in this piece, that the
                    fingers seemed to shoot forward, and the thunderbolt to be out of the picture.
                    His Venus <hi rend="italic">Avabvομwn</hi> was esteemed the most exquisite
                    figure which the pencil could create.</p>
