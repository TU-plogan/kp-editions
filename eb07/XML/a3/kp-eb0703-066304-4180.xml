                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">ASCHAM, <hi rend="smallcaps">Roger</hi></label>, a very
                    distinguished scholar and Writer, was born at Kirby Wiske, a village in
                    Yorkshire, near Northallerton, about the year 1515. John Ascham, his father, was
                    house-steward in the family of Scroop, and by his wife, Margaret, was connected
                    with several respectable families. A short time before his death, Sir Anthony
                    Winfield, having conceived a predilection for his third son Roger, took him into
                    his family, and extended his bounty so far as to give him the advantage of a
                    private education along with his own sons. Under a domestic tutor he made a
                    rapid progress in classical learning, and early discovered a great partiality
                    for reading. The superiority of genius and docility of temper which he
                    constantly displayed induced his patron to send him to’St John’s College,
                    Cambridge, in the year 1530.</p>
                <p>The revival of Grecian and Roman literature at the period Ascham entered upon his
                    studies was peculiarly favourable to the natural bent of his inclination. A
                    desire of excelling uniformly influenced his conduct, and, adopting the maxim,
                    <hi rend="italic">Qui docet, discit,</hi> he began to teach boys the rudiments
                    of the Greek language as soon as he was acquainted with the elementary parts
                    himself. His plan was approved by Pember, and under the direction of this
                    valuable friend he soon became acquainted with the best Greek and Latin authors.
                    But he took particular delight in reading Cicero and Caesar, and upon them
                    formed the elegance of his Latin style, which proved so honourable and so
                    advantageous in the after part of his life.</p>
                <p>Ascham took his first degree of bachelor of arts in his 18th year, and was chosen
                    fellow of the college about a month afterwards. The favourable disposition,
                    however, which he manifested towards the reformed religion was no small obstacle
                    in the way of his preferment. He was elected master of arts in the year 1537,
                    and about this period he began to act in the capacity of a tutor.</p>
                <p>His reputation for Greek learning soon brought him many pupils; and these were so
                    well instructed that several of them afterwards rose to considerable eminence,
                    Of these William Grindall was one of the most distinguished, who obtained the
                    station of master of languages to the lady Elizabeth, upon the recommendation of
                    Sir John Cheke. It appears uncertain why Ascham himself was not appointed to
                    that honourable station; but his partiality for the university seems, from a
                    hint in one of his letters, to have been the cause. At that period there was no
                    particular chair appropriated to the Greek language, but Ascham was appointed by
                    the university to read lectures upon that language in the schools. A dispute
                    arose in the university at that time about the pronunciation of the Greek
                    language, in which Ascham first opposed the method observed by Sir John Cheke
                    and Sir Thomas Smith; but, upon more mature deliberation, he adopted that
                    method, which has ever since been practised in the English schools. Both on
                    account of the beauty of his handwriting, and the purity and elegance of his
                    Latin, he was employed to write the public letters of the university.</p>
                <p>By the advice of his friend Pember, he turned his attention to the study of
                    instrumental music, and thereby enlivened his leisure hours, and prepared his
                    mind for renewed exertion. In his study he also amused himself with embellishing
                    the pages of his manuscripts with beautiful draughts, and in the field he joined
                    in the diversion of the bow and arrow. The learned Ascham did not deem his
                    labour improperly bestowed in writing a book entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Toxopliilus,</hi> in an age when the proper use of the bow was of more
                    importance than for mere amusement. This work was written in a more natural,
                    easy, and truly English diction than had hitherto been in use; and it also
                    abounds with many beautiful allusions and curious fragments of English history.
                    Ascham candidly acknowledges, that being anxious to make the tour of Italy,
                    which was then the great republic of letters, and particularly of Grecian
                    literature, he wished, by dedicating his book to the king, to obtain a pension,
                    to enable him to make that tour. It reflects some lustre on the benevolence of
                    Henry VIII. that in the year 1544 he settled upon him an annual pension of L.10,
                    which Dr Johnson, considering the circumstances of the times, estimates at the
                    value of L.100. Upon the death of Henry this pension was for some time
                    discontinued; but it was again renewed by Edward VI., and doubled by Queen Mary.
                    In the same year, also, Ascham obtained the ap-pointaient<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193104193" xml:id="kp-eb0703-4193-0664"/> of orator to the university;
                    an office which he retained with great reputation during the period he was
                    connected with the university.</p>
                <p>For some years he received an annual gratuity from Lee, archbishop of York, but
                    to what amount is not recorded; and, in 1548, upon the death of his pupil
                    Grindall, preceptor to the lady Elizabeth, his pupils and writings had acquired
                    him such celebrity, that he was appointed to direct the studies of that
                    princess. He successfully acquitted himself in that honourable charge; but two
                    years after, from some unknown cause of dissatisfaction, he returned to the
                    university, having taken an abrupt leave of the princess. This part of his
                    conduct did not lessen him in the esteem of Elizabeth; for in the same year she
                    recalled him to court, and appointed him secretary to Sir Richard Morisine,
                    ambassador to the emperor Charles V. In his way to London he paid a visit to
                    Lady Jane Gray, whom he found in her chamber reading Plato’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phoedo,</hi> in Greek, “and that,” says he, “with as much delight as some
                    gentlemen would read a merry tale in Boccace while the duke and duchess, and the
                    rest of the household, were hunting in the park.</p>
                <p>In the character of secretary to Sir Richard, besides aiding him in the
                    management of his public affairs, he also conducted his private studies. During
                    the mornings of four days in the week he read with him a portion of Herodotus or
                    Demosthenes, and in the evenings some pages of Sophocles or Euripides; and on
                    the other mornings he wrote the letters of public business, and on the evenings
                    he either wrote his own private letters or continued his diary and remarks.
                    While Ascham was on his travels, he made a short excursion to Italy; but was
                    much disgusted with the manners of the people, especially of the Venetians.
                    After his return from that tour, he favoured the world with a curious tract,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">A Report and Discourse of the Affairs and State of
                    Germany,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Upon the death of Edward VI. Morisine was recalled, and Ascham returned to the
                    university. But through the interest of Bishop Gardiner, the fortune of Ascham
                    soon took a favourable turn, who, although he knew him to be a Protestant,
                    obtained him the office of Latin secretary to the queen, with liberty to retain
                    his university emoluments, and the additional salary of L.10 a-year. The
                    prudence of Ascham enabled him to act a respectable part, both under the
                    intolerant reign of Mary, and also in the most perilous situations during the
                    reign of Eliźa-beth; and the readiness and elegance of his Latin style rendered
                    him a useful member at court. He is reported to have written, during the course
                    of three days, 47 letters to persons in the highest ranks of life.</p>
                <p>When the crown passed to a Protestant prince, it made little alteration in the
                    condition of Ascham, who still retained his station. He spent several hours
                    every day in reading the learned languages with the queen, and her proficiency
                    was equal to his labours; and it might have been expected that his rewards would
                    have been more ample than L.20 per annum, together with the prebend of Westwang.
                    Some have alleged that the queen kept him poor because he was addicted to
                    cock-fighting, and in other respects extravagant; but the defects in his
                    character should not have deprived him of the rewards due to actual
                    services.</p>
                <p>In consequence of a conversation which took place in the apartment of secretary
                    Cecil, upon the subject of education, Sir Richard Sackville, who was present,
                    requested him to write a book on the general subject of education. This work is
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">The Schoolmaster,</hi> and contains many excellent
                    instructions to the teachers of youth. It was published by his widow after his
                    death. By too close application to composing a poem, which he intended to
                    present to the queen on the new-year’s day of 1569, he was seized with an
                    illness which proved fatal, and died on the 23d of December 1568. His death was
                    universally lamented, and the queen expressed her regret by saying, that “she
                    would rather have lost L.10,000 than her tutor Ascham.” His epistles, which are
                    valuable both on account of their style and historical information, were
                    published after his death, and dedicated to the queen: the best edition is that
                    of Mr Elstob, published at Oxford in 1703. His English works were published in
                    4to, with a life by Dr Johnson, in 1767. This edition has been reprinted in
                    8vo.</p>
