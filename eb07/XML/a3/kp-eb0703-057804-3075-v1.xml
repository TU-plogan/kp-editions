                    eminent physician, poet, and miscellaneous writer, was born in Castletown
                    parish, Roxburghshire, where his father and brother were ministers; completed
                    his education in the university of Edinburgh, where he took his degree in
                    physic, February 4, 1732, with much reputation; and published his thesis, as·
                    the forms of that university require; the subject of which was <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Tabe Purulenta.</hi> In 1735 he published a little
                    hu-. morous fugitive pamphlet in 8vo, entitled <hi rend="italic">An Essay for
                    abridging the Study of Physic</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">to
                    which is added, a Diα&gt; logue betwixt Hygeia, Mercury, and Pluto, relating to
                    thf practice of Physic as it is managed by a certain illustrious Society</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">as also an Epistle from Usbeck the Persian
                    to Joshua Ward, Esq.</hi> This piece contains much fun and. drollery; in the
                    dialogue, he has caught the very spirit of Lucian. In 1737 he published <hi
                    rend="italic">A Synopsis of the History and Cure of the Venereal Disease,</hi>
                    8vo. This was soon followed by the <hi rend="italic">Economy of Love,</hi> a
                    poem which has much merit, but, it must be confessed, is too strongly tinctured
                    with the licentiousness of Ovid. It is said, however, that his maturer judgment
                    expunged many of the luxuriances of youthful fancy, in an edition “revised and
                    corrected by the author” in 1768. It appears by one of the cases on literary
                    property, that Mr Millar paid 50 guineas for the copy-right of this poem, which
                    was intended as a burlesque on some didactic writers. It has been observed of Dr
                    Armstrong, that his works have great inequalities, some of them being possessed
                    of every requisite to be sought after in the most perfect composition, while
                    others can hardly be considered as superior to the productions of mediocrity.
                    <hi rend="italic">The Art of preserving Health,</hi> which was published in
                    1744, is his best performance. In 1746 Dr Armstrong was appointed one of the
                    physicians to the hospital for lame and sick soldiers behind Buckingham House.
                    In 1751 he published his poem <hi rend="italic">On Benevolence,</hi> in folio;
                    and in 1753, <hi rend="italic">Taste, an Epistle to a young Critic.</hi> In 1758
                    appeared <hi rend="italic">Sketches or Essays on various subjects, by Launcelot
                    Temple Esq. in two parts.</hi> Tn this production, which possesses much humour
                    and knowledge of the world, and which had a remarkably rapid sale, he is
                    supposed to have been assisted by Mr Wilkes. In 1760 he was appointed physician
                    to the army in Germany, where, in 1761, he wrote a poem called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Day, an Epistle to John Wilkes of Aylesbury, Esq.</hi> In this poem, which is
                    not collected in his works, he wantonly hazarded a reflection on Churchill,
                    which drew on him the vengeance of that severest of satirists. In 1770 Dr
                    Armstrong published a collection of Miscellanies, in 2 vols., containing, I, The
                    Art of preserving Health; 2, Of Benevolence, an Epistle to Eumenes; 3, Taste, an
                    Epistle to a young Critic, 1753; 4, Imitations of Shakspeare and Spenser; 5, The
                    Universal Almanack, by Noureddin Ali; 6, The Forced Marriage, a tragedy; 7,
                    Sketches. In 1771 he published A <hi rend="italic">short Ramble through some
                    parts of France and Italy, by Launcelot Temple</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    in 1773, in his own name, a quarto pamphlet, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Medical Essays</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> towards the conclusion
                    of which he accounts for his not having such extensive practice as some of his
                    brethren, from his not being qualified to employ the usual means. He complains
                    much of the behaviour of some of his brethren, of the herd of critics, and
                    particularly of the reviewers. He died in September 1779.</p>
