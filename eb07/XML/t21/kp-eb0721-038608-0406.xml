                <p><label type="entry">TRINIDAD</label>, the largest of the windward West India
                    Islands, is separated from the province of Venezuela by the Gulf of Paria, and
                    at one point is not more than twenty miles from the American continent. It is
                    situated between 10° and 11° north latitude, and 61° and 62° west longitude. The
                    island is nearly square, being generally about fifty miles long by thirty broad;
                    but from the furthest point (Hicacos) on the south-west to the furthest point on
                    the north-west (Point Galera), it reaches to above ninety miles, and contains an
                    area of 2020 square miles. lt was discovered by Columbus on the 31st July 1498,
                    and taken possession of by the Spaniards in 1588. Sir Walter Raleigh visited it
                    in 1595, and committed some outrages in the capital. In 1797 it was captured by
                    Sir Ralph Abercromby, and has remained a British settlement ever since. The
                    richness of its soil, the luxuriance of its vegetation, its finely wooded hills,
                    beautiful rivers, and magnificent landscapes, have distinguished Trinidad as the
                    <hi rend="italic">Indian Paradise.</hi> This island is evidently a section of
                    the opposite continent, disjoined either by a volcanic or oceanic eruption. The
                    same strata of earth, the same rocks and fossils, are common to both. Besides
                    several craters and volcanoes in the island, there are two submarine volcanoes,
                    one south of Cape de la Brea, and the other in the Bay of Meyaro. But the most
                    remarkable phenomenon in the island is the asphaltum or pitch lake, situated on
                    a small peninsula, and occupying the highest part of the point of land. It is
                    nearly circular, and more than a mile and a half in length. It is remarkable for
                    the extraordinary mutability of its surface; the small islet of the evening
                    being often found a gulf in the morning, and this again is succeeded by another
                    islet, adorned with the most luxuriant vegetation. The usual appearance and
                    consistence of the asphaltum is that of pit-coal, but of a grayish colour,
                    melting like sealing-wax, and in hot weather it is actually liquid an inch deep.
                    It is rendered ductile by a gentle heat, and when mixed with grease or pitch,
                    acquires fluidity. The highest mountain-range is on the north, near the coast,
                    some parts of which reach an elevation of nearly 3000 feet. There are also
                    chains of hills, but of <pb break="no"

                    />less elevation, in the centre and on the south coast. They all run from east
                    to west. The island has the advantage of numerous streams, some of them
                    navigable by small vessels. The exports amounted in 1832 to L.235,657, of which
                    L.220,168 was for sugar and molasses. The imports for the same period amounted
                    to L.229,697. Port of Spain, the capital, contains a population of 9869, of whom
                    1489 are whites. The population of the island in 1832 consisted of, whites,
                    3683; free blacks, 16,302; slaves, 20,265; total, 46,250. In the island there
                    are eight free schools with 373 scholars, and twenty-two private schools with
                    412 scholars.</p>
