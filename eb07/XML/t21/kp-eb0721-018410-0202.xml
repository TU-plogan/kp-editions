                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                    Terentius</hi></label>, acomic poet of great celebrity, was born at Carthage in
                    the year 192 before the commencement of the Christian era. At an early age he
                    became a captive, and was sold as a slave to Terentius Lucanus, a Roman senator,
                    to whom he appears to have been indebted for a learned education. His manners
                    and accomplishments recommended him not only to his master, but likewise to
                    other men of rank, whose names have been recorded. Having been manumitted, he
                    attained to great eminence as a writer of Latin comedies. He was honoured with
                    the friendship of Laelius, and of Scipio the son of Paulus Aemilius; and his
                    dramas are even supposed to have derived some of their chief beauties from their
                    patrician pens. Such insinuations have not been uncommon in various eras of
                    literary history; but some doubt may reasonably be entertained whether Scipio or
                    Laelius could have produced even the second-rate scenes of Terence’s comedies.
                    They exhibit a uniform vein of elegant simplicity, in which we discover no
                    reason to suspect a divided property. His plots are derived from Greek sources,
                    chiefly from Menander; but the terse Latinity and graceful diction are
                    peculiarly his own. Caesar considered the want of pungent humour, the <hi
                    rend="italic">vis comica,</hi> as the chief defect of his dramas.</p>
                <p>Lenibus atque utinam scriptis adjuncta forat via Comica, ut acquato virtus
                    polleret honore Cum Graecis, neque in hac despectus parte jaceres.</p>
                <p>The comedies of Terence appear to have been very successful on the stage, but he
                    did not long continue his prosperous career. According to Eusebius, he died in
                    Arcadia; and Suetonius refers his death to the consulship of Cn. Corn. Dolabella
                    and M. Fulvius Nobilior, that is, to the year 159 before Christ. According to
                    this chronology, he must only have attained the age of thirty-three; but the
                    latter writer states that he had not completed his thirty-fifth year. The
                    circumstances of his death are variously related, and one account ascribes it to
                    shipwreck. He left an only daughter, who became the wife of a Roman knight, and
                    inherited a garden of twenty acres in the Via Appia.</p>

                <p>He had a tawny complexion, with a slender frame, and a moderate stature.</p>
                <p>Of the six comedies of Terence, the editions are very numerous, and not a few
                    appeared before the termination of the first half century of printing. The <hi
                    rend="italic">editio princeps,</hi> a folio without date, is supposed to have
                    been printed at Strasburg by Mentelin. Seventeen editions, the first in 1517,
                    proceeded from the Aldine press. Of the earlier editions, the most important is
                    that of Gabriel Faërnus, Florent. 1565, 8vo. Faërnus was a man of taste as well
                    as learning, and, being himself a very skilful versifier,<note anchored="true"

                    some eminent qualifications as an editor of Terence. To his text many succeeding
                    editors have chiefly adhered. Another valuable edition was published by
                    Lindenbrog, Paris. 1602, 4to, Francof. 1623, 4to. Passing many others, we arrive
                    at the edition of Bishop Hare, Loud. 1724, 1725, 4to. It was speedily followed
                    by that of Bentley, Cantab. 1726, 4to, Amst. 1727, 4to. Another elaborate
                    edition, differing however in many respects, was about the same time published
                    by Westerhov, Hag. Com. 1726, 2 tom. 4to. There are many subsequent editions,
                    some of a very recent date. One edition was professedly published for men of
                    taste; “in usum elegantiorum hominum edidit F. H. Bothe.” Berolini, 1806, 8vo. A
                    good translation of Terence, into blank verse, was executed by the elder George
                    Colman, Lond. 1765, 4to.</p>
