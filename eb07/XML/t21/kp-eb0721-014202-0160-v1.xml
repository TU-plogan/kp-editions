                <p>The history of the invention of the telescope has been given in our article <hi

                    chap. 4), where two particular constructions of the instrument, viz. that of
                    Professor Barlow and Mr Rogers, are described; and also the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dorpat telescope,</hi> of which a figure is there given. At the time that
                    article was written, this was the most powerful instrument of the kind that had
                    ever been directed to the heavens, its object-glass being 9½ inches in diameter,
                    and focal length about 14 feet. Now, however, the University of Cambridge
                    possesses an instrument still more powerful, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Northumberland Equatorial,</hi> so called in honour of the noble duke by whom
                    it was presented to the university in the year 1838. The object-glass of this
                    magnificent telescope is 11½ clear inches in diameter, and its focal length 19
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> feet. A particular
                    description of it has been given in the eleventh volume of the Cambridge
                    Astronomical Observations. There is another telescope of still larger dimensions
                    in the possession of an amateur astronomer, Mr Cooper of Sligo. The diameter of
                    the object-glass is 13∙3 inches, and the focal length 21 feet 3 inches.</p>
                <p>The general aim in the construction of a telescope is, to form, by means of
                    mirrors or lenses, an image of the distant object, as large, as bright, and as
                    extensive as is possible, consistently with distinctness; and then to view the
                    image with a magnifying glass in any convenient manner. This gives us an
                    arrangement of our subject. We shall first show the principles of construction
                    of the object-glass or mirror, so that it shall form an image of the distant
                    object with these qualities; and then show bow to construct the magnifying glass
                    or eye-piece, so as to preserve them unimpaired.</p>
                <p>This indistinctness which we wish to avoid arises from two causes; the spherical
                    figures of the refracting and reflecting surfaces, and the different
                    refrangibility of the differently coloured rays of light. The first may be
                    called the <hi rend="italic">spherical</hi> and the second the <hi rend="italic"
                    >chromatic</hi> indistinctness; and the deviations from the foci may be called
                    the <hi rend="italic">spherical</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">chromatic</hi>
                    aberrations.</p>
                <p>The limits of a work like this will not permit us to give any more of the
                    doctrine of aberrations than is absolutely necessary for the construction of
                    achromatic telescopes; and we must refer the reader for a general view of the
                    whole to Euler’s Dioptrics, also to Dr Smith’s Optics. We shall begin with the
                    aberration of colour.</p>
                <p>Let white or compounded light fall perpendicularly on the flat side PQ (fig. 1)
                    of a plano-convex lens PV Q, whose axis is CV and vertex V. The white ray <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> P falling on the extremity of the lens is dispersed by
                    refraction at the point P of the spherical surface, and the red ray goes to the
                    point <hi rend="italic">r</hi> of the axis, and the violet ray to the point <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi>. In like manner, the white ray <hi rend="italic">q</hi> Q
                    is dispersed by refraction at Q, the red ray going to <hi rend="italic">r</hi>,
                    and the violet to <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> The red ray Pr crosses the violet
                    ray Q <hi rend="italic">v</hi> in a point D, and Q <hi rend="italic">r</hi>
                    crosses P <hi rend="italic">v</hi> in a point E; and the whole light refracted
                    and dispersed by the circumference whose diameter is PQ, passes through the
                    circular area, whose diameter is DE. Supposing that the lens is of such a form
                    that it would collect red rays, refracted by its whole surface in the point <hi
                    rend="italic">r,</hi> and violet in the point <hi rend="italic">v</hi>; then it
                    is evident that the whole light which occupies the surface of the lens will pass
                    through this little circle, whose diameter is DE. Therefore white light issuing
                    from a point so distant that the rays may be considered as parallel, will not be
                    collected <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=161"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0161-0143"/> in another point or focus, but will be dispersed
                    over the surface of that little circle, which is therefore called the <hi
                    rend="italic">circle of chromatic dispersion;</hi> and the radiant point will be
                    represented by this circle. The neighbouring points are in like manner
                    represented by circles; and these circles, encroaching on and mixing with each
                    other, must occasion haziness or confusion, and render the picture indistinct.
                    This indistinctness will be greater in the proportion of the number of circles
                    which are in this manner mixed together. This will be in the proportion of the
                    room that is for them; that is, in proportion to the area of the circle, or in
                    the duplicate proportion of its diameter. Our first business therefore is to
                    obtain measures of this diameter, and to mark the connection between it and the
                    aperture and focal distance of the lens.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">i</hi> be to <hi rend="italic">r</hi> as the sine of
                    incidence in glass to the sine of refraction of the red rays; and let <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> be to <hi rend="italic">v</hi> as the sine of incidence to
                    the sine of refraction of the violet rays. Then we say, that when the aperture
                    PQ is moderate, <hi rend="italic">v — r: r + r —</hi> 2 <hi rend="italic">i</hi>
                    = DE: PQ very nearly.</p>
                <p>For let DE, which is evidently perpendicular to Vr, meet the parallel incident
                    rays in K and L and the radii of the spherical surface in G and H. It is plain
                    that GPK is equal to the angle of incidence on the posterior or spherical
                    surface of the lens; and GP <hi rend="italic">r</hi> and GP <hi rend="italic"
                    >v</hi> are the angles of the refraction of the red and the violet rays; and
                    that GK, GD, and GE, are very nearly as the sines of those angles, because the
                    angles are supposed to be small. Therefore DE: KD <hi rend="italic">— v — r:
                    r—i;</hi> and, by doubling the consequents, DE: 2KD = <hi rend="italic">υ —
                    r</hi>: 2 <hi rend="italic">r</hi> — 2 <hi rend="italic">i</hi>. Also DE: 2KD +
                    DE = υ — <hi rend="italic">r</hi>: 2r — 2 <hi rend="italic">i</hi> + <hi
                    rend="italic">v — r = υ — r: r + υ — 2i.</hi> But 2KD + DE is equal to KL or PQ.
                    Therefore we have DE: PQ <hi rend="italic">= υ — r: r + υ —</hi> 2 <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q. E. D.</hi><hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi>
                    1. Sir Isaac Newton found, that in common glass the sines of refraction of the
                    red and violet rays were 77 and 78 where the sine of incidence was 50. Hence <hi
                    rend="italic">v — r</hi> is to <hi rend="italic">v</hi> + <hi rend="italic">r
                    —</hi> 2 <hi rend="italic">i</hi> as 1 to 55; and the diameter of the smallest
                    circle of dispersion is <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    55</hi> th part of that of the lens.</p>
                <p>2. In like manner may be determined the circle of dispersion that will comprehend
                    the rays of any particular colour or set of colours. Thus all the orange and
                    yellow will pass through a circle whose diameter is <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 200</hi> th of that of the lens.</p>
                <p>3. In different surfaces, or plano-convex lenses, the angles of aberration <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> P <hi rend="italic">v</hi> are as the breadth PQ directly,
                    and as the focal distance VF inversely; because any angle DPE is as its subtense
                    DE directly and radius DP inversely. —We call VF the focal distance, because at
                    this distance, or at the point F, the light is most of all constipated. If we
                    examine the focal distance by holding the lens to the sun, we judge it to be
                    where the light is drawn into the smallest spot.</p>
                <p>When we reflect that a lens of 5½ inches in diameter has a circle of dispersion
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> th of an inch in
                    diameter, we are surprised that it produces any picture of an object that can be
                    distinguished. We should not expect greater distinctness from such a lens than
                    would be produced in a camera obscura without a lens, by simply admitting the
                    light through a hole of <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    10</hi> th of an inch in diameter. This, we know, would be very hazy and
                    confused. But when we remark the superior vivacity of the yellow and orange
                    light in comparison with the rest, we may believe that the effect produced by
                    the confusion of the other colours will be much less sensible. But a stronger
                    reason is, that the light is much denser in the middle of the circle of
                    dispersion, and is exceedingly faint towards the margin. This, however, must not
                    be taken for granted; and we must know distinctly the manner in which the light
                    of different colours is distributed over the circle of chromatic dispersion,
                    before we pretend to pronounce on the immense difference between the
                    indistinctness arising from colour and that arising from the spherical figure.
                    We think this the more necessary, seeing that the illustrious discoverer of the
                    chromatic aberration has made a great mistake in the comparison, because he did
                    not consider the distribution of the light in the circle of spherical
                    dispersion. It is therefore proper to investigate the chromatic distribution of
                    the light, and we shall then see that the superiority of the reflecting
                    telescope is incomparably less than Newton imagined it to be.</p>
                <p>Therefore let EB (fig. 2) represent a plano-convex lens, of which C is the centre
                    and C <hi rend="italic">r</hi> the axis. Let us suppose it to have no spherical
                    aberration, but to collect rays occupying its whole surface to single points in
                    the axis. Let a beam of white or compounded light fall perpendicularly on its
                    plane surface. The rays will be so refracted by its curved surface, that the
                    extreme red rays will be collected at <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> the extreme
                    violet rays at <hi rend="italic">w</hi>, and those of intermediate
                    refrangibility at intermediate points <hi rend="italic">o, y, g, b, ρ, v,
                    of</hi> the line <hi rend="italic">rw,</hi> which is nearly <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 28</hi> th of <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> C. The extreme red and violet rays will cross each, other
                    at A and D; and AD will be a section or diameter of the circle of chromatic
                    dispersion, and will be about <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 55</hi> th of EB. We may suppose <hi rend="italic">wr</hi> to
                    be bisected in <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> because <hi rend="italic">wb</hi> is to
                    <hi rend="italic">br</hi> very nearly in the ratio of equality (for <hi
                    rend="italic">rb: rC</hi> = <hi rend="italic">b</hi> A: <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                    E = <hi rend="italic">b</hi> A: <hi rend="italic">c</hi> B = <hi rend="italic"
                    >wb: w</hi> C <hi rend="italic">).</hi> The line <hi rend="italic">rw</hi> will
                    be a kind of prismatic spectrum, red from <hi rend="italic">r</hi> to o,
                    orange-coloured from <hi rend="italic">o</hi> to <hi rend="italic">y,</hi>
                    yellow from <hi rend="italic">y</hi> to <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> green from <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> to <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, blue from <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> to <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> purple from <hi rend="italic">p</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">v,</hi> and violet from <hi rend="italic">v</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">w.</hi></p>
                <p>The light in its compound state must be supposed uniformly dense as it falls upon
                    the lens; and the same must be said of the rays of any particular colour. Newton
                    supposes also, that when a white ray, such as eE, is dispersed into its
                    component coloured rays by refraction at E, it is uniformly spread over the
                    angle DEA. This supposition is indeed gratuitous; but we have no argument to the
                    contrary, and may therefore consider it as just. The consequence is, that each
                    point <hi rend="italic">w, v, p, b, &amp;c. of</hi> the spectrum is not only
                    equally luminous, but also illuminates uniformly its corresponding portion of
                    AD; that is to say, the coating (so to term it) of any particular colour, such
                    as purple, from the point <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> is uniformly dense in every
                    part of AD on which it falls. In like manner, the colouring of yellow,
                    intercepted by a part of AD in its passage to the point <hi rend="italic"
                    >y,</hi> is uniformly dense in all its parts. But the density of the different
                    colours in AD is extremely different; for, since the radiation in <hi
                    rend="italic">w</hi> is equally dense with that in <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> the
                    density of the violet colouring, which radiates from <hi rend="italic">w,</hi>
                    and is spread over the whole of AD, must be much less than the density of the
                    purple colouring, which radiates from <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> and occupies
                    only a part of AD round the circle <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> These densities
                    must be very nearly in the inverse proportion of <hi rend="italic">wb</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> to <hi rend="italic">pc</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=162"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0162-0144"/>
                <p>Hence we see that the central point <hi rend="italic">b</hi> will be very
                    intensely illuminated by the blue radiating from <hi rend="italic">pb,</hi> and
                    the green intercepted from <hi rend="italic">bg.</hi> It will be more faintly
                    illuminated by the purple radiating from <hi rend="italic">vp,</hi> and the
                    yellow intercepted from <hi rend="italic">gy;</hi> and still more faintly by the
                    violet from <hi rend="italic">wυ,</hi> and the orange and red intercepted from
                    yr. The whole colouring will be a white, tending a little to yellowness. The
                    accurate proportion of these colourings may be computed from our knowledge of
                    the position of the points o, <hi rend="italic">y, g,</hi> &amp;c <hi
                    rend="italic">.</hi> But this is of little moment. It is of more consequence to
                    be able to determine the proportion of the total intensity of the light in <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> to its intensity in any other point I.</p>
                <p>For this purpose draw rIR, I <hi rend="italic">w</hi> W, meeting the lens in R
                    and W. The point I receives none of the light which passes through the space RW;
                    for it is evident that <hi rend="italic">bl</hi>: CR = <hi rend="italic"
                    >bA</hi>: CE = 1: 55, and that CR = CW; and therefore, since all the light
                    incident on EB passes through AD, all the light incident on RW passes through I
                    <hi rend="italic">i (bi</hi> being made = <hi rend="italic">b</hi> I <hi
                    rend="italic">).</hi> Draw <hi rend="italic">o</hi> IO, <hi rend="italic">y</hi>
                    IY, <hi rend="italic">g</hi> IG, I <hi rend="italic">p</hi> P, I <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi> V. It is plain that I receives red light from RO, orange
                    from OY, yellow from YG, green from GE, a little blue from BP, purple from PV,
                    and violet from VW. It therefore wants some of the green and of the blue.</p>
                <p>That we may judge of the intensity of these colours at I, suppose the lens
                    covered with paper pierced with a small hole at G. The green light only will
                    pass through I; the other colours will pass between I and <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> or between I and A, according as they are more or less refrangible than
                    the particular green at I. This particular colour converges to <hi rend="italic"
                    >g,</hi> and therefore will illuminate a small spot round I, where it will be as
                    much denser than it is at G as this spot is smaller than the hole at G. The
                    natural density at G, therefore, will be to the increased density at I, as <hi

                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. In like manner, the natural density of the purple
                    coming to I through an equal hole at P will be to the increased density at I as
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> I <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> to CP <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. And thus it appears, that the intensity of the
                    differently coloured illuminations of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> point of the
                    circle of dispersion, is inversely proportional to the square of the distance
                    from the centre of the lens to the point of its surface through which the
                    colouring light comes to this point of the circle of dispersion. This
                    circumstance will give us a very easy, and, we think, an elegant solution of the
                    question.</p>
                <p>Bisect CE in F, and draw FL perpendicular to CE, making it equal to CF. Through
                    the point L describe the hyperbola KLN of the second order, that is, having the
                    ordinates EK, FL, RN, &amp;c. inversely proportional to the squares of the
                    abscissae CE, CF, CR, &amp;c.; so that FL: RN = θp <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>:
                    ζjξa&gt; or = CR <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>: CF <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>, &amp;c. It is evident that these ordinates are proportional to the
                    densities of the severally coloured lights which go from them to any points
                    whatever of the circle of dispersion.</p>
                <p>Now the total density of the light at I depends both on the density of each
                    particular colour and on the number of colours which fall on it. The ordinates
                    of this hyperbola determine the first; and the space ER measures the number of
                    colours which fall on I, because it receives light from the whole of ER, and of
                    its equal BW. Therefore, if ordinates be drawn from any point of ER, their sum
                    will be as the whole light which goes to I; that is, the total density of the
                    light at I will be proportional to the area NREK. Now it is known that CE ∙ EK
                    is equal to the infinitely extended area lying beyond EK; and CR ∙ RN is equal
                    to the infinitely extended area lying beyond R N. Therefore the area NREK is
                    equal to CR ∙ RN — CE ∙ EK. But RN</p>

                    or to <hi rend="superscript"> AI</hi> / <hi rend="italic subscript"> b</hi><hi

                    rend="subscript"> I</hi>.</p>
                <p>Here it is proper to observe, that since the point R has the same situation in
                    the diameter EB that the point I has in the diameter AD of the circle of
                    dispersion, the circle described on EB may be conceived as the magnified
                    representation of the circle of dispersion. The point F, for instance,
                    represents the point <hi rend="italic">f</hi> in the circle of dispersion, which
                    bisects the radius <hi rend="italic">bA.</hi>; and <hi rend="italic">f</hi>
                    receives no light from any part of the lens which is hearer the centre than F,
                    being illuminated only by the light which comes through EF, and its opposite
                    BF'. The same may be said of every other point.</p>
                <p>In like manner, the density of the light in <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> the middle
                    between <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and A, is measured by <hi rend="superscript">
                    EF</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> CF</hi>, which is = <hi rend="superscript">
                    EF</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> EF</hi>, or 1. This makes the density at this
                    point a proper standard of comparison. The density there is to the density at I
                    as 1 to <hi rend="superscript"> AI</hi> / <hi rend="italic subscript"> b</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript"> I</hi>, or as <hi rend="italic">b</hi> I to AI; and this is
                    the simplest mode of comparison. The density half way from the centre of the
                    circle of dispersion, is to the density at any point I as <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> I to AI.</p>
                <p>Lastly, through L describe the common rectangular hyperbola ALη, meeting the
                    ordinates of the former in <hi rend="italic">k</hi>, L, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >n;</hi> and draw <hi rend="italic">kh</hi> parallel to EC, cutting the
                    ordinates in <hi rend="italic">g,f, r,</hi> &amp;c. Then CR: CE = EA: Rn, and
                    CR: CE — CR = EA: Rn—EA, or CR: RE= EA: <hi rend="italic">rn,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> I: IΛ = EA: <hi rend="italic">m.</hi> And thus we have a
                    very simple expression of the density in any point of the circle of dispersion.
                    Let the point be anywhere, as at I. Divide the lens in R as AD is divided in I,
                    and then <hi rend="italic">rn</hi> is as the density in I.</p>
                <p>These two measures were given by Newton; the first in his treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">de Mundi Systemate,</hi> and the last in his Optics, but both
                    without demonstration.</p>
                <p>If the hyperbola <hi rend="italic">k</hi> L <hi rend="italic">n</hi> be made to
                    revolve round the axis CQ, it will generate a solid spindle, which will measure
                    the whole quantity of light which passes through different portions of the
                    circle of dispersion. Thus the solid produced by the revolution of L <hi
                    rend="italic">kf</hi> will measure all the light which occupies the outer part
                    of the circle of dispersion lying without the middle of the radius. This space
                    is ¾ths of the whole circle; but the quantity of light is but ¼th of the
                    whole.</p>
                <p>A fully more simple expression of the whole quantity of light passing through
                    different portions of the circle of chromatic dispersion may now be obtained as
                    follows:</p>
                <p>It has been demonstrated, that the density of the light at I is as <hi
                    rend="superscript"> AI</hi> / <hi rend="italic subscript"> b</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript"> I</hi>, or as <hi rend="superscript"> ER</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> CR</hi>. Suppose the figure to turn round the axis: the points
                    I and R describe circumferences of circles; and the whole light passing through
                    this circumference is as the circumference, or as the radius and as the density
                    <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=163"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0163-0145"/> ER jointly. It is therefore as <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ER</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> CR</hi> · CR, that is, as
                    ER. Draw any straight line Em, cutting RN in <hi rend="italic">s</hi>, and any
                    other ordinate FL in <hi rend="italic">x</hi> R <hi rend="italic">s</hi>. The
                    whole light which illuminates the circumference described by I is to the whole
                    light which illuminates the centre <hi rend="italic">b</hi> as ER to EC, or as
                    Rs to <hi rend="italic">Cm.</hi> In like manner, the whole light which
                    illuminates the circumference described by the point <hi rend="italic">f</hi> in
                    the circle of dispersion, is to the whole light which illuminates the centre <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> as F <hi rend="italic">x</hi> to C <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi>. The lines <hi rend="italic">Cm,</hi> Rs, Far, are therefore
                    proportional to the whole light which illuminates the corresponding
                    circumferences in the circle of dispersion. Therefore the whole light which
                    falls on the circle whose radius is <hi rend="italic">b</hi> I, will be
                    represented by the trapezium in CR <hi rend="italic">s</hi>; and the whole light
                    which falls on the ring described by IA, will be represented by the triangle E
                    <hi rend="italic">s</hi> R; and so of any other portions.</p>
                <p>By considering the figure, we see that the distribution of the light is
                    exceedingly unequal. Round the margin it has no sensible density; while its
                    density in the very centre is incomparably greater than in any other point,
                    being expressed by the asymptote of a hyperbola. Also the circle described with
                    the radius contains ¾ths of the whole light. No wonder, then, that the confusion
                    caused by the mixture of these circles of dispersion is less than one should
                    expect; besides, it is evident that the most lively or impressive colours occupy
                    the middle of the spectrum, and are there much denser than the rest. The margin
                    is covered with an illumination of deep red and violet, neither of which colours
                    is brilliant. The margin will be of a dark claret colour. The centre revives all
                    the colours, but in a proportion of intensity greatly different from that in the
                    common prismatic spectrum, because the radiant points L, <hi rend="italic">p, b,
                    g,</hi> &amp;c <hi rend="italic">.</hi> by which it is illuminated, are at such
                    different distances from it. It will be white; but, we apprehend, not a pure
                    white, being greatly overcharged with the middle colours.</p>
                <p>These considerations show that the coloured fringes which are observed to border
                    very luminous objecte seen on a dark ground through optical instruments, do not
                    proceed from the object-glass of a telescope or microscope, but from an improper
                    construction of the eye-glasses. The chromatic dispersions would produce fringes
                    of a different colour when they produce any at all, and the colours would be
                    differently disposed. But this dispersion by the object-glass can hardly produce
                    any fringes: its effect is a general and almost uniform mixture of circles all
                    over the field, which produces an uniform haziness, as if the object were viewed
                    at an improper distance, or out of its focus, as we vulgarly express it.</p>
                <p>We may at present form a good guess at the limit which this cause puts to the
                    performance of a telescope. A point of a very distant object is represented, in
                    the picture formed by the object-glass, by a little circle, whose diameter is at
                    least <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 300</hi> th of the
                    aperture of the object-glass, making a very full allowance for the superior
                    brilliancy and density of the central light. We look at this picture with a
                    magnifying eye-glass. This magnifies the picture of the point. If it amplify it
                    to such a degree as to make it an object individually distinguishable, the
                    confusion is then sensible. Now this can be computed. An object subtending one
                    minute of a degree is distinguished by the dullest eye, even although it be a
                    dark object on a bright ground. Let us therefore suppose a telescope, the
                    object-glass of which is of six feet focal distance, and one inch aperture. The
                    diameter of the circle of chromatic dispersion will be <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 300</hi> th of an inch, which subtends at the
                    centre of the object-glass an angle of about nine seconds and a half. This, when
                    magnified six times by an eye-glass, would become a distinguishable object; and
                    a telescope of this length would be indistinct if it magnified more than six
                    times, if a point were thus spread out into a spot of uniform intensity. But the
                    spot is much less intense about its margin. It is found experimentally that a
                    piece of engraving, having fine cross hatches, is not sensibly indistinct till
                    brought so far from the limits of perfectly distinct vision, that this
                    indistinctness amounts to 6' or 5' in breadth. Therefore such a telescope will
                    be sensibly distinct when it magnifies thirty-six times; and this is very
                    agreeable to experience.</p>
                <p>We come, in the second place, to the more arduous task of ascertaining the error
                    arising from the spherical figure of the surfaces employed in optical
                    instruments. Suffice it to say, before we begin, that although geometers have
                    exhibited other forms of lenses which are totally exempt from this error, they
                    cannot be executed by the artist; and we are therefore restricted to the
                    employment of spherical surfaces. We shall set out with Dr Smith’s fundamental
                    theorem.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">In Reflections.</hi></p>
                <p>Let AVB (fig 3) be a concave spherical mirror, of which C is the centre, V the
                    vertex, CV the axis, and F the focus of an infinitely slender pencil of parallel
                    rays passing through the centre. Let the ray <hi rend="italic">a</hi> A,
                    parallel to the axis, be reflected in AG, crossing the central ray C V in <hi
                    rend="italic">f.</hi> Let AP be the sine of the semi-aperture AV, AD its

                <p>The aberration <hi rend="italic">Pf</hi> from the principal focus of central rays

                <p>For, because AD is perpendicular to CA, the points C, A, D, are in a circle, of

                <p>In general, the longitudinal aberrations from the focus of central parallel rays
                    are as the squares of the apertures directly, and as the focal distances
                    inversely; and the lateral aberrations are as the cubes of the apertures
                    directly, and the squares of the focal distances inversely; and the angular
                    aberrations are as the cubes of the aperture directly, and the cubes of the
                    focal distances inversely.</p>
                <p>The reader must have observed, that to simplify the investigation, some small
                    errors are admitted. PV and PD are not in the exact proportion that we assumed
                    them, nor is <hi rend="italic">Df</hi> equal to F V. But in the small apertures
                    which suffice for optical instruments, these errors may be disregarded.</p>
                <p>This spherical aberration produces an indistinctness of vision, in the same
                    manner as the chromatic aberration does, viz. by spreading out every
                    mathematical point of the object into a little spot in its picture; which spots,
                    by mixing with each other, confuse the whole. We must now determine the diameter
                    of the circle of diffusion, as we did in the case of chromatic dispersion.</p>

                    Therefore EH is greatest when Pπ is equal to the half of AP. When this is the

                    pass, is ¼ of the diameter of the circle of aberration at the focus of parallel
                    central rays. In the chromatic aberration it was ½; so that in this respect the
                    spherical aberration does not create so great confusion as the chromatic.</p>
                <p>We are now able to compare them, since we have the measure of both the circles of
                    aberration.</p>
                <p>It has not been found possible to give more than four inches of aperture to an
                    object-glass of 100 feet focal distance, so as to preserve sufficient
                    distinctness. If we compute the diameter of the circle EH corresponding to this
                    <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=165"

                    we restrict the circle of chromatic dispersion to <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    / <hi rend="subscript"> 250</hi> of the aperture, which is hardly the fifth part

                <p>The circle of spherical aberration of a plano-convex lens, with the plane side

                <p>Sir Isaac Newton was therefore well entitled to say, that it was quite needless
                    to attempt figures which should have less aberration than spherical ones, while
                    the confusion pro-duccd by the chromatic dispersion remained uncorrected. Since
                    the indistinctness is as the squares of the diameters of the circles of
                    aberration, the disproportion is quite beyond our imagination, even when Newton
                    has made such a liberal allowance to the chromatic dispersion. But it must be
                    acknowledged, that he has not attended to the distribution of the light in the
                    circle of spherical aberration, and has hastily supposed it to be like the
                    distribution of the coloured light, indefinitely rare in the margin, and denser
                    in the centre.</p>
                <p>Boscovich has shown that the light in the margin of the circle of spherical
                    aberration, instead of being incomparably rarer than in the spaces between it
                    and the centre, is incomparably denser. The indistinctness therefore produced by
                    the intersection of these luminous circumferences is vastly great, and increases
                    the whole indistinctness exceedingly. By a gross calculation which we made, it
                    appears to be increased at least 500 times. The proportional indistinctness,
                    therefore, instead of being 1900 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> to 1, is only
                    1900 ’</p>
                <p>-- -, or nearly 7220 to 1; a proportion still sufficiently 500</p>
                <p>great to warrant Newton’s preference of the reflecting telescope of his
                    invention. And we may now observe, that the reflecting telescope has even a
                    great advantage over a refracting one of the same focal distance, with respect
                    to its spherical aberration: For we have seen (Cor. 2) that the r <hi

                    therefore, if the surfaces were portions of the same sphere, the diameter of the
                    circle of aberration of refracted rays would be to that of the circle of
                    aberration of reflected rays as <hi rend="superscript"> 9</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 16</hi> to ¼, or as 9 to 4. But when the refracting and
                    reflecting surfaces, in the position here considered, have the same focal
                    distance, the radius of the refracting surface is four times that of the
                    reflecting surface. The proportion of the diameters of the circles of spherical
                    aberration is that of 9 × 4 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> to 4, or of 144 to 4,
                    or 36 to I. The distinctness therefore of the reflector is 36 × 36, or 1296
                    times greater than that of a plano-convex lens (placed with the plane side next
                    the distant object) of the same breadth and focal distance, and will therefore
                    admit of a much greater magnifying power. This comparison is indeed made in
                    circumstances most favourable to the reflector, because this is the very worst
                    position of a plano-convex lens. But we have not as yet learned the aberration
                    in any other position. In another position the refraction and consequent
                    aberration of both surfaces are complicated.</p>
                <p>Before we proceed to the consideration of this very difficult subject, we may
                    deduce, from what has been already demonstrated, several general rules and
                    maxims in the construction of telescopes, which will explain (to such readers as
                    do not wish to enter more deeply into the subject) and justify the proportion
                    which long practice of the best artists has sanctioned.</p>
                <p>Indistinctness proceeds from the commixture of the circles of aberration on the
                    retina of the eye: for any one <hi rend="italic">sensible</hi> point of the
                    retina, being the centre of a circle of aberration, will at once be affected by
                    the admixture of the rays of as many different pencils of light as there are
                    sensible points in the area of that circle, and will convey to the mind a mixed
                    sensation of as many visible points of the object. This number will be as the
                    area of the circle of aberrations, whatever be the size of a sensible point of
                    the retina. Now in vision with telescopes the diameter of the circle of
                    aberration on the retina is as the <hi rend="italic">apparent</hi> magnitude of
                    the diameter of the corresponding circle in the focus of the eye-glass; that is,
                    as the angle subtended by this diameter at the centre of the eye-glass; that is,
                    as the diameter itself directly, and as the focal distance of the eye-glass
                    inversely. And the area of that circle on the retina is as the area of the
                    circle on the focus of the eye-glass directly, and as the square of the focal
                    distance of the eye-glass inversely. And this is the measure of the apparent
                    indistinctness.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">cor.</hi> In all sorts of telescopes, and also in compound
                    microscopes, an object is seen equally distinct when the focal distances of the
                    eye-glasses are proportional to the diameters of the circles of aberration in
                    the focus of the object-glass.</p>
                <p>Here we do not consider the trifling alteration which well-constructed
                    eye-glasses may add to the indistinctness of the first image.</p>
                <p>In refracting telescopes, the apparent indistinctness is as the area of the
                    object-glass directly, and as the square of the focal distance of the eye-glass
                    inversely. For it has been shown, that the area of the circle of dispersion is
                    as the area of the object-glass, and that the spherical aberration is
                    insignificant when compared with this.</p>
                <p>Therefore, to make reflecting telescopes equally distinct, the diameter of the
                    object-glass must be proportional to the focal distance of the eye-glass.</p>
                <p>But in reflecting telescopes, the indistinctness is as the sixth power of the
                    aperture of the object-glass directly, and as the fourth power of the focal
                    distance of the object-glass and square of the focal distance of the eye-glass
                    inversely. This is evident from the dimensions of the circle of aberra-A V <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> tion, which was found proportional to ^ξyγ5∙</p>
                <p>Therefore, to have them equally distinct, the cubes of the apertures must be
                    proportional to the squares of the focal distance multiplied by the focal
                    distance of the eye-glass.</p>
                <p>By these rules, and a standard telescope of approved goodness, an artist can
                    always proportion the parts of any instrument he wishes to construct. Huyghens
                    made one, of which the object-glass had 30 feet focal distance, and three inches
                    diameter; the eye-glass had 3∙3 inches focal distance; and its performance was
                    found superior to any which he had seen. Nor did this appear owing to any <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=166"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0166-0148"/> chance goodness of the object-glass, because he
                    found others equally good which were constructed on similar proportions. This
                    has therefore been adopted as a standard.</p>
                <p>It does not at first appear how there can be any difficulty in this matter,
                    because we can always diminish the aperture of the object-glass or speculum,
                    till the circle of aberration is as small as we please. But by diminishing this
                    aperture, we diminish the light in the duplicate ratio of the aperture. Whatever
                    be the aperture, the brightness is diminished by the magnifying power, which
                    spreads the light over a greater surface in the bottom of the eye. The apparent
                    brightness must be as the square of the aperture of the telescope directly, and
                    the square of the amplification of the diameter of an object inversely. Objects
                    therefore will be seen equally bright if the apertures of the telescopes be as
                    the focal distances of the object-glasses directly, and the focal distances of
                    the single eye-glass (or eye-glass equivalent to the eye-piece) inversely.
                    Therefore, to have telescopes equally distinct and equally bright, we must
                    combine these proportions with the former. It is needless to go farther into
                    this subject, because the construction of refracting telescopes has been so
                    materially changed by the correction of the chromatic aberration, that there can
                    hardly be given any proportion between the object-glass and eye-glasses. Every
                    thing now depends on the degree in which we can correct the aberrations of the
                    object-glass. We have been able so far to diminish the chromatic aberration,
                    that we can give very great apertures without its becoming sensible. But this is
                    attended with so great an increase of the aberration of figure, that this last
                    becomes a sensible quality. A lens which has 30° for its semi-aperture, has a
                    circle of aberration equal to its chromatic aberration. Fortunately we can
                    derive from the very method of contrary refractions, which we employ for
                    removing the chromatic aberrations, a correction of the other. For this
                    contrivance we are also indebted to the illustrious Newton.</p>
                <p>We call this Newton’s contrivance, because he was the first who proposed a
                    construction of an object-glass in which the aberration was corrected by the
                    contrary aberrations of glass and water.</p>
                <p>Huyghens had indeed supposed, that our all-wise Creator had employed in the eyes
                    of animals many refractions in place of one, in order to make the vision more
                    distinct; and the invidious detractors from Newton’s fame have catched at this
                    vague conjecture as an indication of his knowledge of the possibility of
                    destroying the aberration of figure by contrary refractions. But this is very
                    ill founded. Huyghens has acquired sufficient reputation by his theory of
                    aberrations. The scope of his writing in the passage alluded to, is to show
                    that, by dividing any intended refraction into parts, and producing a certain
                    convergence to or divergence from the axis of an optical instrument, by means of
                    two or three lenses instead of one, we diminish the aberrations four or nine
                    times. This conjecture about the eye was therefore in the natural train of his
                    thoughts. But he did not think of destroying the aberration altogether by
                    opposite refractions. Newton, in 1669, says that opticians need not trouble
                    themselves about giving figures to their glasses other than spherical. If this
                    figure were all the obstacle to the improvement of telescopes, he could show
                    them a construction of an object-glass having spherical surfaces where the
                    aberration is destroyed; and accordingly he gives the construction of one
                    composed of glass and water, in which this is done completely by means of
                    contrary refractions.</p>
                <p>The general principle is this. When the radiant point R (fig. 7), or focus of
                    incident rays, and its conjugate focus F of refracted central rays, are on
                    opposite sides of the refracting surface or lens V, the conjugate focus <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> of marginal rays is nearer to R than F is. But when the
                    focus of incident rays R ’ lies on the same side with its conjugate focus F' for
                    central rays, R' is greater than R' F'.</p>
                <p>Now fig. 8 represents the contrivance for destroying the colour produced at F,
                    the principal focus of the convex lens V, of crown glass, by means of the
                    contrary refraction of the concave lens <hi rend="italic">v</hi> of flint glass.
                    The incident parallel rays are made to converge to F by the first lens. This
                    convergence is diminished, but not entirely destroyed, by the concave lens <hi
                    rend="italic">v,</hi> and the focus is formed in F'. F and F' therefore are
                    conjugate foci of the concave lens. If F be the focus of V for central rays, the
                    marginal rays will be collected at some point <hi rend="italic">f</hi> nearer to
                    the lens. If F be now considered as the focus of light incident on the centre of
                    <hi rend="italic">v</hi>, and F' be the conjugate focus, the marginal ray <hi
                    rend="italic">p F'</hi> would be refracted to some point <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> ' lying beyond F'. Therefore the marginal ray <hi rend="italic">p f</hi>
                    may be refracted to F, if the aberration of the concave be properly adjusted to
                    that of the convex.</p>
                <p>This brings us to the most difficult part of our subject, the compounded
                    aberrations of different surfaces. Our limits will not admit of our treating
                    this in the same elementary and perspicuous manner that we employed for a single
                    surface. We must try to do it in a compendious way, which will admit at once the
                    different surfaces, and the different refractive powers of different substances.
                    This must naturally render the process more complicated; but we hope to treat
                    the subject in a way easily comprehended by any person moderately acquainted
                    with common algebra.</p>

                    the spherical figure of the refracting surface.</p>
                <p>Thus our formula has at last assumed a very simple form, and is vastly preferable
                    to Dr Smith’s for practice.</p>
                <p>This aberration is evidently proportional to the square of the semi-aperture, and
                    to the square of the distance <hi rend="italic">φ;</hi> but in order to obtain
                    this simplicity, several quantities were neglected. The assumption of the
                    equality of AX to g2</p>
                <p>-ris the first source of error. A much more accurate <hi rend="italic">2a</hi>
                    value of it would have been for it is really</p>
                <p>= — If for AX we substitute its approximated value e” 2cτe≡</p>
                <p>—, we should have AX = <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> = — ⅛. To have</p>

                <p>2a</p>
                <p>2a used this value would not much have complicated the calculus; but it did not
                    occur to us till we had finished the investigation, and it would have required
                    the whole to be changed. The operation in page 149, col. 2, par. 1, is another
                    source of error. But these errors are very inconsiderable when the aperture is
                    moderate. They increase for the most part with an increase of aperture, but not
                    in the proportion of any regular function of it; so that we cannot improve the
                    formula by any manageable process, and must be contented with it. The errors are
                    precisely the same with those of Dr Smith’s theorem, and indeed with those of
                    any that we have seen, which are not vastly more complicated.</p>
                <p>As this is to be frequently combined with subsequent operations, we shorten the
                    expression by putting <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> for <hi rend="strikethrough"

                <p>The easiest and most perspicuous method for obtaining the aberration of rays
                    twice refracted, will be to consider the first refraction as not having any
                    aberration, and determine the aberration of the second refraction. Then con
                    ceive the focus of the first refraction as shifted by the aberration. This will
                    produce a change in the focal distance of the second refraction, which may be

                    through the centres, which it will do without refraction. Let another ray <hi

                    cutting the second surface in N, where it is farther refracted into NI. It is
                    required to determine the focal distance BI.</p>
                <p>It is plain that the sine of incidence on the second surface is to the sine of
                    refraction into the surrounding air as 1 to <hi rend="italic">m.</hi> Also BI

                <p>Let the radius of the second surface be <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and let <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> still express the semi-aperture (because it hardly differs
                    from N <hi rend="italic">x</hi>). Also let <hi rend="italic">α</hi> be the
                    thickness of the lens. Then observe, that the focal distance of the rays
                    refracted by the first surface (neglecting the thickness of the lens and the
                    aberration of the first surface), is the distance of the radiant point for the
                    second refraction, or is the focal distance of rays incident on the second
                    surface. In place of <hi rend="italic">r</hi> therefore we must take <hi

                <p>Thus we have got an expression similar to the other; and the focal distance BI,

                <p>The preceding formula appears very complex, but is of very easy management,
                    requiring only the preparation of the simple numbers which form the numerators

                <p>We might here point out the cases which reduce the aberration expressed in the

                    >(q</hi> + <hi rend="italic">q'</hi>), is the correction for the aperture 2e.
                    And it is evident that <hi rend="italic">q'</hi> is a formula precisely similar
                    to <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> containing the same number of terms, and differing
                    only by the <hi rend="italic">m', a', n',</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r</hi><hi

                    >r</hi>.</p>
                <p>It is also evident, that if there be <hi rend="italic">a</hi> third lens, we
                    shall obtain its focal distance by a process precisely similar to that by which
                    we obtained DL; and so on for any number of lenses.</p>
                <p>Thus have we obtained formulae by which the foci of rays are determined in the
                    most general terms, and in such a manner as shall point out the connection of
                    the curvatures, thicknesses, and distances of the lenses, with their spherical
                    aberrations, and with the final aberration of the compound lens, and give the
                    aberrations in separate symbols, so that we can treat them by themselves, and
                    subject them to any conditions which may enable us to correct one of them by
                    another.</p>
                <p>We also see in general, that the corrections for the thickness and distance of
                    the lenses are exhibited in terms which involve only the focal distances of
                    central rays, and have very little influence on the aberrations, and still less
                    on the ratio of the aberrations, of the different lenses. This is a most
                    convenient circumstance; for we may neglect them while we are determining <hi
                    rend="italic">q</hi> and <hi rend="italic">q',</hi> and in determining the ratio
                    of the focal distances of the several lenses, on which the correction of the
                    chromatic aberration chiefly depends. Therefore, in the construction of a
                    compound lens for uniting the different colours, we may neglect this correction
                    for the thickness and distance till the end of the process. When we apply it, we
                    shall find that it chiefly affects the final focal distance, making it somewhat
                    longer, but has hardly any influence either on the chromatic or spherical
                    aberration. We do not hesitate to say, that the final formulae here given are
                    abundantly accurate, while they are vastly more manageable than those employed
                    by Euler or D’Alembert. We have calculated trigonometrically the progress of the
                    rays through one of the glasses, which will be given as an example, giving it a
                    very extravagant aperture, that the errors of the formulae might be very
                    remarkable. We found the real aberration exceed the aberration assigned by the
                    formula by no more than <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    59</hi> th part, a difference which is quite insignificant. The process here
                    given derives its simplicity from the frequent occurrence of harmonic
                    proportions in all optical theorems. This enabled M. Clairaut to employ the
                    reciprocals of the radii and distances with so much simplicity and
                    generality.</p>
                <p>We consider it as another advantage of M. Clairaut’s method, that it gives, by
                    the way, formulae for the more ordinary questions in optics, which are of
                    wonderful simplicity, and most easily remembered. The chief problems in the
                    elementary construction of optical instruments relate to the focal distances of
                    central rays. This determines the focal distances and arrangement of the
                    glasses. All the rest may be called the refinement of optics; teaching us how to
                    avoid or correct the indistinctness, the colours, and the distortions, which are
                    produced in the images formed by these simple constructions.</p>

                <p>Having thus obtained the necessary analysis and formula, it now remains to apply
                    them to the construction of achromatic lenses, in which it fortunately happens
                    that the employment of several surfaces, in order to produce the union of the
                    differently refrangible rays; enables us at the same time to employ them for
                    correcting each other’s spherical aberration.</p>
                <p>A white or compounded ray is separated by refraction into its component coloured
                    rays, and they are diffused over a small angular space. Thus it appears, that
                    the glass used <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=171"

                    white rav, which was incident on its posterior surface in an angle of 30°, in
                    such a manner that the extreme red ray emerged into air, making an angle of 50°
                    21 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> ' with the
                    perpendicular; the extreme violet ray emerged in an angle of 51° 15 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> '; and the ray which
                    was in the confines of green and blue, emerged in an angle of 50° 48 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> '. If the sine of the
                    angle 30° of incidence be called 0∙5, which it really is, the sine of the
                    emergence of the red ray will be 0∙77,, that of the violet ray will be 0∙78, and
                    that of the intermediate ray will be 0∙77½, an exact mean between the two
                    extremes. This ray may therefore be called the mean refrangible ray, and the
                    ratio of 77½ to 50, or of 1∙55 to 1, will very properly express the mean
                    refraction of this glass; and we have for this glass <hi rend="italic">m</hi> =
                    1∙55. The sine of refraction, being measured on a scale of which the sine of
                    incidence occupies 100 parts, will be 154 for the red ray, 155 for the mean ray,
                    and 156 for the violet ray. This number, or its ratio to unity, is commonly
                    taken to represent the refractive power of the glass. There is some impropriety
                    in this, unless we consider ratios as measured by their logarithms; for if <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> be 1, the substance does not refract at all. The refractive
                    power can be properly measured only by the refraction which it produces; that
                    is, by the change which it makes in the direction of the light, or the angle
                    contained between the incident and refracted rays. If two substances produce
                    such deviations always in one proportion, we should then say that their
                    refractive powers are in that proportion. This is not true in any substances;
                    but the sines of the angles contained between the refracted ray and the
                    perpendicular, are always in one proportion when the angle of incidence in both
                    substances is the same. This being a cognisable function of the real refraction,
                    has therefore been assumed as the only convenient measure of the refractive
                    powers. Although it is not strictly just, it answers extremely well in the most
                    usual cases in optical instruments. The refractions are moderate, and the sines
                    are very nearly as the angles contained between the rays and the perpendicular;
                    and the real angles of refraction, or deflections of the rays, are almost
                    exactly proportional to <hi rend="italic">m—</hi> 1. The most natural and
                    obvious measure of the refractive powers would therefore be <hi rend="italic">m
                    —</hi> 1. But this would embarrass some very frequent calculations; and we
                    therefore find it best, on the whole, to take <hi rend="italic">m</hi> itself
                    for the measure of the refractive power.</p>
                <p>The separation of the red, violet, and intervening rays, has been called <hi
                    rend="italic">dispersion;</hi> and although this arises merely from a difference
                    of the refractive power in respect of the different rays, it is convenient to
                    distinguish this particular modification of the refractive power by a name, and
                    we call it the <hi rend="italic">dispersive power</hi> of the refracting
                    substance.</p>
                <p>It is susceptible of degrees; for a piece of flint-glass will refract the light,
                    so that when the sine of refraction of the red ray is 77, the sine of the
                    refraction of the violet ray is nearly 78½; or if the sine of refraction of the
                    red ray, measured on a particular scale, is 1∙54, the sine of refraction of the
                    violet ray is 1∙57. The dispersion of this substance, being measured by the
                    difference of the extreme· sines of refraction, is greater than the dispersion
                    of the other glass, in the proportion of three to two.</p>
                <p>But this alone is not a sufficient measure of the absolute dispersive power of a
                    substance. Although the ratio of l·54 to 1∙56 remains constant, whatever the
                    real magnitude of the refractions of common glass may be, and though we
                    therefore say that its dispersive power is constant, we know that by increasing
                    the incidence and the refraction, the absolute dispersion is also increased.
                    Another substance shows the same properties, and in a particular case may
                    produce the same dispersion; yet it has not for this sole reason the same
                    dispersive power. If indeed the incidence and the refraction of the mean ray be
                    also the same, the dispersive power cannot be said to differ; but if the
                    incidence and the refraction of the mean ray be less, the dispersive power must
                    be considered as greater, though the actual dispersion be the same; because if
                    we increase the incidence till it becomes equal to that in the common glass, the
                    dispersion will now be increased. The proper way of conceiving the dispersion
                    therefore is, to consider it as a portion of the whole refraction; and if we
                    find a substance making the same dispersion with half the general refraction, we
                    must say that the dispersive quality is double, because by making the refraction
                    equal, the dispersion will really be double.</p>
                <p>If therefore we take <hi rend="italic">dm</hi> as a symbol of the separation of
                    the extreme rays from the middle ray, <hi rend="italic superscript"> dm</hi> /
                    <hi rend="italic subscript"> m</hi><hi rend="subscript"> -1</hi> is the natural
                    measure of the dispersive power.</p>
                <p>It is not unusual for optical writers to take the whole separation of the red and
                    violet rays for the measure of the dispersive power, and to compare this with
                    the refracting power with respect to one of the extreme rays. But it is surely
                    better to consider the mean refraction as the measure of the refracting power;
                    and the deviation of either of the extremes from this mean is a proper enough
                    measure of the dispersion, being always half of it. It is attended with this
                    convenience, that being introduced into our computations as a quantity
                    infinitely small, and treated as such for the ease of computation, while it is
                    really a quantity of sensible magnitude, the errors arising from this
                    supposition are diminished greatly by taking one half of the deviation and
                    comparing it with the mean refraction. This method has, however, this
                    inconvenience, that it does not exhibit at once the refractive power in all
                    substances respecting any particular colour of light; for it is not the ray of
                    any particular colour that suffers the mean refraction. In common glass it is
                    the ray which is in the confines of the yellow and blue, in flint-glass it is
                    nearly the middle blue ray, and in other substances it is a different ray. These
                    circumstances appear plainly in the different proportions of the colours of the
                    prismatic spectrum exhibited by different substances. This will be considered
                    afterwards, being a great bar to the perfection of achromatic instruments.</p>
                <p>The way in which an achromatic lens is constructed is, to make use of a contrary
                    refraction of a second lens to destroy the dispersion or spherical aberration of
                    the first. The first purpose will be answered if <hi rend="italic superscript">
                    dm</hi><hi rend="italic">/</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> n</hi> be equal to
                    <hi rend="italic superscript"> dm'</hi><hi rend="italic">/</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> n'</hi>. For, in order that the different coloured rays may be
                    collected into one point by two lenses, it is only necessary that—, the
                    reciprocal of the focal distance of rays refracted by both, may be the same for
                    the extreme and <hi rend="italic">m</hi>-L <hi rend="italic">dm —</hi> I <hi

                    rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">n' η</hi></p>
                <p>This may be seen in another way, more comprehensible by such as are not versant
                    in these discussions. In order that the extreme colours which are separated by
                    the first lens may be rendered parallel by the second, we have shown already
                    that <hi rend="italic">η</hi> and n' are proportional to the radii of the
                    equivalent isosceles lenses, being the halves of these radii. In these small
                    refractions they are therefore inversely proportional to the angles formed by
                    the surfaces <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=172"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0172-0154"/> at the edges of the lenses: <hi rend="italic"
                    >n'</hi> may therefore be taken for the angle of the first lens, and <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> for that of the second. Now the small refraction by a prism
                    whose angle (also small) is <hi rend="italic">n'</hi>, is <hi rend="italic"
                    >(m—</hi> l) <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> The dispersive power being now
                    substituted for the refractive power, we have for this refraction of the prism
                    <hi rend="italic">dm × n'.</hi> This must be destroyed by the opposite
                    refraction of the other prism <hi rend="italic">dm' × n.</hi></p>
                <p>Therefore <hi rend="italic">dm</hi> X <hi rend="italic">n' = dm! × n,</hi> or — =
                    — . In like <hi rend="italic">n n'</hi><hi rend="italic">dm</hi> manner, this
                    effect will be produced by three lenses if —</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">dm' dm',</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> n</hi></p>

                    ·</p>
                <p>Lastly, the errors arising from the spherical figure, which we expressed by — R
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">(q</hi> 4- y <hi

                    employed in the preceding formulae, which will insure these conditions. It will
                    render the process more perspicuous if we collect into one view the
                    significations of our various symbols, and the principal equations which we are
                    to employ.</p>

                <p>The co-efficients of this equation, and the independent quantity, are all known,

                <p>But it is evidently an indeterminate equation, because there are two unknown
                    quantities, so that there may be an infinity of solutions. It must be rendered
                    determinate by means of some other conditions to which it may be sub-iected.
                    These conditions must depend on some other circumstances, which may direct our
                    choice.</p>
                <p>One circumstance occurs to us which we think of very great consequence. In the
                    passage of light from one substance to another, there is always a considerable
                    portion reflected from the posterior surface of the first and from the anterior
                    surface of the last; and this reflection is more copious in proportion to the
                    refraction. This loss of light will therefore be diminished by making the
                    internal surfaces of the lenses to coincide, that is, by making <hi
                    rend="italic">b = a'.</hi> This will be attended with another advantage. If we
                    put between the glasses a substance of nearly the same refracting power, we
                    shall not only completely prevent this loss of light, but we shall greatly
                    diminish the errors which arise from an imperfect polish of the surfaces. We
                    have tried this, and find the effect very surprising. The lens being polished
                    immediately after the figure has been given it, and while it was almost
                    impervious to light by reason of its roughness, which was still sensible to the
                    naked eye, performed as well as when finished in the finest manner.</p>
                <p>This condition, by taking away one refraction, obliges us to increase those which
                    remain, and therefore increases the spherical aberrations. And since our
                    formulae do not fully remove those (by reason of the small quantities neglected
                    in the process), it is uncertain whether this condition be the most eligible. We
                    have, however, no direct argument to the contrary.</p>
                <p>Let us see what determination this gives us.</p>
                <p>In this case -, = γ- = - — 1. For because - = - — 4 <hi rend="italic">aba
                    nab</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> = 1, we have 1 + τ = -, and τ = - — 1.
                    There- <hi rend="italic">b a ba</hi><hi rend="italic">112</hi> fore = — -f- 1.
                    Therefore, in our final equation, put i —? -f- 1 in place of -t, and — 1 in
                    place of</p>
                <p>. <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ∙. <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi>, A —C B-p D —2C

                    rend="subscript"> r</hi>, <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi> and it becomes <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> — -t-E-∣-D—C=0.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">cr o</hi></p>
                <p>Thus have we arrived at a quadratic equation, where is the unknown quantity. It
                    has the form <hi rend="italic">pχ-</hi>-f- <hi rend="italic">qx</hi>-f- <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> = 0, where <hi rend="italic">p =</hi> A — C, 7 = 2C — B —

                    rend="italic">a</hi></p>
                <p>Divide the equation by <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> and we have <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ι</hi><hi rend="italic">+ ^x</hi>-J- - =
                    0. Make <hi rend="italic">s = -</hi> and <hi rend="italic">t = -,</hi> and we
                    have <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi> 4- <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">P P</hi></p>
                <p>This gives us finally i, or <hi rend="italic">x — —</hi> ⅜ s =±= √∣ s <hi

                <p>This value of - is taken from a scale of which the unit is <hi rend="italic"

                    lens, or has the same focal distance with it. We must then find (on the same
                    scale) the value of <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> viz. -— 1, which is also the value
                    of α'. Having obtained <hi rend="italic">at,</hi> we must find <hi rend="italic"
                    >b'</hi> by means of the cquation = and therefore</p>

                <p>+ <hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> — l∙</p>
                <p>Thus is our object-glass constructed; and we must determine its focal distance,
                    or its reciprocal -i∙. This is <hi rend="italic">= m —</hi> 1 — <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">μ</hi><hi rend="italic">(m' —</hi> 1).</p>
                <p>All these radii and distances are measured on a scale of which <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> is the unit But it is more convenient to measure every thing by the
                    focal distance of the compound object-glass. This gives us the proportion which
                    all the distances bear to it. Therefore, calling P unity, in order to obtain -
                    on this scale, we have only to state the analogy rn — 1 — w <hi rend="italic"
                    >(m'—</hi> 1): 1 = -: T and A is the radius of α A</p>
                <p>our first surface measured on a scale of which P is the unit.</p>
                <p>If, in the formula which expresses the final equation for -, the value of <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> should be positive, and greater than ¼ <hi rend="italic"
                    >s</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> the equation has
                    imaginary roots; and it is not possible, with the glasses employed and the
                    conditions assumed, to correct both the chromatic and spherical aberrations.</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">t</hi> is negative and equal to ¼s <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>, the radical part of the value is ≡ 0, and <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    / <hi rend="italic subscript"> a</hi> = -½s. But if it be negative or positive,
                    but less than ¼s <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, the equation has two real
                    roots, which will give two constructions. That is to be preferred which gives
                    the smallest curvature of the surfaces; because, since in our formulae which
                    determine the spherical aberration, some quantities are neglected, these are
                    always greater when a large arch (that is, an arch of many degrees<pb break="no"

                    is employed. No radius should be admitted which is much less than one third of
                    the focal distance.</p>
                <p>This process will be made plain by an example.</p>
                <p>Experiments have shown, that in common crown-glass the sine of incidence is to

                    which is = —0∙0307 (that is, to 0∙047l add 0∙0307), and we obtain 0∙0778, the
                    square root of which is = 0∙2789. Therefore, finally, <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>± = 0∙2789, which is either 0∙4959 or — 0·0619. It is plain that the first must
                    be preferred, because the second gives a negative radius, or makes the first
                    surface of the crown-glass concave. Now as the convergence of the rays is to be
                    produced by the crown-glass, the other surface must become very convex, and
                    occasion great errors in the computed aberration. We therefore retain 0·4959 for

                <p>Now to obtain all the measures in terms of the focal distance P, we have only to
                    divide the measures already found by 6∙2383, and the quotients are the measures

                <p>If it be intended that the focal distance of the objectglass shall be any number
                    <hi rend="italic">n of</hi> inches or feet, we have only to multiply each of the
                    above radii by n, and we have their lengths in inches or feet.</p>
                <p>Thus we have completed the investigation of the construction of a double
                    object-glass. Although this was intricate, the final result is abundantly simple
                    for practice, especially with the assistance of logarithms. The only troublesome
                    thing is the preparation of the numerical co-efficients A, B, C, D, E of the
                    final equation. Strict attention must also be paid to the positive and negative
                    signs of the quantities employed.</p>
                <p>We might propose other conditions. Thus it is natural to prefer for the first or
                    crown-glass lens such a form as shall give it the smallest possible aberration.
                    This will require a small aberration of the flint-glass to correct it. But a
                    little reflection will convince us that this form will not be good. The focal
                    distance of the crown-glass must not exceed one third of that of the compound
                    glass; these two being nearly in the proportion of <hi rend="italic">dm' —
                    dm</hi> to <hi rend="italic">dm'.</hi> Therefore if this form be adopted, and
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be made about <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 6</hi> th of <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> it will not exceed <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> th of P. Therefore,
                    although we may produce a most accurate union of the central and marginal rays
                    by opposite aberrations, there will be a considerable aberration of some rays
                    which are between the centre and the margin.</p>
                <p>It is absolutely impossible to collect into one point the whole rays (though the
                    very remotest rays are united with the central rays), except in a very
                    particular case, which cannot obtain in an object-glass; and the small
                    quantities which are neglected in the formula which we have given for the
                    spherical aberration, produce errors which do not follow any proportion of the
                    aperture that can be expressed by an equation of a manageable form. When the
                    aperture is very large, it is better not to correct the aberration for the whole
                    aperture, but for about <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    6</hi> ths of it. When the rays corresponding to this distance are made to
                    coincide with the central rays by means of opposite aberrations, the rays which
                    are beyond this distance will be united with some of those which are nearer to
                    the centre, and the whole diffusion will be considerably diminished. Dr Smith
                    has illustrated this in a very perspicuous manner in his theory of his Catoptric
                    Microscope.</p>
                <p>But although we cannot adopt this form of an object-glass, there may be other
                    considerations which may lead us to prefer some particular form of the
                    crown-glass, or of the flint-glass. We shall therefore adopt our general
                    equation A B C D <hi rend="subscript"> 1 r</hi>, „</p>

                    >a'</hi></p>
                <p>Therefore let <hi rend="italic">h</hi> express this selected ratio of the two
                    radii of the crown-glass, making = <hi rend="italic">h</hi> (remembering always
                    that <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is positive and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> negative
                    in the case of a double convex, and /1 is a negative number).</p>
                <p>With this condition we have ∙ <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> = -. But when we make

                <p>It may be worth while to take a particular case of this condition. Suppose the
                    crown-glass to be of equal convexities on both sides. This has some advantages:
                    we can tell with precision whether the curvatures are precisely equal, by
                    measuring the focal distance of rays reflected back from its posterior surface.
                    These distances will be precisely equal. Now it is of the utmost importance in
                    the construction of an object-glass which is to correct the spherical
                    aberration, that the forms be precisely such as are required by our
                    formulas.</p>

                    This gives two real roots, viz. 0∙8874, and — 0∙5008. If we take the first, we
                    shall have a convex anterior surface for the flint-glass, and consequently a
                    very deep concave for the posterior surface. We therefore take the second or
                    negative root — 0∙5008.</p>

                <p>By comparing this object-glass with the former, we may remark, that diminishing
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> a little increases <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and in
                    this respect improves the lens. It indeed has diminished <hi rend="italic"
                    >b'</hi>, but this being already considerable, no inconveniencc attends the
                    diminution. But we learn, at the same time, that the advantage <hi rend="italic"
                    >must</hi> be very small; for we cannot diminish <hi rend="italic">a</hi> much
                    more, without making it as small as the smallest radius of the object-glass.
                    This proportion is therefore very near the maximum, or best possible; and we
                    know that in such cases even considerable changes in the radii will make but
                    small changes in the result: for these reasons we are disposed to give a strong
                    preference to the first construction, on account of the other advantages which
                    we showed to attend it.</p>
                <p>As another example, we may take a case which is very nearly the general practice

                <p>We imagine that these cases are sufficient for showing the management of the
                    general equation; and the example of the numerical solution of the first case
                    affords instances of the only niceties which occur in the process, viz. the
                    proper employment of the positive and negative quantities.</p>
                <p>We have oftener than once observed, that the formula is not perfectly accurate,
                    and that in very large apertures errors will remain. It is proper, therefore,
                    when we have obtained the form of a compound object-glass, to calculate
                    trigonometrically the progress of the light through it; and if we find a
                    considerable aberration, either chromatic or spherical, remaining, we must make
                    such changes in the curvatures as will correct it. We have done this for the
                    first example; and we find, that if the focal distance of the compound
                    object-glass be 100 inches, there remains of the spherical aberration nearly <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 60</hi> th of an inch, and
                    the aberration of colour is over corrected above <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    / <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi> th of an inch. The first aberration has been
                    diminished about six times, and the other about thirty times. Both of the
                    remaining errors will be diminished by increasing the radius of the inner
                    surfaces. This will diminish the aberration of the crown-glass, and will
                    diminish the dispersion of the flint <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=176" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0176-0158"/>
                    more than that of the crown. But indeed the remaining error is hardly worth our
                    notice.</p>
                <p>It is evident to any person conversant with optical discussions that we shall
                    improve the correction of the spherical aberration by diminishing the
                    refractions. If we employ two lenses for producing the convergency of the rays
                    to a real focus, we shall reduce the aberration to ¼th. Therefore a better
                    achromatic glass will be formed of three lenses, two of which are convex and of
                    crown-glass. The refraction being thus divided between them, the aberrations are
                    lessened. There is no occasion to employ two concave lenses of flint-glass;
                    there is even an advantage in using one. The aberration being considerable, less
                    of it will serve for correcting the aberration of the crown-glass, and therefore
                    such a form may be selected as has little aberration. Some light is indeed lost
                    by these two additional surfaces; but this is much more than compensated by the
                    greater apertures which we can venture to give when the curvature of the surface
                    is so much diminished. We proceed therefore to <hi rend="italic">The
                    construction of a Triple Achromatic Object-glass.</hi></p>
                <p>It is plain that there are more conditions to be assumed before we can render
                    this a determinate problem, and that the investigation must be more intricate.
                    At the same time it must give us a much greater variety of constructions, in
                    consequence of our having more conditions necessary for giving the equation this
                    determinate form. Our limits will not allow us to give a full account of all
                    that may be done in this method. We shall therefore content ourselves with
                    giving one case, which will sufficiently point out the method of proceeding. We
                    shall then give the results in some other eligible cases, as rules to artists by
                    which they may construct such glasses.</p>
                <p>Let the first and second glasses be of equal curvatures on both sides; the first
                    being a double convex of crown-glass, and the second a double concave of
                    flint-glass.</p>

                <p>This is not a very good form, because the last surface has too great

                <p>We thought it worth while to compute the curvatures for a case where the internal

                <p>We have had an opportunity of trying glasses of this construction, and found them
                    equal to any of the same length, although executed by an artist by no means
                    excellent in his profession as a glass-grinder. This very circumstance gave us
                    the opportunity of seeing the good effects of interposing a transparent
                    substance between the glasses. We put some clear turpentine varnish between
                    them, which completely prevented all reflection from the internal surfaces.
                    Accordingly these telescopes were surprisingly bright; and although the
                    roughness left by the first grinding was very perceptible by the naked eye
                    before the glasses were put together, yet when joined in this manner it entirely
                    disappeared, even when the glasses were viewed with a deep magnifier.</p>
                <p>The aperture of an object-glass of this construction, of 30 inches focal
                    distance, was 3 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> th
                    inches, which is considerably more than any of Mr Dollond’s that we have
                    seen.</p>
                <p>If we should think it of advantage to make all the three lenses isosceles, that
                    is, equally curved on both surfaces, the general equation will give the
                    following radii:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">a</hi> = + 0·639 <hi rend="italic">a' = —</hi> 0·5285 a" = +
                    0·6413 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> = — 0·639 <hi rend="italic">b'</hi> = + 0·5285
                    <hi rend="italic">b''</hi> = — 0 6413. This seems a good form, having large
                    radii.</p>
                <p>Should we choose to have the two crown-glass lenses isosceles and equal, we must
                    make <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = + 0·6412 <hi rend="italic">a'</hi> = -0·5227 <hi
                    rend="italic">a''</hi> = +0·6412 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> = — 0·6412 <hi
                    rend="italic">b'</hi> = + 0·5367 <hi rend="italic">b''</hi> = — 0·6412.</p>
                <p>This form hardly differs from the last.</p>
                <p>Our readers will recollect that all these forms proceed on certain measures of
                    the refractive and dispersive powers of the substances employed, which are
                    expressed by <hi rend="italic">m, m', dm,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dm';</hi>
                    and we may be assured that the formula; are sufficiently exact, by the
                    comparison (which we have made in one of the cases) of the result of the
                    formula; and the trigonometrical calculation of the progress of the rays. The
                    error was but <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 60</hi> th
                    of the whole, ten times less than another error, which unavoidably remains, and
                    will be considered presently. These measures of refraction and dispersion were
                    carefully taken; but there is great diversity, particularly in the flint-glass.
                    We are well informed that the manufacture of this article has considerably
                    changed of late years, and that it is in general less refractive and less
                    dispersive than formerly. This must evidently make a change in the forms of
                    achromatic glasses. The proportion of the focal distance of the crown-glasses to
                    that of the flint must be increased, and this will occasion a change in the
                    curvatures, which shall correct the spherical aberration. We examined with great
                    care a parcel of flint-glass which an artist of this city got lately for the
                    purpose of making achromatic object-glasses, and also some very white
                    crown-glass made in Leith; and we obtained the following measures:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">m</hi> = 1·529 <hi rend="italic">dm</hi> _ 142 _ , <hi
                    rend="italic">ml</hi> = 1-578 <hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> m</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">~</hi> 219</p>
                <p>We computed some forms for triple object-glasses made of these glasses, which we
                    shall subjoin as a specimen of the variations which this change of data will
                    occasion.</p>
                <p>If all the three lenses are made isosceles, we have <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = +
                    0·796 <hi rend="italic">a'</hi> = — 0·474 <hi rend="italic">a" = +</hi> 0·502
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> = — 0·796 <hi rend="italic">b'</hi> = + 0·474 <hi
                    rend="italic">b''</hi> = — 0·502 or <hi rend="italic">a =</hi> 0·504 <hi
                    rend="italic">a' = -</hi> 0·475 <hi rend="italic">a" = +</hi> 0·793</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">b</hi> = -0∙504 <hi rend="italic">b=</hi> 0·475 <hi
                    rend="italic">b'' = —</hi> 0∙793.</p>
                <p>If the middle lens be isosceles, the two crown-glass lenses may be made of the
                    same form and focal distance, and placed the same way. This will give us <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> = + 0·705 <hi rend="italic">a'</hi> = — 0·475 <hi
                    rend="italic">a"</hi> = + 0∙705 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> = - 0·547 <hi
                    rend="italic">b'</hi> = + 0·475 <hi rend="italic">b'' = —</hi> 0·547.</p>
                <p>This construction allows a much better form, if the measures of refraction and
                    dispersion are the same that we used formerly. For we shall have <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> = + 0·628 a' = — 0·579 <hi rend="italic">a''</hi> = +
                    0·628</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">b</hi> = — 0·749 <hi rend="italic">b'</hi> = + 0·579 <hi
                    rend="italic">b''</hi> = — 0·749.</p>
                <p>And this is pretty near the practice of the London opticians.</p>
                <p>We may here observe, upon the whole, that an amateur has little chance of
                    succeeding in these attempts. The diversity of glasses, and the uncertainty of
                    the workman’s producing the very curvatures which he intends, are so great, that
                    the object-glass turns out different from our expectation. The artist who makes
                    great numbers acquires a pretty certain guess at the remaining error; and having
                    many lenses intended to be of one form, but unavoidably differing a little from
                    it, he tries several of them with the other two, and finding one better than the
                    rest, he makes use of it to complete the set.</p>
                <p>The great difficulty in the construction is to find the exact proportion of the
                    dispersive powers of the crown and flint glass. The crown is pretty constant;
                    but there are hardly two pots of flint-glass which have the same dispersive
                    power. Even if constant, it is difficult to measure it accurately; and an error
                    in this greatly affects the instrument, because the focal distances of the
                    lenses must be nearly as their dispersive powers. The method of examining this
                    circumstance, which we found most accurate, was as follows:</p>
                <p>The sun’s light, or that of a brilliant lamp, passed through a small hole in a
                    board, and fell on another board pierced also with a small hole. Behind this was
                    placed a fine prism A (fig. 12), which formed a spectrum R <hi rend="italic"
                    >o</hi> V on a screen pierced with a small hole. Behind this was placed a prism
                    B of the substance under examination. The ray which was refracted by it fell on
                    the wall at D, and the distance of its illumination from that point to C, on
                    which an unrefracted ray would have fallen, was carefully measured. This showed
                    the refraction of that colour. Then, in order that we might be certain that we
                    always compared the refraction of the same precise colour by the different
                    prisms placed at B, we marked the precise position of the prism A when the ray
                    of a particular colour fell on the prism B. This was done by an index AG
                    attached to A, and turning with it, when we caused the different colours of the
                    spectrum formed by A to fall on B. Having examined one prism B with respect to
                    all the colours in the spectrum formed by A, we put another B in its place. Then
                    bringing A to all its former positions successively, by means of a graduated
                    arch HGK, we were certain, that when the index was at the same division of the
                    arch, it was the very ray which had been made to pass through the first prism B
                    in a former experiment. We did not solicitously endeavour to find the very
                    extreme red and violet rays; because, although we did not learn the whole
                    dispersions of the two prisms, we learned their proportions, which is the
                    circumstance wanted in the construction of achromatic glasses. It <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=178" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0178-0160"/>
                    is in vain to attempt this by measuring the spectrums themselves; for we cannot
                    be certain of selecting the very same colours for the comparison, because they
                    succeed in an insensible gradation.</p>
                <p>The intelligent reader will readily observe that we have hitherto proceeded on
                    the supposition that when, by means of contrary refractions, we have united the
                    extreme red and violet rays, we have also united all the others. But this is
                    quite gratuitous. Sir Isaac Newton would however have made the same supposition;
                    for he imagined that the different colours divided the spectrum formed by all
                    substances in the proportions of a musical canon. This is a mistake. When a
                    spectrum is formed by a prism of crown-glass, and another of precisely the same
                    length is formed by the side of it by a prism of flint-glass, the confine
                    between the green and blue will be found precisely in the middle of the first
                    spectrum, but in the second it will be considerably nearer to the red extremity.
                    In short, different substances do not disperse the colours in the same
                    proportion.</p>
                <p>The effect of this irrationality (so to call it) of dispersion, will appear
                    plainly in the following manner: Let A (fig. 13) represent a spot of white solar
                    light falling perpendicularly on a wall. Suppose a prism of common glass placed
                    behind the hole through which the light is admitted, with its refracting angle
                    facing the left hand. It will refract the beam of light to the right, and will
                    at the same time disperse this heterogeneous light into its component rays,
                    carrying the extreme red ray from A to R, the extreme orange from A to O, the
                    extreme yellow from A to Y, &amp;c. and will form the usual prismatic spectrum
                    ROYGBPVC. If the whole length RC be divided into 1000 parts, we shall have (when
                    the whole refraction AR is small) RO very nearly 12.5, RY = 200, RG = 333, RB =
                    500, RP = 667, RV = 778, and RC = 1000; this being the proportion observed in
                    the differences of the sines of refraction by Sir Isaac Newton.</p>
                <p>Perhaps a refracting medium may be found such, that a prism made of it would
                    refract the white light from A', in the upper line of this figure, in such a
                    manner that a spectrum R'OΥ'G'B'P'V'C' shall be formed at the same distance from
                    A', and of the same length, but divided in a different proportion. We do not
                    know that such a medium has been found; but we know that a prism of flint-glass
                    has its refractive and dispersive powers so constituted, that if A'H be taken
                    about one third of AR, a spot of white light, formed by rays falling
                    perpendicularly at H', will be so refracted and dispersed that the extreme red
                    ray will be carried from H' to R', and the extreme violet from H' to C', and the
                    intermediate colours to intermediate points, forming a spectrum resembling the
                    other, but having the colours more constipated towards R', and more dilated
                    towards C s so that the ray which the common glass carried to the middle point B
                    of the spectrum RC is now in a point B' of the spectrum R'C', considerably
                    nearer to R'.</p>
                <p>Dr R. Blair found, on the other hand, that certain fluids, particularly such as
                    contain the muriatic acid, when formed into a prism, will refract the light from
                    H" (in the lower line) so as to form a spectrum R"C" equal to RC, and as far
                    removed from A" as RC is from A, but having the colours more dilated toward R'',
                    and more constipated toward C, than is observed in RC; so that the ray which was
                    carried by the prism of common glass to the middle point B, is carried to a
                    point B", considerably nearer to C".</p>
                <p>Let us now suppose that, instead of a white spot at A, we have a prismatic
                    spectrum AB (fig. 14), and that the prism of common glass is applied, as before,
                    immediately behind the prism which forms the spectrum AB. We know that this will
                    be refracted sidewise, and will make a spectrum ROYGBPC, inclined to the plane
                    of refraction in an angle of 45°; so that drawing the perpendicular RC', we have
                    RC' = C'C.</p>
                <p>We also know that the prism of flint-glass would refract the spectrum formed by
                    the first prism on EHF, in such a manner that the red ray will go to R, the
                    violet to C, and the intermediate rays to points <hi rend="italic">o</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">y, g, b, p, v,</hi> so situated that <hi rend="italic">O'o</hi> is
                    = R’O' of the other figure, Yy is = R'Y' of that figure, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gg</hi> = R'G', &amp;c. These points must therefore lie in a curve <hi
                    rend="italic">RoygbpvC,</hi> which is convex towards the axis R'C'. In like
                    manner, we may be assured that Dr Blair’s fluid will form a spectrum R <hi
                    rend="italic">o'y'g'b'p'v'</hi> C, concave toward R'C.</p>
                <p>Let it be observed, by the way, that this is a very good method for discovering
                    whether a medium disperses the light in the same proportion with the prism which
                    is employed for forming the first spectrum AB or EE. It disperses in the same or
                    in a different proportion, according as the oblique spectrum is straight or
                    crooked; and the exact proportion corresponding to each colour is found by
                    measuring the ordinates of the curves RAC or R <hi rend="italic">b'</hi> C.</p>
                <p>Having formed the oblique spectrum RBC by a prism of common glass, we know that
                    an cqual prism of the same glass, placed in a contrary position, will bring back
                    all the rays from the spectrum RBC to the spectrum AB, laying each colour on its
                    former place.</p>
                <p>In like manner, having formed the oblique spectrum RAC by a prism of flint-glass,
                    we know that another prism of flint-glass, placed in the opposite direction,
                    will bring all the rays back to the spectrum EHF.</p>
                <p>But having formed the oblique spectrum RBC by a prism of common glass, if we
                    place the flint-glass prism in the contrary position, it will bring the colour R
                    back to E, and the colour C to F; but it will not bring the colour B to H, but
                    to a point <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> such that BA is equal to AH, and AB to AH.
                    In like manner, the other colours will not be brought back to the straight line
                    EHF, but to a curve EAF, forming a crooked spectrum.</p>
                <p>In like manner, the fluids discovered by Dr Blair, when employed to bring back
                    the oblique spectrum RBC formed by common glass, will bring its extremities back
                    to E and F, and form the crooked spectrum E <hi rend="italic">h'</hi> F lying
                    beyond EHF.</p>
                <p>This experiment evidently gives us another method for examining the
                    proportionality of the dispersion of different substances.</p>
                <p>Having, by common glass, brought back the oblique spectrum formed by common glass
                    to its natural place AB, suppose the original spectrum at AB to contract
                    gradually (as Newton has made it to do by means of a lens), it is plain that the
                    oblique spectrum will also contract, and so will the second spectrum at AB; and
                    it will at last coalesce into a white spot. The effect will be equivalent to a
                    gradual compression of the whole figure, by which the parallel lines All and BC
                    gradually approach, and at last unite.</p>
                <p>In like manner, when the oblique spectrum formed by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=179" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0179-0161"/>
                    flint-glass is brought back to EHF by a flint-glass prism, and the figure
                    compressed in the same gradual manner, all the colours will coalesce into a
                    white spot.</p>
                <p>But when flint-glass is employed to bring back the oblique spectrum formed by
                    common glass, it forms the crooked spectrum E <hi rend="italic">h</hi> F. Now
                    let the figure be compressed. The curve E <hi rend="italic">h</hi> F will be
                    doubled down on the line H <hi rend="italic">h</hi>, and there will be formed a
                    compound spectrum H <hi rend="italic">h</hi>, quite unlike the common spectrum,
                    being purple or claret coloured at H by the mixture of the extreme red and
                    violet, and green edged with blue at <hi rend="italic">h</hi> by the mixture of
                    the green and blue. The fluid prisms would in like manner form a spectrum of the
                    same kind on the other side of H.</p>
                <p>This is precisely what is observed in achromatic object-glasses made of
                    crown-glass and flint: for the refraction from A to R corresponds to the
                    refraction of the convex crown-glass; and the contrary refraction from R to E
                    corresponds to the contrary refraction of the concave flint-glass, which still
                    leaves a part of the first refraction, producing a convergence to the axis of
                    the telescope. It is found to give a purple or wine-coloured focus, and within
                    this a green one, and between these an imperfect white. Dr Blair found, that
                    when the eye-glass was drawn out beyond its proper distance, a star was
                    surrounded by a green fringe, by the rays of the green end of the spectrum,
                    which crossed each other within the focus; and when the eye-glass was too near
                    the object-glass, the star had a wine-coloured fringe. The green rays were
                    ultimately most refracted. We should expect the fringe to be of a blue colour
                    rather than a green. But this is easily explained. The extreme violet rays are
                    very faint, so as hardly to be sensible; therefore, when a compound glass is
                    made as achromatic as possible to our senses, in all probability (nay certainly)
                    these almost insensible violet rays are left out, and perhaps the extreme
                    colours which are united are the red and the middle violet rays. This makes the
                    green to be the mean ray, and therefore the_most outstanding when the
                    dispersions are not proportional.</p>
                <p>Dr Blair very properly calls these spectrums, H <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and H
                    <hi rend="italic">h</hi> ', <hi rend="italic">secondary spectrums,</hi> and
                    seems to think that he is the first who has taken notice of them as
                    indispensably necessary. But this subject was touched by Clairaut, and fully
                    discusscd by Boscovich.</p>
                <p>The most essential service which the public has received at the hands of Dr
                    Blair, is the discovery of fluid mediums of proper dispersive power. By
                    composing the lenses of such substances, we are at once freed from the
                    irregularities in the refraction and dispersion of flint-glass, from which the
                    chemists have not been able to free it. In whatever way this glass is made, it
                    consists of parts which differ both in refractive and dispersive power; and when
                    taken up from the pot, these parts mix in threads, which may be disseminated
                    through the mass in any degree of fineness. But they still retain their
                    properties; and when a piece of flint-glass has been formed into a lens, the
                    eye, placed in its focus, sees the whole surface occupied by glistening threads
                    or broader veins running across it. Great rewards have been offered for removing
                    this defect, but hitherto to no purpose. We beg leave to propose the following
                    method. Let the glass be reduced to powder, and then melted with a great
                    proportion of alkaline salt, so as to make a liquor silicum. When precipitated
                    from this by an acid, it must be in a state of very uniform composition. If
                    again melted into glass, we should hope that it would be free from this defect;
                    if not, the case seems to be desperate. But by using a fluid medium, Dr Blair
                    was released from all this embarrassment; and he acquired another immense
                    advantage, that of adjusting at pleasure both the refractive and dispersive
                    powers of his lenses. In solid lenses, we do not know whether we have taken the
                    curvatures suited to the refractions till our glass is finished; and if we have
                    mistaken the proportions, all our labour is lost. But when fluids are used, it
                    is enough that we know nearly the refractions. We suit our focal distances to
                    these, and then select our curvature, so as to remove the aberration of figure,
                    preserving the focal distances. Thus, by properly tempering the fluid mediums,
                    we bring the lens to agree precisely with the theory, perfectly achromatic, and
                    the aberration of figure as much corrected as is possible.</p>
                <p>Dr Blair examined the refractive and dispersive powers of a great variety of
                    substances, and found great varieties in their actions on the different colours.
                    This is indeed what every well-informed naturalist would expect. There is no
                    doubt now among naturalists about the mechanical connection of the phenomena of
                    nature; and all are agreed that the chemical actions of the particles of matter
                    are perfectly like in kind to the action of gravitating bodies; that all these
                    phenomena are the effects of forces like those which we call attractions and
                    repulsions, and which we observe in magnets and electrified bodies; that light
                    is refracted by forces of the same kind, but differing chiefly in the small
                    extent of their sphere of activity. We cannot derive much knowledge from what he
                    has already published, because it was chiefly with the intention of giving a
                    popular, though not an accurate, view of the subject. The constructions which
                    are there mentioned are not those which he found most effectual, but those which
                    would be most easily understood, or demonstrated by the slight theory which is
                    contained in the dissertation; besides, the manner of expressing the difference
                    of refrangibility, perhaps chosen for its paradoxial appearance, does not give
                    us a clear notion of the characteristic differences of the substances examined.
                    Those rays which are ultimately most deflected from their direction, are said to
                    have become the most refrangible by the combination of different substances,
                    although in all the particular refractions by which this effect is produced,
                    they are less refracted than the violet light. We can just gather this much,
                    that common glass disperses the rays in such a manner that the ray which is in
                    the confine of the green and blue occupies the middle of the prismatic spectrum;
                    but in glasses, and many other substances which are more dispersive, this ray is
                    nearer to the ruddy extremity of the spectrum. While therefore the straight line
                    RC' (fig. 14) terminates the ordinates O <hi rend="italic">o'</hi>, YY',G <hi
                    rend="italic">g'</hi>, &amp;c., which represent the dispersion of common glass,
                    the ordinates which express the dispersions of these substances are terminated
                    by a curve passing through R and C', but lying below the line RC’. When
                    therefore parallel heterogeneous light is made to converge to the axis of a
                    convex lens of common glass, as happens at F (in fig. 8) the light is dispersed,
                    and the violet rays have a shorter focal distance. If we now apply a concave
                    lens of greater dispersive power, the red and violet rays are brought to one
                    focus F; but the green rays, not being so much refracted away from F, are left
                    behind at <hi rend="italic">φ,</hi> and have now a shorter focal distance. But
                    Dr Blair afterwards found that this was not the case with the muriate acid, and
                    some solutions in it. He found that the ray which common glass causcd to occupy
                    the middle of the spectrum, was much nearer to the blue extremity when refracted
                    by these fluids. Therefore a concave lens formed of such fluids which united the
                    red and violet rays in F', refracted the green rays to <hi rend="italic"
                    >f'.</hi></p>
                <p>Having observed this, it was an obvious conjecture, that a mixture of some of
                    these fluids might produce a medium, whose action on the intermediate rays
                    should have the same proportion that is observed on common glass; or that two of
                    them might be found which formed spectra similarly divided, and yet differing
                    sufficiently in dispersive power to enable us to destroy the dispersion by
                    contrary refractions, without destroying the whole refraction. Dr Blair
                    accordingly found a mixture of ammoniacal and mercurial <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=180" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0180-0162"/>
                    salts, and also some other substances, which produced dispersions proportional
                    to that of glass, with respect to the different colours.</p>
                <p>And thus did the result of this intricate and laborious investigation correspond
                    to his utmost wishes. He produced achromatic telescopes which seem as perfect as
                    the thing will admit of; for he was able to give them such apertures, that the
                    <hi rend="italic">incorrigible</hi> aberration arising from the spherical
                    surfaces becomes a sensible quantity, so as to preclude farther amplification of
                    the eye-glasses. We have examined one of his telescopes. The focal distance of
                    the object-glass did not exceed 17 inches, and the aperture was fully 3½ inches.
                    We viewed some single and double stars, and some common objects, with this
                    telescope; and found, that in magnifying power, brightness, and distinctness, it
                    was manifestly superior to one of Mr Dollond’s of 42 inches focal length. It
                    also gave us an opportunity of admiring the dexterity of the London artists, who
                    could work the glasses with such accuracy. We had most distinct vision of a star
                    when using an erecting eye-piece, which made this telescope magnify more than a
                    hundred times; and we found the field of vision as uniformly distinct as with
                    Dollond’s 42-inch telescope magnifying forty-six times. The intelligent reader
                    must admire the nice figuring and centring of the very deep eye-glasses which
                    are necessary for this amplification.</p>
                <p>We now proceed to consider the eye-pieces or glasses of telescopes. The proper
                    construction of an eye-piece is not less essential than that of the
                    object-glass. But our limits will not allow us to treat this subject in the same
                    detail. Our readers will find abundant information in Dr Smith’s Optics
                    concerning the eye-glasses, chiefly deduced from Huyghens’s fine theory of
                    aberration. At the same time, we must again pay Mr Dollond the merited
                    compliment of saying, that he was the first who made any scientific application
                    of this theory to the compound eye-piece for erecting the object. His eye-pieces
                    of five and six glasses are very ingenious reduplications of Huyghens’s
                    eye-pieces of two glasses, and would probably have superseded all others, had
                    not his discovery of achromatic object-glasses caused opticians to consider the
                    chromatic dispersion with more attention, and pointed out methods of correcting
                    it in the eye-piece without any compound eye-glasses. They have found that this
                    may be more conveniently done with four eye-glasses, without sensibly
                    diminishing the advantages which Huyghens showed to result from employing many
                    small refractions instead of a lesser number of great ones. As this is a curious
                    subject, we shall add what may be sufficient for making our readers fully
                    acquainted with it, and content ourselves with merely mentioning the principles
                    of the other rules for constructing an eye-piece.</p>
                <p>Such readers as are less familiarly acquainted with optical discussions will do
                    well to keep in mind the following consequences of the general focal
                    theorem.</p>
                <p>If AB (fig. 15) be a lens, R a radiant point or focus of incident rays, and <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> the focus of parallel rays coming from the opposite side;
                    then,</p>
                <p>1. Draw the perpendicular <hi rend="italic">aa</hi> ' to the axis, meeting the
                    incident ray in <hi rend="italic">a',</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a'</hi> A to
                    the centre of the lens. The refracted ray BF is parallel to <hi rend="italic"
                    >a'</hi> A; for R <hi rend="italic">a</hi> ': <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 'A (= R
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi>: <hi rend="italic">a</hi> A) = RB: BF (= RA: AF), which
                    is the focal theorem.</p>
                <p>2. An oblique pencil BP <hi rend="italic">b</hi> proceeding from any point P
                    which is not in the axis, is collected to the point <hi rend="italic">f,</hi>
                    where the refracted ray BF cuts the line PA <hi rend="italic">f</hi> drawn from
                    P through the centre of the lens: for Pα': <hi rend="italic">a</hi> ’A = PB: B
                    <hi rend="italic">f</hi>, which is also the focal theorem.</p>
                <p>The Galilean telescope is susceptible of so little improve ment that we need not
                    employ any time in illustrating its performance.</p>
                <p>The simple astronomical telescope is represented in fig. 16. The beam of parallel
                    rays, inclined to the axis, is made to converge to a point G, where it forms an
                    image of the lowest point of a very distant object. These rays decussating from
                    G fall on the eye-glass; the ray from the lowest point B of the object-glass
                    falls on the eye-glass at <hi rend="italic">b;</hi> and the ray from A falls on
                    <hi rend="italic">a;</hi> and the ray from the centre O falls on <hi
                    rend="italic">o</hi>. These rays are rendered parallel, or nearly so, by
                    refraction through the eye-glass, and take the direction <hi rend="italic"
                    >bit,</hi> oI, <hi rend="italic">ai.</hi> If the eye be placed so that this
                    pencil of parallel rays may enter it, they converge to a point of the retina,
                    and give distinct vision to the lowest point of the object. It appears inverted,
                    because the rays by which we see its lowest point come in the direction which in
                    simple vision is connected with the upper point of an object. They come from
                    above, and therefore are thought to proceed from above. We see the point as if
                    situated in the direction Io. In like manner, the eye placed at I sees the upper
                    point of the object in the direction IP, and its middle in the direction IE. The
                    proper place for the eye is I; if brought much nearer the glass, or removed much
                    farther from it, some or the whole of this extreme pencil of rays will not enter
                    the pupil. It is therefore of importance to determine this point. Because the
                    eye requires parallel rays for distinct vision, it is plain that F must be the
                    principal focus of the eye-glass. Therefore, by the common focal theorem, OF: OE
                    = OE: OI, or OF: FE = OE: EI.</p>
                <p>The magnifying power being measured by the magnitude of the visual angle,
                    compared with the magnitude of the visual angle with the naked eye, we have <hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> o</hi><hi rend="superscript"> I</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> p</hi> / <hi rend="italic subscript"> o</hi><hi rend="subscript">
                    O</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> p</hi> or <hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> o</hi><hi rend="superscript"> IF</hi> / <hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> o</hi><hi rend="subscript"> OF</hi> for the measure of the
                    magnifying power. This is very nearly = <hi rend="superscript"> OE</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> EI</hi> or <hi rend="superscript"> OF</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> FI</hi>.</p>
                <p>As the line OE, joining the centres of the lenses, and perpendicular to their
                    surfaces, is called the axis of the telescope, so the ray OG is called the axis
                    of the oblique pencil, being really the axis of the cone of light which has the
                    object-glass for its base. This ray is through its whole course the axis of the
                    oblique pencil; and when its course is determined, the amplification, the field
                    of vision, the apertures of the glasses, are all determined. For this purpose we
                    have only to consider the centre of the object-glass as a radical point, and
                    trace the process of a ray from this point through the other glasses: this will
                    be the axis of some oblique pencil.</p>
                <p>It is evident, therefore, that the field of vision depends on the breadth of the
                    eye-glass. Should we increase this, the extreme pencil will pass through I,
                    because O and I are still the conjugate foci of the eye-glass. On the other
                    hand, the angle resolved on for the extent or field of vision gives the breadth
                    of the eye-glass.</p>
                <p>We may here observe, by the way, that for all optical instruments there must be
                    two optical figures considered. The first shows the progress of a pencil of rays
                    coming from one point of the object. The various focuses of this pencil show the
                    places of the different images, real or virtual. Such a figure is formed by the
                    three rays AG <hi rend="italic">ai</hi>, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=181" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0181-0163"/>
                    OG <hi rend="italic">o</hi> I, BG <hi rend="italic">bi</hi>. The second shows
                    the progress of the axes of the different pencils proceeding through the centre
                    of the object-glass. The focuses of this pencil of axes show the places where an
                    image of the object-glass is formed; and this field determines the field of
                    vision, the apertures of the lenses, and the amplification or magnifying power.
                    The three rays OGoI, OFEI, OHPI, form this figure.</p>
                <p>See also fig. 24, where the progress of both sets of pencils is more
                    diversified.</p>
                <p>The perfection of a telescope is to represent an object in its proper shape,
                    distinctly magnified, with a great field of vision, and sufficiently bright. But
                    there are limits to all these qualities; and an increase of one of them, for the
                    most part, diminishes the rest. The brightness depends on the aperture of the
                    object-glass, and will increase in the same proportion (because <hi
                    rend="italic">iι'</hi> will always be to AB in the proportion of EF to FO), till
                    the diameter of the emergent pencil is equal to that of the pupil of the eye.
                    Increasing the object glass any more, can send no more light into the eye. But
                    we cannot make the emergent pencil nearly so large as this when the telescope
                    magnifies much; for the great aperture of the object glass produces an
                    indistinct image at GF, and its indistinctness is magnified by the
                    eye-glass.</p>
                <p>A great field of vision is incompatible with the true shape of the object; for it
                    is not strictly true that all rays flowing from O are refracted to I. Those rays
                    which go to the margin of the eye-glass cross the axis between E and I; and
                    therefore they cross it at a greater angle than if they passed through I. Now
                    had they really passed through I, the object would have been represented in its
                    due proportions. Therefore, since the angles of the marginal parts are enlarged
                    by the aberration of the eye-glass, the marginal parts themselves will appear
                    enlarged, or the object appear distorted. Thus a chess-board viewed through a
                    reading glass appears drawn out at the corners, and the straight lines are all
                    changed into curves, as is represented in fig. 17.</p>
                <p>The circumstance which most peremptorily limits the extent of field is the
                    necessary distinctness. If the vision be indistinct, it is useless, and no other
                    quality can compensate this defect. The distortion is very inconsiderable in
                    much larger angles of vision than we can admit, and is unworthy of the attention
                    paid to it by optical writers. They have been induced to take notice of it,
                    because the means of correcting it in a considerable degree are attainable, and
                    afford an opportunity of exhibiting their knowledge; whereas the indistinctness
                    which accompanies a large field is a subject of most difficult discussion, and
                    has hitherto baffled all their efforts to express it by any intelligible or
                    manageable formulae.</p>
                <p>This subject must however be considered. The image at GF of a very remote object
                    is not a plain surface perpendicular to the axis of the telescope, but is nearly
                    spherical, having O for its centre. If a number of pencils of parallel rays
                    crossing each other in I fall on the eye-glass, they will term a picture on the
                    opposite side, in the focus F. But this picture will by no means be flat, nor
                    nearly so, but very concave towards E. Its exact form is of most difficult
                    investigation. The elements of it are given by Dr Barrow; and we have given the
                    chief of them in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics</hi>, when considering
                    the foci of infinitely slender pencils of oblique rays. Therefore it is
                    impossible that the picture formed by the object-glass can be seen distinctly in
                    all its parts by the eye-glass. Even if it were flat, the points G and II (fig.
                    16) are too far from the eye-glass when the middle F is at the proper distance
                    for distinct vision. When, therefore, the telescope is so adjusted that we have
                    distinct vision of the middle of the field, in order to see the margin
                    distinctly we must push in the eye-glass: and having so done, the middle of the
                    field becomes indistinct. When the field of vision exceeds twelve or fifteen
                    degrees, it is not possible by any contrivance to make it tolerably distinct all
                    over; and we must turn the telescope successively to the different parts of the
                    field that we may see them agreeably.</p>
                <p>The cause of this indistinctness is, as we have already said, the shortness of
                    the lateral foci of lateral and oblique pencils refracted by the eye-glass. The
                    oblique pencil <hi rend="italic">bGa,</hi> by which an eye placed at I sees the
                    point G of the image, is a cone of light, having a circular base on the
                    eye-glass, of which circle <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> is one of the diameters.
                    There is a diameter perpendicular to this, which, in this figure, is represented
                    by the point o. Fig. 18 represents the base of the cone as seen by an eye placed
                    in the axis of the telescope, with the object-glass as appearing behind it. The
                    point <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is formed by a ray which comes from the lowest
                    point B of the object glass, and the point <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is
                    illuminated by a ray from A. The point <hi rend="italic">c</hi> at the right
                    hand of the circular base of this cone of light came from the point C on the
                    left side of the object-glass; and the light comes to <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    from D. Now the laws of optics demonstrate, that the rays which come through the
                    points <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> are more convergent
                    after refraction than the rays which come through <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> The analogies, therefore, which ascertain the foci of
                    rays lying in planes passing through the axis, do not determine the foci of the
                    others. Of this we may be sensible by looking through a lens to a figure on
                    which are drawn concentric circles crossed by radii. When the telescope is so
                    adjusted that we see distinctly the extremity of one of the radii, we shall not
                    see distinctly the circumference which crosses the extremity with equal
                    distinctness, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> This difference, however,
                    between the foci of the rays which come through <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> and those which come through c and <hi rend="italic"
                    >d,</hi> is not considerable in the fields of vision which are otherwise
                    admissible. But the same difference of foci obtains also with respect to the
                    dispersion of light, and is more remarkable. Both D’Alembert and Euler have
                    attempted to introduce it into their formulae; but they have made them useless
                    for any practical purpose by their inextricable complication.</p>
                <p>This must serve ns <hi rend="italic">a</hi> general indication of the
                    difficulties which occur in the construction of telescopes, even although the
                    object-glass were perfect, forming an image without the smallest confusion or
                    distortion.</p>
                <p>There is yet another difficulty or imperfection. The rays of the pencil <hi
                    rend="italic">aGb</hi> (fig. 16), when refracted through the eye-glass, are also
                    separated into their component colours. The edge of the lens must evidently
                    perform the office of a prism, and the white ray <hi rend="italic">Gb</hi> will
                    be so dispersed, that if <hi rend="italic">bi</hi> be the path of its red ray,
                    the violet ray, which makes another part of it, will take such a course <hi
                    rend="italic">bn</hi> that the angle <hi rend="italic">ibn</hi> will be nearly
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 27</hi> th of <hi
                    rend="italic">G'bi'.</hi> The ray <hi rend="italic">Ga</hi> passing through a
                    part of the lens whose surfaces are less inclined to each other, will be less
                    refracted, and will be less dispersed in the same proportion very nearly.
                    Therefore the two violet rays will be very nearly parallel when the two red rays
                    are rendered parallel.</p>
                <p>Hence it must happen that the object will appear bordered with coloured fringes.
                    A black line seen near the margin on a white ground, will have a ruddy and
                    orange border on the outside, and a blue border within: and this confusion is
                    altogether independent on the object-glass, and is so much the greater as the
                    visual angle <hi rend="italic">b</hi> IE is greater.</p>
                <p>Such are the difficulties. They would be unsurmountable, were it not that some of
                    them are so connected that, to a certain extent, the diminution of one is
                    accompanied <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=182"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0182-0164"/> by a diminution of the other. What are called the
                    <hi rend="italic">caustic curves</hi> are the geometrical loci of the foci of
                    infinitely slender pencils; consequently the point G is very nearly in the
                    caustic formed by a beam of light consisting of rays parallel to Io, and
                    occupying the whole surface of the eye-glass, because the pencil of rays which
                    are collected at G is very small. Any thing therefore that diminishes the mutual
                    inclination of the adjoining rays, puts their concourse farther off. Now this is
                    precisely what we want; for the point G of the image formed by the object-glass
                    is already beyond the focus of the oblique slender pencil of parallel rays <hi
                    rend="italic">ia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i'b;</hi> and therefore, if we could
                    make this focus go a little farther from <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> we shall bring it nearer to G, and obtain more distinct
                    vision of this point of the object. Now let it be recollected, that in moderate
                    refractions through prisms, two rays which are inclined to each other in a small
                    angle are, after refraction, inclined to each other in the same angle.
                    Therefore, if we can diminish the aberration of the ray <hi rend="italic"
                    >ai,</hi> or oI, or <hi rend="italic">bi',</hi> we diminish their mutual
                    inclination, and consequently the mutual inclination of the rays Ga, Go, <hi
                    rend="italic">GlI,</hi> and therefore lengthen the focus, and get more distinct
                    vision of the point G. Therefore we at once correct the distortion and the
                    indistinctness; and this is the aim of Mr Huyghens’s great principle of dividing
                    the refractions.</p>
                <p>The general method is as follows. Let O be the object-glass (fig. 19) and E the
                    eye-glass of a telescope, and F</p>
                <p>their common focus, and FG the image formed by the object-glass. The proportion
                    of their focal distances is supposed to be such as gives as great a magnifying
                    power as the perfection of the object-glass will admit. Let BI be the axis of
                    the emergent pencil. It is known by the focal theorem that GE is parallel to BI:
                    therefore BGE is the whole refraction or deflection of the ray OHB from its
                    former direction. Let it be proposed to diminish the aberrations by dividing
                    this into two parts by means of two glasses D and <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> so
                    as to make the ultimate angle of vision <hi rend="italic">bic</hi> equal to BIE,
                    and thus retain the same magnifying power and visible field. Let it be proposed
                    to divide it into the parts BGC and CGE.</p>
                <p>From G draw any line GD to the axis towards O; and draw the perpendicular DH,
                    cutting OG in H; draw He parallel to GC, cutting GD in <hi rend="italic">g;</hi>
                    draw <hi rend="italic">gf</hi> perpendicular to the axis, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >ge</hi> parallel to GE; draw <hi rend="italic">eb</hi> perpendicular to the
                    axis; draw Dδ parallel to GC, and <hi rend="italic">dδ</hi> perpendicular to the
                    axis. Then if there be placed at D a lens whose focal distance is D <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi>, and another at <hi rend="italic">e</hi> whose focal
                    distance is <hi rend="italic">ef,</hi> the thing is done. The ray OH will be
                    refracted into H <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, and this into <hi rend="italic"
                    >bi,</hi> parallel to BI.</p>
                <p>The demonstration of this construction is so evident by means of the common focal
                    theorem, that we need not repeat it, nor the reasons for its advantages. We have
                    the same magnifying power, and the same field of vision; we have less
                    aberration, and therefore less distortion and indistinctness; and this is
                    brought about by a lens HD of a smaller aperture and a greater focal distance
                    than BE. Consequently, if we are contented with the distinctness of the margin
                    of the field with a single eye-glass, we may greatly increase the field of
                    vision; for if we increase DH to the size of EB, we shall have a greater field,
                    and much greater distinctness in the margin; because HD is of a longer focal
                    distance, and will bear a greater aperture, preserving the same distinctness at
                    the edge. On this account the glass HD is commonly called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >field-glass.</hi></p>
                <p>It must be observed here, however, that although the distortion of the object is
                    lessened, there is a real distortion produced in the image <hi rend="italic"
                    >fg.</hi> But this, when magnified by the glass <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> is
                    smaller than the distortion produced by the glass E, of greater aperture and
                    shorter focus, on the undistorted image GF. But because there is a distortion in
                    the second image <hi rend="italic">fg,</hi> this construction cannot be used for
                    the telescopes of astronomical quadrants, and other graduated instruments,
                    because then equal divisions of the micrometer would not correspond to equal
                    angles.</p>
                <p>But the same construction will answer in this case by taking the point D on that
                    side of F which is remote from O (fig. 20). This is the form now employed in the
                    telescopes of all graduated instruments.</p>
                <p>The exact proportion in which the distortion and the indistinctness at the edges
                    of the field are diminished by this construction, depends on the proportion in
                    which the angle BGE is divided by GC, and is of pretty difficult investigation.
                    But it never deviates far (never one eighth in optical instruments) from the
                    proportion of the squares of the angles. We may, without any sensible error,
                    suppose it in this proportion. This gives us a practical rule of easy
                    recollection, and of most extensive use. When we would diminish an aberration by
                    dividing the whole refraction into two parts, we shall do it most effectually by
                    making them equal. In like manner, if we divide it into three parts by means of
                    two additional glasses, we must make each = <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 5</hi> of the whole, and so on for a greater number.</p>
                <p>This useful problem, even when limited, as we have done, to equal refractions, is
                    as yet indeterminate; that is, susceptible of an infinity of solutions; for the
                    point D, where the field-glass is placed, was taken at pleasure; yet there must
                    be situations more proper than others. The aberrations which produce distortion,
                    and those which produce indistinctness, do not follow the same proportions. To
                    correct the indistinctness, we should not select such positions of the lens HD
                    as will give a small focal distance to <hi rend="italic">be;</hi> that is, we
                    should not remove it very far from F. Huy-ghens recommends the proportion of
                    three to one for that of the focal distances of the lens HD and <hi
                    rend="italic">eb,</hi> and says that the distance De should be — 2Fe. This will
                    make <hi rend="italic">ei</hi> = ½ eF, and will divide the whole refraction into
                    two equal parts, as any one will readily see by constructing the common optical
                    figure. Mr Short, the celebrated improver of reflecting telescopes, generally
                    employed this proportion; and we shall presently see that it is a very good
                    one.</p>
                <p>It has already been observed that the great refractions which take place on the
                    eye-glasses, occasion very considerable dispersions, and disturb the vision by
                    fringing every thing with colours. To remedy this, achromatic eye-glasses may be
                    employed, constructed by the rules already delivered. This construction,
                    however, is incomparably more intricate than that of object-glasses; for the
                    equations must involve the distance of the radiant point, and be more
                    complicated; and this complication is immensely increased on account of the
                    great obliquity of the pencils.</p>
                <p>Most fortunately the Huyghenian construction of an eyepiece enables us to correct
                    this dispersion to a great degree of exactness. A heterogeneous ray is dispersed
                    at H, and the red ray belonging to it falls on the lens <hi rend="italic"
                    >be,</hi> at a greater distance from the centre than the violet ray coming from
                    H. It will therefore be less refracted, <hi rend="italic">coeteris paribus,</hi>
                    by <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=183"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0183-0165"/> the lens <hi rend="italic">be;</hi> and it is
                    possible that the difference may be such that the red and violet rays dispersed
                    at II may be rendered parallel at <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> or even a little
                    divergent, so as to unite accurately with the red ray at the bottom of the eye.
                    How this may be effected by a proper selection of the places and figures of the
                    lenses, will appear by the following proposition, which we imagine is new, and
                    not inelegant.</p>
                <p>Let the compound ray OP (fig. 21) be dispersed by the lens PC, and let PV, PR be
                    its violet and red rays, cutting the axis in <hi rend="italic">g</hi> and G. It
                    is required to place another lens RD in their way, so that the emergent rays Rr,
                    Vr, shall be parallel.</p>
                <p>Produce the incident ray OP to Z. The angles ZPR, ZPV, are given (and RPV is
                    nearly = <hi rend="superscript"> ZPR</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 27</hi>), and
                    the intersections G and <hi rend="italic">g</hi> with the axis. Let F be the
                    focus of parallel red light coming through the lens RD in the opposite
                    direction. Then (by the common optical theorem) the perpendicular F <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> will cut PR in such a point <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> that
                    <hi rend="italic">g</hi> F will be parallel to the emergent ray Rr, and to V <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi>. Therefore if <hi rend="italic">g</hi> D cut PV in <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">uf</hi> be drawn perpendicular to
                    the axis, we shall have (also by the common theorem) the point <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> for the focus of violet rays, and DF: D <hi rend="italic">f</hi> = D <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi>: D <hi rend="italic">u</hi> = 28: 27 nearly, or in a given
                    ratio.</p>
                <p>The problem is therefore reduced to this, “to draw from a point D in the line CG
                    a line D <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> which shall be cut by the lines PR and PV in
                    the given ratio.”</p>
                <p>The following construction naturally offers itself. Make GM: <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi> M in the given ratio, and draw MK parallel to P <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi>. Through <hi rend="italic">any</hi> point D of CG draw the straight line
                    PDK, cutting MK in K. Join GK, and draw D <hi rend="italic">g</hi> parallel to
                    KG. This will solve the problem; and, drawing <hi rend="italic">g</hi> F
                    perpendicular to the axis, we shall have F for the focus of the lens RD for
                    parallel red rays.</p>
                <p>The demonstration is evident; for MK being parallel to <hi rend="italic">Pg,</hi>
                    we have GM: <hi rend="italic">g</hi> M = GK: HK = <hi rend="italic">g</hi> D: uD
                    = FD <hi rend="italic">f</hi> D, in the ratio required.</p>
                <p>This problem admits of an infinity of solutions, because the point D may be taken
                    anywhere in the line CG. It may therefore be subjected to such conditions as may
                    produce other advantages.</p>
                <p>1. It may be restricted by the magnifying power, or by the division which we
                    choose to make of the whole refraction which produces this magnifying power.
                    Thus, if we have resolved to diminish the aberrations by making the two
                    refractions equal, we have determined the angle RrD. Therefore draw GK, making
                    the angle MGK equal to that which the emergent pencil must make with the axis,
                    in order to produce this magnifying power. Then draw MK parallel to <hi
                    rend="italic">Pg,</hi> meeting GK in K. Then draw PK, cutting the axis in D, and
                    D <hi rend="italic">g</hi> parallel to GK, and <hi rend="italic">g</hi> F
                    perpendicular to the axis. D is the place and DF the focal distance of the
                    eye-glass.</p>
                <p>2. Particular circumstances may cause us to fix on a particular place D, and we
                    only want the focal distance. In this case the first construction suffices.</p>
                <p>3. We may have determined on a certain focal distance DF, and the place must be
                    determined. In this case let GF: F <hi rend="italic">g</hi> = 1: tan. G,</p>
                <p>F <hi rend="italic">g</hi>: <hi rend="italic">fu —</hi> 1: <hi rend="italic"
                    >m,</hi> m being = <hi rend="superscript"> 27</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    28</hi>, <hi rend="italic">fu</hi>: <hi rend="italic">fg</hi> = tan. <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi>: 1; then GF: <hi rend="italic">fg</hi> = tan. <hi
                    rend="italic">g: m</hi> tan. G; then GF — <hi rend="italic">fg</hi>: GF tan. <hi
                    rend="italic">g — m</hi> tan. G: tan. <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Gg</hi> + F <hi rend="italic">f:</hi> GF = tan. <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi> — <hi rend="italic">m</hi> tan. G: tan. <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> and GF
                    = <hi rend="italic">Gg</hi> + F <hi rend="italic">f</hi><hi rend="superscript">
                    tan.</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> g</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    tan.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> g</hi><hi rend="subscript"> -</hi><hi
                    rend="italic                     subscript"> m</hi><hi rend="subscript">
                    tan.G</hi>, and is therefore given, and the place of F is determined; and since
                    FD is given by supposition, D is determined.</p>
                <p>The application of this problem to our purpose is difficult, if we take it in the
                    most general terms; but the nature of the thing makes such limitations that it
                    becomes very easy. In the case of the dispersion of light, the angle GP <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> is so small that MK may be drawn parallel to PG without any
                    sensible error. If the ray OP were parallel to CG, then G would be the focus of
                    the lens PC, and the point M would fall on C; because the focal distance of red
                    rays is to that of violet rays in the same proportion for every lens, and
                    therefore CG: <hi rend="italic">Cg</hi> = DF: D <hi rend="italic">f.</hi> Now,
                    in a telescope which magnifies considerably, the angle at the object-glass is
                    very small, and CG hardly exceeds the focal distance; and CG is to <hi
                    rend="italic">Cg</hi> very nearly in the same proportion of 28 to 27. We may
                    therefore draw through C (fig. 22) a line CK parallel to PG; then draw GK’
                    perpendicular to the axis of the lenses, and join PK'; draw K'BE parallel to CG,
                    cutting PK in B; draw BHI parallel to GK, cutting GK' in H. Join HD and PK. It
                    is evident that CG is bisected in F', and that K’B = 2FD; also K'H: HG = K’B: BE
                    = CD: DG. Therefore DH is parallel to CK ’ or to PG. But because PF =F'K', PD is
                    = DB, and IH = HB. Therefore <hi rend="italic">gD =</hi> HB, and FD <hi
                    rend="subscript"> =</hi> K'B = 2F'D; and FD is bisected in F'. Therefore CD =
                    <hi rend="superscript"> CG + FD</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>That is, in order that the eye-glass RD may correct the dispersion of the
                    field-glass PC, <hi rend="italic">the distance between them must be equal to the
                    half sum of their focal distances</hi> very nearly. More exactly, <hi
                    rend="italic">the distance between them must be equal to the half sum of the
                    focal distance of the eye-glass, and the distance at which the field-glass would
                    form an image of the object-glass.</hi> For the point G is the focus to which a
                    ray coming from the centre of the object-glass is refracted by the
                    field-glass.</p>
                <p>This is a very simple solution of an important problem. Huyghens’s eye-piece
                    corresponds with it exactly. If indeed the dispersion at P is not entirely
                    produced by the refraction, but perhaps combined with some previous dispersion,
                    the point M (fig. 21) will not coincide with C (fig. 22), and we shall have GC
                    to GM as the natural dispersion at P to the dispersion which really obtains
                    there. This may destroy the equation CD = <hi rend="superscript"> CG + FD</hi> /
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. Thus, in a manner rather unexpected, have we freed
                    the eye-glasses from the greatest part of the effect of dispersion. We may do it
                    entirely by pushing the eye-glass a little nearer to the field-glass. This will
                    render the violet rays a little divergent from the red, so as to produce a
                    perfect picture at the bottom of the eye. But by doing so we have hurt the
                    distinctness of the whole picture, because F is not in the focus of RD. We
                    remedy this by <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=184"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0184-0166"/> drawing both glasses out a little, and the
                    telescope is made perfect.</p>
                <p>This improvement cannot be applied to the construction of quadrant telescopes,
                    such as fig. 20. Mr Ramsden has attempted it, however, in a very ingenious way,
                    which merits a place here, and is also instructive in another respect. The
                    field-glass HD is a plano-convex, with its plane side next the image GF. It is
                    placed very near this image. The consequence of this disposition is, that the
                    image GF produces a vertical image which is much less convex towards the glass.
                    He then places a lens on the point C, where the red ray would cross the axis.
                    The violet ray will pass on the other side of it. If the focal distance of this
                    glass be <hi rend="italic">fc,</hi> the vision will be distinct and free from
                    colour. It has, however, the inconvenience of obliging the eye to be close to
                    the glass, which is very troublesome.</p>
                <p>This would be a good construction for a magic lanthorn, or for the object-glass
                    of a solar microscope, or indeed of any compound microscope.</p>
                <p>We may presume that the reader is now pretty familiar with the different
                    circumstances which must be considered in the construction of an eye-piece, and
                    proceed to consider those which must be employed to erect the object.</p>
                <p>This may be done by placing the lens which receives the light from the
                    object-glass in such a manner that a second image (inverted with respect to the
                    first) may be formed beyond it, and this may he viewed by an eye-glass. Such a
                    construction is represented in fig. 23. But, besides many other defects, it
                    tinges the object prodigiously with colour. The ray <hi rend="italic">od</hi> is
                    dispersed at into the red ray <hi rend="italic">dr</hi> and the violet <hi
                    rend="italic">dv. v</hi> being farther from the centre than <hi rend="italic"
                    >r;</hi> the refracted ray <hi rend="italic">vv'</hi> crosses rr <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>, both by reason of spherical aberration and its
                    greater refrangibility.</p>
                <p>But the common day-telescope, invented by F. Rheita, has in this respect greatly
                    the advantage of the one now described. The rays of compound light are dispersed
                    at two points. The violet ray in its course falls without the red ray, but is
                    accurately collected with it at a common focus, as we shall demonstrate by and
                    by. Since they cross each other in the focus, the violet ray must fall within
                    the red ray, and be less refracted than if it had fallen on the same point with
                    the red ray. Had it fallen there, it would have separated from it; but by a
                    proper diminution of its refraction, it is kept parallel to it, or nearly so.
                    And this is one excellence of this telescope; when constructed with three
                    eye-glasses perfectly equal, the colour is sensibly diminished, and by using an
                    eye-glass somewhat smaller it may be removed entirely. We say no more of it at
                    present, because we shall find its construction included in another, which is
                    still more perfect.</p>
                <p>It is evident at first sight that this telescope may be improved by substituting
                    for the eye-glass the Huyghenian double eye-glass, or field-glass and eye-glass
                    represented in figs,. 19 and 20, and that the first of these may be improved and
                    rendered achromatic. This will require the two glasses to be increased from
                    their present dimensions to the size of a field-glass suited to the magnifying
                    power of the telescope, supposing it an astronomical telescope. Thus we shall
                    have a telescope of four eye-glasses. The first three will be of a considerable
                    focal distance, and two of them will have a common focus at <hi rend="italic"
                    >b.</hi> But this is considerably different from the eye-pieces of four glasses
                    which are now used, and are far better. We arc indebted for them to Mr Dollond,
                    who was a mathematician as well as an artist, and in the course of his research
                    discovered resources which had not been thought of. He had not then discovered
                    the achromatic object-glass, and was busy in improving the eye-glasses by
                    diminishing their spherical aberration. His first thought was to make the
                    Huyghenian addition at both the images of the day-telescope. This suggested to
                    him the following eye-piece of five glasses.</p>
                <p>Fig. 24 represents this eye-piece, but there is not room for the object-glass at
                    its proper distance. A pencil of rays coming from the upper point of the object
                    is made to converge (by the object-glass) to G, where it would form a picture of
                    that part of the object. But it is intercepted by the lens A <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi>, and its axis is bent towards the axis of the telescope in the direction
                    <hi rend="italic">ab.</hi> At the same time, the rays which converged to G
                    converge to <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> and there is formed an inverted picture of
                    the object at <hi rend="italic">gf.</hi> The axis of the pencil is again
                    refracted at <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> crosses the axis of the telescope in H,
                    is refracted again at <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> at <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and
                    at <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> and at last crosses the axis in I. The rays of this
                    pencil, diverging from <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> are made less diverging, and
                    proceed as if they came from <hi rend="italic">g',</hi> in the line <hi
                    rend="italic">Bgg'.</hi> The lens cC causes them to converge to <hi
                    rend="italic">g',</hi> in the line G"C <hi rend="italic">g'</hi>. The lens <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> D makes them converge still more to G", and there they form
                    an erect picture G"F"; diverging from G'', they are rendered parallel by the
                    refraction at <hi rend="italic">e.</hi></p>
                <p>At H the rays are nearly parallel. Had the glass B <hi rend="italic">b</hi> been
                    a little farther from A, they would have been accurately so, and the
                    object-glass, with the glasses A and B, would have formed an astronomical
                    telescope with the Huyghenian eye-piece. The glasses C, D, and E, are intended
                    merely for bending the rays back again till they again cross the axis in I. The
                    glass C tends chiefly to diminish the great angle BH <hi rend="italic">b</hi>;
                    and then the two glasses D and E are another Huyghenian eye-piece.</p>
                <p>The art in this construction lies in the proper adjustment of the glasses, so as
                    to divide the whole bending of the pencil pretty equally among them, and to form
                    the last image in the focus of the eye-glass, and at a proper distance from the
                    other glass. Bringing B nearer to A would bcnd the pencil more to the axis.
                    Placing C farther from B would do the same thing; but this would be accompanied
                    with more aberration, because the rays would fall at a greater distance from the
                    centres of the lenses. The greatest bending is made at the field-glass D; and we
                    imagine that the <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=185"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0185-0167"/> telescope would be improved, and made more
                    distinct at the edges of the field, by employing another glass of great focal
                    distance between C and D.</p>
                <p>There is an image formed at H of the object-glasses, and the whole light passes
                    through a small circle in this place. It is usual to put a plate here pierced
                    with a hole which has the diameter of this image. A second image of the
                    object-glass is formed at I, and indeed wherever the pencils cross the axis. A
                    lens placed at H makes no change in any of the angles, nor in the magnifying
                    power, and affects only the place where the images are formed. And, on the other
                    hand, a lens placed at <hi rend="italic">f</hi> or F", where a real image is
                    formed, makes no change in the places of the images, but affects the mutual
                    inclination of the pencils. This affords a resource to the artist, by which he
                    may combine properties which seem incompatible. The aperture of A dcter-mincs
                    the visible field and all the other apertures.</p>
                <p>We must avoid forming a real image, such as <hi rend="italic">fg,</hi> or F''G",
                    on or very near any glass; for we cannot see this image without seeing along
                    with it every particle of dust and every scratch on the glass. We see them as
                    making part of the object when the image is exactly on the glass, and we see
                    them confusedly, and so as to confuse the object, when the image is near it. For
                    when the image is on or very near any glass, the pencil of light occupies a very
                    small part of its surface, and a particle of dust intercepts a great proportion
                    of it.</p>
                <p>It is plain that this construction will not do for the telescope of graduated
                    instruments, because the micrometer cannot be applied to the second image <hi
                    rend="italic">fg,</hi> on account of its being a little distorted, as has been
                    observed of the Huy-ghenian eye-piece. Also the interposition of the glass C
                    makes it difficult to correct the dispersion.</p>
                <p>By proper reasoning from the correction in the Huyghe-nian eye-piece, we are led
                    to the best construction of one with three glasses, which we shall now’
                    consider, taking it in a particular form, which shall make the discussion easy,
                    and make us fully masters of the principles which lead to a better form.
                    Therefore let PA (fig. 25) be the glass which first receives the light
                    proceeding from the image formed by the object-glass, and let OP be the axis of
                    the extreme pencil. This is refracted into PR, which is again refracted into R
                    <hi rend="italic">r</hi> by the next lens Br. Let <hi rend="italic">b</hi> be
                    the focus of parallel rays of the second lens. Draw PBr. We know that A <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi>: <hi rend="italic">b</hi> B — PB: Br, and that rays of one
                    kind diverging from P will be collected at <hi rend="italic">r.</hi> But if PR,
                    P V be a red and a violet ray, the violet ray will be more refracted at V, and
                    will cross the red ray in some intermediate point <hi rend="italic">g</hi> of
                    the line R <hi rend="italic">r</hi>. If therefore the first image had been
                    formed precisely on the lens PA, we should have a second image at <hi
                    rend="italic">fg</hi> free from all coloured fringes.</p>
                <p>If the refractions at P and R are equal (as in the common day-telescope), the
                    dispersion at V must be equal to that at P, or the angle <hi rend="italic"
                    >v</hi> Vr = VPR. But we have ultimately RPV: R <hi rend="italic">r</hi> V = BC:
                    AB (= B <hi rend="italic">b</hi>: <hi rend="italic">Ab</hi> by the focal
                    theorem). Therefore <hi rend="italic">g</hi> V <hi rend="italic">r: gr</hi> V
                    (or <hi rend="italic">gr: g</hi> V, or <hi rend="italic">Cf</hi>: <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> B) = B <hi rend="italic">b</hi>: A <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> and AB: A <hi rend="italic">b —</hi> R <hi rend="italic">r</hi>: R <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi>.</p>
                <p>This shows, by the way, the advantage of the common day-telescope. In this AB = 2
                    Aft, and therefore <hi rend="italic">f</hi> is the place of the last image which
                    is free from coloured fringes* But this image will not be seen free from
                    coloured fringes through the eye-glass C <hi rend="italic">r</hi> if <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> be its focus: for had <hi rend="italic">gr, gv</hi> been
                    both red rays, they would have been parallel after refraction; but <hi
                    rend="italic">gv</hi> being a violet ray, will be more refracted. It will not
                    indeed be so much deflected from parallelism as the violet ray, which naturally
                    accompanies the red ray to <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> because it falls nearer the
                    centre. By computation its dispersion is diminished about <hi rend="superscript"
                    > 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 7 th</hi>.</p>
                <p>In order that <hi rend="italic">gv</hi> may be made parallel to <hi rend="italic"
                    >gr</hi> after refraction, the refraction at <hi rend="italic">r</hi> must be
                    such that the dispersion corresponding to it may be of a proper magnitude. How
                    to determine this is the question. Let the dispersion at <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi> be to the dispersion produced by the refraction at <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> (which is required for producing the intended magnifying power) as 1 to
                    9. Make 9: 1 = <hi rend="italic">ff': f'C =,fC:</hi> CD, and draw the
                    perpendicular D <hi rend="italic">r'</hi> meeting the refracted ray <hi
                    rend="italic">rr'</hi> in <hi rend="italic">r'.</hi> Then we know by the common
                    focal theorem, that if <hi rend="italic">f'</hi> be the focus of the lens C <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi>, red rays diverging from <hi rend="italic">g</hi> will be
                    united in <hi rend="italic">r'</hi>. But the violet ray <hi rend="italic"
                    >gν</hi> will be refracted into <hi rend="italic">vv'</hi> parallel to <hi
                    rend="italic">rr'.</hi> For the angle <hi rend="italic">vr'r: vgr =</hi>
                    (ultimately) <hi rend="italic">fC</hi>: CD =9:1. Therefore the angle <hi
                    rend="italic">vdr</hi> is equal to the dispersion produced at <hi rend="italic"
                    >r,</hi> and therefore equal to <hi rend="italic">r'νυ',</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">vν</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> l</hi> is parallel to <hi
                    rend="italic">rd.</hi></p>
                <p>But by this we have destroyed the distinct vision of the image formed at <hi
                    rend="italic">fg,</hi> because it is no longer at the focus of the eye-glass.
                    But distinct vision will be restored by pushing the glasses nearer to the
                    object-glass. This makes the rays of each particular pencil more divergent after
                    refraction through A, but scarcely makes any change in the directions of the
                    pencils themselves. Thus the image comes to the focus <hi rend="italic">f',</hi>
                    and makes no sensible change in the dispersions.</p>
                <p>In the common day-telescope, the first image is formed in the anterior focus of
                    the first eye-glass, and the second image is at the anterior focus of the last
                    eye-glass. If we change this last for one of half the focal distance, and push
                    in the eye-piece till the image formed by the object-glass is half way between
                    the first eye-glass and its focus, the last image will be formed at the focus of
                    the new eye-glass, and the eye-piece will be achromatic. This is easily seen by
                    making the usual computations by the focal theorem. But the visible field is
                    diminished, because we cannot give the same aperture as before to the new
                    eye-glass; but we can substitute for it two eye-glasses like the former, placed
                    close together. This will have the same focal distance with the new one, and
                    will allow the same aperture that we had before.</p>
                <p>On these principles may be demonstrated the correction of colour in eye-pieces
                    with three glasses of the following construction.</p>
                <p>Let the glasses A and B be placed so that the posterior focus of the first nearly
                    coincides with the anterior focus of the second, or rather so that the anterior
                    focus of B may be at the place where the image of the object-glass is formed, by
                    which situation the aperture necessary for transmitting the whole light will be
                    the smallest possible. Place the third, C, at a distance from the second, which
                    exceeds the sum of their focal distances by a space which is a third
                    proportional to the distance of the first and second, and the focal distance of
                    the second. The distance of the first eye-glass from the object-glass must be
                    equal to the product of the focal distance of the first and second divided by
                    their sum.</p>
                <p>Let Oo, <hi rend="italic">Aa,</hi> B <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, Cc, the focal
                    distances of the glasses, be O, <hi rend="italic">a, b</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi>. Then make AB = <hi rend="italic">a</hi> + <hi rend="italic">b</hi>

                    vision = 3438 × <hi rend="superscript"> aperture of A</hi> / <hi

                <p>These eye-pieces will admit the use of a micrometer at the place of the first
                    image, because it has no distortion.</p>
                <p>Mr Dollond was anxious to combine this achromatism of the eye-pieces with the
                    advantages which he had found in the eye-pieces with five glasses. The eye-piece
                    of three glasses necessarily has a very great refraction at the glass B, where
                    the pencil which has come from the other side of the axis must be rendered again
                    convergent, or at least parallel to it. This occasions considerable aberrations,
                    which may be avoided by giving part of this refraction to a glass put between
                    the first and second, in the same way as was done by the glass B put between A
                    and C in his five-glass eye-piece. But this deranges the whole process. His
                    ingenuity, however, surmounted the difficulty, and he made eye-pieces of four
                    glasses, which seem as perfect as can be desired. He did not publish his
                    ingenious investigation; we imagine therefore that it will be an acceptable
                    thing to the artists to have precise instructions how to proceed.</p>
                <p>It is evident, that if we make the rays of different colours unite on the surface
                    of the last eye-glass but one, commonly called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >field-glass,</hi> the thing will be done, because the dispersion from this
                    point of union will then unite with the dispersion produced by this glass alone;
                    and this increased dispersion may be corrected by the last eye-glass in the way
                    already shown.</p>
                <p>Therefore let A, B (fig. 26) be the stations which we have fixed on for the first
                    and second eye-glasses, in order to give a proper portion of the whole
                    refraction to the second glass. Let <hi rend="italic">b</hi> be the anterior
                    focus of B. Draw PB <hi rend="italic">r</hi> through the centre of B. Make A <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi>: <hi rend="italic">b</hi> B = AB: BK. Draw the
                    perpendicular Kr, meeting the refracted ray in <hi rend="italic">r</hi>. We know
                    by the focal theorem, that red rays diverging from P will converge to <hi
                    rend="italic">r;</hi> but the violet ray PV, being more refracted, will cross R
                    <hi rend="italic">r</hi> in some point <hi rend="italic">g.</hi> Drawing the
                    perpendicular <hi rend="italic">fg,</hi> we get <hi rend="italic">f</hi> for the
                    proper place of the field-glass. Let the refracted ray R <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi>, produced backward, meet the ray OP coming from the centre of the
                    object-glass in O. Let the angle of dispersion RP V be called <hi rend="italic"
                    >p,</hi> and the angle of dispersion at V, that is, <hi rend="italic">r</hi> V
                    <hi rend="italic">v</hi>, be <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> and the angle V <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> R be <hi rend="italic">r.</hi></p>
                <p>It is evident that OR: OP = <hi rend="italic">p</hi>: <hi rend="italic">v,</hi>
                    because the dispersions are proportional to the sines of the refractions, which
                    in this case are very nearly as the refractions themselves.</p>

                    being a constant quantity while the glass B is the same, the place of union

                    On the other hand, bringing B nearer to A increases <hi rend="italic">Bf.</hi>
                    If we keep the distance between the glasses the same, but increase the focal

                    because this change augments the numerator and diminishes the denominator of the

                <p>In this manner we can unite the colours at what distance we please, and
                    consequently can unite them in the place of the intended field-glass, from which
                    they will diverge with an increased dispersion, viz. with the dispersion
                    competent to the refraction produced there, and the dispersion <hi rend="italic"
                    >p(m + n)</hi> conjoined.</p>
                <p>It only remains to determine the proper focal distances of the field-glass and
                    eye-glass, and the place of the eye-glass, so that this dispersion may be
                    finally corrected.</p>
                <p>This is an indeterminate problem, admitting of an infinity of solutions. We shall
                    limit it by an equal division of the two remaining refractions, which are
                    necessary in order to produce the intended magnifying power. This construction
                    has the advantage of diminishing the aberration. Thus we know the two
                    refractions, and the dispersion competent to each; it being nearly <hi

                <p>Let fig. 27 represent this addition to the eye-piece. <hi rend="italic">Cg</hi>
                    is the field-glass coming in the place of <hi rend="italic">fg</hi> of fig. 26,
                    and <hi rend="italic">Rgw</hi> is the red ray coming from the glass BK. Draw <hi

                    eye-glass; that is, making the angle <hi rend="italic">Csg</hi> with the axis
                    correspond to the intended magnifying power. Bisect this angle by the line <hi

                    Dr perpendicular to the axis. Then a lens placed in D, having the focal distance
                    D <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, will destroy the dispersion at the lens <hi
                    rend="italic">gc,</hi> which refracts the ray <hi rend="italic">gw</hi> into <hi

                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">gv</hi> be the violet ray, making the angle <hi
                    rend="italic">vgr</hi> = <hi rend="italic">s</hi>. It is plain, by the common
                    optical theorem, that <hi rend="italic">gr</hi> will be refracted into <hi
                    rend="italic">rr'</hi> parallel to <hi rend="italic">δ</hi> D. Draw <hi

                    rend="italic">vr'.</hi> By the focal theorem, two red rays <hi rend="italic">gr,
                    gv</hi> will be united in <hi rend="italic">r'.</hi> But the violet ray <hi
                    rend="italic">gv</hi> will be more refracted, and will take the path <hi
                    rend="italic">vv',</hi> making the angle of dispersion <hi rend="italic">r'vv —
                    q</hi> very nearly, because the. dispersion at <hi rend="italic">v</hi> does not
                    sensibly differ from that at <hi rend="italic">r</hi>. Now, in the small angles
                    of refraction which obtain in optical instruments, the angles rr't', <hi

                    >g</hi> is corrected by the lens Dr. The focal distance <hi rend="italic"

                <p>It is easy to see that this (not inelegant) construction is not limited to the
                    equality of the refractions <hi rend="italic">wgr, Krr'.</hi> In whatever
                    proportion the whole refraction <hi rend="italic">wgs</hi> is divided, we always
                    can tell the proportion of the dispersions which the two refractions occasion at
                    <hi rend="italic">g</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and can therefore find
                    the values of <hi rend="italic">s</hi> and <hi rend="italic">q.</hi> Indeed this
                    solution includes the problem in p. 167, col. 2, par. 2; but it had not occurred
                    to us till the present occasion. Our readers will not be displeased with this
                    variety of resource.</p>
                <p>The intelligent reader will sec that in this solution some quantities and ratios
                    are assumed as equal which arc not strictly so, in the same manner as in all the
                    elementary optical theorems. The parallelism, however, of <hi rend="italic"
                    >vv'</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rr'</hi> may be made accurate by pushing the
                    lens Dr nearer to C <hi rend="italic">g</hi>, or retiring it from it. We may
                    also, by pushing it still nearer, induce a small divergency of the violet ray,
                    so as to produce accurate vision in the eye, and may thus make the vision
                    through a telescope more perfect than with the naked eye, where dispersion is by
                    no means avoided. It would therefore be an improvement to have the eye-glass in
                    a sliding tube for adjustment. Bring the telescope to distinct vision; and if
                    any colour be visible about the edges of the field, shift the eye-glass till
                    this colour is removed. The vision may now become indistinct; but this is
                    corrected by shifting the place of the whole eye-piece.</p>
                <p>We have examined trigonometrically the progress of a red and a violet ray through
                    many eye-pieces of Dollond's and Ramsden’s best telescopes, and we have found in
                    all of them that the colours are united on or very near the field-glass; so that
                    we presume that a theory somewhat analogous to ours has directed the ingenious
                    inventors. We meet with many made by other artists, and even some of theirs,
                    where a considerable degree of colour remains, sometimes in the natural order,
                    and often in the contrary order. This must happen in the hands of mere
                    imitators, ignorant of principle. We presume that we have now made this
                    principle sufficiently plain.</p>
                <p>Fig. 28 represents the eye-piece of a very fine spy-glass by Mr Ramsden; the
                    focal length of its object-glass is 8½ inches, with 1 <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> th of aperture, 2° 05' of visible field,
                    and 15·4 magnifying power. The distances and focal lengths are of their proper
                    dimensions, but the apertures are ½ larger, that the progress of a lateral
                    pencil might be more distinctly drawn. The dimensions are as follow:</p>
                <p>Foc.lengths A <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = 0∙775, B <hi rend="italic">b</hi> =
                    1∙025, C <hi rend="italic">c</hi> = 1∙01, D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> = 0∙79.
                    Distances AB= 1∙18, BC =1∙83, CD= 1∙105.</p>
                <p>It is perfectly achromatic, and the colours are united, not precisely at the lens
                    <hi rend="italic">Cg,</hi> but about <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 20</hi> th of an inch nearer the eye-glass.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that this combination of glasses may be used as a microscope; for
                    if, instead of the image formed by the object-glass at FG, we substitute a small
                    object, illuminated from behind, as in compound microscopes, and if we draw the
                    eye-piece a very small way from this object, the pencils of parallel rays
                    emergent from the eye-glass D will become convergent to very distant points, and
                    will there form an inverted and enlarged picture of the object, which may be
                    viewed by a Huyghenian eye-piece; and we may thus get high magnifying powers
                    without using very deep glasses. We tried the eye-piece of which we have given
                    the dimensions in this way, and found that it might be made to magnify 180 times
                    with very great distinctness. When used as the magnifier of a solar microscope,
                    it infinitely surpasses every thing we have ever seen. The picture formed by a
                    solar microscope is generally so indistinct, that it is fit only for amusing
                    ladies; but with this magnifier it seemed perfectly sharp. We therefore
                    recommend this to the artists as a valuable article of their trade.</p>
                <p>The only thing which remains to be considered in the theory of refracting
                    telescopes, is the forms of the different lenses. Hitherto we have had no
                    occasion to consider any thing but their focal distances; but their aberrations
                    depend greatly on the adjustment of their forms to their situations. When the
                    conjugate focuses of a lens are determined by the services which it is to
                    perform, there is a certain form or proportion between the curvatures of their
                    anterior and posterior surfaces, which will make their aberrations the smallest
                    possible.</p>
                <p>It is evident that this proportion is to be obtained by making the fluxion of the
                    quantity within the parenthesis in the formula at the top of col. 2, p. 151,
                    equal to nothing. When this is done, we obtain this formula for <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> the radius of curvature for the anterior surface of a
                    lens: - = ⅜-- <hi rend="strikethrough">^t</hi><hi rend="superscript
                    strikethrough"> nt</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi> 2m -f- 4</p>
                <p>4- ~τ—- <hi rend="strikethrough">j^</hi> ~i∖- -, where <hi rend="italic">m</hi>
                    is the ratio of the sine of inci- 2 <hi rend="italic">(m</hi>-p 4) <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> dence to the sine of refraction, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> is the distance of the focus of incident rays, positive or negative,
                    according as they converge or diverge, all measured on a scale of which the unit
                    is <hi rend="italic">n, =</hi> half of the radius of the equivalent isosceles
                    lens.</p>
                <p>It will be sufficiently exact for our purpose to suppose <hi rend="italic">m</hi>
                    + <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, though it is
                    more nearly <hi rend="superscript"> 31</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 20</hi>. In
                    this case, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> = <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 6</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> + <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 10</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 7r</hi> = <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 6r + 10</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 7r</hi>. Therefore <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> = <hi rend="superscript"> 7r</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    6r+10</hi>, and <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> b</hi> =
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi>- 1 = <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1-a</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi>.</p>
                <p>As an example, let it be required to give the radii of curvature in inches for
                    the eye-glass <hi rend="italic">be</hi> of page 164, col. I, par. 2, which we
                    shall suppose of 1½ inch focal distance, and that <hi rend="italic">ec</hi> (=
                    <hi rend="italic">r</hi>) is 3¾th inches.</p>
                <p>The radius of curvature for the equivalent isosceles lens</p>
                <p>Si is 1∙5, and its half is 0∙75. Therefore <hi rend="italic">r</hi> = -A* = 5;
                    and v’ ∕ *)</p>
                <p>our formula is <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = <hi rend="superscript"> 7×5</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 6×5+10</hi> = <hi rend="superscript"> 35</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 40</hi> = 0·875; and <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> b</hi> = <hi rend="superscript"> 1-a</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> a</hi> = <hi rend="superscript"> 0·125</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0·875</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> = <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0·875</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 0·125</hi> = 7.</p>
                <p>These values are parts of a scale of which the unit is 0·75 inch. Therefore <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> in inches, = 0∙875 × 0·75 = 0∙65525, <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> in inches, = 7 × 0∙75 = 5∙25.</p>
                <p>And here we must observe that the posterior surface is concave; for <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> is a positive quantity, because 1 — <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> is a positive quantity as well as <hi rend="italic">a;</hi> therefore
                    the centre of sphericity of both surfaces lies beyond the lens.</p>
                <p>And this determination is not very different from the usual practice, which
                    commonly makes this lens a plane convex with its flat side next the eye: and
                    there will not be much difference in the performance of these two lenses; for in
                    all cases of maxima and minima, even a pretty considerable change of the best
                    dimensions does not make a sensible change in the result.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=188"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0188-0170"/>
                <p>The same consideration leads to a rule which is very simple, and sufficiently
                    exact for ordinary situations. This is to make the curvatures such, that the
                    incident and emergent pencils may be nearly equally inclined to the surfaces of
                    the lens. Thus in the eye-piece with five glasses, A and B should be most convex
                    on their anterior sides; C should be most convex on the posterior side; D should
                    be nearly isosceles; and E nearly plano-convex.</p>
                <p>But this is not so easy a matter as appears at first sight. The lenses of an
                    eye-piece have not only to bend the several pencils of light to and from the
                    axis of the telescope; they have also to form images on the axes of these
                    pencils. These offices frequently require opposite forms, as mentioned in par.
                    3, col. 2, p. 162. Thus the glass A, fig. 28, should be most convex on the side
                    next the object, that it may produce little distortion of the pencils. But it
                    should be most convex next the eye, that it may produce distinct vision of the
                    image FG, which is very near it. This image should have its concavity turned
                    towards A, whereas it is towards the object-glass. We must therefore endeavour
                    to make the vertical image <hi rend="italic">fg</hi> flatter, or even convex.
                    This requires a glass very flat before and convex behind. For similar reasons
                    the object-glass of a microscope and the simple eye-glass of an astronomical
                    telescope should be formed in the same way.</p>
                <p>This is a subject of most difficult discussion, and requires a theory for which
                    our limits do not afford room. The artists are obliged to grope their way. The
                    proper method of experiment would be, to make eye-pieces of large dimensions,
                    with extravagant apertures to increase the aberrations, and to provide for each
                    station A, B, C, and D, a number of lenses of the same focal distance, but of
                    different forms; and we would advise making the trial in the way of a solar
                    microscope, and to have two eye-pieces on trial at once. Their pictures can be
                    formed on the same screen, and accurately compared; whereas it is difficult to
                    keep in remembrance the performance of one eye-piece, and compare it with
                    another.</p>
                <p>We cannot add any thing to what Dr Smith has delivered on the theory of
                    reflecting telescopes. There appears to be the same possibility of correcting
                    the aberration of the great speculum by the contrary aberration of a convex
                    small speculum, that we have practised in the compound object-glass of an
                    achromatic refracting telescope. But this cannot be, unless we make the radius
                    of the convex speculum exceedingly large, which destroys the magnifying power
                    and the brightness. This therefore must be given up. Indeed their performance,
                    when well executed, does already surpass all imagination. Dr Herschel found
                    great advantages in what he called the <hi rend="italic">front view,</hi> not
                    using a plane mirror to throw the pencils to one side. But this cannot be
                    practised in any but telescopes so large that the loss of light occasioned by
                    the interposition of the observer’s head may be disregarded. <hi
