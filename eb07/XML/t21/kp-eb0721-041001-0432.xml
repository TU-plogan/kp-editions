                <p><label type="entry">TURGOT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Αννε Robert
                    Jacques</hi></label>, Baron de l’Aulne, a celebrated philosopher and statesman,
                    was born at Paris on the 10th of May 1727, of a very ancient Norman family. His
                    father was a long time provost of the corporation of merchants, during which he
                    was the object of general admiration on account of his prudent administration.
                    Turgot was the youngest of three brothers, and was destined for the church. He
                    had scarcely attained the age at which reflection commences, when he resolved to
                    sacrifice all temporal advantages to liberty and conscience, and to pursue his
                    ecclesiastical studies without declaring his repugnance to their proposed
                    object. At the age of twenty-three years he took his degree, and in December
                    1749 was elected prior of the Sorbonne. The time when it was necessary for him
                    to declare that he would not be an ecclesiastic was now arrived. He announced
                    this resolution to his father by letter, showing the motives which induced him
                    to decline the clerical profession. His father consented, and he was appointed
                    master of requests. He prepared himself for this office by particular
                    application to those branches of knowledge which are most connected with its
                    functions and duties, viz. natural philosophy, agriculture, manufactures,
                    commerce, &amp;c. About this period he wrote some articles for the <hi
                    rend="italic">Encyclopédie,</hi> which attained great celebrity. Of these the
                    principal are, Etymology, Existence, Expansibility, Fair, and Foundation. He had
                    prepared several others but the persecution against the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopédie</hi> induced him to decline further contributions.</p>
                <p>In 1761 Turgot was appointed intendant of Limoges, where he gave activity to the
                    society of agriculture; opened a mode of public instruction for female
                    professors of midwifery; procured for the people the attendance of able
                    physicians during the raging of epidemic diseases; established houses of
                    industry, supported by charity (the only species of alms-giving which does not
                    encourage idleness); introduced the cultivation of potatoes into his province,
                    &amp;c. &amp;c. While he proceeded with unremitting activity and zeal in
                    promoting the good of the people over whom he was placed, he meditated projects
                    of a more extensive nature, such as an equal distribution of the taxes, the
                    construction of the roads, the regulation of the militia, the prevention of a
                    scarcity of provision, and the protection of commerce.</p>
                <p>On the death of Louis XV. the public voice called Turgot to the first offices of
                    government, as a man who united the experience resulting from habits of business
                    to ail the improvements which study can procure. After being only a short time
                    at the head of the marine department, he was, August 24. 1774, appointed
                    comptroller-general of the finances. During his discharge of this important
                    office, the operations which he carried on are astonishing. He suppressed
                    twenty-three kinds of duties on necessary occupations, useful contracts, or
                    merited compensations. He abolished the corvee, or the labour required from the
                    public for the highways, saving the nation thirty millions of livres annually.
                    He set aside another kind of corvée, which respected the carriage of military
                    stores and baggage. He abated the rigour in the administration of indirect
                    impositions, to the great profit of the contributors, the king, and the
                    financiers; besides effecting many other essential improvements in political
                    economy. At length, however, by the artifices of the courtiers, he was deprived
                    of his offices; and in retirement he devoted himself to the studies which he had
                    cultivated in his youth. He died on the 20th of March 1781. An edition of his
                    works, in 9 vols. 8vo, was commenced in 1808 and completed in 1811. He composed,
                    it is said, the celebrated Latin inscription intended for a picture of Dr
                    Franklin.</p>
