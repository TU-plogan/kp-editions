                    person is interred, and the monument erected to preserve his memory. The word is
                    formed from the Greek <hi rend="italic">τύμϐος</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                    >tumulus,</hi> sepulchre; or, according to Menage, from the Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">tumba,</hi> which has the same signification.</p>
                <p>In many nations it has been customary to burn the bodies of the dead, and to
                    collect the ashes with pious care into an urn, which was deposited in a tomb or
                    sepulchre. Among many other nations it has been the practice to lay the dead
                    body in a tomb, without consuming it, after having wrapped it up decently, and
                    sometimes placing it in a cofiin. The tombs of the Jews were generally hollow
                    places hewn out of a rock. Abraham buried Sarah in a cave. Such was also the
                    place in which the kings of Judah and Israel were interred; and such was the
                    place in which the body of our Saviour was deposited by Joseph of Arimathea. But
                    it is probable that the common people buried their dead in graves; for our
                    Saviour compares the Pharisees to “graves which appear not, and the men that
                    walk over them are not aware of them.” Over the tombs, perhaps only of people of
                    distinction, a stone or monument was erected, to intimate to passengers that
                    they were burying-places, that they might not pollute themselves by touching
                    them. With the same intention, as Dr Lightfoot informs us, they whitened them
                    every year on the 15th of February. The Egyptians buried their dead in caves,
                    called <hi rend="italic">catacombs.</hi> The pyramids, as some think, were also
                    employed for the same purpose. Sometimes, after embalming their dead, they
                    placed them in niches in some magnificent apartment in their houses.</p>
                <p>The Greeks and Romans burned their dead, and deposited their ashes in a tomb. The
                    Greeks interred the ashes without the cities, by the sides of their highways.
                    Sometimes, indeed, by way of particular honour, they were buried in an elevated
                    part of the town; and the Lacedaemonians were allowed by Lycurgus to bury in the
                    city and round their temples. But this was forbidden among the Romans by the law
                    of the twelve tables: <hi rend="italic">In urbe ne sepelito, neve urito.</hi>
                    Valerius Publicola, Posthumus Tuber-tius, and the family of the Claudii, were
                    however buried in the Capitol. To bury by the sides of public roads was also
                    common, among the Romans; and hence their epitaphs frequently began with <hi
                    rend="italic">Siste viator.</hi> Highways were probably selected for two
                    reasons; that the dead might not be offensive or injure the health of the
                    living; and that they might supply a lesson of mortality.</p>
                <p>As it would swell this article to too great a size to describe all the different
                    kinds of tombs which have been used by different nations and ages, we must
                    content ourselves with shortly describing the tombs of a few nations, and adding
                    a few concomitant circumstances.</p>
                <p>The tombs of the Parsees are singular. After lying a proper time in his own house
                    for the purposes of mourning, the deceased, followed by his relations and
                    friends, the females chanting a requiem, is deposited in a tomb of the following
                    construction. It is a circular building, open at top, about fifty-five feet in
                    diameter and twenty-five feet in height, filled, to within five feet of the top,
                    excepting a well of fifteen feet diameter in the centre. The part so filled is
                    terraced, with a slight declivity toward the well. Two circular grooves, three
                    inches deep, are raised round the well; the first at the distance of four, the
                    second at ten. feet from the well. Grooves of the like depth or height, and four
                    feet distance from each other, at the outer part of the outer circle, are
                    carried straight from the wall to the well, communicating with the circular
                    ones, for the purpose of carrying off the water, &amp;c. The tomb, by this
                    means, is divided into three circles of partitions; the outer, about seven feet
                    by four; the middle, six by three; the inner, four by two; the outer for the
                    men, the middle for the women, the inner for the children; in which the bodies
                    are respectively placed, wrapped loosely in a piece of cloth, and left to be
                    devoured by the vultures; which is very soon done, as numbers of those animals
                    are always seen hovering and watching about these charnel-houses, in expectation
                    of their prey. The friends of the deceased, or the persons who have charge of
                    the tomb, come at the proper time, and throw the bones into their receptacle,
                    the well in the centre; for which purpose iron rakes and tongs are deposited in
                    the tomb. The entrance is closed by an iron door, four feet square, on the
                    eastern side, as high up as the terrace, to which a road is raised. Upon the
                    wall, above the door, an additional wall is raised, to prevent people from
                    looking into the tomb, which the Parsees are particularly careful to prevent. A
                    Persian inscription is engraved on a stone over the door. From the bottom of the
                    wall, subterraneous passages lead to receive the bones, and prevent the well
                    from filling.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Moor’s

                <p>Of the ancient sepulchres found in Russia and Siberia, some are perfect tumuli,
                    raised to an enormous height, while others are almost level with the ground.
                    Some of them are encompassed with a square wall of large quarry-stones placed in
                    an erect position; others are covered only with a small heap of stones, or they
                    are tumuli adorned with stones at top. Some are walled with brick within, and
                    vaulted over; others are no more than pits or common graves. In some the earth
                    is excavated several fathoms deep; others, and especially those which are topped
                    by a lofty tumulus, are only dug of a sufficient depth for covering the carcass.
                    In many of these sepulchres, the bones of men, and frequently of horses, are
                    found, and in a condition that renders it probable the bodies were not burnt
                    before they were inhumed. Other bones show clearly that they have been
                    previously burnt; because a part of them is unconsumed, and because they lie in
                    a disordered manner, and some of them are wanting. Urns, in which other nations
                    of antiquity have deposited the ashes of their dead, are never met with here;
                    but sometimes what remained of the bodies after combustion, and even whole
                    carcasses, are found wrapped up in thin plates of gold. Many dead bodies are
                    frequently seen deposited together in one tomb; a certain indication that either
                    a battle had been fought in the neighbourhood of the place, or that some
                    families buried their relations in an hereditary tomb.</p>
                <p>The Moors, like all other Mahommedans, hold it contrary to the spirit of religion
                    to bury their dead in mosques, and to profane the temple of the Most High by the
                    putrefaction of dead bodies. In the infancy of the church, the Christians had
                    the like respect for their temples. The burial grounds of the Mahommedans are
                    without the city; the emperors have their sepulchres distinct and distant from
                    the mosque, in sanctuaries built by themselves; and their tombs are exceedingly
                    simple. All Mahommedans inter the dead at the hour set apart for prayer. The
                    defunct is not kept in the house, except he expires after sunset; but the body
                    is transported to the mosque, whither it is carried by those who are going to
                    prayer. Each, from a spirit of devotion, is desirous to carry in his turn. The
                    Moors sing at their burial service; which usage they have perhaps imitated after
                    the Christians of Spain. They have no particular colour appropriated to
                    mourning. Women regularly go on the <pb break="no"
