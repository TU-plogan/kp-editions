                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    celebrated Roman historian, and one of the greatest men of his time, appears to
                    have been born about the fifty-seventh year of the Christian era. He early
                    applied himself to the labours of the bar, in which he gained very considerable
                    reputation. He was a man of equestrian rank, and was promoted to various
                    offices. Having married the daughter of Agricoa, the road to public honours was
                    opened to him in the reign of Vespasian; but during the sanguinary and
                    capricious tyranny of Domitian, he, as well as his friend Pliny, appears to have
                    retired from the theatre of public affairs. The reign of Nerva restored these
                    luminaries of Roman literature to the metropolis; and, in the year 97, we find
                    Tacitus engaged to pronounce the funeral oration of the venerable Virginius
                    Rufus, the colleague of the emperor in the consulship, and afterwards succeeding
                    him as consul for the remainder of the year. In the year of the city 853, Pliny
                    and Tacitus were appointed by the senate to plead the cause of the oppressed
                    Africans against Marius Priscus, a corrupt proconsul, who was convicted before
                    the fathers; and the patriot orators were honoured with a declaration that they
                    had executed their trust to the entire satisfaction of the house. The time of
                    the historian’s death is not mentioned by any ancient author, but it is probable
                    that he died in the reign of Trajan.</p>
                <p>His works which still remain are, 1. The Life of Agricoa, his father-in-law; 2.
                    On the Manners of the Germans; 3. Five books of his History; 4. His Annals.
                    There is also attributed to him a dialogue “De Causis corrupt® Eloquentiae,”
                    which others have ascribed to Quintilian. The treatise on the manners of the
                    Germans was published in 851. The exact time when Tacitus published his history
                    is uncertain, but it was in some period of Trajan’s reign, who died suddenly,
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a. u. c.</hi> 870, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> D. 117. The
                    history comprises a period of twenty-seven years, from the accession of Galba,
                    822, to the death of Domitian, 849. The history being finished, he did not think
                    he had completed the tablature of slavery: he reverted to the time of Tiberius;
                    and the second work, which, however, comes first in the order of chronology,
                    includes a period of fifty-four years, from the accession of Tiberius, 767, to
                    the death of Nero, 821: this work is his Annals.</p>
                <p>No author has obtained a more splendid reputation than Tacitus. It is impossible
                    not to admire and recommend his intimate knowledge of the human heart, the
                    spirit of liberty which he breathes, and the force and vivacity with which he
                    perpetually expresses himself. He has been censured as obscure; and indeed
                    nothing can be more certain than that he did not write for the common mass of
                    men. But to those who are judges of his compositions, it is no matter of regret
                    that his manner is his own, and peculiar. Never were description and sentiment
                    so wonderfully and so beautifully blended; and never were the actions and
                    characters of men delineated with so much strength and precision.</p>
                <p>Of the works of Tacitus, the first edition was printed by V. Spira at Venice in
                    1468 or 1469. It is in folio, and without a date. After some intervening
                    impressions, a more complete edition was superintended by Beroaldus, Romae,
                    1515, fol. Here the earlier books of the Annals were printed for the first time.
                    The subsequent editions are so numerous, that we can only specify a very small
                    proportion. Tacitus was greatly indebted to the learned labours of Lipsius, who
                    published several editions. His first was printed at Antwerp, 1574, 8vo. His
                    annotations were gradually augmented, and underwent different revisals and <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=87"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0087-0069"/> modifications. The last edition which he himself
                    superintended was that of Ant. 1600, fol. Passing over the editions “cum notis
                    variorum,” 1672 and 1685, we arrive at that of Ryckius, Lugd. Bat. 1687, 2 tom.
                    12mo. The second volume contains the editor’s annotations. J. Gronovius had
                    undertaken to prepare an edition with the notes of various critics; and after
                    his death it was completed by his son Abraham, Traj. ad Rhen. 1721, 2 tom. 4to.
                    Two editions by Ernesti were printed at Leipzig in 1752 and 1772, each in two
                    vols. 8vo. An elegant edition was published by Brotier, Paris. 1771, 4 tom. 4to,
                    1776, 7 tom. 12mo. We now descend to the edition of Oberlin, Lipsiae, 1801, 2
                    tom. 8vo; and to that of Ruperti, Gotting. 1804, 2 tom. 8vo.</p>
                <p>The works of Tacitus have been translated into various languages. The earliest
                    English version was executed by Sir Henry Savile and Richard Greenway. Dryden
                    lent his ready aid to “The Annals and History of Cornelius Tacitus, by several
                    hands.” Lond. 1698, 3 vols. 8vo. Some of these hands are suspected to have been
                    chiefly indebted to a French translation. Their version was followed by that of
                    Thomas Gordon, Lond. 1728-31, 2 vols. fol. Gordon’s phraseology is remarkable
                    for its affectation; and by labouring to imitate the style of the original
                    author, he has in some instances rendered his own scarcely intelligible-A more
                    readable translation of Tacitus was produced by Arthur Murphy, Lond. 1793, 4
                    vols. 4to. The dialogue on eloquence has been well translated by Mr Melmoth; the
                    life of Agricoa, and the description of Germany, by Dr Aikin.</p>
