                <p><label type="entry">TEFLIS, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Tiflis</hi></label>, a city
                    of Asia, and capital of the kingdom of Georgia, situated on the precipitous
                    banks of the Kur, at the foot of a line of dark and barren hills, which
                    overshadow the town, and impart to it a gloomy appearance. This city was visited
                    by Sir R. K. Porter in 1817, and from his work the following account is chiefly
                    compiled. Teflis has no claim to a very high antiquity, having been founded in
                    1063 by the czar Liewang, who was attracted to the spot by certain warm springs
                    in the neighbourhood, from which he expected to derive benefit. Before that
                    period it could boast of no habitation in the form of a house, with the
                    exception of a few mud hovels for the convenience of the occupiers of a small
                    fortress which stood on an adjacent height, and protected the valley, and of
                    which the remains are still to be seen on a hill to the south of the town, at
                    some distance from the station of the more modern citadel, which is of Turkish
                    origin. The road along the western bank of the Kur was completely commanded by
                    this old work of the native czars; and its dark and frowning towers still seem
                    to threaten the passenger below. The first aspect of the town appeared to Sir R.
                    K. Porter peculiarly gloomy; and though these impressions were in some degree
                    lessened by greater familiarity, the effect of the surrounding scenery always
                    remained the same; and the town seemed to be enclosed in a vast prison of high
                    and beetling rocks, broken into deep clefts, black and bare, and projecting into
                    a thousand rugged and savage forms. So confined an abode is far from being
                    desirable; and hence the governor-general has chosen his place of residence at a
                    short distance from the body of the city, on the gentle slope of a hill fronting
                    the river, with a fine view of the Caucasus Mountains. This building, with the
                    arsenal, the hospital, churches, and a few villas in the neighbourhood, is all
                    that bears any resemblance to the architecture of Europe. The rest is purely
                    Asiatic, in the most unfavourable sense of the term, being a collection of low,
                    flat-roofed dwellings, built of dun brick, mingled with stones and mud; the
                    doors and windows exceedingly small; the latter covered with paper instead of
                    glass. The streets are all narrow, and covered with deep mud or dust, according
                    <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=153"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0153-0135"/>as the weather is wet or dry. The Russian governor
                    has ' begun to remedy this defect by ordering them to be paved.</p>
                <p>He has also introduced other improvements, by directing old and ruinous houses to
                    be pulled down, and others more handsome and spacious to be erected in their
                    stead. Among other improvements, the bazaar, or great market-place for
                    merchants, has undergone important alterations. It has been totally roofed in,
                    but with open circles left in the rafters for the admission of air and light. It
                    is united with the square of the city guard by long colonnades, which place is
                    also lined with shops, covered from the weather with a fine range of pillared
                    arcades. The natives themselves begin to be sensible of these improvements, when
                    they experience the comfort of shelter for themselves and their merchandise,
                    from the injurious effects of rain or scorching heat. The bazaar is a narrow
                    street, long and winding. It is lined on each side with shops of every
                    description, such as those of fruiterers, grocers, barbers, cooks, mercers,
                    saddlers, armourers, and various other traders, who all display their articles
                    to the best advantage. Notwithstanding the value of the merchandise here
                    exposed, the place is a free thoroughfare, not merely to pedestrians, but to
                    horsemen, and asses with burdens, and even to droves of buffaloes. Hence it is
                    often both disagreeable and dangerous to foot passengers, though it is still a
                    bustling scene, full of people from morning till night. Not far from the bazaar
                    is the public caravanserai, which is a circular building, three stories in
                    height, with a sort of gallery running in front of each range of doors, from
                    which stone-steps descend to conduct passengers above or below. Here the
                    merchants take up their quarters; and here may be seen exposed on the stone or
                    earthen floors of dark and vaulted apartments, whatever goods the merchants who
                    inhabit them possess. The owner of each heap sits cross-legged, in grave
                    attendance, waiting the appearance of customers, or bargaining with those who
                    arrive. The centre of the court is filled with the horses and mules of the
                    merchants in the caravanserai.</p>
                <p>Teflis has been long famed for its hot baths, which possess valuable medicinal
                    properties, and are frequented by both sexes for health as well as for luxury
                    and amusement. These baths are situated at the extremity of the bazaar, where is
                    a small bridge over a deep ravine, in which flows a mountain stream, pure and
                    cold at its fountain head, but, mingling with the hot springs, which take their
                    rise in the adjacent heights, it becomes warm. It is over this steaming flood
                    that the baths are erected. On one side of the bridge stand those appropriated
                    to the men, and on the other, immediately under the gloomy walks of the citadel,
                    those allotted to the women. The water which supplies these baths is strongly
                    impregnated with sulphur, having the usual offensive smell of such springs. Its
                    heat may be reckoned at from 15 to 36 degrees of Reaumur in the several basins;
                    and at the source the heat is 42 degrees. The basins are excavated in the solid
                    rock, over whose surface the water had originally flowed; and these are divided,
                    under one immense vaulted roof, into different apartments, from which the
                    day-light is entirely excluded, and where total darkness is only dispelled by
                    the faint glimmering of a few lamps twinkling amid the vapours from the steam.
                    These baths are open to all ranks indiscriminately, and are in a state of the
                    greatest disorder and filth. There is not a place where a bather could lay down
                    his clothes without having them drenched in wet, and dirtied. In journeying
                    farther into the interior of these boiling caverns, Sir R. K. Porter found an
                    accumulation of every thing that can disgust the senses. All sorts of people
                    were huddled together, scrubbing, scraping, rubbing, shaving, &amp;c.; these
                    offices being done in each case by the companions of the bather, or by the
                    persons of the bath in attendance. He also visited the baths appropriated to the
                    females, into which he was admitted without the least scruple.</p>
                <p>The citadel is situated on the summit of a very high promontory, which forms the
                    termination of the mountain that overshadows the town on its south-western side.
                    This fortress was erected in 1576, when the Turks took possession of Georgia, to
                    overawe the conquered province. About two centuries afterwards it was dismantled
                    by the Persians when they overran the country, and was left gradually to decay.
                    It exhibits a mass of ruins, which however are still grand and imposing; and the
                    situation in which they are placed increases the wildness and majesty of these
                    eastern towers. Within the old battlements may still be seen the remains of the
                    mosque mentioned by Chardin, and which is now used as a prison for malefactors,
                    under an officer and guard. Besides this fortress, the Turks, for greater
                    security, enclosed the town on every side with a range of towers and walls; but
                    these ancient bulwarks, like the citadel itself, are now, with the exception of
                    the wall facing the river, nearly levelled with the ground. There are several
                    fine churches in Teflis, of different Christian persuasions. That which is
                    dedicated to the Catholic mode of worship is the most beautiful. The great
                    Armenian church, the cathedral of Holy Zion, is more extensive, but is not equal
                    to the other either in richness or grace of architecture; yet its more
                    advantageous situation adding the majesty of nature to the holy sanctity of the
                    place, seems fully to bear out the propriety of its appellation. The noble
                    waters of the Kur roll past its base, increasing in rapidity and sound as they
                    pour onward through the bold cliffs, which, narrowing, contract the rapid
                    stream. Here a bridge of a single arch connects the town with a considerable
                    suburb called Avlabar. It is chiefly inhabited by a colony of Armenians who fled
                    from the neighbourhood of Erivan during the late wars between Russia and Persia.
                    Here are also the ruins of an ancient fort, church, and houses; and about two
                    miles farther from this side of the city stand the remains of another sacred and
                    ancient edifice, on the summit of a hill so high that it commands the most
                    extensive view in the vicinity of Teflis; embracing on one side the city, with
                    its citadel, churches, and gardens; on the other, to the north, the windings of
                    the Kur through the varied shores of the valley and the plain; with the whole
                    chain of mountains from the province of Kahetia to Kasi-beck, and their
                    tremendous summits, pile above pile as far as the eye can reach to the
                    north-west, the snowy summit of Elborus towering in the distance to the height,
                    according to the calculation of a Russian officer, of 16,700 feet above the
                    level of the sea.</p>
                <p>From their intercourse with the Russians, the higher classes of the inhabitants
                    have gradually lost much of their Asiatic manners; and such changes not being
                    well understood by those who adopt them, are not in many cases favourable to the
                    improvement of the people. In this case the Asiatics, set free from the
                    restraints imposed by their own manners, have not adopted those of Europe; and
                    have thus become more licentious than before. The women, having broken through
                    the restraint that concealed their faces from all but their husbands, have also
                    thrown off other restraints. They were at first extremely offended and disgusted
                    when the Russian troops were quartered in their houses, and when they were first
                    obliged to appear before them; but custom at last rendering them familiar to
                    this intercourse, a great change has, within the last twenty years, been
                    effected in the conduct of the female Georgians. Among the lower classes this
                    effect of foreign intercourse has been even more decided. When they go abroad,
                    they still retain the chadre, or veil, in which they are enveloped from head to
                    foot; but when they are seen standing at their doors without this safeguard,
                    they, from old custom, retreat hastily into the house from the gaze of
                    strangers. They have been long celebrated for their beauty, having fine large
                    dark eyes, regular features, and a pleasing and mild expression of countenance.
                    Before its capture in 1757 by Aga Mahommed<pb break="no"

                    Khan, it contained 4000 houses, and 22,000 inhabitants. The population does not
                    now exceed 15,000, though it is on the increase since the country came into the
                    possession of the Russians, whose vigorous government gives protection to life
                    and property. It is well situated for an entrepôt of trade; and Fraser mentions
                    that it is fast rising from the ruinous condition in which the Russians received
                    it, to be a thriving commercial place. The government gives every encouragement
                    to industry: the port is declared free to all goods upon payment of an <hi
                    rend="italic">ad valorem</hi> duty of five per cent. at the Russian
                    custom-house; and no internal duties are levied at toll-houses within their
                    dominions. The distance from Redoubt Kaleh, on the Black Sea, to Teflis, is 230
                    miles. The Russian authorities are at present improving the road, and there are
                    regular caravans from Teflis to Tabriz, which travel the journey in eighteen or
                    twenty days, through a safe country. A trade has already commenced in such
                    commodities as woollen cloths, cottons, plain and printed goods, hardware
                    articles, silk and cotton manufactures of Lyon, embroideries, cloths, &amp;c.;
                    several cargoes of European goods having already reached Teflis from the Black
                    Sea, and been sold with a large profit. This trade, it is probable, will
                    gradually increase under the patronage of the Russian government, and hence
                    Teflis bids fair to become, like Odessa, a commercial mart for an extensive
                    district. From Petersburg it is distant 1752 English miles. Long. 62. 40½. E.
