                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    of Canterbury, was the son of Robert Tillotson of Sowerby, in the parish of
                    Halifax in Yorkshire, clothier; and was born there in the year 1030. He studied
                    at Clare Hall, Cambridge, and in 1651 became a fellow. In 1656 he left the
                    university, in order to become tutor to the son of Edmund Prideaux, Esq. of Ford
                    Abbey in Devonshire. He was afterwards curate to Dr Hacket, vicar of Cheslmnt,
                    in Hertfordshire. In 1663 he was presented by Sir Thomas Barnardiston to the
                    rectory of Ketton or Ked-dington, in the county of Suffolk; but was the next
                    year chosen preacher to Lincoln’s Inn, when he procured Ketton to be bestowed on
                    his curate. He was greatly admired in London for his sermons; and in the same
                    year was chosen Tuesday-lecturer at St Lawrence’s church, where his lectures
                    were frequented by all the divines of the city, and by many persons of quality
                    and distinction. In 1666, he took the degree of D. D. at Cambridge; in 1669, was
                    made prebendary of Canterbury; in 1672, was admitted dean of that cathedral; and
                    three years afterwards, was made a prebendary of St Paul’s cathedral. In 1679,
                    he became acquainted with Charles earl of Shrewsbury, whom he converted from
                    popery; and the next year he refused to sign the clergy of London’s address of
                    thanks to King Charles II. for not agreeing to the bill for excluding the duke
                    of York. In 1683, he visited the unfortunate Lord Russell when under
                    condemnation, and attended him in his last moments on the scaffold. In 1689, he
                    was installed dean of St Paul’s; made clerk of the closet to King William and
                    Queen Mary; and appointed one of the commissioners to prepare matters to be laid
                    before the convocation, in order to a comprehension of all Protestants, as well
                    dissenters as churchmen; but this attempt was frustrated by the bigotry of those
                    members of that body who refused to admit of any alteration in things
                    confessedly indifferent. In 1691, Dr Tillotson, notwithstanding the warmest
                    remonstrances and entreaties on his part, was consecrated archbishop of
                    Canterbury, and four days after was sworn one of the privy council; their
                    majesties always reposing an entire confidence in his prudence, moderation, and
                    integrity. In 1694, he was seized with a palsy, of which he died in the 65th
                    year of his age. He was interred in the church of St Lawrence Jewry, where a
                    handsome monument is erected to his memory. This learned and pious divine, while
                    living, was greatly inveighed against by the enemies of the revolution. After
                    his death there was found a bundle of bitter libels which had been published
                    against him, on which he had written with his own hand, “I forgive the authors
                    of these books, and pray God that he may also forgive them.” It is remarkable,
                    that while this truly great man was in a private station, he always laid aside
                    two tenths of his income for charitable uses. One volume in folio of Dr
                    Tillotson’s sermons was published in his lifetime, and corrected by his own
                    hand. They were translated into French by Barbeyrac. Those which were published
                    after his death by his chaplain Dr Barker, form two volumes in folio, the copy
                    of which was sold for L.2500. This was the only legacy he left to his family,
                    his extensive charity having consumed his yearly revenues as constantly as they
                    came to his hands. King William however gave two grants to his widow; the first
                    of which was an annuity of L.400 during the term of her natural life, and the
                    second of L.200 as an addition to the former annuity. Tillotson wrote some other
                    works besides his Sermons; and also published Dr Barrow’s Works, and Bishop
                    Wilkins’s Principles and Duties of Natural Religion, as well as a volume of that
                    prelate’s Sermons.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
