                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">TYRWHITT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Τhomas</hi></label>, a
                    distinguished scholar, was born in London on the 29th of March 1730. His father
                    Dr Robert Tyrwhitt, descended from an ancient baronet’s family in Lincolnshire,
                    was at that time rector of St James’s, Westminster; but this benefice he
                    resigned in 1732, on being appointed a canon residentiary of St Paul’s. With
                    this preferment, he held the prebend of Kentishtown, and the archdeaconry of
                    London. In 1740 he became a canon of Windsor; and, if his life had been
                    prolonged, he might perhaps have attained to a higher station in the church; but
                    he died on the 15th of June 1742, at the early age of forty-four. By his wife,
                    the eldest daughter of Bishop Gibson, he left a numerous family, with only a
                    moderate provision. His eldest son Thomas was sent to a school at Kensington,
                    after he had completed the sixth year of his age. In January 1741 he was removed
                    to Eton, where he first displayed that ardent love of literature for which he
                    continued through life to be eminently distinguished. It was said of Tyrwhitt
                    that he never was a boy, his calm and contemplative disposition always leading
                    him to manly and scholar-like pursuits. After residing at Eton for six years, he
                    was in 1747 entered of Queen’s College, Oxford. He took the degree of A. B. in
                    1750; and having been elected to a fellowship of Merton in August 1755, he took
                    that of A. M. in the ensuing year.</p>
                <p>He had previously hired chambers in the Temple, and applied himself to the study
                    of the law; but in December 1756 he was appointed under secretary at war, the
                    principal secretary being his friend and patron Lord Barrington. In August 1762
                    he obtained the more lucrative office of clerk of the House of Commons, and he
                    then resigned his fellowship. “If the fatigues of the clerkship,” says one
                    biographer, “had not proved too much for his constitution, it is thought that
                    some of the higher offices of the state were within his reach.” He resigned his
                    office in January 1768, and passed the remainder of his life in learned
                    retirement. In 1784 he was elected a curator of the British Museum, and was
                    zealous in discharging the duties connected with this honourable appointment. To
                    the Museum he bequeathed a portion of his valuable library, comprehending such
                    books as it did not already possess. His constitution had never been robust; and
                    having been attacked by two violent disorders, he expired on the 15th of August
                    1786, in the fifty-seventh year of his age. He died at his house in
                    Welbeck-street, Cavendish-square, and was interred, as his father had also been,
                    in St George’s Chapel, Windsor. He left behind him the character of a learned
                    and amiable man. “In private life,” we are informed, “he was a man of great
                    liberality, of which some striking instances are given. In one year it is said
                    he gave away L.2000, and for such generous exertions he had the ability as well
                    as the inclination, for he had no luxuries, no follies, and no vices to
                    maintain. Of such a man it is unnecessary to add, that he died lamented by all
                    who knew the worth of his friendship, or enjoyed the honour of his
                    acquaintance.”</p>
                <p>Tyrwhitt was a man of solid as well as extensive erudition; well acquainted with
                    the modern, and eminently skilled in the ancient languages. He was an able
                    Grecian; and his name is held in much respect by the scholars of the continent.
                    He distinguished himself by his sound judgment and critical sagacity; nor was he
                    less distinguished by the modesty and candour which he carried into all his
                    inquiries. He bore no resemblance to those verbal critics who seem to have
                    dipped their pens in gall whenever they enter upon the discussion of a
                    controverted point, however minute.</p>
                <p>His earliest publication was “An Epistle to Florio at Oxford.” Lond. 1749, 4to.
                    This was followed by “Translations in Verse.” 1752, 4to. Here Pope’s Messiah and
                    Philips’s Splendid Shilling appear in Latin, and the eighth Isthmian ode of
                    Pindar in English. His next work, which is but of small extent, is entitled
                    “Observations and Conjectures on some Passages of Shakspeare.” Oxford, 1766,
                    8vo. On the same poet he afterwards communicated various annotations to Steevens
                    and Reed, for their editions of 1778 and 1785. His edition of another English
                    poet brought him a considerable increase of reputation: “The Canterbury Tales of
                    Chaucer. To which are added, an essay on his language and versification; an
                    introductory discourse; and notes.” Lond. 1775-8, 5 vols. 8vo. Oxf. 1798, 2
                    vols. 4to. Lond. 1830, 5 vols. 8vo. He afterwards lent his aid to the
                    publication of “Poems, supposed to have been written at Bristol, by Thomas
                    Rowley and others, in the fifteenth century; the greatest part now first
                    published from the most authentic copies, with an engraved specimen of one of
                    the MSS. To which are added <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=473" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0473-0443"/>a
                    preface, an introductory account of the several pieces, and a glossary.” Lond.
                    1777, 8vo. This volume was twice reprinted in 1778, with the addition of an
                    appendix, tending to prove that the poems were all written by Chatterton.
                    Tyrwhitt’s opinion, which is now sufficiently confirmed, was opposed by several
                    writers, one of whom was Mr Bryant, and another Dr Milles, dean of Exeter. The
                    former published an elaborate volume of nearly six hundred pages. He returned an
                    able and temperate answer, under the title of “A Vindication of the Appendix to
                    the Poems called Rowley’s, in reply to the Answers of the Dean of Exeter, Jacob
                    Bryant, Esquire, and a third anonymous writer; with some further Observations
                    upon those Poems, and an Examination of the Evidence which has been produced in
                    support of their Authenticity.” Lond. 1782, 8vo. The word <hi rend="italic"
                    >authenticity,</hi> it may be remarked, is here improperly used instead of <hi
                    rend="italic">genuineness.</hi> On this controversy, several other tracts were
                    produced. Tyrwhitt’s opinion was adopted by Warton, and was opposed by
                    Mathias.</p>
                <p>These were the principal works of literature which he published in English. He
                    was however the editor of other two works which deserve to be mentioned.
                    “Proceedings and Debates in the House of Commons in 1620 and 1621; from the
                    original MS. in the library of Queen’s College, Oxford: with an appendix.” Oxf.
                    1766, 2 vols. 8vo. “The Manner of Holding Parliaments in England. By Henry
                    Elsynge, Cler. Par. Corrected and enlarged from the author’s original MS.” Lond.
                    1768, 8vo. He likewise superintended the posthumous publication of his learned
                    friend Dr Musgrave: “Two Dissertations. I. On the Grecian Mythology. II. An
                    Examination of Sir Isaac Newton’s Objections to the Chronology of the
                    Olympiads.” Lond. 1782, 8vo. For this work a very liberal subscription had been
                    raised, entirely by the exertions of Mr Tyrwhitt, who had previously
                    relinquished to the author’s widow a bond for several hundred pounds, which he
                    had lent to her husband.</p>
                <p>His classical labours, though not very extensive, have secured him a high
                    reputation as a scholar. In 1773 he published from a Harleian manuscript
                    “Fragmenta duo Plutarchi and after an interval of three years appeared his
                    “Dissertatio de Babrio, Fabularum Aesopearum Scriptore. Inseruntur Fabulae
                    quaedam Aesopeae nunquam antehac editae, ex cod. MS. Bodleiano. Accedunt Babrii
                    Fragmenta.” Lond. 1776, 8vo. Of Babrius, otherwise called Babrias or Gabrias,
                    the personal history is altogether obscure. Tyrwhitt supposes him to have
                    flourished during the age of Augustus, or somewhat earlier. Avianus states that
                    he compressed two volumes of fables into Greek iambics: “quas Grecis iambis
                    Babrius repetens, in duo volumina coartavit.” Suidas informs us that he changed
                    ten books of Aesopean fables into choliambic verse. His seazons appear to have
                    been afterwards reduced to prose; and Tyrwhitt considers it probable that all
                    the prose fables now bearing the name of Aesop have been fabricated from
                    Babrius. “Mihi sane haec cogitanti verisimile videtur, collectiones omnes, quas
                    hodie tenemus, fabularum Aesopearum ab opere Babriano originem suam duxisse,
                    differentias autem earum scriptorum multitudini imputandas esse, qui diversis
                    temporibus, et locis, et ingeniis, et studiis, metrorum ele-gantissimorum partes
                    varias, pro libitu suo quisque, in prosam traducendas sumpserunt.” In the
                    Bodleian Library he found a MS. which, being inaccurately described, had escaped
                    the notice of Dr Hudson, although he was keeper of that library when, in 1718,
                    he published his edition of Aesop. Various fragments of Babrius are yet to be
                    found in their original state; and the learning and sagacity of Bentley,
                    Tyrwhitt, and other critics, have frequently enabled them to restore his verses
                    from their transposed form. The merits of this dissertation are duly
                    acknowledged by Knoch, the most recent editor of Babrius. A sequel to it was
                    soon afterwards published. “De Lapidibus poema, Orpheo a quibusdam adscriptum,
                    Gr. et Lat. ex editione J. M.Gesneri. Recensuit notasque adjecit Thomas
                    Tyrwhitt. Simul prodit Auctarium Dissertationis de Babrio.” Lond. 1781, 8vo.
                    Both the dissertation and the <hi rend="italic">auctarium</hi> were reprinted
                    under the superintendence of Harles, Erlangae, 1785, 8vo.</p>
                <p>Tyrwhitt had contributed various notes on Euripides, which appeared in Musgrave’s
                    edition, published at Oxford in 1778 in 4 vols. 4to. He afterwards produced
                    his·“Conjecture in Strabonem.” Lond. 1783, 8vo. Erlang. 1788, 8vo. The last work
                    which he lived to publish was an edition of the oration of Isaeus “De Meneclis
                    Hereditate.” Lond. 1785, 8vo. He had bestowed no small labour in the preparation
                    of another work, which was conducted through the press by Dr Burgess, afterwards
                    bishop of Salisbury: “Aristotelis de Poetica liber Graece et Latine. Lectionem
                    constituit, versionem refinxit, animadversionibus illustravit Thomas Tyrwhitt.”
                    Oxonii, 1794, fol. 4to&amp;8vo. These animadversions, which may be regarded as
                    his principal work, are very able and elaborate. Another posthumous publication
                    appeared after a considerable interval: “Thomae Tyrwhitti Conjecture in
                    Aeschylum, Euripidem, et Aristophanem. Accedunt Epistolae diversorum ad
                    Tyrwhittum.” Oxon. 1822, 8vo. (<hi rend="smallcaps">x</hi>.)</p>
