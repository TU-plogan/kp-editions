                <p><label type="entry">TAWING</label>, the art of dressing skins in white, so as to
                    render them fit for divers manufactures, particularly gloves, &amp;c. All skins
                    may be tawed; but those chiefly used for this purpose are lamb, sheep, kid, and
                    goat skins. The method of tawing is this. The skins having been cleared of wool
                    or hair by means of lime, are laid in a large vat of wood or stone, set on the
                    ground, full of water, in which quicklime has been slaked; where they are
                    allowed to lie a month or six weeks, according as the weather is more or less
                    hot, or as the skins are required to be more or less soft and pliant. While they
                    are in the vat, the water and lime are changed twice, and the skins arc taken
                    out and put in again every day; and when they are taken out for the last time,
                    they are laid all night to soak in a running water, that the greatest part of
                    the lime may be removed; and in the morning are laid together by sixes one upon
                    another, upon a wooden leg, and are scraped stoutly one after another, to get
                    the flesh off from the fleshy side, with a cutting two-handled instrument called
                    a knife; and then they cut off the legs and other superfluous parts about the
                    extremes. They are afterwards laid in a vat or pit with a little water, where
                    they are fulled with wooden pestles for the space of a quarter of an hour; and
                    then the vat is filled up with water, with which they are rinsed.</p>
                <p>In the next place, they are thrown on a clean pavement to drain, and afterwards
                    cast into a fresh pit of water, out of which they rinse them well; and they are
                    again laid on the wooden leg, six at a time, with the hair side outermost: after
                    which they rub a kind of whetstone very briskly, to soften and fit them to
                    receive four or five more preparations, given them on the leg both on the flesh
                    side and hair side, with the knife, after the manner above mentioned. After this
                    they are put into a pit of water and wheaten bran, and stirred about in it with
                    wooden poles till the bran is perceived to stick to them, and then they are
                    left. As they rise of themselves to the top of the water by a kind of
                    fermentation, they are plunged down again to the bottom; and at the same time
                    fire is set to the liquor, which bums as easily as if it were brandy, but goes
                    out the moment the skins are all covered. They repeat this operation as often as
                    the skins rise above the water; and when they have done with rising they take
                    them out, lay them on the wooden leg, the fleshy side outwards, and pass the
                    knife over them to scrape off the bran.</p>
                <p>Having thus cleared them of the bran, they lay the skins in a large basket, and
                    load them with huge stones to promote the draining; and when they are drained
                    sufficiently, they give them their feeding, which is performed after the manner
                    following. For 100 of large sheep-skins, and for smaller in proportion, they
                    take eight pounds of alum and three of sea-salt, and melt the whole with water
                    in a vessel over the fire, pouring the solution out, while yet lukewarm, into a
                    kind of trough, in which are twenty pounds of the finest wheat-flour, with the
                    yolks of eight dozen of eggs; of all which is formed a kind of paste, a little
                    thicker than children’s pap. This, when prepared, is put into another vessel to
                    be used in the following manner. They pour a quantity of hot water into the
                    trough in which the paste was made, mixing two spoonfuls of the paste with it;
                    to do which they use a wooden spoon that contains just as much as is required
                    for a dozen of skins; and when the whole is well diluted, two dozen of the skins
                    are plunged into it; but they take care that the water be not too hot, which
                    would spoil the paste and burn the skins. After they have lain some time in the
                    trough, they are taken out, one after another, with the hand, and are stretched
                    out. This they do twice; and after they have given them all their paste, they
                    put them into tubs, and there full them afresh with wooden pestles. They then
                    put them into a vat, where they are suffered to lie for five or six days, or
                    more; after which they take them out in fair weather, and hang them to dry on
                    cords or racks; and the quicker they are dried the better; for if they are too
                    long in drying the salt and alum within them are apt to make them rise in a
                    grain, which is an essential fault in this kind of dressing.</p>
                <p>When the skins are dry, they are made up into bundles, and just dipt in fair
                    water, and taken out and drained: they are then thrown into an empty tub; and
                    after having lain some time are taken out and trampled under foot. They then
                    draw them over a flat iron instrument, the top of which is round like a
                    battledore, and the bottom fixed into a wooden block, to stretch and open them;
                    and having been opened, they are hung in the air upon cords to dry; and being
                    dry, they are opened a second time, by passing them again over the same
                    instrument. In the last place, they are laid on a table, pulled out, and laid
                    smooth, and are then fit for sale.</p>
