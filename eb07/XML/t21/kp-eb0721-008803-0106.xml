                <p><label type="entry">TASTE</label> is likewise used in a figurative sense, to
                    denote that faculty by which we perceive and judge of whatever is beautiful or
                    sublime in the works of nature or of art. This faculty relishes some things, is
                    disgusted with others, and to many is indifferent. It has also been called an
                    internal <hi rend="italic">sense,</hi> and by one philosopher a <hi
                    rend="italic">reβer sense,</hi> while others have considered it as the joint
                    exertion of perception and judgment in some cases, and as a play of the
                    imagination in others. To decide among these different opinions, it will be
                    necessary to ascertain, if we can, what are the objects of this faculty.
                    Scarlet, blue, green, and yellow, are all beautiful colours, and a cube and a
                    sphere are beautiful figures: but it does not appear to us that a man could be
                    said to have either a good or a bad taste for relishing the perception of a
                    scarlet more than that of a yellow colour, or a spherical more than a cubical
                    figure.</p>
                <p>With respect to the objects of the external sense, we are <pb break="no"

                    constituted by nature as to relish those kinds of food which are most wholesome,
                    and such a taste is justly said to be sound and uncorrupted. It is at first in
                    the highest perfection, for it depends not on culture of any kind, and is
                    incapable of improvement. The reverse is the case with respect to internal
                    taste. Every voice, it is true, unites in applauding elegance, simplicity,
                    spirit in writing, and in blaming affectation, or a false brilliancy; but when
                    critics descend to particulars, this seeming unanimity vanishes. Perhaps no man
                    ever beheld the rising or setting sun without feeling emotions of pleasure; yet
                    it is certain that the emotions of the clown are not the same, at least in
                    degree, with those of the philosopher. Any beautiful object presented to the eye
                    gives a pleasing sensation to the mind; and it appears to us that the clown
                    feels nothing more than a mere sensation from the view of the rising sun,
                    similar to what he would feel from a blazing heath. In poetry and painting the
                    vulgar are always delighted with the melody of the verse, and the brilliancy of
                    the colours, and think of nothing else as beauties.</p>
                <p>If this be so, the pleasures which the vulgar derive from what are called objects
                    of taste, are mere gratifications of the senses; but very different is the
                    pleasure which the man of cultivated taste derives from the beauties of nature
                    or of art. The mere sensation of the clown is followed by a train of ideas which
                    hurries him beyond the object before him to its beneficent effects and its
                    Almighty Creator. The nature of any person’s taste, therefore, is generally
                    determined from the character of his imagination and the soundness of his
                    judgment. The simple perception of the object we find is insufficient to excite
                    these emotions, unless it is accompanied with this operation of mind. Thus, when
                    we feel the beauty or sublimity of natural scenery, we are conscious of a
                    variety of images in our minds very different from those which the objects
                    themselves can present to the eye.</p>
                <p>If the mind is in such a state as to prevent this freedom of imagination, the
                    emotion is not perceived. In so far as the beauties of nature or art affect the
                    external senses, their effect is the same on every man who is in possession of
                    these senses. But to a man in pain or in grief, the same scene will not produce
                    any feeling of admiration, which at other times would have produced it in
                    perfection.</p>
                <p>There are many objects of taste which do not produce their full effect on the
                    imagination, but through the medium of the judgment. The beauty of the Farnese
                    Hercules is one kind of beauty, that of the gladiators in the palace of Chighi
                    another, and that of the Apollo Belvidere a third. Each of these figures is
                    acknowledged to be perfect in its kind; but, according to Sir Joshua Reynolds,
                    the highest perfection of the human figure is not to be found but in that form
                    which might be taken from them all, and which would partake of the activity of
                    the gladiator, of the delicacy of the Apollo, and of the muscular strength of
                    the Hercules. In this view the perfection of these statues consists in something
                    which, being perceived by the eye, is referred by the understanding to what we
                    know of the characters of Hercules, Apollo, and the gladiator, and which we
                    suppose it was the intention of the statuaries to express. There are, besides,
                    objects of which taste is sometimes said to judge, though they have little or no
                    effect whatever on the imagination. A book of abstract science, written in a
                    prolix and intricate style, may be said to be in a bad taste; and had Swift, in
                    his clear and simple style, written an Essay on the Human Understanding, his
                    work, supposing him to have been master of the subject, would undoubtedly have
                    displayed more taste than Locke’s, in which the terms are sometimes vague, and
                    the periods encumbered. This is the case of Berkeley, who is admitted by all to
                    have been a writer of good taste, though neither the Principles of Human
                    Knowledge, nor the Minute Philosopher, is capable of affording pleasure, either
                    to the senses or the imagination. His beauty consists merely in the perspicuity
                    of his style, of which the understanding alone is the judge. The metaphysical
                    writings of Dr Reid possess in an eminent degree the same beauty; and no man of
                    true taste can read them without admiring the elegant simplicity of the
                    composition as much as the strength of the reasoning, and feeling from the whole
                    a pleasure which the inflated style of Shaftesbury cannot communicate.</p>
                <p>If this be a just account of the pleasures of taste, that faculty cannot be
                    properly considered as a mere internal sense, since to its enjoyments a
                    well-stored fancy is necessary in some cases, and the reasoning power in all;
                    and the poet and the painter who wish to excel in their respective professions,
                    must not content themselves, the one with filling the ear of the reader with
                    mellifluous sounds, and the other with dazzling or deceiving the eye of the
                    spectator by the brilliancy of his colours, but both must strive for fame by
                    captivating the imagination; while the architect who aspires to a similar
                    celebrity must make the purpose of his ornaments obvious to every person capable
                    of judging. The landscapes of Claude Lorrain, the music of Handel, and the
                    poetry of Milton, excite feeble emotions in our minds, when our attention is
                    confined to the qualities which they present to our senses, or when it is to
                    such qualities of their composition that we turn our regard. It is then only we
                    feel the sublimity or beauty of their productions, when our imaginations are
                    kindled by their power, when we lose ourselves amid the number of images that
                    pass before our minds, and when we waken at last from this play of fancy as from
                    the charm of a romantic dream.</p>
                <p>It is well observed by Sir Joshua Reynolds, that taste is sometimes praised in
                    such terms by orators and poets, who call it inspiration, and a gift from
                    heaven, that though a student by such praise may have his attention roused, and
                    a desire excited of obtaining this gift, he is more likely to be deterred than
                    encouraged in the pursuit of his object. “He examines his own mind, and
                    perceives <hi rend="italic">there</hi> nothing of that divine inspiration with
                    which he is told so many others have been favoured. He never travelled to heaven
                    to gather new ideas; and he finds himself possessed of no other qualifications
                    than what mere common observation and a plain understanding are able to confer.
                    Thus he becomes gloomy amidst the splendour of figurative declamation, and
                    thinks it hopeless to pursue an object which he supposes out of the reach of
                    human industry. But on this, as on many other occasions, we ought to distinguish
                    how much is to be given to enthusiasm, and how much to common sense; taking care
                    not to lose in terms of vague admiration that solidity and truth of principle
                    upon which alone we can reason.” Whoever possesses the ordinary powers of
                    perception, sensibility of heart, good sense, and an imagination capable of
                    being roused by the striking objects of nature and of art, may, without
                    inspiration, become, by mere experience, a man of fine taste in the objects of
                    which he aspires to be a critical judge.</p>
                <p>This being the case, we may easily account for the variety of tastes which
                    prevail among man, not only as individuals, but as nations. We have already
                    mentioned the difference in one instance between the European taste and the
                    African respecting female beauty; and we may now affirm, as we hope to prove our
                    affirmation, that the one taste is equally correct with the other. The charms of
                    female beauty exist not in the mere external form and colour considered by
                    themselves (for then the inanimate statue of the Venus de’ Medici would give
                    more delight to the European beholder than the finest woman that ever lived);
                    but we associate external beauty with sweetness of disposition, and with all the
                    train of endearments which take place in the union of the sexes; and it is this
                    association which delights the man of taste, as giving refinement to an appe <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=108"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0108-0090"/> tite which itself is gross and sensual. A similar
                    association must be formed in the breast of the African who has any taste; and
                    as he never knew feminine softness, or any of the endearing qualities of the
                    sex, but as united with thick lips, a flat nose, a black skin, and woolly hair,
                    a sable beauty of that description must excite in his breast the same emotions
                    that are excited in the breast of an European by the fair woman with Grecian
                    features.</p>
                <p>But is there not an ideal or perfect beauty of the human form? There certainly
                    is, as of every other natural object; but it cannot be the same in Europe as in
                    Africa, unless to a being who is acquainted with all the peculiarities of form,
                    national and individual, that are to be found among the inhabitants of the whole
                    earth. It has been supposed, and we think completely proved, by Mr Alison, one
                    of our best writers on the philosophy of taste, that the sublimity or beauty of
                    forms arises altogether from the associations which we connect with them, or the
                    qualities of which they are expressive to us. The qualities expressed by the
                    male and female forms are very different; and we would by no means think the
                    woman beautiful who should have the form of the Farnese Hercules, or admire the
                    shapes of the hero who should be formed like the Venus de’ Medici; because the
                    proportions of such a woman would indicate strength and intrepidity, where we
                    wish to find only gentleness and delicacy; and the delicate form of the hero
                    would indicate softness and effeminacy, where the opposite qualities only can be
                    esteemed. As we associate with the female form many desirable qualities, every
                    woman is esteemed more or less beautiful as her figure and features indicate a
                    greater or smaller number of these qualities; and the same is the case with
                    respect to the qualities which adorn the male character, and the form and
                    features by which they are expressed. Upon comparing a number of human beings
                    with one another, we find, that with respect to every feature and limb, there is
                    one central form to which nature always tends, though she be continually
                    deviating from it on the right hand and on the left. This form therefore is
                    considered as the most perfect form of the species, and most expressive of the
                    qualities for which that species is valued; but in Africa, the central form,
                    with respect to the proportions of the human body and the features of the human
                    face, is very different from what it is in Europe; and therefore the ideal or
                    perfect beauty of the human form and features cannot be the same in both
                    countries. No doubt, if a man could examine the limbs and features of every
                    individual of the human race, he would discover one central form belonging to
                    the whole, and be led to esteem it the standard of beauty; but as this is
                    obviously impossible, the common idea or central form belonging to each great
                    class of mankind must be esteemed the standard of beauty in that class, as
                    indicating most completely the qualities for which individuals are esteemed.
                    Thus there is a common form in childhood, and a common form in age; each of
                    which is the more perfect as it is the more remote from peculiarities: but
                    though age and childhood have something in common, we should not deem the child
                    beautiful who was formed exactly like the most handsome man, nor the man
                    handsome who was formed exactly like the most beautiful child. This doctrine is
                    well illustrated by Sir Joshua Reynolds, who has applied it to every object
                    esteemed beautiful in nature; and proved, that the superiority of Claude Lorrain
                    over the landscape-painters of the Dutch and Flemish schools, arises chiefly
                    from his having generalized his conceptions, and formed his pictures by
                    compounding together the various draughts which he had previously made from
                    various beautiful scenes and prospects. “On the whole,” says he, “it seems to me
                    that there is but one presiding principle which regulates and gives stability to
                    every art. The works, whether of poets, painters, moralists, or historians,
                    which are built upon general nature, live for ever; while those which depend for
                    their existence on particular customs and habits, a particular view of nature,
                    or the fluctuation of fashion, can only be coeval with that which first raised
                    them from obscurity. All the individual objects which are exhibited to our view
                    by nature, upon close examination will be found to have their blemishes and
                    defects. The most beautiful forms have something about them like weakness,
                    minuteness, or imperfection. But it is not every eye that perceives these
                    blemishes. It must be an eye long used to the contemplation and comparison of
                    these forms; which alone can discern what any set of objects of the same kind
                    has in common, and what each wants in particular.”</p>
                <p>From these reasonings the same great artist concludes, that the man who is
                    ambitious of the character of possessing a correct taste, ought to acquire a
                    “habit of comparing and digesting his notions. He ought not to be wholly
                    unacquainted with that part of philosophy which gives him an insight into human
                    nature, and relates to the manners, characters, passions, and affections. He
                    ought to know <hi rend="italic">something</hi> concerning <hi rend="italic"
                    >mind,</hi> as well as a great deal concerning the <hi rend="italic">body,</hi>
                    and the various external works of nature and of art; for it is only the power of
                    distinguishing right from wrong that is properly denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >taste.</hi></p>
                <p>“Genius and taste, in the common acceptation, appear to be very nearly related;
                    the difference lies only in this, that genius has superadded to it a habit or
                    power of execution. Or we may say that taste, when this power is added, changes
                    its name, and is called <hi rend="italic">genius.</hi> They both, in the popular
                    opinion, pretend to an entire exemption from the restraint of rules. It is
                    supposed that their powers are intuitive; that under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">genius</hi> great works are produced, and under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">taste</hi> an exact judgment is given, without our knowing why,
                    and without being under the least obligation to reason, precept, or
                    experience.</p>
                <p>“One can scarce state these opinions without exposing their absurdity; yet they
                    are constantly in the mouths of men, and particularly of illiterate and affected
                    connoisseurs. The natural appetite or taste of the human mind is for <hi
                    rend="italic">truth;</hi> whether that truth results from the real agreement or
                    equality of original ideas among themselves, from the agreement of the
                    representation of any object with the thing represented, or from the
                    correspondence of the several parts of any arrangement with each other. It is
                    the very same taste which relishes a demonstration in geometry, that is pleased
                    with the resemblance of a picture to an original, and touched with the harmony
                    of music.</p>
                <p>“But besides <hi rend="italic">real,</hi> there is also <hi rend="italic"
                    >apparent</hi> truth, or opinion, or prejudice. With regard to real truth, when
                    it is known, the taste which conforms to it is and must be uniform. With regard
                    to the second sort of truth, which may be called <hi rend="italic">truth upon
                    sufferance,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">truth by courtesy,</hi> it is not fixed,
                    but variable. However, whilst these opinions and prejudices on which it is
                    founded continue, they operate as truth; and the art whose office it is to
                    please the mind as well as instruct it, must direct itself according to <hi
                    rend="italic">opinion,</hi> or it will not attain its end. In proportion as
                    these prejudices are known to be generally diffused or long received, the taste
                    which conforms to them approaches nearer to certainty, and to a sort of
                    resemblance to real science, even where opinions are found to be no better than
                    prejudices. And since they deserve, on account of their duration and extent, to
                    be considered as really true, they become capable of no small degree of
                    stability and determination by their permanent and uniform nature.</p>
                <p>“Of the judgment which we make on the works of art, and the preference that we
                    give to one class of art over another, if a reason be demanded, the question is
                    perhaps evaded by answering, I judge from my taste; but it does not follow that
                    a better answer cannot be given, though for common gazers this may be
                    sufficient. Every man is not obliged to investigate the causes of his
                    approbation or <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=109"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0109-0091"/>dislike. The arts would lie open for ever to
                    caprice and casualty, if those who are to judge of their excellencies bad no
                    settled principles by which they are to regulate their decisions, and the merit
                    or defect of performances were to be determined by unguided fancy. And indeed we
                    may venture to assert, that whatever speculative knowledge is necessary to the
                    artist, is equally and indispensably necessary to the critic and the
                    connoisseur.</p>
                <p>“The first idea that occurs in the consideration of what is fixed in art or in
                    taste, is that presiding principle which we have already mentioned, the general
                    idea of nature. The beginning, the middle, and the end of every thing that is
                    valuable in taste, is comprised in the knowledge of what is truly nature; for
                    whatever ideas are not conformable to those of nature or universal opinion, must
                    be considered as more or less capricious; the idea of nature comprehending not
                    only the forms which nature produces, but also the nature and internal fabric
                    and organization, as I may call it, of the human mind and imagination. General
                    ideas, beauty, or nature, are but different ways of expressing the same thing,
                    whether we apply these terms to statues, poetry, or picture. Deformity is not
                    nature, but an accidental deviation from her accustomed practice. This general
                    idea therefore ought to be called <hi rend="italic">nature;</hi> and nothing
                    else, correctly speaking, has a right to that name. Hence it plainly appears,
                    that as a work is conducted under the influence of general ideas, or partial, it
                    is principally to be considered as the effect of a good or a bad taste.”</p>
                <p>Upon the whole, we may conclude that the real substance, as it may be called, of
                    what goes under the name of <hi rend="italic">taste,</hi> is fixed and
                    established in the nature of things; that there are certain and regular causes
                    by which the imagination and passions of men are affected; and that the
                    knowledge of these causes is acquired by a laborious and diligent investigation
                    of nature, and by the same slow progress as wisdom or knowledge of every kind,
                    however instantaneous its operations may appear when thus acquired. A man of
                    real taste is always a man of judgment in other respects; and those inventions
                    which either disdain or shrink from reason, are generally more like the dreams
                    of a distempered brain than the exalted enthusiasm of a sound and true genius.
                    In the midst of the highest flights of fancy or imagination, reason ought to
                    preside from first to last; and he who shall decide on the beauties of any one
                    of the fine arts by an imaginary innate sense or feeling, will make as
                    ridiculous an appearance as the connoisseur mentioned by Dr Moore, who praised
                    as a work of the divine Raphael the wretched daubing by a Swiss copyist. The
                    reader who wishes for further instruction in the philosophy of taste, may
                    consult the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Beauty</hi> in this work; Dr Gerard’s
                    Essay on Taste, with the dissertations of Voltaire, D’Alembert, and Montesquieu;
                    Alison’s Essays on the Nature and Principles of Taste; and Sir Joshua Reynolds’s
                    Discourses delivered in the Royal Academy.</p>
