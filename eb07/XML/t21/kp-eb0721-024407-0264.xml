                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    sometimes called Learmont, and sometimes the Rhymer, has long been recognized in
                    the venerable character of a prophet and poet; but the history of his life and
                    writings is involved in that degree of obscurity which may well be supposed to
                    attend so remote an era of our literary annals. His very name is not ascertained
                    beyond all doubt or controversy. According to Macpherson, the accurate editor of
                    Winton, he received his surname of Learmont from Hector Boyce: but it seems
                    unnecessary to suppose that the inventive faculties of this historian were so
                    unprofitably exercised; and if credit is due to an excellent genealogist, his
                    family name is sufficiently established by its occurrence in authentic
                    documents. In one charter, says Nisbet, he is called Thomas Rymor, but in others
                    of an earlier date, Thomas Lear-mount of Ercildoun. Certain however it is that
                    no writer who preceded Boyce has yet been found to describe him by the surname
                    of Learmont: by Robert of Brunne, Barbour, Winton, Bower, and Mair, he is named
                    Erceldoune, while Henry the blind poet designates him Thomas the Rhymer. In a
                    charter granted to the Trinity House of Soltra, the poet’s son describes himself
                    as Thomas of Ercildoun, the son and heir of Thomas <hi rend="italic">Rymour</hi>
                    of Ercildoun; but whether this addition is to be considered as an ordinary
                    surname, or as an epithet commonly applied in allusion to the father’s poetical
                    character, cannot be positively determined. It must at least be recollected that
                    Rymer is a surname in both parts of the island, and that it has been traced to
                    the poet’s own age, and to the particular district in which he resided. Thomas
                    the Rhymer is the name by which he continues to be best known among the common
                    people of Scotland. Erceldoune, from which he derived his other appellation, is
                    a village situate in the county of Berwick, at a small distance from Melrose;
                    and the western extremity of this village still exhibits the ruins of a tower
                    which was once honoured by his residence. His estate was afterwards acquired by
                    the earl of March, who at the opposite end of the village possessed another
                    place of strength, called the Earl’s Tower; and hence the ancient name of
                    Erceldoune is supposed to have been gradually corrupted into Earlstoun.</p>
                <p>The period of his birth it seems impossible to ascertain; but it is evident that
                    he must have reached the height of his reputation about the year 1286, the date
                    of his famous prophecy respecting the death of Alexander the Third; and in the
                    year 1299, his son and heir conveyed the estate of Erceldoune to the convent of
                    Soltra. It is therefore obvious that his father must have died during the
                    interval. Patrick Gordon refers his death to the year 1307, but this cannot be
                    considered as any competent authority. An individual who enjoyed the reputation
                    of a prophet may naturally be supposed to have attained a venerable age. Whether
                    he himself aspired to the character of a prophet, it must now be fruitless to
                    enquire; but it is at least certain, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=265" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0265-0245"
                    />that such a character was long attached to his name. Barbour, who wrote about
                    the year 1370, makes a distinct allusion to “Thomas prophecy of Hersildoune.”
                    Bower, the continuator of the Scotichronico, who flourished about the year 1430,
                    has furnished us with a circumstantial detail respecting Thomas’s prediction of
                    the king’s premature death. Winton and Henry have likewise represented him as
                    endowed with the spirit of divination; and they are equally dubious as to the
                    origin of the power which they acknowledge him to have possessed. Mair and Boyce
                    have inserted in their respective histories, the tale so circumstantially
                    related by Bower; but, with his usual good sense, the former subjoins, “To this
                    Thomas our countrymen have ascribed many predictions, and the common people of
                    Britain yield no slight degree of credit to stories of this nature; which I for
                    the most part am accustomed to treat with ridicule.” Lesley commemorates Michael
                    Scott and Thomas Learmont as personages of an extraordinary character; and he
                    also hints at the famous prediction of the king’s death. But the period of the
                    union of the crowns seems to have been the crisis of his reputation as a
                    prophet; for, as we learn from Robert Birrel, “at this time all the haill
                    cornons of Scotland that had red or understanding, wer daylie speik-ing and
                    exponeing of Thomas Rhymer his prophesie, and of uther prophesies quhilk wer
                    prophesied in auld tymes.” Of the collection which includes the prophecies
                    ascribed to Thomas, the earliest edition that has hitherto been traced was
                    printed by Robert Waldegrave in the year 1603. It was reprinted by Andrew Hart
                    in 1615: the subsequent editions are very numerous; and the collection still
                    continues to be printed for the worshipful company of flying stationers.</p>
                <p>The claims of Thomas of Erceldoune to the character of a prophet, do not seem to
                    require any further investigation; but his claims to the character of a poet may
                    perhaps be considered as more legitimate. That he was admired for his poetical
                    talents, is supposed to be established by the testimony of a writer who
                    approached very near his own age: Robert of Brunne, who flourished about the
                    year 1303, is believed to commemorate the same Thomas of Erceldoune as the
                    author of an incomparable romance on the story of Sir Tristrem. A romance of
                    this description, and doubtless of a very early date, was discovered in the
                    Auchinleck MS. belonging to the Advocates Library; and of this very curious
                    relique of British literature, an elaborate and valuable edition, including all
                    the necessary illustrations, was published by Sir Walter Scott in the year 1804.
                    The distinguished editor entertained no doubt of its being the genuine
                    production of Thomas of Erceldoune; but the supposition, we must confess,
                    appears liable to many doubts and difficulties. This metrical romance, to
                    whatever author it may be attributed, is deservedly regarded as a precious
                    relique of early British, we do not venture to say Scotish, poetry. It is highly
                    curious as a specimen of language, and not less curious as a specimen of
                    composition. The verses are short, and the stanzas somewhat artificial in their
                    structure; and amid the quaint simplicity of the author’s style, we often
                    distinguish a forcible brevity of expression. But his narrative, which has
                    always a certain air of originality, is sometimes so abrupt as to seem obscure,
                    and even enigmatical.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
