                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">TUNNEL</label>. A tunnel is simply a hole bored through a
                    hill, in order to carry a canal, a road, or a railway, in an advantageous
                    course, and is generally resorted to as a means of lessening the expense which
                    would ensue if an open cutting were made. There are other reasons which may
                    render this mode of proceeding advisable; such as gaining the consent of a
                    landholder, who would object to a cutting through his property, but would have
                    no dislike to a tunnel; and various other local causes: but the general reason
                    for such a mode of proceeding is the consideration of expense. In order to enter
                    into this inquiry, the first step is to make plenty of borings, for the purpose
                    of examining the geological structure of the proposed hill. If these are
                    considered satisfactory, trial shafts should be sunk quite to the intended
                    bottom, as by these the quantity of water to be expected will be discovered. It
                    should be particularly attended to, as water is one of the greatest annoyances
                    to be encountered in tunnelling. The readiest way is to measure the water into a
                    cask, and ascertain the number of gallons per minute. To do it readily, the
                    shaft should be about four feet in diameter, rather more than less; and no loss
                    will be occasioned by making it large, as, if the situation is properly chosen,
                    it may afterwards be converted into a working shaft.</p>
                <p>The necessary power to drain being taken into account, and the geological
                    structure of the ground being ascertained by the borings, we have thus the
                    elements for making an estimate of the relative expense of forming a tunnel or
                    an open cutting. Questions of expediency will also have to be taken into the
                    account; such as, how the spoil from a tunnel can be deposited, and at what
                    expense in the purchase of land; whether earth in large quantities is requisite
                    for an adjacent embankment; and if we lose this by making a tunnel, at what
                    price can a side-cutting be made to complete the embankment; and various other
                    questions connected with the locality, which can only be determined on the spot.
                    Sometimes the earth for the tunnel can be taken out laterally, the working
                    shafts being horizontal; and in this case the work is called a gallery, and not
                    a tunnel. This process will in general lessen the expense.</p>
                <p>In the present state of civil engineering, a tunnel can be made through any
                    object, from a rock to a quicksand; and the question of making it turns chiefly
                    on the expense, which will vary from L.20 a yard in sandstone, which is easy to
                    cut, and which will stand without brick-work, up to L.100 and L 140 a yard in
                    quicksand and bad ground, requiring twenty-seven inches thickness in the
                    brick-work, and mostly to be laid in concrete. The Thames tunnel has cost about
                    L.1200 a yard. Here, however, there have been severe difficulties of a peculiar
                    nature to contend with, and it is a double tunnel. In general the rocky strata
                    will be cheapest, as no brick-work will be required. Hard shale, and in fact any
                    thing which will not cut by a spade, is best removed by blasting, and not by the
                    pickaxe. In some cases tough clays will be found, against which a pickaxe is
                    nearly useless, as it merely indents a hole where it sticks, without loosening
                    any thing. Blasting will have no effect on this: hatchets will answer very well,
                    and cross-cut saws best of all. The borings should be numerous, so as to give
                    all the strata. Chalk, for instance, will often contain large holes filled with
                    gravel, which on being opened during the execution of the work, will pour in on
                    the unsuspecting miner like water.</p>
                <p>After due consideration, having determined on a tunnel at the place proposed, the
                    engineer next decides on the size and shape, both being in some measure
                    regulated by what the tunnel is intended to carry. But, as respects the shape,
                    this is also dependent on the nature of the ground, and the degree of weight
                    which the brick-work will have to support. For instance, in a wet quicksand,
                    which approaches the nature of a fluid, with an equal pressure all round, the
                    shape should approximate as nearly as possible to that of a circle; and for any
                    other kind of pressure, the form of the tunnel should be proportionally
                    modified. Curves and rises or falls should by all means be avoided if
                    practicable.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>When it is
                    for a canal, the form is generally an entire: oval, the lower portion forming
                    the water-way; and on one or both side· a retaining wall is built, and filled in
                    behind, to form the towing-path. Sometimes a wood camsheet is substituted for
                    the wall, and cross sleepers laid on it. In a canal, of course, every thing must
                    be level from lock to lock.</p></note></p>
                <p>In setting out a tunnel, the engineer should have a transit instrument, placed in
                    a fixed observatory, and standing on a pier insulated from the building; and if
                    there is any road near it, the pier must be insulated from the ground to a depth
                    of six, eight, or ten feet, according to the nature of the traffic on the road,
                    in order to insure stability and a freedom from vibration. A distant mark should
                    then be taken in the line of the tunnel, and a fixed point placed as the
                    adjusting spot for the line of direction: the farther this is off the better.
                    Intermediate marks for the working and ventilating shafts may then be set out
                    correctly; and as these are sunk, plummets, suspended from points accurately set
                    out by the transit instruments, may be constantly tried as to the proper
                    direction. These plummets should be of iron, and should be let down into buckets
                    of water, to check the vibration; or, what is better, they should hang in cups
                    of mercury. When the shafts are cleared out to the bottom, other transit
                    instruments may be placed in them, the plumb-line and transit being kept as far
                    from each other as possible. The intersection of the vertical hairs in the
                    transit with the plumb-line, will then enable the engineer properly to set out
                    the work.</p>
                <p>Tunnels have been known to draw water off the wells as far as a mile distant.
                    This may generally be remedied in every case except that of a canal containing
                    salt water, by sinking the wells deeper, which for the most part restores them
                    to nearly their original state. When a salt-water canal is to pass through a
                    tunnel, compensation had better be made to the parties as soon as it is
                    discovered that an injury has been done. In all cases of canal tunnels, care
                    must be taken that they are run deep enough to insure a proper supply of water
                    to allow for waste, lockage, and leakage, where the supply is contingent on a
                    tideway. It will be very expensive to remedy this afterwards, and will most
                    probably require the erection of a steam-engine to pump up a sufficient
                    quantity.</p>
                <p>Some of the old canal tunnels, through an injudicious economy, were constructed
                    without a towing-path. The boats are in these cases pushed through by men lying
                    on their back on the deck, or on a projecting board placed for the purpose. They
                    then set their feet against the side-walls of the tunnel, and advancing them
                    alternately, foot the boat along, the helmsman steering against them. This
                    barbarous plan, which has occasioned serious loss of life, is now generally
                    abandoned; but no tunnel or canal can be called perfect unless it has a
                    towing-path on both sides. In the tunnels, an iron hand-rail should invariably
                    be set up next the edge of the towing-path; and if there is but one of these,
                    its width should be so increased as readily to admit the horses to pass each
                    other. Some of the old tunnels above described were completed for less than four
                    pounds per yard; and one, the old tunnel on the Grand Trunk Canal at Harccastle,
                    in Staffordshire, constructed by Brindley, only cost L.3. 10s. 8d. It was ten
                    feet in diameter, and consisted merely of a semicircular brick arch, which
                    sprung from the water-line of the canal. The variation in </p>

                <p>In the agreement entered into with the contractor, the price of the contract, and
                    a schedule, by which any extra or additional works are to be executed, should be
                    stated; and likewise the mode of payment, and the nature of any retentions. The
                    time for completion, and fines for exceeding this time, should be clearly and
                    distinctly laid down; with the condition that all payments are subject to the
                    engineer’s approval of the work. The contractor should find all tools,
                    machinery, labour, and materials of an approved kind, getting out all
                    foundations, excavations, shafts, culverts, drains, roads, &amp;c.; and he
                    should provide all centrings, coffer-dams, pumping apparatus, scaffolding,
                    fencing, and other requisite materiais of every description, according to the
                    specifications, plans, and drawings, and the instructions which he may from time
                    to time receive from the engineer. In the case of a railway, he should lay the
                    permanent way, the materials being in this case found for him; and io a canal he
                    should construct all the locks and gates, if there arc any at either end of the
                    tunnel, and form the towing-path. When he does not employ a sufficient number of
                    men on the work, the engineer should have power to engage more, after giving him
                    a week’s notice of his intention. These may be retained temporarily or
                    permanently, as may be required, and in all cases using the contractor’s
                    materials, the men’s pay being deducted from the price of his contract. The
                    engineer should also have the power of ordering the discharge of any foreman or
                    workman acting improperly, or doing his work with carelessness; a power which he
                    should be cautious not to use without strong reasons. The ground over the tunnel
                    should be fenced off previously to commencing the work. The contractor should be
                    restricted from entering on any adjoining land without leave; and if this should
                    be necessary after the leave is obtained, the required land should be
                    immediately fenced in. Temporary roads, for the conveyance of materials from the
                    high roads, when required, should be formed by the contractor; as also those
                    necessary for conveying away the spoil-earth. If the company who are forming the
                    tunnel are called upon by any of the surrounding occupiers, they should have
                    power to compensate them for any damages, and to place the suras thus paid to
                    the contractor’s account.</p>
                <p>The contractor should not be allowed to sublet any portion of the work without
                    permission in writing from the engineer. He should also be bound to take down or
                    otherwise alter any work not approved of by the engineer, and to remove all
                    unsound materials. All materials, from the moment they arc brought on the site
                    of the works, become the property of the persons for whom the tunnel is made,
                    and the contractor must not remove them again without permission; but the
                    company or other persons making the tunnel are not to be answerable for the
                    damages which any materials may sustain. These and similar clauses in the
                    agreement, are of course only provided for cases of emergency, and would seldom
                    require to be acted on. The contractor should make all the alterations and
                    additions which he may be instructed to do by the engineer, and no others. He is
                    to be furnished with copies of the plans, sections, and other drawings, also of
                    the specification, and is himself to see if these are correct; he is also to do
                    all that may be reasonably implied, although not actually expressed, in the
                    drawings and specification. It is usual to deduct ten per cent. from the
                    payments; the whole of which is not returned to the contractor till twelve
                    months after the completion of the work, he being bound to keep it in repair for
                    that length of time. The payments are in general made monthly, including those
                    for extra and additional works, after being approved by the engineer, who is to
                    certify the same. It is also usual in large works of this kind, when the
                    contractor has more than two millions of bricks on the site of the work, to
                    allow him half or two thirds of their cost.</p>
                <p>' When the tunnel is for a railway, the company deliver the permanent-way
                    materials at the nearest convenient place, and the contractor brings them to the
                    works, defraying the charge of wharfage, if any. In the event of any disputes,
                    the decision of the principal engineer is in all cases to be final.</p>
                <p>The drawings should consist of, 1. a general section of the tunnel
                    longitudinally, containing all the measurements to an exact scale; the positions
                    of any ventilating shafts if such are required; their length, breadth, thickness
                    of brickwork, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>2. Views of the fronts and wings, with plans and sections of the foundations and
                    wing-walls, showing the curves and batters.</p>
                <p>3. Plans and sections of the ventilating shafts, and the iron-work connected with
                    them on the working shafts.</p>
                <p>4. Transverse sections of the tunnel, with any other details as to drains, and
                    all other necessary information; and plan and section of fronts.</p>
                <p>5. A general plan of the property through which the tunnel passes, showing the
                    width to be fenced in.</p>
                <p>6. If for a railway, plans of the rails, blocks, and the mode of laying them. If
                    for a canal, plans of the locks and gates, with all other necessary details.</p>
                <p>The specification should define in words the situation and termini of the tunnel,
                    and the number and dimensions of the locks, if for a canal; and should then
                    enumerate the various works, such as fencing off the ground above, one chain in
                    width, till the tunnel is completed; sinking ventilating and working shafts;
                    excavating and building the tunnel; building the fronts; laying the drainage;
                    excavating in open cutting at each end, if required; forming and turfing the
                    slopes, and fencing and ditching them, and the tops of the fronts; depositing
                    all the earth in a given place, so as, when soiled, to he fit for agricultural
                    purposes; ballasting and laying the way, if for a railway; but if for a canal,
                    making all the necessary locks and feeders, forming the towing-path, building
                    lock-houses, deviating roads if required, and keeping the whole in repair for
                    one year.</p>
                <p>The temporary fencing should be on each side of the tunnel one chain in width,
                    between which all work and materials arc to be comprised. It should be of split
                    oak posts nine feet apart, mortised for the reception of three horizontal oak or
                    larch bars; the posts three and a half feet above ground, and the bars having
                    one intermediate stay or prickpost firmly nailed to each of them. This fencing
                    should be substantially fixed previously to the commencement of any other work,
                    so as to exclude sheep and cattle from the intermediate space, and protect the
                    surrounding land from damage. On the outside of the fencing a ditch should be
                    formed, four feet wide at the top, one foot wide at the bottom, and one and a
                    half foot deep, communicating with any existing water-courses or drains, so as
                    effectually to prevent any of the shafts which may be sunk from injury by the
                    overflow of water during the progress of the work. The strictest attention
                    should be paid to this stipulation<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=427" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0427-0405"/>
                    near every shaft; and should the situation of any shaft require for its
                    protection a larger ditch in the line of fencing, or a puddled ditch round its
                    site, the contractor should be required to make it at his own cost.</p>
                <p>When ventilating shafts are necessary, they may be built of any required size. In
                    railway tunnels from 2000 to 2500 yards long, two shafts sixty feet diameter
                    will he sufficient. They are best built from the top; for instance, excavate ten
                    feet down, and build the shaft for that height, then divide the circumference
                    into parts about ten feet wide, and excavate every alternate one of these,
                    leaving the others to support the ring of brick-work; and when these alternate
                    ones are bricked up to the ring above, the remaining earth is all taken away,
                    and the bricking continued till the second ring is completed and connected with
                    the first, when the same process is repeated till the whole is continued to the
                    required depth.</p>
                <p>The thickness of the brick-work is of course in proportion to the size and
                    height. For a shaft sixty feet diameter and 120 feet high, the following would
                    be sufficient in unfavourable ground. The tunnel, where the shaft intersects it,
                    should be entirely of stone, and on this a course of stone four feet square, on
                    which the shaft stands; then the first forty-six feet to be three feet thick;
                    the next seventeen feet, two feet eight inches thick; the next seventeen feet,
                    two feet three inches thick; and the last or upper sixteen feet, one foot ten
                    inches thick, coped with stone for the railing. the boundary wall might be one
                    foot one and a half inch thick, with footings, and an increase in the
                    foundations, if thought necessary.</p>
                <p>They should be built in alternate courses of headers and stretchers, each brick
                    being well flushed up; and where the tunnel intersects the shaft it should be
                    faced with stone, each stone to be eighteen inches upon the curve of the soffit,
                    toothing into the brick-work in the soffit of the tunnel by being three and four
                    feet long alternately; the whole truly fitted in their beds, and neatly
                    hammer-dressed, each being secured to the adjoining one with malleable iron
                    dowels run in with lead.</p>
                <p>Stone coping should be set upon the shafts a little above the level of the
                    ground, into which iron railing may be fixed. The stones to be secured by lead
                    joggles, three fourths of an inch square, and run one inch into each stone. The
                    iron railing should be about three feet high, of malleable iron, three fourths
                    of an inch square, and five inches distant from centre to centre, set three
                    inches into the coping, and run with lead. A half-round hand-rail should be
                    riveted on each upright, an inch and a half wide, as a finish.</p>
                <p>Shafts of the above size should be enclosed with a circular wall seventy-two feet
                    in diameter, twelve feet high, and fourteen inches thick, with a plinth of
                    eighteen inches, and a stone coping sixteen inches wide and four inches thick,
                    weathered and throated. In this wall there should be a doorway. The space or
                    path between the wall and the shaft should be paved with bricks, having a gentle
                    slope outwards, with holes through the wall about every three feet, to let out
                    the water.</p>
                <p>The whole bottom of the shaft should be soundly filled in, sufficiently deep,
                    with good concrete beaten firmly down; and whenever the excavation is larger
                    than the dimensions of the shaft, the space should be filled perfectly solid
                    with brick-bats, and grouted with Roman cement, with which the shafts are to be
                    built; but the enclosing wall may be built with mortar. Whenever water occurs in
                    sinking any of the shafts, it must be completely excluded from them by a lining
                    of puddle, or Roman cement if necessary.</p>
                <p>In short tunnels it may sometimes be advisable to drive a heading, about four
                    feet wide and five feet high, right through, before excavating it; and the
                    contractor should be allowed to sink what air-shafts he thinks proper, provided
                    they are not in the line of any road, nor within fifty feet of any working
                    shaft. They may be from three to four feet diameter in the clear, supported on
                    iron curbs, carried up ten feet above the surface, and coped with stone.</p>
                <p>To determine the number of working shafts, regard must be had to the time allowed
                    for the completion of the work, and the nature of the part to be excavated. The
                    shafts must be just so close together that every face can be raised and bricked
                    half the distance to the next shaft, two months before the given time for
                    completion, leaving these two months for building the fronts, and laying the way
                    if for a railway; and in all cases a larger allowance had better be made, in
                    case of accidents.</p>
                <p>the number having been determined on, their places should be shown on the
                    drawings. They should be nine feet in diameter inside, and nine inches thick;
                    the bricks to be all heading, and to be well bedded in Roman cement. The shafts
                    should be kept free from all bulges and imperfections; they should rest on an
                    iron curb-ring, forming a key between the bottom of the shaft and the top of the
                    tunnel; and they should be carried up ten feet above the surface, and coped with
                    stone.</p>
                <p>In excavating where the ground is bad, the contractor should not, without
                    permission, advance beyond the completed brick-work more than six feet. Ten feet
                    will in most cases be a convenient length; but in this the engineer must form
                    his judgment from the nature of the ground. The space excavated must be well
                    secured, in the maimer to be hereafter stated. The dimensions of these supports
                    are to be approved of by the engineer. The invert, sides, and roof, should be
                    cut out as nearly as possible of the size the tunnel will be when finished. When
                    more than this is taken out, it should be securely made good; in every case one
                    man being employed at each face solely in filling and ramming in, if under the
                    invert, with well-pounded clay, and if on the sides or top, with suitable
                    materials, rammed in with every other course of bricks at the sides, and, as
                    soon as the succeeding excavation will allow it, at the top. But when the ground
                    is very bad, the bars are to be left in, at the pleasure of the engineer. The
                    cills should not in general rest on the brick-work, but on trestles, so as to be
                    independent of the side-walls. If this is not done, the holes where they have
                    rested should be made good, whenever they are withdrawn, with brick and
                    cement.</p>
                <p>When any two faces are within fifty yards of each other, a heading should be
                    driven to connect them, and insure the proper direction of the line at the
                    junction. The contractor should also be bound to drive any headings the engineer
                    may direct, either for drainage or' otherwise. The engineer should, at the
                    contractor’s expense, from time to time give the contractor marks, in the way to
                    be hereafter shown, to let him know how the line of the work is to be
                    regulated.</p>
                <p>Twenty-seven inches thick in the sides and top, and eighteen inches in the
                    invert, in Roman cement, will be the most ever required, even in a quicksand;
                    and as the nature of the ground improves, this may be lessened, till we arrive
                    at the point where it will stand of itself. Each brick should be well bedded
                    with a wooden mallet, and every joint thoroughly flushed when mortar is used.
                    When the shape of the tunnel requires it, the bricks must be moulded taper. In
                    the arch they are laid in concentric rings, half a brick thick, taking care that
                    the additional number of bricks requisite for each additional ring is put in,
                    which is easily calculated. In a tunnel twenty-seven feet high, and twenty-three
                    wide, it will be five more for every ring. A course of stone should be laid in
                    at the springing of the side-walls from the invert; the stones about three feet
                    long, well bedded in mortar, on four courses of very sound and hard bricks.</p>
                <p>It will generally happen that excavations are to be made <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=428" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0428-0406"/>at
                    each end after the tunnelling has sufficiently advanced. These excavations
                    should be turfed, if possible, as soon as they are finished; and if turf is not
                    to be had, they must be soiled at least eight inches thick, and sown at the
                    proper season with equal parts of rye and clover seed, in the proportions of
                    three pounds of the mixed seed per acre.</p>
                <p>The top of the slopes and the ends of the tunnel should be protected with a
                    ditch, a wood-railing, and a line of quicks. The ditch should be five feet wide
                    at the top, two feet deep, and with slopes that will stand according to the
                    nature of the soil, which, if very bad, will render it necessary to widen the
                    top. The earth from the ditch will form a mound to be neatly turfed, having the
                    best of the vegetable soil in its middle, where a double row of three years old
                    quicks, two years transplanted, should be set in the proportion of twelve
                    quicksets to a lineal yard. The fence of split oak is to be set on the inner
                    edge of the ditch, as before described. The quicks should be weeded and cleaned
                    twice a year, and others planted in the room of those which have not taken
                    root.</p>
                <p>A brick drain should be laid the whole length of the tunnel, in Roman cement,
                    with the end-joints open half an inch for the passage in of water from the
                    ballasting; and if the shafts let in water, a conveyance half-round pipe must be
                    fitted to the bottom of them, to lead the water down the side of the tunnel into
                    the drain.</p>
                <p>With respect to the spoil, if made into banks, the turf should first be removed,
                    to be afterwards put on the top. Convenient sites should be found, so that the
                    spoil shall be useable for agricultural purposes; and where turf enough to cover
                    it cannot be had, it must be soiled and sown with seed at the proper season.</p>
                <p>All damages to the adjoining land must be paid by the contractor; but if the
                    parties making the tunnel arc, as is usually the case, a public company, under
                    an act of parliament, they should assist the contractor in getting the necessary
                    land, with the powers of their act. It is understood that the contractor has the
                    full use of the one chain in width along the line of the tunnel, free of all
                    charge, on which to erect any buildings or machinery he may require, laying
                    railways or roads for conveying away spoil and bringing in materials,
                    lifting-engines, pumping-engines, or any other apparatus; and it is also
                    understood, that if any material turns up fit for making bricks, he is to have
                    the advantage of applying it to that purpose.</p>
                <p>In case of having any roads to divert, or new ones to make, the ground should be
                    excavated the required width, and one foot deep; when, if it is moist, brushwood
                    should be placed upon the bottom, and then gravel, till the centre, when the
                    whole is well beaten, is two feet above the excavated bottom, with a rounding of
                    six inches on the surface. None of the gravel or broken stones should be larger
                    than will go through a two-inch ring. A ditch, railing, and quicks, as before
                    described, are then to be put up.</p>
                <p>The engineer is in all cases to be the judge of the thickness of the brick-work,
                    which should be provided for in the schedule of prices; as also, whether laid in
                    cement or mortar. It should also be clearly defined whether or not the
                    contractor is to be liable for any damage done to the land from the falling of
                    the surface during the execution of the works, or if the regular continuity of
                    the brick-work is destroyed, arising from irregular shrinking or settlement in
                    the arch, imperfection in the centring, or any other cause. He should also be
                    bound to remove all the temporary fencing, and clear the surface after the works
                    are completed.</p>
                <p>The materials should all be of the very best kind. The bricks should be sound,
                    hard, and well shaped, being moulded taper wherever the form of the tunnel
                    requires it. The sides may be built in English bond, or alternate heading and
                    stretching; but the arch and the invert must be in concentric half-brick rings.
                    The mortar should be of the best lime and sharp sand, in the proportions of
                    three to one, and passed through a pug-mill, the lime being ground under
                    edge-stones in its dry or unslacked state. The Roman cement should be perfectly
                    fresh burnt, and capable of setting hard; it should be mixed with an equal
                    quantity of sand, and none used which has set. The stone should be of a sound
                    and hard quality, perfectly free from flaws. The cast iron employed in the curbs
                    for the shafts should be of the best No. 2 iron, and the castings perfectly
                    clean and cleared from air-bubbles or pin-holes, and no stopping or packing
                    should be allowed. The whole of the malleable iron-bolts, &amp;c. employed,
                    should be made of the best scrap-iron. The bolts for retaining the tunnel fronts
                    should he tested to twenty-five tons, and tested in pairs to try the couplings.
                    When concrete is used, it should be five measures of clean riddled gravel, and
                    one measure of lime, and not mixed till immediately before it is required to be
                    placed in its intended situation.</p>
                <p>There should be a specified time for the contractor to begin and finish each
                    portion, such as the working shafts, the ventilating shafts, the excavation,
                    &amp;c.; and he should be bound to execute a given quantity of tunnelling per
                    week, sending the engineer a weekly return of all descriptions of men employed
                    on the works, distinguished into classes.</p>
                <p>When the rails, chairs, blocks, and other permanent-way materials are delivered
                    to the contractor, he is then responsible for them. They need not be delivered
                    till the tunnel is complete. Ballasting is to be used of broken stone or gravel
                    for bringing up the blocks to the required height, without any mixture of clay
                    or other substance capable of containing water; it should set quite hard. If
                    broken stones are used, they should be passed through a two-inch ring. The
                    ballasting, which may, if required, be shot down the shafts, an inclined plane
                    at the bottom canting it the right way, should be spread over the invert, and
                    beaten into a firm and solid mass, by means of heavy beaters, worked by at least
                    two men, till it is consolidated at the proper height to receive the blocks or
                    sleepers, which are also to be imbedded as firmly as possible. The contractor
                    will have to drill two holes in each block to receive the treenails, and to cut
                    a proper bed for the chairs on the sleepers. No spikes should be driven into
                    sleepers till proper holes are bored. The sleepers should be imbedded by
                    beaters, and the blocks by lifting them one foot high by a spring lever, and
                    then letting them fall till no difference of level is perceived. The rails must
                    be laid perfectly level and parallel, and the joints even and true, with an
                    allowance for expansion and contraction suitable to the temperature to be
                    furnished by the engineer. The utmost care and attention should be paid to so
                    essential a point as the laying of the permanent way.</p>
                <p>ln excavating the working or ventilating shafts, it will be the best method to
                    sink with a roll till they are fifty or sixty feet deep: this is worked by hand,
                    and then with a horse-gin. Fig. 13, Plate CCCCXCIV. If the ground is hard, the
                    roll should be used longer, as this will be the cheapest way. The roll is worked
                    by two men, and if they have to stand still occasionally for the bucket, or skip
                    as it is termed, to be filled, it will be a less expense than if a horse,
                    horseboy, and bank-man (to land the skip), have to wait for the fillers. In
                    working rocks, they will frequently have to wait for the blast.</p>
                <p>A working shaft of nine feet diameter will be found sufficient; and in commencing
                    it, place four cills across, as represented in the drawing, fig. 13, about
                    twelve or fourteen inches square. On them place the standards for the winch, as
                    shown; then begin the excavation, going on till the ground discovers signs of
                    weakness; then put in a curb (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>), which is a wooden ring
                    the size of the shaft, three inches thick, and as wide as the intended
                    brick-work, for which four inches and a half will in most cases be sufficient.
                    But if the ground is very soft, cut back into it and make the curb wider; then
                    brick the shaft from the curb to the top, and go on excavating<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=429" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0429-0407"/>
                    down the dotted line (<hi rend="italic">cc</hi>), leaving the earth at (cc) to
                    support the curb <hi rend="italic">(a).</hi> Timber props (<hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi>) may also be set up for further support, if thought necessary.</p>
                <p>When the ground again shows signs of weakness, excavate inwards, as at <hi
                    rend="italic">(a),</hi> and filling up with another curb, proceed as before,
                    according to the nature of the ground, faking out one fourth, one sixth, or one
                    eight of the circumference, and putting in the same quantity of the curb, brick
                    it up to the curb nbove, and then take out another portion of the earth; or, if
                    possible, proceed in pairs.</p>
                <p>When it is found expedient to use the gin, two pulleys must be fixed, as shown in
                    the drawing, fig. 13, for the rope to run over, and the supports or standards
                    made proportionally stronger. Having in this way completed the working shafts,
                    the next process is to sink down to the bottom of the tunnel: it is of no
                    consequence whether enough is taken out for the invert or not. The excavation
                    should then be commenced at the top of the tunnel, first running a heading at
                    the upper part, a little exceeding the length intended to be put in. This length
                    must depend entirely on the nature of the ground, varying from three to fifteen
                    feet up to rock, which wants no brick-work. The excavating is then continued
                    downwards from the heading; and when got out, the earth is propped up by the
                    mining centres, mostly composed of round timber, as shown in Plate CCCCXLIV. All
                    this propping is above the centring; it is composed of two cills (<hi
                    rend="italic">aa</hi>), fig. 10, close to the face of the tunnel, between which
                    are the props (<hi rend="italic">bb</hi>). These cills might be fastened by an
                    earth-screw (c), fig. 16, worming into the face of the tunnel. The crown and
                    side bars <hi rend="italic">(dd)</hi> are then introduced: the two upper ones
                    are called crown-bars, and all the rest side-bars. The thick end of the bars
                    rests on the props, and the smaller end on the last length of brick-work in the
                    tunnel. From each cill stretchers <hi rend="italic">(ee),</hi> fig. 16 and 10,
                    are fixed, the other end taking the last brick-work; also raking stretchers or
                    rakers (<hi rend="italic">ff</hi>) <hi rend="italic">,</hi> figs. 10 and 16, the
                    ends of which are let in so as to have a firm hold on the last brick-work. The
                    cills may be from twelve to fourteen inches square when the ground is bad; the
                    crown-bars fourteen inches diameter at the thick end, the stretchers, rakers,
                    and props, being in proportion; and their thickest ends placed as shown in the
                    drawing, reducing their sizes in better ground. It is advisable to buy the
                    timber whole, and cut it up according as the strain is found to vary.</p>
                <p>The number of side-bars depends entirely on the nature of the ground. Sometimes
                    they will only be required down to the top cill, and in other grounds they must
                    be carried down to the invert. Sometimes, when, from the weight of the face, it
                    is seen that many stretchers must be used, three cills are put in. The props
                    also to the crown and side bars vary with the pressure; and for this purpose,
                    they are made to radiate to a point, which changes accordingly. Thus the prop
                    (<hi rend="italic">g</hi>), fig. 10, would in rock be perpendicular; and if the
                    ground at the prop (<hi rend="italic">h</hi>) was bad, and likely to come in,
                    the prop (<hi rend="italic">h</hi>) would be inclined in the position of the
                    dotted line. The props between and under the cills are all perpendicular;
                    between each crown and side bar there are stretchers to keep them apart at the
                    proper distance. When the propping is completed, the next object is to get up
                    the centring for the brick-work (which is formed in the manner shown in fig.
                    15), of the required shape for the tunnel, leaving a space just enough to take
                    the brick-work and laggins between the centring and the propping apparatus. The
                    invert is the first thing built, then the side-walls, by means of the leading
                    frame (<hi rend="italic">ff</hi>), which goes up to the springing, having
                    supports <hi rend="italic">(gg).</hi> This leading frame, which is in fact a
                    template, is set up next the face of the tunnel, and from it the bricklayers
                    string their lines; and when finished, the leading frame takes to pieces, and is
                    got out till a new length of the work is excavated, and it is then put together
                    as before.</p>
                <p>When the side-walls are raised to the springing of the arch, acill(e), fig. 15,
                    is built in with them; then the centring, which, with its cill (i), is all fixed
                    together, is got up and wedged to the required height. The laggins <hi
                    rend="italic">(kk)</hi> are pieces of quartering which go from centre to centre,
                    and on them the bricks are laid; (<hi rend="italic">cc</hi>) are the
                    queen-posts, <hi rend="italic">(d)</hi> is the straining-piece, (<hi
                    rend="italic">aa</hi>) principal beams butting against <hi rend="italic">(b),
                    (mm)</hi> are the ribs on which the laggins lie; and if the centring is large,
                    these may be joined over the queen-posts and struts.</p>
                <p>In some rare cases the cill (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) is not laid on the
                    side-walls and bricked in, as leaving a hole would, if the weight was great, be
                    dangerous. Whenever this happens, trestles are set up from the bottom to support
                    the cill (e).</p>
                <p>Sometimes in quicksands or other bad ground, a slip will happen, in spite of all
                    exertions to the contrary. This occurrence will perhaps take place, if the
                    rakers are not got up, although the crown-bars, side-bars, and cills are up. It
                    arises principally from a pressure on the face, throwing the cill back and
                    letting the bars down. When it does happen, a shaft must be sunk from above, and
                    the ground beaten perfectly firm and solid from bottom to top, and the work then
                    proceeded with as in any other new length. The slip will often extend to the
                    surface, and will then take the appearance of a hollow dome.</p>
                <p>In the upper portion of the arch, where the bars cannot be withdrawn, and the
                    vacancy between the brick-work and the excavation filled up and rammed in till
                    the completion of the brick-work, it should invariably be done at the very
                    earliest possible period, which will be when the next length of excavation has
                    proceeded far enough to let the workmen have sufficient space to perform it with
                    soundness; and whenever the material through which the tunnel is making is of so
                    bad a nature as not to admit the withdrawal of the bars and planking, without a
                    risk of disturbing either the form or stability of the brick-work, they must be
                    left in, according to the judgment of the engineer; consequently their value
                    should invariably form an item in tire schedule of prices under which the
                    contractor is constructing his work.</p>
                <p>Tunnelling under rivers presents considerable difficulty, as has been experienced
                    in that under the Thames. the first tunnel was commenced at Gravesend in the
                    year 1799, but the scheme was speedily abandoned. In 1804 another was commenced
                    from Rotherhithe to Limehouse; but after sinking an eleven-feet shaft forty-two
                    feet, the difficulties were such that the work was suspended. The diameter was
                    then reduced to eight feet, and at seventy-six feet deep a drift was carried 923
                    feet under the river, which was only 150 feet from the opposite shore: the
                    engineer then reported that farther progress was impracticable. Several other
                    plans were devised, till in 1823 Mr Brunel proposed his for a double tunnel
                    between Rotherhithe and Wapping, the soil there being a tenacious blue clay. The
                    Rotherhithe shaft is fifty feet diameter 150 feet distant from the river, being
                    forty-two feet high and three thick, built on the surface and excavated
                    afterwards; the earth and water being drawn out by a steam-engine on the top. It
                    was thus sunk in its place in a body, and by this means passed through a bed of
                    gravel and sand twenty-six feet deep, which had caused great inconvenience in
                    the former attempt. Sec fig. 11.</p>
                <p>The fifty-feet shaft was sunk sixty-five feet, and from the lower level a
                    twenty-five feet shaft was sunk to eighty feet for drainage. At sixty-three feet
                    the tunnel commences dipping two and a quarter feet per 100 feet. The excavation
                    was thirty-eight feet wide and twenty-two and a half high, or a sectional area
                    of 850 feet; and the bottom, at the deepest part of the river, is seventy-six
                    feet below high water. The excavation was effected by a shield composed of
                    twelveframes close together, having each three cells above one another for the
                    miners (fig. 18): 400 feet were bricked <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=430" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0430-0408"
                    />complete in ten and a half months. In May 1827 and January 1828 the river
                    burst in. These accidents were overcome by throwing down bags of clay from
                    above. The work was however suspended for several years, not from any doubt of
                    its success, but from want of funds. It has again been commenced, and has now
                    reached the wharf-wall on the Wapping side.</p>
                <p>The shafts will contain easy flights of steps for foot-passengers, and the
                    descents for carriages are intended to be circular, to give them an easy slope.
                    The middle wall was first built solid for greater strength; but openings were
                    then made, so that each tunnel has ready communication with the other. The
                    entire length will be 1300 feet. During the excavation each portion of the
                    shield advances separately; and in front, polling boards are pressed firm
                    against the earth by screws. These boards are removed singly to excavate, and
                    the first is always replaced before a second is taken down. Fig. 17 shows
                    through the tunnel a view of the twelve parts of the shield as worked. They, of
                    course, are all of a length, extending to the outer parts of the brick-work in
                    all parts.</p>
                <p>In Plate CCCCXCIV., fig. 14 shows the mode of supporting the shafts in a canal or
                    railway tunnel when finished, by the iron curb, separate drawings of which are
