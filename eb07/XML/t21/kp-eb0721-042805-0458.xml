                <p><label type="entry">TURNING</label>, the art of giving circular and other forms
                    to objects, by making them revolve in various manners in a machine called a
                    lathe, and applying cutting instruments so as to produce the form required; or
                    by making the cutting instrument revolve, when the object to be operated upon is
                    fixed.</p>
                <p>This art is of great antiquity, and is of immense importance to the practical
                    mechanic. It embraces many varieties requiring varied machinery for their proper
                    performance, from the simple throwing wheel of the potter to the complicated and
                    nearly automatic slide-lathe, in which, almost independent of manual dexterity,
                    an indefinite number of copies of an article can be produced with unerring
                    accuracy.</p>
                <p>There is probably, in the range of mechanical operation, none susceptible of
                    greater accuracy than the art of turning, and there is none which has so much
                    conduced to the improvement of our machinery. The extent of the applications of
                    this art may be learned by the four following conditions, which comprise the
                    most important of its varieties. A knowledge of the manipulations no mere
                    description can convey; and as, in the limits here assigned us, it would be
                    impossible to describe all the varieties of the art, and the machines made use
                    of, we shall content ourselves with such a selection as may appear to us to
                    possess the greatest interest for the general reader.</p>
                <p>1st. The article to be turned may be made to revolve round its own axis, and the
                    cutting tool applied to its surface, so as to produce the requisite form, as in
                    simple turning, performed in the ordinary lathe used by cabinet-turners; the
                    more powerful lathe used for turning metal of large diameter; and the
                    self-acting slide-lathe.</p>
                <p>2d. The article may remain stationary, while the cutting instrument either merely
                    revolves, or, while revolving, has at the same time some other motion given to
                    it.</p>
                <p>3d. The article may be made to move in some curve derived from circular motion,
                    and the cutting tool applied as before.</p>
                <p>4th. The article may be made to revolve, and at the same time to have a
                    reciprocating motion in the direction of its axis, the cutting instrument being
                    only applied, however, while the article is either in the course of its forward
                    or backward motion, but its application not continued through both; and all
                    these motions may be more or less combined, thus producing almost infinite
                    variety.</p>
                <p>The self-acting slide-lathe being the most perfect of the machines of the first
                    class, we have preferred giving a drawing and description of it; from these, the
                    other lathes referred to will be more easily understood than if we had described
                    a less perfect machine. The lathe, when of large size, is generally driven by
                    steam or other power; but when small it is driven by a treadle put in motion by
                    the foot of the workman. The treadle acts on a cranked axle, on which is fixed a
                    fly-wheel; and a band from the fly-wheel passes over the pulley of the mandril
                    or spindle, to which the article to be turned is attached. This is generally the
                    arrangement of the common lathe, which differs from the slide-lathe only in
                    wanting the slide and its moving apparatus, which we are about to describe, and
                    has in place of it a simple rest to work by hand.</p>
                <p>The following figures represent the slide-lathe as constructed by Messrs
                    Whitworth &amp; Company of Manchester, and exhibit certain contrivances which
                    have been patented by these gentlemen.</p>

                <p>the same parts in all the figures. A A is a strong framing, which supports the
                    bed of the lathe B B. At the left-hand extremity of the bed is fixed the head C
                    C, and through steel bushes in the tiprights, or puppets as they are termed, the
                    spindle or mandril D works; the projecting right hand end of the mandril is
                    screwed, so that chucks and other apparatus for holding the work to be turned
                    may be attached to it. One of these, the double driver, will be found figured
                    and described afterwards. In brackets projecting backwards from the uprights
                    another spindle E works. One of the brackets and the end of the spindle are seen
                    in fig. 2. On the main spindle D there is a conical pulley F, carrying a pinion
                    on its smaller end; the pulley with its pinion turns on the spindle, hut
                    independently of it. To the right of the pulley is a spur-wheel H, keyed on the
                    spindle; to this spur-wheel the pulley can be locked at pleasure, so as to be
                    carried round along with it. On the spindle E is a spur-wheel G and a pinion,
                    which cannot be seen in the drawing. These are fitted respectively to gear with
                    the spur-wheel and pulley-pinion of the main spindle. Different materials
                    require to pass the cutting tool with different degrees of rapidity, in order to
                    be efficiently operated upon. Cast iron requires to revolve slowly, so that it
                    may come in contact with the cutting tool at the rate of about 100 feet per
                    minute; wrought iron and steel about twice as quick; and brass is better cut at
                    a still higher velocity. Thus, it is required that provision be made in the
                    lathe for altering the speed, independently of the velocity of the prime mover.
                    It is obvious, too, that the same material must require a change in the speed of
                    the lathe, according to its diameter, that a uniform rate of speed may be
                    maintained by its surface. This alteration in the velocity of the spindle or
                    mandril is produced by the pulley and wheels we have just described, in the
                    following manner :—When the belt from the prime mover, acting on the pulley F,
                    causes it to revolve, if a slow motion be required, the pinion of the pulley is
                    made to gear with the spur-wheel I of the spindle E; and the pinion fixed on the
                    same spindle gearing into the spur-wheel H of the main spindle D, causes it to
                    revolve with a motion slow as compared with the speed of the pulley. If a higher
                    velocity be required, the wheel and pinion of the spindle E are put out of gear
                    with the pinion and wheel of the main spindle by sliding the spindle E a little
                    to the left hand, and then locking together the pulley and spur-wheel H, so as
                    to cause the main spindle to turn directly by the pulley.</p>
                <p>The face of the spur-wheel H has drawn on it a great number of concentric
                    circles. The circumference of each circle is divided into equal parts, and such
                    numbers are chosen for the division as are multiples of the greatest variety of
                    measures; at each division of the circles there is pierced a hole, into which a
                    point is pressed by a spring. By means of this apparatus, an object in the lathe
                    can have its surface divided into any number of equal parts. On the end of the
                    main spindle is fixed a pinion K, which, by the intervention of the stud-wheels
                    and pinion L, drives the spur-wheel M, fixed on the end of a screw N, which
                    extends along the whole length of the lathe, and is called the leading screw.
                    The ends of the leading screws and main spindle are made accurately of the same
                    size, so that the wheels and pinions which have for different purposes to be
                    fixed on them may be exchangeable. On the right hand side of the lathe is seen
                    the shifting-head or puppet O, which is capable of being shifted along to any
                    part of the bed, and fixed there, and which carries the centre pin. This is
                    adjusted more nicely to its work by means of a screw turned by the wheel P, and
                    it is fixed by the clamping screw Q. The slide-rest consists of an upper and an
                    under slide: the latter lies across the bed, and is moved along it lengthways by
                    means of the leading screw. The upper slide can move at right angles to the
                    under one, and carries the cutting tools: the manner in which the slides are
                    moved by the leading screw is, in this lathe, very ingenious. From the under
                    slide there descends a short vertical spindle, carrying on its lower extremity a
                    peculiarly-formed pinion ♯, which is constantly in gear with the leading screw.
                    When the leading screw is in motion and the pinion fixed, the latter serves as a
                    nut or female screw, and the slide is moved along the bed of the lathe to the
                    right or to the left as the screw may be turned. On the upper end of the
                    vertical spindle there is fixed a mitred wheel <hi rend="italic">b</hi>: into
                    this a pinion <hi rend="italic">c</hi> works, whose spindle crosses the slide,
                    and has a handle <hi rend="italic">d</hi> fixed to it. On the slide having
                    reached one or other extremity of the bed of the lathe, it may be carried to the
                    other by reversing the motion of the screw; but it is more speedily done by
                    turning the handle <hi rend="italic">d</hi> which turns the pinion <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> and so the slide is carried along very rapidly.</p>
                <p>The upper slide is moved across the bed of the lathe as follows: A pinion <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> which works into the mitred wheel of the vertical spindle,
                    is fixed on the end of a shaft <hi rend="italic">f</hi>, on whose other end is
                    fixed the wheel <hi rend="italic">g</hi>; this gears into another wheel A, fixed
                    on the end of a leading screw, which crosses the main leading screw, and, by
                    means of an apparatus similar to that above described, causes the upper slide to
                    move at right angles to the under one. In fig. 3 the under slide is represented
                    as fixed in its position by means of a clamp, whose handle is seen at <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> in fig. 1, and the main leading screw is, by means of the
                    pinion <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> the mitred wheel <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, and
                    the pinion and wheels <hi rend="italic">e</hi>, <hi rend="italic">g, h</hi>,
                    working the cross leading screw of the upper slide, by which it is moved across
                    the bed of the lathe.</p>
                <p>In plain cylindrical turning, the motion of the slide is so adjusted in relation
                    to the motion of the article operated upon, that the cutter carried by the slide
                    shall not move over a space greater than the breadth of its point in the lime
                    that the article makes one revolution. In screw-turning, the cutter again is
                    made to travel over a space as much greater than the breadth of its point during
                    one revolution of the spindle, as the pitch of the screw requires. The requisite
                    changes in the motion are effected by changing the wheels on the ends of the
                    main spindle and the leading screw.</p>
                <p>On the mandril nose there is represented, in fig. 1, what is called a double
                    driver, and we here give the details of an excellent apparatus of this kind,
                    invented by Mr Joseph Clement of London, by which an article can be fixed
                    perfectly true between the centres of the lathe. The figures and description are
                    from the Transactions of the Society of Arts of London, vol. xlvii.</p>

                    />centres have been lost, a simple apparatus, called a boring collar, is made
                    use of. It consists of a puppet, capable of being fixed on the bed of the lathe,
                    in the same manner as the puppet O, fig. 1, and as a substitute for it. On the
                    right hand side of this is fixed, by a bolt through its centre, a disc of cast
                    iron, which has been turned perfectly flat, and which is of as large diameter as
                    the height of the puppet above the bed will admit. On this disc a circle is
                    traced, the highest point of it being exactly level with the centre of the
                    mandril; and all round the circle are bored holes, varying in their dimensions,
                    to suit the different sizes of the objects which require to be centred. The disc
                    moving round on the bolt by which it is attached to the puppet, the hole
                    suitable for the article to be centred is turned uppermost, so as to be on a
                    line with the mandril, and the disc is then fixed in that position by another
                    bolt or pin, which is passed into a hole in the puppet below the centre, through
                    one of another inner series of holes in the plale, which correspond to those
                    above described.</p>
                <p>The slide-lathe which we have described is one well adapted for the machinist;
                    but for particular uses, certain modifications are made in the apparatus: of
                    these we shall immediately speak. In the mean time we may observe, that a very
                    useful arrangement of the slide-lathe has been made by Mr C. D. May of
                    Edinburgh. In his lathe the slide works, not on the top of the bed, but along
                    its face: it thus can pass from end to end clear of the puppets, and the lathe
                    can at once be converted into an ordinary one to work by hand, by moving the
                    slide to the right hand extremity of the lathe, clear of the shifting puppet,
                    and applying the ordinary rest to work by hand. This lathe is very neat, is
                    simple in construction, and occupies little space</p>
                <p>The modifications in the slide-rest are as follows: The upper slide, in place of
                    being able to move at right angles only to the lower rest, may have other
                    motions given to it. It may be made to turn round on a centre, and, by an index
                    and graduated arc, may be set at any angle to the axis of the mandril. In this
                    way it is used for turning conical work. The rest may be made, too, to receive
                    cutting instruments, to which circular motion may be given, while the article
                    operated upon remains stationary, as mentioned in the second division of the
                    subject.</p>
                <p>In this case a frame is added to the lathe, consisting of two uprights, one at
                    each end, carrying a series of pulleys put in motion by bells from the
                    fly-wheel, and which again, by means of a band, give motion to a pulley fixed on
                    the end of a revolving cutter, carried by the slide. It will at once be seen,
                    that when an article is held in a chuck on the end of the mandril, and turned
                    round, so as, by means of the divided circles on the spur-wheel face, to present
                    any number of sides to the action of the revolving cutter, and when the cutter
                    itself can, by means of the double slides and turning motion, be set in almost
                    any position relative to the work, the variety of uses of which this arrangement
                    is susceptible is almost infinite. Holes may be bored with it radiating from the
                    axis of a cylinder, as for the spokes of a wheel: they may be bored in a
                    straight line, or in a helical line; continuous grooves may be formed in any
                    direction. By using proper cutters, any of the geometrical solids may be formed
                    in the lathe. A very obvious application of this apparatus is to the cutting of
                    the teeth of wheels, either direct or oblique. Suppose that it is required to
                    cut a wheel of ninety teeth: a circle in the dividing plate on the face of the
                    spur-wheel, containing ninety holes, or any multiple of that number, is
                    selected, and the spring pointer being fixed in the first hole, a proper cutter,
                    fixed on a vertical spindle, is made to act on the wheel, and to cut out the
                    first tooth to the proper depth: it is then withdrawn, and the mandril is turned
                    round until the pointer falls into the second hole of the dividing plate; the
                    cutter is again applied for the second tooth, and so on successively for all of
                    them In what we have described we have supposed the work to be fixed to the
                    mandril of the lathe, and the cutting instruments attached to the slide; but the
                    case may be reversed, and thence arises a new variety of applications. A
                    circular saw being fixed on the mandril, an article held in the slide-rest may
                    be presented to it, so as to be cut in any plane. Large drills, too, may be
                    carried by the mandril, and the work to be bored fixed to the slide.</p>
                <p>To the other varieties of the art the term of ornamental turning or
                    engine-turning is generally applied. Among these are rosette turning, eccentric
                    turning, elliptic turning, epicycloidal turning, and spiral turning. The lathe
                    for the first of these has this peculiarity. The head on the left, in place of
                    being fixed firm on the bed, stands between centres parallel to the spindle at
                    the level of the bed. It is kept in its proper position by the adjusted pressure
                    of four springs, one of which is fixed at each side of the front and back
                    puppet. On the spindles are fixed the rosettes, from which the lathe derives its
                    peculiar motion. These rosettes consist of wheels, discs, or portions of
                    cylinders, having their surface indented in various forms. Fixed parallel to the
                    spindle, but at a lower level, is the bar on which the rubbing apparatus is
                    fixed; the rubber, being placed in contact with one of the rosettes, and
                    incapable of yielding to the inequalities of its surface, forces the spindle on
                    which the rosettes are placed, and consequently the article operated on, to move
                    in various regular curves, as the indentations on the rosette guide them. The
                    rosette may be applied to elliptical turning by using a proper chuck, as
                    described under that head. For vertical waved lines, a pinion is fixed on the
                    head of the spindle, working a rack attached to a vertical slide fixed in the
                    front puppet; to counterbalance the slide, a cord is attached to its top, passed
                    over a pulley above, and attached to a weight at its other extremity; thus the
                    pinion is relieved from unnecessary friction.</p>
                <p>In eccentric turning, an eccentric chuck is used. This consists of a solid
                    circular plate, which is fixed to the mandril of the lathe. On the face of the
                    plate are fixed two guides, so as to form a dovetailed slide for another plate,
                    which is moved by a screw sunk in a slot in the under plate. On the upper plate
                    is a circular toothed plate, which is capable of being turned round its centre,
                    and is retained in any position by a catch, which falls between its teeth, and
                    is held by a spring. On the centre of this wheel is fixed a screw similar to
                    that on the nose of the mandril, and to this is chucked the work to be turned.
                    The first plate moves, of course, concentric with the s indie of the lathe; but
                    the slide, with its circular plate, can be moved so that the work revolves with
                    any degree of eccentricity required.</p>
                <p>Epicycloidal turning is another beautiful variety of the art. Like eccentric
                    turning, this is performed by a chuck peculiarly formed, but so complicated as
                    to be totally unintelligible without the aid of numerous figures; we are under
                    the necessity, therefore, of referring the reader to the works quoted at the end
                    of the article for a full explanation of it. In Bergeron’s work, he will find
                    beautiful engravings of the apparatus for this and the other varieties of
                    ornamental turning, with minute descriptions.</p>
                <p>Elliptic turning will be found described under that title.</p>
                <p>The lathe for spiral turning is constructed as follows. On a shaft lying above
                    the bed are three drums, or large wheels, with broad rims, that on the extreme
                    left being smaller than the other two. To the circumference of the latter is
                    attached a cord, which is stretched tight to the end of a strong elastic beam or
                    spring fixed at the roof. On the bed, beneath this drum, is the fixed head,
                    which consists of two puppets fixed at about two and a half feet asunder. In the
                    top of each puppet is fixed a brass bush, in which the spindle, which is
                    perfectly cylindrical, moves as directed by the leading screw, consisting of a
                    cylinder of wood, firmly fixed on the spindle between the two puppets, on which
                    is grooved out a screw of the same pitch as that required to be made. This is
                    effected by placing beneath, and close to the cylinder, a wheel having a thin,
                    round, or pointed edge, and turning on centres in a forked frame, after the
                    manner of a framed pulley. The frame of this wheel is fixed on a stiff centre,
                    so as to be capable of being set to any angle. If the spindle be then caused to
                    revolve, it will also move in a longitudinal direction, in exact proportion to
                    the divergence from a right angle, at which the wheel is set. and there will be
                    traced on the cylinder a screw, which, when cut to fit the edge of the wheel, is
                    a leading screw. These leading screws may be multiplied indefinitely, by
                    shifting the wheel to different angles, to mark a y number of cylinders or
                    leading screws that may be required. On the spindle at the front of the leading
                    screw is a wooden pulley, round which passes the cord which conies down from the
                    large drum on the left; it then passes down and is fixed to the left corner of
                    the treadle, the other end of which is raised by a cord passing straight from
                    its extremity to the large drum on the other end of the shaft. By pressing down
                    the treadle, the cord, which. as before remarked, passes round the pulley on the
                    spindle, causes it to revolve; it also, by unwinding from the drums, causes them
                    and their shaft to revolve, and the smaller drum, as it revolves, warps round it
                    the cord attached to the spring in the roof, thereby bending it. It is evident
                    that, whenever the pressure of the foot on the treadle is removed, the
                    elasticity of the spring will cause it to pull off the cord which held it down,
                    and cause the small drum round which the cord was wound, and the other drums,
                    and the spindle, to revolve in the opposite direction to that caused by the
                    descent of the treadle.</p>
                <p>The shift ng head consists of two puppets and a spin&lt;lle. the same as that
                    just described for the fixed head. Solid on the head of each spindle is a socket
                    or hollow cylinder, in which is fixed, by means of a side-screw or otherwise, a
                    strong taper screw: one of these screws is inserted into each end of the piece
                    of wood to be turned. The rest has a groove, through which the tool passes, in
                    order to prevent the longitudinal motion from displacing it. It is evident that
                    no more length of twisted work can be produced at once than the length of the
                    leading screw: but by shilling the rest, and taking care that the cuts join
                    accurately, the twist or <pb break="no"

                    />screw may be continued to any desired length. By means of this lathe, every
                    variety of twisted work can be produced.</p>
                <p>The reciprocating motion of the spindle may be varied by the introduction of
                    other apparatus for its introduction than the screw we have described. By means
                    of elliptical or other rubbers placed at the extremity of the spindle, singular
                    compound motions are produced; and when with these are combined rubbers to cause
                    lateral motion, as in the rosette lathe, an immense variety of beautiful and
                    fanciful figures is the result.</p>
