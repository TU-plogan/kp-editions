                <p><label type="entry">TORBAY</label>, a fine and commodious bay on the coast of
                    Devonshire, of great importance to the naval power of the British empire,
                    celebrated as the place where King William with his army landed in the year
                    1688. The bay is formed by two capes or promontories; that on the east, called
                    Hob's-nose, and that on the west, called Berry-head. It is distant from the Bill
                    of Portland thirty-seven miles, and the circumference is about twelve miles, so
                    that there is sufficient space for the whole British navy to ride in security.
                    Near the entrance are four islets or large rocks, called the Oristone, the
                    Loadstone, the Thatcher, and the Shag-rock: but they present no danger, as there
                    is a good passage between them, and a depth from six to ten fathoms of water
                    close to them. Ships may anchor in this bay in six, seven, eight, or nine
                    fathoms water. The ground is a strong clay, and very good for holding. Within
                    the bay they are secure against all winds; but a gale from the east brings in a
                    great swell, which ships can avoid by anchoring about a mile from Brixham
                    pier-head, in seven fathoms of water.</p>
                <p>Few parts of England so powerfully strike the beholder as this bay when viewed
                    from a ship at anchor in it. The thick foliage of the fruit and other trees
                    which are distributed on the sides of the lofty hills that surround the bay, the
                    elegant gentlemen’s seats interspersed among them, the villages with the spires
                    of the churches on the land, the two towns of Brixham and Torquay with their
                    handsome rows of houses, and the great number of vessels of all descriptions,
                    from the smallest fishing-boats to the largest ships that sail on the ocean,
                    present a picture which can scarcely be rivalled on any other spot of the globe.
                    The mildness of the climate has gradually induced the building of large distinct
                    mansions, and has also augmented two towns, which from hamlets have become
                    populous places, deserving here to be noticed. Brixham, or, as it was formerly
                    called, Brixholme, is on the south side of the bay. It is the greatest fishing
                    place in the kingdom, and one of the finest nurseries for seamen. It has a
                    convenient pier, and a complete watering wharf, from which a store of water can
                    be supplied to a fleet with great facility and expedition. The parish church nt
                    Brixham is a fine old structure; and at a mile and a half from thence, at the
                    quay, a church has recently been erected. capable of seating 1200 persons. This
                    place has of late been visited by strangers in the summer for sea-bathing, and
                    in the winter for the benefit of enjoying a mild climate. The population of the
                    parish of Brixham amounted in 1821 to 4503, and in 1831 to 5015. Torquay is
                    situated in the cove of Torbay, two miles from the promontory called Hob’s-nose.
                    It is sheltered from the waves by a ridge of rocks; and it cannot be exceeded in
                    romantic beauty and picturesque scenery. Here a new pier, projecting southwest
                    from the eastern cliff, affords complete protection to shipping from the
                    southern winds. The regularity of the buildings raised for the accommodation of
                    visitors adds neatness and beauty to the place; and the park, with a new
                    carriage-way to it, and a plantation on one side, is no small embellishment to
                    the place.</p>
                <p>Torquay exhibits a remarkable instance of rapid creation, and ranks as one of the
                    most esteemed of the sea-bathing places; possessing all the advantages of the
                    mild climate of the most southern part of the British islands. It is exempted
                    from exposure to the winds from the north and the east by the lofty hill which
                    intervenes. Though there is much bathing company in the summer, yet in the
                    winter, if the visitors are not more numerous, they are more select; as many
                    invalids, or those who feel symptoms of a pulmonary kind, resort to Torquay to
                    pass the severer months, and not only from the neighbouring counties, but from
                    the more northerly parts of England, and even of Scotland. It has every
                    convenience for the purpose of sanatory retirement that the best watering place
                    affords. Provisions are good and cheap; and the rides in the vicinity, though
                    rather hilly, arc kept in good condition. This place is in two parishes. One of
                    these is Tor-Moham, whose population amounted in 1821 to 1925, and 1831 to 3582,
                    and it has rapidly increased since the last of these dates. The other parish is
                    Mary Church, whose inhabitants amounted in 1821 to 1050, and in 1831 to 1204. By
                    calculation in the present year, 1840, Torquay itself is stated to have 6000
                    residents, exclusively of those strangers that resort to it in the two seasons
                    between which the parliamentary enumerations have been taken. The objects in the
                    vicinity that engage the attention of visitors are, Tor Abbey, an ancient
                    edifice; Poole's Hole, a very curious cavern; Kent’s Hole, one much larger, with
                    three entrances, and a roof thirty feet high. There are several fine seats in
                    the neighbourhood.</p>
