                <p><label type="entry">TRYPHIODORUS</label>, a poet of some note in the
                    decliningages of Greek literature, was a native of Egypt, but the rest of his
                    history is very obscurely known. “All that can be determined in relation to our
                    author’s age,” says Merrick, “is that he lived between the reigns of [Alexander]
                    Severus and Anastasius, the former of whom died at the beginning of the third
                    century, and the latter at the beginning of the sixth.” His writings were
                    numerous, and several of them are mentioned by Suidas. One of these is described
                    as <hi rend="italic">Marathoniaca;</hi> a poem, which apparently related to the
                    victory at Marathon. Another of his poems was founded on the story of
                    Hippodamia; and a third, which is more frequently mentioned, was a
                    lipogrammatic, or letter-dropping, Odyssey. “It is generally believed,” as
                    Merrick states, “that the poem was divided into as many books as there are
                    letters in the Greek alphabet, and that in the first book there was no word
                    which had an alpha in it; in the same manner he is thought to have proceeded
                    through the whole work, leaving out in each book that letter by which the number
                    of it was distinguished.” The fantastic plan of this poem is well known to the
                    English reader, from one of Addison’s papers on false wit, Spectator, No. 50.
                    All the works of Tryphiodorus have however perished, with the exception of his
                    poem on the destruction of Troy, 'I <hi rend="italic">λίου</hi> "A <hi
                    rend="italic">λωσις</hi>, which consists of 681 hexameter verses.</p>
                <p>The first edition of this poem was printed by Aldus, in an octavo volume which
                    has no date, and which likewise includes the two poems of Quintus Calaber and
                    Coluthus. That of Tryphiodorus was reprinted in several collections, and not
                    unfrequently in a separate form. An edition, accompanied with a translation into
                    Latin verse, and some annotations, was published by Jamotius, Lutet. 1557, 8vo.
                    The poem was afterwards published with a double version, in prose and verse, by
                    N. Frischlinus, and the castigations of Rhodomannus, Francof. 1588, 4to. The
                    Greek text was edited by II. Rumpitis, Hamb. 1617, 8vo. A good edition,
                    containing the metrical version of Frischlinus, and the select notes of previous
                    editors, added to some of his own, was published by James Merrick, Oxon. 8vo. He
                    likewise translated the poem into English verse, and besides adding copious
                    notes, prefixed an elaborate “Dissertation on the Life and Writings of
                    Tryphiodorus.” The <hi rend="italic">imprimatur</hi> of his version is dated in
                    1739, that of the Greek and Latin edition in 1741; but no date appears in either
                    of the title-pages. The Greek text, with a Latin version, Salvini’s translation
                    into Italian verse, and select annotations, was edited by Bandini, Florent.
                    1765, 8vo. Another edition of Tryphiodorus was accompanied with a poetical
                    translation into Italian verse by A. T. di Villa, Modena, 1774, 8vo. Two
                    editions, with various illustrations, were published by Thomas Northmore, Lond.
                    1791, 8vo, Lond. 1804,: vo. A splendid edition, including a few emendations and
                    critical notes, was more recently superintended by Schafer, Lipsiae, 1808,
