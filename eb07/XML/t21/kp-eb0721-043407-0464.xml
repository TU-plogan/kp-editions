                    >Printing</hi> the reader will find that the invention of the art of
                    type-founding was a very early consequence of the discovery of the rude art of
                    taking impressions from laboriously excised letters of wood and metal; and that
                    after an investigation of the statements of various authors, the honour of the
                    invention has been given to the illustrious partnership of Gutenberg, Fust, and
                    Schaeffer, the larger share being allowed to the latter, as having had practice
                    in the design and proportioning of letters in his original employment of an
                    illuminator; that the place of the invention was the city of Mentz, and that the
                    time was about the year 1457. Nor, upon examination, will it appear that any
                    other can dispute the honour with these worthies, inasmuch as they indisputably
                    used cast metal types before <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=465" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0465-0435"
                    />the secession of Gutenberg from his associates, and consequently before the
                    dispersion of their workmen by the capture of Mentz in the year 1462; nor will
                    the claims of Koster of Haarlem in any case interfere with these, the most
                    sanguine of his supporters carrying his pretensions no farther than the art of
                    taking impressions from excised characters of wood, of lead, and lastly of tin.
                    The necessity of some improvement upon the original method of forming types,
                    even on the very limited scale upon which the first efforts of typography were
                    conducted, must be obvious, and it appears to have advanced in a natural and
                    rapid course. The first step seems to have been the striking of a letter of
                    approved cut, answering in some degree to the modern punch, into soft clay or
                    plaster, and the infusion of metal into the mould thus formed; the shaft or <hi
                    rend="italic">body,</hi> which by so rude and uncertain a method must
                    necessarily have been rough and untrue, being dressed into correctness by manual
                    labour. The art of casting and working metals, however, being at that time by no
                    means defective, and Fust being by profession a worker in gold and silver, it is
                    probable that a process not unlike the modern was soon invented; but of this we
                    have no certain evidence, the whole art of printing being carefully kept a
                    “mystery” by the initiated until about half a century after the probable date of
                    the invention.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A copy of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Speculum Humanae Salvationis,</hi> in the library of the
                    late duke of Marlborough, presents probably the earliest specimen of cast types;
                    twenty-five of its leaves being printed from solid wooden blocks, or perhaps
                    from wooden blocks on which the designs have been so cut that the scrolls, cut
                    upon other blocks, were inserted in spaces left for them; while, in thirty-eight
                    leaves, the scrolls are in cast type, inserted in the designs in lieu of the
                    engraved scrolls.</p></note> This evidence is afforded ns by the device of
                    Badius Ascensius, an eminent printer of Paris and Lyon in the beginning of the
                    sixteenth century, and also by that of an English printer, Anthony Scoloker of
                    lppeswych, who modified and adopted the device of Ascensius, as indeed did many
                    other printers of various countries. This curious design exhibits in one
                    apartment the various processes of printing, the foreground presenting a press
                    in full work, the background on the left the cases and the compositor, and on
                    the right the foundery; the matrix and other appliances bearing a precise
                    resemblance to those at present in use. This introduces to observation the fact
                    that the earlier printers generally combined all the various processes of their
                    profession in their own offices, although it would appear, that as the art
                    spread over Europe, and secrecy became less and less necessary, the most
                    enterprising speedily began to furnish their distant brethren with types from
                    their respective founderies. Thus it would appear that the first types of the
                    English architypographer Caxton were supplied by Ulric Zell, and that it was not
                    until the establishment of his printing-house at Westminster that he began to
                    cut letter in imitation of his own hand-writing, and more agreeable to the
                    fashion of writing at that time in use in England. Lettou and Machlinia are
                    supposed to have purchased their types from foreign founderies, perhaps from
                    Lyon or Milan. But Wynkyn de Worde discarded that jealousy which had hitherto
                    obstructed the progress of the art in England, and having cut many founts of
                    considerable beauty, supplied his contemporary typographers. His black letter in
                    especial was so much esteemed as to have been in use to a very late period, and
                    it is said that remnants of his founts are to be found in some of the most
                    ancient printing establishments; nay, it is even possible that some of his
                    original punches or matrices might yet by a diligent antiquary be discovered—a
                    valuable and interesting addition to our many curious relics of the art.</p>
                <p>The first record of the separation of the art of type-founding from that of
                    printing, would appear to be a decree of the star-chamber in the reign of
                    Charles I., dated 11th July 1637. This was probably one of the attempts to
                    suppress the printing of seditious works by the rising puritans, who, after
                    establishing secret printing-offices in various parts of the kingdom, found it
                    necessary for secrecy to cut their founts themselves. The decree seems to have
                    been in some degree a revival of one of the same nature, 28 Elizabeth, limiting
                    the number of printers to twenty. By the first-mentioned decree it was
                    ordered,</p>
                <p>That there shall be four founders of letters for printing, and no more.</p>
                <p>That the archbishop of Canterbury, or the bishop of London, with six other high
                    commissioners, shall supply the places of those four as they shall become
                    void.</p>
                <p>That no master founder shall keep above two apprentices at one time.</p>
                <p>That all journeymen founders be employed by the masters of the trade, and that
                    idle journeymen be compelled to work upon pain of imprisonment, and such other
                    punishment as the court shall think fit.</p>
                <p>That no master founder of letters shall employ any other person in any work
                    belonging to the easting and founding of letters than freemen or apprentices to
                    the trade, save only in pulling off the knots of metal hanging at the end of the
                    letters when they are first cast, in which work every master founder may employ
                    one boy only not bound to the trade.</p>
                <p>The four founders app∙inted by this decree to serve the whole kingdom were John
                    Grismand, Thomas Wright, Arthur Nicholas, and Alexander Fi(ield.</p>
                <p>This decree was revived 14th Charles IL, renewed 16th Charles II., and again for
                    seven years 1st James II., at which term it expired, and was never renewed.</p>
                <p>The founts in use in English printing-offices may be divided into two kinds;
                    those used for hook, and those for job printing, that is, hand and posting
                    bills, &amp;c. Of book types there are twelve regular bodies, viz. Great Primer,
                    English, Pica, Small Pica, Long Primer, Bourgeois, Brevier, Minion, Nonpareil,
                    Ruby, Pearl, and Diamond. Besides these, Minion-Nonpareil is a good deal used;
                    and some founders have introduced intermediate founts, as Emerald.</p>
                <p>It is much to be regretted that no uniform standard has been adopted by
                    letter-founders for their founts of the same-named letter; they vary not only
                    from those of other founders. but even from their own, owing to which it seldom
                    happens that any two founts <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> together. This is the
                    cause of much inconvenience, as in the instance of capitals and small capitals,
                    accented letters, signs, and other sorts introduced into common matter; the
                    printer being obliged to purchase a small quantity of each with every fount,
                    whereas, were there any uniformity, he might have a considerable quantity to be
                    used with any fount as occasion required.</p>
                <p>Great Primer (Fr. <hi rend="italic">Gros Romain;</hi> Ger. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tertia)</hi> is the largest type in use in book printing, being chiefly for
                    large Bibles, on which account it is sometimes called Bible Text; but it is very
                    seldom employed. There are about 51¼ ms to a foot: it is double the body of
                    Bourgeois.</p>

                    The French name is probably derived from its being first used to print the works
                    of St Augustin; the German from its being the middle of seven standard founts
                    used by the early German printers. There are about 64 ms to a foot: its body is
                    equal to two Minions.</p>
                <p>Pica (Fr. and Ger. <hi rend="italic">Cicero,</hi> from its having been first used
                    for Cicero’s Epistles) is the fount which is used as the general standard of
                    measurement in casting leads, quotations, cutting rule, and regulating the price
                    of press-work, &amp;c. It is in very extensive use for works of a standard <pb

                    equal to two Nonpareils.</p>
                <p>Small Pica (Fr. <hi rend="italic">Philosophie;</hi> Ger. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brevier)</hi> is perhaps the most extensively used of all the founts, being a
                    very useful and well-proportioned letter. Novels are almost always printed in
                    this body. 83 ms to a foot; equal to two Rubies.</p>
                <p>Long Primer (Fr. <hi rend="italic">Perit Romain;</hi> Ger. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Corpus)</hi> is likewise much used, being very well adapted for works in 12mo,
                    dictionaries, and other works in which much matter is to be got into a small
                    space: it is the type of the Waverley Novels and of this Encyclopaedia. 89 ms to

                <p>Bourgeois (Fr. <hi rend="italic">Gaillarde;</hi> the Germans have none to
                    correspond) is much used for the same purposes as Long Primer, and in solid
                    matter is difficult to distinguish by the eye from that body. 102 ms to a foot:

                    much used for printing breviaries. It is much employed for small works, and for

                <p>Diamond (Fr. and Ger. <hi rend="italic">Diamond)</hi> is the smallest body cut;
                    it is distressingly small, and is used mostly for notes to works in Nonpareil
                    and the descending bodies. The French have succeeded in cutting the face so
                    small as to be illegible, and an annual lately sold in London in this letter is
                    accompanied with a magnifying glass. 205 ms = 1 foot: half Bourgeois.</p>
                <p>The principal apparatus in the casting of type are the punch, the matrix, and the
                    mould. The punch (or puncheon) is a piece of steel bearing upon one end a single
                    letter, which is formed by hammering, filing, and other processes, and differs
                    in no other respect from ordinary punches than the unusual care and accuracy
                    with which it is worked. It must be remembered, that as each letter is but one
                    of a large number with which it is to harmonize, the height must be obtained
                    with the greatest precision, the breadth both of the heavy and the fine strokes
                    must be carefully proportioned, the turns graceful. This general harmony is not
                    very difficult to attain in the coarser fancy tvpe, there being in this, as in
                    other arts, little merit in imitating the vulgar or the grotesque; but the
                    elegant and symmetrical face of book type is as difficult to attain as the
                    exquisite grace of the higher productions of the arts; and yet, to such
                    perfection have modern artists attained, that the practised eye has little
                    difficulty in assigning an individual letter to its proper fount, and even, if
                    the printer has turned his attention to the particulars of his art, to the
                    foundery and the artist, the punch-cutter of a foundery of character having a
                    professional reputation, like a painter or engraver. Mr Moxon, a mechanician of
                    great ingenuity, in his Mechanical Exercises, has the credit of first assigning
                    rules for the shaping of letters, laying down geometrical rules for the angles
                    of inclination, the curves, and for adjusting the base from which the shoulders
                    of the letter should rise to obtain the greatest strength. From this the modern
                    artists have varied, obtaining great sharpness of appearance combined with
                    strength and durability. Although beyond a doubt Mr Moxon’s formulae have been
                    of great advantage to subsequent punch-cutters, he was by no means a successful
                    artist himself; his type, cut upon the most philosophical principles, being
                    uglier than that of his contemporaries. The matrix is a small piece of copper
                    into which the punch is struck. Much care is also requisite in doing this,
                    although, provided it be struck sufficiently deep, the surface of the copper may
                    be filed down so as to leave the impress of the exact depth. It has been
                    explained in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Printing</hi>, that to obtain
                    equality of impression the face of the composed type must be in an exact plane,
                    from which it will be easily understood that the just depth of the impression in
                    the matrix is a matter of much importance. The copper must now be carefully
                    dressed at the ends and sides, in order that when adjusted in the mould, the
                    character, when cast, may be so placed upon its body that it shall stand exactly
                    even with its brother characters: the nicety required in this is surprising.</p>
                <p>The mould is a very simple but very ingenious apparatus, consisting of two parts,
                    so contrived that, being properly placed together (viz. <hi rend="italic">a</hi>

                    rend="italic">e,</hi> a space, which is geometrically described as a
                    parallelopiped, being, in fact, the mould in which the type is formed; the
                    matrix <hi rend="italic">f</hi> is placed at the bottom; the metal is poured in
                    at the orifice formed by the closing of the upper parts. It will be seen that
                    the two parts which form the mould slide upon each other, and that the extent to
                    which they close is regulated by the width of the matrix; and that therefore all
                    types of one fount, whether the broad 4-m quadrat or the narrow i or 1, may be
                    cast in the same mould. The spring at the bottom of figure 2 retains the matrix
                    in its place, and without removing it the rew letter cannot be disengaged; the
                    hooks at the top are used to remove the letter from the mould. <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> is an enlarged drawing of the matrix.</p>
                <p>The caster, with this apparatus, stations himself by the side of a furnace
                    containing the melting pot and the fluid metal, of which he takes a portion with
                    a very small ladle, and having poured in a sufficient quantity, jerks the mould
                    into the air with his left hand (a very singular movement), which has the effect
                    of expelling the air and forcing the metal into the finest strokes of the
                    matrix. He then with one finger releases the spring, separates the mould, and
                    hooks out the letter with one of the pieces of bent wire represented at the top
                    of the mould; and so proceeds with considcrable rapidity, casting about 500
                    letters in the hour, of ordinary sized type, although the smaller and the larger
                    <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=467"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0467-0437"/>sizes require much more time, the first on account
                    of the care requisite, and the latter to allow of the setting of the metal.</p>
                <p>The types are now removed from the caster’s table by a boy, who strikes off the
                    knob at the bottom, caused by the superfluous metal at the orifice of the mould.
                    A workman next rubs the sides of each letter upon a slab of very gritty stone
                    (his fingers being guarded by a piece of leather), which removes any small knobs
                    or globules attached to the sides or edges. This is done with great rapidity,
                    from 1500 to 2000 letters being rubbed in an hour. The letters are then set up
                    in a long stick, and again dressed, and the bottom grooved, by which exact
                    height is insured; and the fount being then proportioned, is tied up, and is
                    ready for the printer.</p>
                <p>The matrix for very large type is differently prepared, the nicety of the
                    punch-cutter’s art not being required. The letter having been accurately shaped
                    out by rule and compass upon a piece of copper or brass, the part so marked out
                    is cut away, care being taken to cut the back somewhat wider than the front, the
                    sloping edge forming the shoulder of the future type. The piece of brass now
                    very much resembles the plates used for stencilling the large headings of legal
                    forms: it is next riveted upon a smooth surface of brass, which forms the face
                    of the letter.</p>
                <p>There is a peculiarity in script type which is deserving of mention. Script being
                    an imitation of hand-writing, it is necessary that the fine strokes at the
                    beginning and end of each letter should be in close contact with those of the
                    preceding and succeeding letters. This M. Didot endeavoured to achieve by a very
                    curious shape in the type, by which each should so lock in with the other that
                    the required contact should not fail; but he carried his invention beyond the
                    power of practice, for having resolved the characters into their component
                    parts, he cast a series of signs exactly resembling the “pothooks and hangers”
                    of a schoolboy’s copy-book, so that not only was every word to be composed, but
                    every letter:</p>
                <p>The English founders soon improved upon this idea, casting each letter complete.
                    This however requires several letters to be cast in several forms, the initial,
                    medial, and final letters not being always quite alike. The following will give
                    an idea of how script is cast and composed:</p>
                <p>Most of the English type-founders, aware of the practical defects of this method,
                    have, by a careful adjustment of the fine strokes at the beginning and end of
                    each letter, cut founts upon the ordinary square body, which answer every
                    purpose. From the nature of the metal, however, and its liability to wear and
                    become battered, script is an expensive fount. <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.
