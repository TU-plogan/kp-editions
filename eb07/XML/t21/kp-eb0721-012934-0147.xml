                    the tea-plant would grow, or where it could be cultivated and manufactured.
                    Recent investigations, however, have dissipated this delusion. It has been found
                    that the Japanese and the Brazilians as well as the Chinese have cultivated tea
                    with success; and, what is of the utmost importance to Britain, it has lately
                    been discovered beyond all doubt that the tea-shrub is indigenous in our Indian

                    Chinese frontier province of Yunnam. For this most important and valuable
                    discovery we are chiefly indebted to the indefatigable researches of Captain
                    Jenkins, Lieutenant Charlton, and C. A. Bruce, Esq.</p>
                <p>Mr Abel the botanist, who accompanied Lord Amherst upon his embassy to China,
                    says,—</p>
                <p>“The green-tea districts in the province of Keang-nan are embraced between the
                    29th and 31st degrees of north latitude, and are situated on the north-western
                    base of a ridge of mountains which divide the provinces of Keang-nan and
                    Keang-see.</p>
                <p>“The black-tea districts in the province of Fo Kien are contained between the
                    27th and 28th degrees of north latitude, and are situated on the S. E.
                    declivities of a ridge of mountains, dividing the province of Fo Kien from that
                    of Keang-nan. Thus the whole range of the great districts of China from which
                    Europe is supplied with tea, from the highest to the lowest degree of latitude,
                    is from 31° to 27°. According to the missionaries, the tea-plant thrives io the
                    more northern provinces, as at Pekin; and from Kempfer, it would appear that it
                    is cultivated in Japan as far as 45° north.</p>
                <p>“From every account given of the tea-plant, it succeeds best on the sides of
                    mountains, where there can be little accumulation of vegetable mould; our
                    opportunities of seeing its cultivation were few, but were all in favour of this
                    conclusion. The plantations were always at some elevation above the plains, in a
                    kind of gravelly soil, formed in some places by disintegrated sandstone, and in
                    others by the debris of primitive rocks. A large and flourishing plantation of
                    all the varieties of the tea-plant (brought together by Mr Bell, the principal
                    tea-inspector at Canton) is situated on an island close to Macao, in a loose,
                    gravelly soil, formed by the disintegration of large grained granite. Judging
                    from the specimens collected in our route through the province of Keang-nan,
                    whence the green tea is provided, the rocks consist chiefly of sandstone,
                    schistus, and granite. As to the precise nature of the rocks of the black-tea
                    country in the province of Fo Kien, I have no exact information; but as the
                    great ridge, separating that province from Keang-see, is a continuation of one
                    separating the latter from Canton, it is perhaps legitimate to conclude, that
                    their constituent rocks are the same, and that the hills and soil on the eastern
                    side are the same as we found them on the western side of the ridge, and that
                    they are covered by a soil like that in which the camellia flourishes; the
                    vegetation chiefly consists of the same kind of plants. But the success of the
                    American plantations proves that the tea-plant will flourish within the tropics;
                    and that it will grow vigorously within them, is proved by the fine plants in
                    Sir H. Low’s plantations at St Helena.”</p>
                <p>In China the hills on which tea is cultivated are not high, and the plantations
                    where the soil is favourable extend over their entire face from the summit to
                    the base. The difference of the temperature from that of the adjacent plains is
                    scarcely perceptible; but it is on the nature of the soil that the quality of
                    the tea principally depends. Rain falls in March and April in moderate showers,
                    and the atmosphere is extremely moist; the finest leaves appear at this time,
                    and are plucked early in April. In May the rain is very heavy, and the leaves
                    begin to be of inferior quality.</p>
                <p>The seeds are put into the ground towards the end of February, or early in March,
                    and spring up almost immediately. The plants stand about three feet and a half
                    distant from each other. They require scarcely any manure; only at first a
                    little mud or thick mucilage is applied to each plant. No other tree is planted
                    among the tea-shrubs, but they are propped up with bamboos. Seedlings of one
                    year’s growth, if too thick, are thinned; but their leaves are not used for two
                    years. After this the leaves of every plant are gathered three times a year,
                    young and old indiscriminately. The gatherers and the driers of the tea are
                    quite distinct classes, the wages of the former being from fivepence to
                    sevenpence of our money per day, while some of the latter receive as much as 200
                    dollars for the season. A man can gather about fifteen pounds of tea-leaves per
                    day; the price of labour in India being only from twopence to threepence per
                    day. Should the plantations which have been commenced in that quarter succeed,
                    the teas of Assam should be procured at one half the cost of those of China.</p>
                <p>The districts of India in which the native tea has been discovered, he between
                    94° and 96° of east longitude, and 26° and 28° of north latitude. Muttuck, which
                    is to the south of the Delree river, is a country that abounds in tea, and it
                    might be made one extensive beautiful tea-garden; and were the hills and valleys
                    of Assam all cultivated, they would be sufficient to supply the immense demand
                    of Britain.</p>
                <p>The tea-plant, which is an evergreen, grows in China to the height of from three
                    to six feet, but seldom more than three. The plants which have been discovered
                    in Assam are much taller. Mr Bruce relates, that in going over one of the low
                    hills behind Jeypore, he came upon a tea-tract which must have been two or three
                    miles in length, on which the wild tea trees were as thick as they could grow;
                    and one of them he found to be three feet in circumference and about sixty feet
                    in height, but this was an extraordinary instance: and he is of opinion that the
                    effect of regularly cultivating the plants in tea-gardens, transplanting and
                    trimming them, and plucking off all the young leaves from month to month as soon
                    as they appear, will tend to stunt and shorten the growth, so that they will not
                    generally rise higher than in China.</p>
                <p>The tea-plants in Assam have in general been found to thrive best near small
                    rivers and pools of water, and in those places where, after heavy falls of rain,
                    quantities of water have accumulated and cut out for themselves numerous small
                    channels. In Assam the wild tea-plants are never met with growing in the sun,
                    but invariably under the shade in thick woods or jungle.</p>
                <p>The following extracts are from Mr Bruce’s Report on the Tea Plantations in
                    Assam.</p>
                <p>“With respect to the tea-plant being most productive on high or low ground. I
                    cannot well say, as all our tracts are on the plains; but from what little I
                    have seen of the hill tracts, I should suppose they were not more productive. In
                    China, the hill tracts produce the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> teas, and they
                    may do the same here. Almost all my tracts on the plains are nearly on the same
                    level, I should think. <hi rend="italic">Nudwa,</hi> perhaps, is a little higher
                    than <hi rend="italic">Tingri,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tingri</hi> a little
                    higher than <hi rend="italic">Kahung;</hi> but I believe they are equally
                    productive» although, if I leaned towards any side with ray limited experience,
                    I should say that the low land, such as at <hi rend="italic">Kaung,</hi> which
                    is not so low as ever to be inundated by the strongest rise in the river, is the
                    best. The plants seem to love and court moisture, not from stagnant pools, but
                    running streams. The <hi rend="italic">Kahung</hi> tracts have the water in and
                    around them; they are all in heavy tree-jungles, which makes it very expensive
                    to clear them. An extent of 300 yards by 300 will cost from 200 to 300 rupees
                    (from L 20 to L.30); <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> according to the manner in
                    which the miserable opium-smoking Assamese work....Last season it was with the
                    greatest difficulty that I could get a sufficient number of hands to gather the
                    leaves. The plucking of the leaves may appear to many a very easy and light
                    employment, but there are not a few of our coolies who would much rather be
                    employed on any other job. The standing in one position so many hours occasions
                    swellings in the legs, as our plants are not like those of China, only three
                    feet high, but double that size, so that one must stand upright to gather the
                    leaves. The Chinese pluck theirs squatting down. We He under a great
                    disadvantage in not having regular men to pluck the leaves; those that have been
                    taught to do so, can pluck twice as many as those that have not; and we can
                    seldom get hold of the same men two seasons running. 1 am of opinion that our
                    trees will become of a smaller and more convenient size after a few years’
                    cultivation; because, trimming of the plants, and taking all the young leaves as
                    soon as they appear, month after month, and year after year, and the plants
                    being deprived of the rich soil they had been living on from time unknown, must
                    soon tell upon them. Transplanting also helps to stunt and shorten the growth of
                    these plants. The Chinese declared to me, that the China plants now at <hi
                    rend="italic">Deenjoy</hi> would never have attained to half the perfection they
                    now have under ten years in their own country.</p>
                <p>“I may here observe, that the sun has a material effect on the leaves; for as
                    soon as the trees that shade the plants are removed, the leaf, from a fine deep
                    green, begins to turn into a yellowish colour, which it retains for some months,
                    and then again gradually changes to a healthy green, but now becomes thicker,
                    and the plant throws out far more numerous leaves than when in the shade. The
                    more the leaves are plucked, the greater number of them are produced. If the
                    leaves of the first crop were not gathered, you might look in vain for the
                    leaves of the second crop. The tea made from the leaves in the shade is not near
                    so good as that from leaves exposed to the sun; the leaves of plants in the sun
                    are much earlier in season than of those in the shade; the leaves from the shady
                    tract give out a more watery liquid when rolled, and those from the sunny a more
                    glutinous substance. When the leaves of either are rolled on a sunny day, they
                    emit less of this liquid than on a rainy day. This juice decreases as <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=149"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0149-0131"/> the season advances. The plants in the sun have
                    flowers and fruit much earlier than those in the shade, and are far more
                    numerous; they have flowers and seeds in July, and fruit in November. Numerous
                    plants are to be seen, that, by some accident, either cold or rain, have lost
                    all their flowers, and commence throwing out fresh flower-buds more abundantly
                    than ever. Thus it is not unfrequent to see some plants in flower so late as
                    March (some of the China plants were in flower in ApriD, bearing at once the old
                    and the new seeds, flower-buds, and full-blown flowers,—all at one and the same
                    time. The rain also greatly affects the leaves, for some sorts of tea cannot be
                    made in a rainy day; for instance the <hi rend="italic">Pouchong</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Mingehew.</hi> The leaves for these ought to be collected about 10
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a. m.</hi> on a sunny morning, when the dew has evaporated.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Pouchong</hi> can only be manufactured from the leaves of
                    the first crop; but the <hi rend="italic">Mingehew</hi> although it requires the
                    same care in making as the other, can yet be made from any crop, provided it is
                    made on a sunny morning. The Chinese dislike gathering leaves on a rainy day for
                    any description of tea, and never will do so unless necessity requires it. Some
                    pretend to distinguish the tea made on a rainy and on a sunny day, much in the
                    same manner as they can distinguish the shady from the sunny teas—by their
                    inferiority. If the large leaves for the black tea were collected on a rainy
                    day, about seven seers, or fourteen pounds, of green leaves would be required to
                    make one seer, or two pounds, of tea: but if collected on a sunny day, about
                    four seers, or eight pounds, of green leaves, would make one seer, or two
                    pounds, of tea;—so the Chinamen say. I tried the experiment, and found it to be
                    correct. Our season for tea-making generally commences about the middle of
                    March, the second crop in the middle of May, the third crop about the first of
                    July; but the tune varies according to the rains setting in sooner or later.· As
                    the manufacture of the <hi rend="italic">Sychee</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mingehew</hi> black teas has never been described, I will here attempt to give
                    some idea how it is performed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“Sychee</hi> Black Tea.—The leaves of this are the <hi
                    rend="italic">Souchong</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pou-chong.</hi> After they
                    have been gathered and dried in the sun in the usual way, they are beaten and
                    put away four different times; they are then put into baskets, pressed down, and
                    a cloth put over them. When the leaves become of a brownish colour by the heat,
                    they throw out and have a peculiar smell, and are then ready for the pan, the
                    bottom of which is made red-hot. This pan is fixed in masonry breast high, and
                    in a sloping position, forming an angle of forty degrees. Thus the pan being
                    placed on an inclined plane, the leaves when tossed about in it cannot escape
                    behind, or on the sides, as it is built high up, but fall out near the edge
                    close to the manufacturer, and always into his hands, so as to be swept out
                    easily. When the bottom of this pan has been made red-hot by a wood fire, the
                    operator puts a cloth to his mouth, to prevent inhaling any of the hot vapour. A
                    man on the left of him stands ready with a basket of prepared leaves; one or two
                    men stand on his right with dollahs, or shallow baskets, to receive the leaves
                    from the pan. and another keeps lifting the hot leaves thrown out of the pan
                    into the dollah, that they may quickly cool. At a given signal from the
                    Chinaman, the person with the basket of prepared leaves seizes a handful and
                    dashes it as quick as thought into the red-hot pan. The Chinaman tosses and
                    turns the crackling leaves in the pan for half a minute, then draws them all out
                    by seizing a few leaves in each hand, using them by way of a brush, not one
                    being left behind. They are all caught by the man with the dollah or basket,
                    who, with his disengaged hand, continues lifting the leaves and letting them
                    fall again, that they may quickly cool. Should a leaf be left behind in the pan
                    by any accident, the cloth that is held ready in the mouth is applied to brush
                    it out; but all this is done as quick as lightning. The man that holds the
                    basket of leaves watches the process sharply; for no sooner is the last leaf out
                    of the pan, than he dashes in another handful, so that, to an observer at a
                    little distance, it appears as if one man was dashing the leaves in, and the
                    other as faβt dashing them out again—so quickly and dexterously is this managed.
                    As soon as one basket has received about four handsful of the hot leaves from
                    the pan, it is removed, and another basket placed to receive the leaves; and so
                    on, until all is finished. A roaring wood fire is kept up under the pan, to keep
                    the bottom red-hot, as the succession of fresh leaves tends greatly to cool the
                    pan. which ought always to be scrubbed and washed out after the process is over.
                    In China these pans are made of cast iron, and if great care is not taken, they
                    will crack in the cooling; to prevent which, one man keeps tapping the inside of
                    the edge of the pan briskly with a wet broom, used in the cleaning of the
                    vessel, while another pours cold water in gently; thus it cools in a few
                    seconds, and is ready for another batch of tea. The leaves are rolled and
                    tatched the same us the other teas, and put into the drying basket for about ten
                    minutes. When a little dry, people are employed to work and press the leaves in
                    the bands in small quantities, of about one and half to two rupees’ weight at a
                    time, for about half a minute; they are then put into small square pieces of
                    paper, and rolled up; after this they are put into the drying basket, and
                    permitted to dry slowly over a gentle fire for some hours, until the whole is
                    thoroughly dry. This tea is not sold in the China market; it is used principally
                    as offerings to the priests, or kept for high days and holidays. It is said to
                    be a very fine tea, and there is not one man in a hundred who can make it
                    properly.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pouchong</hi> tea is made in the same way as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sychee,</hi> with this exception, that it is not formed into
                    balls.</p>

                    >(Pouchong)</hi> are plucked and dried in the sun, and are then beaten and dried
                    in the shade for half an∙hour. This is done three successive rimes, and the
                    leaves are very much shaken by a circular morion given to them in a sieve, so as
                    to keep them rolling and tumbling about in the centre of it This treatment
                    continues until they are very soft; they are then allowed to remain for a short
                    time. The contents of the first sieve are then placed in the centre of a
                    close-worked bamboo basket, with a narrow edge, and the leaves are divided into
                    four equal parts. The contents of the second sieve are placed in another bamboo
                    basket like the former, and this basket is placed on the top of the first, and
                    so on, piling one basket upon another, until all is finished ;—there may be
                    about two pounds of leaves in each basket. The red-hot pan is used the same as
                    in <hi rend="italic">Sychee,</hi> only now the men cast in one division of the
                    leaves into the basket, and this is tumbled and tossed about in the red-hot pan
                    like a plaything for about thirty seconds, and then swept out; another division
                    is cast in, and so on, until all the prepared baskets have been emptied. The
                    contents of each basket are still kept separate, by placing the leaves, when
                    they come out of the pan, in separate baskets. The whole is a brisk and lively
                    scene, and quite methodical, every one knowing his station, and the part he has
                    to perform. The baskets are then arranged on shelves to air; the contents are
                    afterwards tatched the same as our black teas, and fired in the drying baskets,
                    but with this difference, that each division is placed on paper and dried. When
                    it is half dry (the same as our teas), it is put away for the night, and the
                    next morning it is picked, and put into the drying baskets over gentle deadened
                    fires, and gradually dried there; it is then packed hot. This tea is a difficult
                    sort to make.</p>

                    and in tatching roll the leaves occasionally in the pan, and spread them all
                    round the sides of the same; again roll them until they begin to have a withered
                    and soft appearance, then spread them on large sieves, and put them in the shade
                    to air for the night; next morning pick, and then fire them well. Some
                    tea-makers do not keep them all night, but manufacture and pack the tea the same
                    day. This tea is valued in China, as it is very scarce; but the Chinamen
                    acknowledge that it is not a good sort. They prefer the teas the leaves of which
                    are come to maturity.”</p>
                <p>As the green-tea Chinamen have just commenced operations, I will try to give some
                    account of this most interesting process. All leaves up to the size of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Souchong</hi> are taken for the green tea. About three pounds of
                    the fresh leaves, immediately they are brought in, are cast into a hot pan
                    (sometimes they are kept overnight when abundance have been brought in, and we
                    have not been able to work all up); they are then rolled and tossed about in the
                    pan, until they become too hot for the hand. Two slips of bamboo, each about a
                    foot long, split at one end so as to form six prongs, are now used to tumble and
                    toss the leaves about, by running the sticks down the sides of the pan, and
                    turning the leaves up, first with the right hand, then with the left, and this
                    as fast as possible; which keeps the leaves rolling about in the pan without
                    being burnt: this lasts about three minutes; the leaves will then admit of being
                    rolled and pressed without breaking. They are now taken from the pan, and rolled
                    in dol-lahs, much the same as the black tea, for about three minutes, in which
                    process a great quantity of the juice is extracted, if they be fresh leaves; but
                    if they have been kept over night, very little juice can be expressed from them
                    in the morning, on account of its having evaporated. The Chinamen say this does
                    not matter, as it makes no difference in the tea. The leaves are then pressed
                    hard between both hands, and turned round and pressed again and again, until
                    they have taken the shape of a small pyramid. They are now placed in bamboo
                    baskets or dollahs with a narrow edge, and the dollahs or bamboo frame-work,
                    where they are exposed to the sun for two or three minutes, after which these
                    pyramids of tea are gently opened, and thinly spread on the dollahs to dry. When
                    the tea has become a little dry (which will be the case in five or ten minutes
                    if the sun be hot), it is again rolled, and then placed in the sun as before;
                    this is done three successive times. But should the weather be rainy, and there
                    is no hope of its clearing, all this drying is done over the fire in a small
                    drying basket, the same as with black tea. The green tea makers have as great an
                    aversion to drying their tea over the fire as the black-tea makers. The third
                    time it has been rolled and dried, there is very little moisture left in the
                    tea. It is now put into a hot pan. and gently turned over and over, and opened
                    out occasionally, until all has become well heated; it is then tossed out into a
                    basket, and while hot, put into a very strong bag, previously prepared for it,
                    about four feet long, and four spans in circumference. Into this bag the tea is
                    pressed with great force with the hands and feet; from fourteen to twenty pounds
                    being put in at one time, and forced into as small a compass as possible. With
                    his left hand the man firmly closes the mouth of the bag immediately above the
                    leaves, while with the right baud be pommels and beats the bag, every now and
                    then giving <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=150"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0150-0132"/>it a turn. Thus he beats, and turns, and works at
                    it, tightening it by every turn with one band, and holding on with the other,
                    until he has squeezed the leaves into a? small a compass as possible at the end
                    of the bag. He now makes it fast by turns of the cloth where he held on, so that
                    it may not open, and then draws the cloth of the bag over the ball of leaves,
                    thus doubling the bag, the mouth of which is twisted and made fast. The man then
                    stands up, bolding on by a post or some such thing, and works this ball of
                    leaves under his feet, at the same time alternately pressing with all his
                    weight, first with one foot and then the other, turning the ball over and over,
                    and occasionally opening the bag to tighten it more firmly. When he has made it
                    almost as hard as a stone, he secures the mouth well, and puts the bag away for
                    that day. Next morning it is opened out, and the leaves gently separated and
                    placed on dollahs, then fired and dried until they are crisp, the same as the
                    black tea, after which they are packed in boxes or baskets. In China the baskets
                    are made of double bamboo, with leaves between. The tea may then remain on the
                    spot for two or three months, or be sent to any other place to receive the final
                    process. This first part of the green-tea process is so simple, that the natives
                    of this country readily pick it up in a month or two. The second process now
                    commences by opening the boxes or baskets, and exposing the tea on large shallow
                    bamboo baskets or dollahs, until it has become soft enough to roll, it is then
                    put into cast-iron pans set in brick fire-places, the same as described in
                    making the <hi rend="italic">Sychee</hi> black tea. The pan is made very hot by
                    a wood fire, and seven pounds of the leaves are thrown into it and rubbed
                    against the pan, with the right hand until tired, and then with the left, so as
                    not to make the process fatiguing. The pan being placed on an inclined plane,
                    the leaves always come tumbling back towards and near the operator, as he pushes
                    them up from him, moving his hands backwards and forwards and pressing on the
                    leaves with some force with the palms, keeping the ends of the fingers up to
                    prevent their coming in contact with the hot pan. After one hour’s good rubbing,
                    the leaves are taken out and thrown into a large coarse bamboo sieve, from this
                    into a finer one, and again still finer one, until three sorts of tea have been
                    separated. The first, or largest sort, is put into the funnel of the winnowing
                    machine, which has three divisions of small traps below, to let the tea out. A
                    man turns the wheel with his right hand, and with the left regulates the
                    quantity of tea that shall fall through the wooden funnel above, by a wooden
                    slide at the bottom of it The tea being thrown from the sieves into the funnel,
                    the man turns the crank of the wheel, and moves the slide of the funnel
                    gradually, so as to let the tea fall through gently, and in small quantities.
                    The blast from the fan blows the smaller particles of tea to the end of the
                    machine, where it is intercepted by a circular moveable board placed there. The
                    dust and smaller particles are blown against this board, and fall out at an
                    opening at the bottom into a basket placed there to receive it The next highest
                    tea is blown nearly to the end of the machine, and falls down through a trough
                    on the side into a basket *, this tea is called <hi rend="italic">Young
                    Hyson.</hi> The next being a little heavier, is not blown quite so far; it falls
                    through the same trough, which has a division in the middle: this of course is
                    near the centre of the machine. A basket is placed beneath to receive the tea,
                    which is called <hi rend="italic">Hyson.</hi> The next, which is still heavier,
                    falls very near to the end of the fan, this is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gunpowder</hi> Tea; it is in small balls. The heaviest tea falls still closer
                    to the fan, and is called <hi rend="italic">Big Gunpowder;</hi> it is twice or
                    three times the size of <hi rend="italic">Gunpowder</hi> tea, and composed of
                    several young leaves that adhere firmly together. This sort is afterwards put
                    into a box and cut with a sharp iron instrument, then sifted and put among the
                    <hi rend="italic">Gunpowder,</hi> which it now resembles. The different sorts of
                    tea are now put into shallow bamboo baskets, and men, women, and children are
                    employed to pick out the sticks and bad leaves; this is a most tedious process,
                    as the greatest care is taken not to leave the slightest particle of any thing
                    but good tea. But to assist and quicken this tiresome process, beautiful bamboo
                    sieves, very little inferior to our wire ones, and of various sizes, are
                    employed. The different teas are thrown into sieves of different sizes, from
                    large gunpowder to dust tea; they are shaken and tossed, and thrown from one
                    person to another in quick succession, making the scene very animating; in this
                    way a great portion of the stalks are got rid of. After the tea has been well
                    sifted and picked, it is again put into the hot pans, and rubbed and rolled as
                    before, for about one hour; it is then put into shallow bamboo baskets, and once
                    more examined, to separate the different teas that may still remain intermixed,
                    and again put into the hot pan. Now a mixture of sulphate of lime and indigo,
                    very finely pulverised and sifted through fine muslin, in the proportion of
                    unree of the former to one of the latter, is added; to a pan of tea containing
                    about seven pounds, about half a tea-spoonful of this mixture is put, and rubbed
                    and rolled along with the tea in the pan for about an hour, as before described.
                    The tea is then taken hot from the pan and packed firmly in boxes, both hands
                    and feet being used to press it down. The above mixture is not put to the tea to
                    improve its flavour, but merely to give it a uniform colour and appearance, as
                    without it some of the tea would be light and some dark. The indigo gives it the
                    colour, and the sulphate of lime fixes it. The Chinese call the former <hi
                    rend="italic">Youngtin,</hi> the latter <hi rend="italic">Acco,</hi> Large
                    gunpowder tea they call <hi rend="italic">Tycheu;</hi> little gunpowder, <hi

                <p>“The leaves of the green tea are not plucked the same as the black, although the
                    tree or plant is one and the same, which has been proved beyond a shadow of
                    doubt; for I am now plucking leaves for both green and black from the came tract
                    and from the same plants *, the difference lies in the manufacture, and nothing
                    else. The green-tea gatherers are accommodated with a small basket, each having
                    a strap passed round the neck, so as to let the basket hang on the breast. With
                    one hand the man holds the branch, and with the other plucks the leaf, one at a
                    time, taking as high as the <hi rend="italic">Souchong</hi> leaf; a little bit
                    of the lower end of the leaf is left for the young leaf to shoot up close to it;
                    not a bit of stalk must be gathered. This is a very slow and tedious way of
                    gathering. The black-tea maker plucks the tea with great rapidity with both
                    hands, using only the forefinger and thumb, and collects them in the hollow of
                    the hand; when his band is full he throws the leaves into a basket under the
                    shade of the tree; and so quickly does he ply his hands that the eye of a
                    learner cannot follow them, nor see the proper kind of leaf to be plucked; all
                    that he sees is the Chinaman’s hands going right and left, his hands fast
                    filling, and the leaves disappearing.... <hi rend="italic">Paho</hi> black tea
                    leaf would make green tea, some gunpowder, and some young hyson. <hi
                    rend="italic">Pouchong,</hi> although classed as a second black tea, on account
                    of the high price it fetches in the market, is a third-rate leaf, for it is
                    rather larger than the <hi rend="italic">Souchong.</hi> Some of it would make
                    young hyson, and some skin tea. <hi rend="italic">Souchong</hi> would make hyson
                    and young hyson. <hi rend="italic">Toychong</hi> would make skin tea. I will
                    here mention the different kinds of black teas, to make the matter more clear to
                    those who take an interest in the subject. <hi rend="italic">Thowung-Paho</hi>
                    (the <hi rend="italic">Sung fa</hi> is the same leaf as this) is the downy
                    little leaf not expanded, and the one next to it that has just unfolded a
                    little. This tea when made appears full of small white leaves, which are the
                    little downy leaves just mentioned. <hi rend="italic">Twazee Paho</hi> is from
                    the second crop, and nearly the same kind of tea, only a little older; the leaf
                    next the small downy one (being a little more expanded), and the small leaf
                    below this, are taken, making three in all: this has also numerous white leaves,
                    but not so many as the former. <hi rend="italic">Souchong</hi> is the next
                    largest leaf; this is well grown, but embraces all the leaves above it. When the
                    upper leaves have grown out of season for <hi rend="italic">Thowung-Paho and
                    Twazee-Ρaho,</hi> they are all plucked for the <hi rend="italic">Souchong</hi>
                    from the third and fourth of the upper leaves. From <hi rend="italic"
                    >Souchong</hi> leaves the <hi rend="italic">Minchong</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sychee</hi> teas are made in the first crop, and no other. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pouchong</hi> is the next largest leaf; it is a little older and larger than
                    the <hi rend="italic">Souchong.</hi> From this leaf the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sychee</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Minchong</hi> teas can be made in the first
                    crop only. The <hi rend="italic">Pouchong</hi> is never made in the second crop,
                    on account of its not having a good flavour; many of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Souchong</hi> leaves are mixed up in this tea. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Toychong</hi> leaves are those that are rejected from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Souchong</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pouchong,</hi> as being too large and not
                    taking the roll. When the teas are picked, these leaves are put on one side. The
                    Chinese often put them into a bag, and give them a twist, something in the green
                    tea way, and then mix them up with the <hi rend="italic">Souchong</hi> to add to
                    the weight. This leaf (<hi rend="italic">Toychong)</hi> becomes worse in the
                    second and third crops;—it is a cheap tea and sold to the poor. All the black
                    teas that are damaged have the flower of what the Chinese call <hi rend="italic"
                    >Qui</hi><hi rend="italic">fa</hi>, another called <hi rend="italic">Son
                    fa,</hi> mixed up with them. One pound of the flowers is put to each box of
                    damaged tea. After the teas have been well tatched and mixed up with other
                    sorts, these leaves give them a pleasant fragrance. The <hi rend="italic">Son
                    fa</hi> plant is about two feet high, and kept in flower-pots; it is propagated
                    from the roots. The <hi rend="italic">Qui fa</hi> plant is from three to four
                    feet high; one pound of the flowers is put to a box of tea. The plant was seen
                    in the Botanical Gardens at Calcutta by our Chinese interpreter. The flowers of
                    this plant are considered finer than those of the <hi rend="italic">Son
                    fa.”</hi></p>
                <p>“The black-tea makers Appear to me to be very arbitrary in their mode of
                    manufacture; sometimes they will take the leaves of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thowung-Paho,</hi> or perhaps <hi rend="italic">Twazet-Paho;</hi> but if it has
                    been raining, or there is any want of coolies to pluck the leaves quickly, or
                    from any other cause, they will let the leaves grow a few days longer, and turn
                    all into <hi rend="italic">Souchong;</hi> which, it must be remembered, takes
                    all the small leaves above it. If it is the first crop, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Souchong</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pouchong</hi> leaves may all be turned into
                    <hi rend="italic">Souchong</hi> tea; but even if it is the second crop, when the
                    <hi rend="italic">Pouchong</hi> leaves ought not to be gathered, they are
                    nevertheless plucked and mixed up with the <hi rend="italic">Souchong</hi>
                    leaves. Almost all our black and all the green teas have just been made from one
                    garden. When the green-tea makers complained that the leaves were beginning to
                    get too large for them—that is, they were fast growing out of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Souchong</hi> and running into <hi rend="italic">Pouchong</hi> —the black-tea
                    makers took up the manufacture, plucked all the leaves, and made excellent <hi
                    rend="italic">Pouchong;</hi> so that between the two there is not a leaf lost.
                    When the black-tea makers have a garden to themselves they are cruel pluckers,
                    for they almost strip the tree of leaves for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Souchong,</hi> and are not at all nice in the plucking; the third and even the
                    fourth leaf on a tender twig is nipped off in the twinkling of an eye; they then
                    look about for more young leaves, and away go the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pouchong,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Toychong</hi> too, which is the largest
                    leaf of all. But the green-tea men pluck quietly, one by one, down to <hi
                    rend="italic">Souchong.</hi> The black-tea men separate all their teas into

                    />the green-tea manufacturers make no distinction; they prepare all the tea they
                    can, throughout the season, box or basket it up, and when the season is over,
                    they set off for Canton with their produce; at least all those who do not wish

                    It now indiscriminately undergoes the second process; that is, the different
                    crops all are mixed up together. No old leaves can be mixed in the green, as in
                    the black teas; for the long rolling in the pan crushes them, and the fan blows
                    them away, so that only the young leaves are left.”—[Report on the Manufacture
                    of Tea, and the Tea Plantations in Assam, by C. A. Bruce, presented to the Tea
                    Committee, 10th June 1839.]</p>
                <p>Tea was introduced into Europe in the year 1610, by the Dutch East India Company.
                    It is generally said that it was first imported from Holland into England in
                    1666, by the Lords Arlington and Ossory. But that it was used in coffee-houses
                    before this period, appears from an act of parliament passed in 1660, in which a
                    duty of eightpence was laid on every gallon of the infusion sold in these
                    places; and from the following entry which appears in the Diary of Mr Pepys,
                    secretary to the Admiralty,—“September 25, 1661:</p>
                <p>I sent for a cup of tea (a Chinese drink), of which I never drunk before.” In
                    1664, the East India Company bought</p>
                <p>2 lbs. 2 oz. as a present to his majesty; and in 1667 they issued their first
                    order to their agent at Bantam, to send home 100 lbs. of the best tea he could
                    get. It continued to be sold in London for 60s. per lb. till 1707, though it did
                    not cost more than 2s. 6d. or 3s. 6d. at Batavia. In 1689, instead of charging a
                    duty on the decoction from the leaves, a duty of 5s. per lb. was laid on the tea
                    itself. In 1715 green tea began to be used, and as great quantities were then
                    imported, the price was proportionally lowered. In 1790 the quantity of tea
                    retained for home consumption in Great Britain and Ireland was 1,643,095 lbs.,
                    and the duty amounted to L.580,362. Since that period the trade in tea has
                    rapidly continued to increase till it has arrived at its present astonishing
                    magnitude. Till 1833 the East India Company enjoyed a monopoly of the trade in
                    tea, but by the act 3 and 4 William IV., c. 93, the trade was thrown open.</p>
                <p>Sugar and tea are the most productive to the chancellor of the exchequer, of all
                    the exciseable imports. These two articles alone yielded in 1836 a net revenue
                    of L.8,858,700. In 1836 the net revenue from tea was L.4,184,165, and the
                    quantity retained for home consumption was 49,142,236 pounds; in 1837 the net
                    revenue was L.3,223,840, and the quantity retained for home consumption
                    30,625,206 pounds. The ease with which it can be levied has always been a great
                    temptation to lay a heavy duty on this commodity; and the consequence has been,
                    that this, which may now be termed a necessary of life, has been burdened to the
                    utmost limit of productiveness, and sometimes considerably beyond it. Previously
                    to the 1st of July 1837, the duty, which had varied greatly from time to time,
                    was, for Bohea, 1s. 6d. per pound; Congou, Twankay, &amp;c. 2s. 2d.; and
                    Souchong, Hyson, 3s. From that date a uniform duty of 2s. Id. is charged on all
                    sorts. Thus it appears, from the table of sales by the East India Company, that
                    the duty on Bohea is nearly 300 per cent., the price of the pound of Bohea being
                    9 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> d., and the tax
                    upon it 2s. 1d. On the other sorts the tax is about 100 per cent. It may fairly
                    be anticipated, that a considerable reduction of duty on this healthful beverage
                    would promote the comfort and sobriety of the community, without diminishing the
                    amount of the revenue, in consequence of the increase of consumption which would
                    necessarily follow.</p>
                <p>When imported into the United States in American vessels it is duty free; but a
                    duty of ten cents, or 5d. per pound, is laid on what is imported in foreign
                    vessels.</p>
