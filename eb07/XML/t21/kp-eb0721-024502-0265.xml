                    Rumford</hi></label>, a well-known natural philosopher and political economist,
                    was born in 1753, at a village in New Hampshire, then called Rumford, and now
                    Concord. His father died while he was very young, and his mother married another
                    man, who banished him from her house almost in his infancy: he inherited only a
                    small pittance from an uncle, who died soon after his father. Aclergyman named
                    Bernard showed him great kindness, and taught him some of the higher mathematics
                    at an early age, so that at fourteen he was able to calculate and delineate an
                    eclipse of the sun. He had been intended for some commercial employment, but he
                    preferred the pursuit of literature in any form: he attended the lectures of Dr
                    Williams, and afterwards those of Dr Winthrop the astronomer, at Harvard
                    College; and while he was still a stripling, he was established in the temporary
                    occupation of a village school-master; hoping, however, for an early opportunity
                    to engage in some more agreeable employment: and at nineteen, he was fortunate
                    enough to obtain the hand of Mrs Rolfe, daughter of Mr Walker, a clergyman, who
                    had been employed with considerable credit in conducting some public business.
                    For a year or two he lived retired and happy; but having obtained a commission
                    of major in the militia from the governor of the province, together with some
                    other distinctions of a civil nature, he was consequently led to adhere to the
                    party of the Royalists; and he was soon obliged, by the success of the
                    Independent forces, to take refuge at Boston, then occupied by the English
                    troops. It was in November 1773 that he secretly quitted his residence, leaving
                    his wife, whom he never saw again, and his infant daughter, who joined him
                    twenty years after in Europe. He was employed to raise a regiment for the king’s
                    service; but when Boston was evacuated in 1776, he was sent with some important
                    despatches to England. Here he soon acquired the confidence of Lord George
                    Germaine, then colonial secretary of state, and was appointed secretary of the
                    province of Georgia, though he never exercised the office; but he remained
                    attached to that department of the public service.</p>
                <p>In 1777 he commenced his career as an experimental philosopher, by employing his
                    leisure hours, during a visit to Bath, in making some experiments on the
                    cohesive strength of different substances; and upon his return to London, be
                    communicated them to Sir Joseph Banks, with whom he formed an intimate
                    acquaintance, which he kept up throughout the remainder of his life. In 1778 he
                    was admitted a fellow of the Royal Society, and he made in that year his first
                    experiments on gunpowder. In order to pursue these experiments, he went, in
                    1779, on board of the Victory, of 110 guns, commanded by his friend Sir Charles
                    Hardy. He passed the whole campaign on board the fleet; and the results of the
                    observations which he then made, furnished the materials of a chapter which he
                    contributed to Stalkart’s Treatise on Naval Architecture. He added to it a code
                    of signals for the navy, which was net published. In 1780 he was appointed
                    under-secretary of state, and he was constantly employed, for some little time,
                    in the office on the business of the war. He succeeded, by means of his American
                    friends and agents, in raising a regiment of cavalry, called the King’s American
                    Dragoons, of <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=266"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0266-0246"/>which he was appointed lieutenant-colonel
                    commandant; and this success induced him to go to America to serve with it. At
                    Charlestown he was intrusted with the command of the remains of the cavalry of
                    the British army. He speedily restored the discipline of the corps, and gained
                    its confidence and attachment: he often led it against the enemy, and frequently
                    with considerable success. He proceeded, in 1782, to New York, where he assumed
                    the command of his own regiment, having received the colours from the hand of
                    Prince William Henry. In the autumn, General Clinton was succeeded by Sir Guy
                    Carlton, whose friendship and confidence he speedily obtained. His regiment was
                    recruited from the fragments of several others, and he was sent for the winter
                    to Huntingdon in Long Island. In 1783 he was chosen to conduct the defence of
                    Jamaica, which was then threatened by the enemy; but the general peace
                    superseded the necessity of the intended expedition.</p>
                <p>After his return to England, he made great efforts in the cause of the loyalist
                    officers, and he was successful in persuading the ministry to make a proper
                    provision for them. He was himself raised to the rank of colonel, upon the
                    recommendation of General Carlton, only two years after his appointment as
                    lieutenant-colonel. He had acquired a strong predilection for a military life,
                    and was desirous of being sent with his regiment to the East Indies; and when
                    the regiment was reduced, he wished to serve with the Austrians in a war which
                    was then meditated against the Turks. With this view he left England in
                    September 1783, and on his passage to Boulogne, he had an agreeable shipmate in
                    the person of Gibbon the historian, who did justice to his merits as a “soldier,
                    philosopher, and statesman.” At Strasburg, his appearance on the parade in his
                    uniform excited the attention of the late king of Bavaria, then Prince
                    Maximilian of Deux Ponts, who invited him to his table, and being delighted with
                    the accuracy and extent of his military knowledge, gave him a strong
                    recommendation to his uncle, then elector; and instead of a day or two, as he
                    had intended, he staid a fortnight at Munich. He was also very cordially
                    received at Vienna, and passed a part of the winter there; but the war against
                    the Turks not taking place, he returned by Venice and the Tyrol to Munich, where
                    he arrived in the winter of 1784; and being formally invited by the elector to
                    enter his service, he went to London to ask leave to accept the proposal; and it
                    was granted him, together with the honour of knighthood. On his return to
                    Bavaria, he was made a colonel of cavalry, and aide-de-camp-general to the
                    elector. The first four years of his residence at Munich were principally
                    employed in acquiring information, and in preparing his plans of reform; and in
                    the mean time he continued his physical researches. He made his first
                    experiments on heat in 1786, during a journey to Manheim. In 1785 he was made
                    chamberlain to the elector, and member of the academies of Munich and of
                    Manheim; in 1786 he received from the king of Poland the order of St Stanislas;
                    in 1787 he took a journey to Berlin, and was made a member of the Academy of
                    Sciences of that city; in 1788 he was appointed major-general of the Bavarian
                    cavalry, and privy counsellor of state; and he was placed at the head of the war
                    department, in order to pursue his plans for the improvement of the army.</p>
                <p>It was in 1789 that he established the House of Industry at Manheim. He founded
                    also the Military Academy of Munich; he improved the military police of the
                    country; he formed schools of industry for the wives and children of the
                    soldiers; and he embellished the city by a new arrangement of the public
                    gardens. The House of Industry at Munich, which he has described at large in his
                    Essays, was founded in 1790; and from this period may be dated the total
                    abolition of mendicity in Bavaria. His exertions were rewarded by the rank of
                    lieutenant-general of the Bavarian armies, and by a regiment of artillery. In
                    1791 he was created a count of the holy Roman empire, and obtained the order of
                    the white eagle. His health having suffered from constant application, he
                    obtained permission to take a journey into Switzerland and Italy, and he
                    returned to Bavaria in 1794. He had a severe illness at Naples, and he was not
                    sufficiently recovered, upon his return, to resume his active duties; but he
                    employed himself in writing the first five of his Essays. In 1795, he came to
                    England in order to publish the Essays, and in hopes of exciting the public
                    attention to the importance of attempting a similar reform among the lowest
                    orders in Great Britain. He went to Dublin in 1796, to pay a visit to Lord
                    Pelham, afterwards earl of Chichester, then secretary of state for Ireland; and
                    he was of essential service in the arrangement of several of the public
                    institutions of that country. He was made a member of the Royal Irish Academy,
                    and of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts; and after having left the
                    country, he received the public thanks of the grand jury of the county of
                    Dublin, and of the lord mayor of that city, as well as of the lord lieutenant at
                    the head of the government. Upon his return to London, he superintended some
                    improvements at the Foundling Hospital, and presented several models of machines
                    and implements to the board of agriculture; and he established two prizes, for
                    discoveries relating to heat and light, by placing two sums of L.1000 in the
                    British and in the American funds, to be adjudged biennially, for Europe by the
                    Royal Society of London, and for America by the American Academy of
                    Sciences.</p>
                <p>He was recalled to Bavaria by the exigencies of the moment, which were such as to
                    cause the elector to take refuge in Saxony; General Moreau having advanced with
                    his army to the confines of Bavaria. After the battle of Friedberg, Count
                    Rumford was left in command of the Bavarian army, with instructions to act
                    according to his discretion under the circumstances that might occur; and his
                    firmness was such as to prevent either the Austrians or the French from entering
                    Munich. On the elector’s return, he was placed at the head of the department of
                    the general police of Bavaria. His exertions in this office were such as to
                    impair the state of his health, and by way of an honourable retirement, he was
                    sent to London in the capacity of envoy extraordinary and minister
                    plenipotentiary; but being a subject of the king of Britain, he was judged
                    incapable of being received as the diplomatic agent of a foreign court, and he
                    therefore continued to live in England as a private individual. He was very
                    active about this period in projecting and superintending the establishment of
                    the Royal Institution of Great Britain, which was more particularly intended for
                    the application of science to the conveniences and comforts of civil and
                    domestic life, but which has been no less successful in giving opportunity and
                    facility to some of the most refined researches in chemistry and natural
                    philosophy that have distinguished the age, than in serving as a medium for
                    making the treasures of science accessible to the less studious part of the
                    public, and as a model for a variety of other similar undertakings in different
                    parts of the world.</p>
                <p>Count Rumford was soon afterwards officially invited to America by the government
                    of the United States, with an offer of an honourable establishment in a public
                    situation; but he considered it as inconsistent with his engagements in Europe
                    to accept the proposal. In the autumn of 1800, when he went to Scotland, a visit
                    of ceremony was paid to him by the magistrates of Edinburgh. He was consulted
                    respecting the abolition of mendicity, and the measures which he recommended
                    were speedily executed with complete success. He was made an honorary member of
                    the Royal Society and of the Royal College of Physicians of Edin <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=267" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0267-0247"
                    />burgh; and he received a gold snuff-box as a compliment for his assistance in
                    reforming the culinary establishment of Heriot’s Hospital.</p>
                <p>After so active and diversified a career, it was not to be expected that he would
                    be satisfied with the monotony of a permanent residence in London. He was so
                    accustomed to labour for the attainment of some object, that when the object
                    itself was completely within his reach, and the labour was ended, the prospect,
                    which ought to have been uniformly bright, became spontaneously clouded, or the
                    serenity even became unenjoyable for want of some clouds to afford a contrast.
                    He had fitted up a small house at Brompton, with every contrivance for comfort
                    and convenience that could render it fit for the abode of hospitality and of
                    luxury; and the arrangements are fully described in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliothèque Britannique</hi> of his friend Professor Pictet; but after all he
                    never was known to give a single entertainment in it. The enthusiasm excited by
                    the novelty of some of his inventions had subsided; and he was even mortified by
                    becoming, in common with the most elevated personages of the country, the object
                    of the impertinent attacks of a popular satirist. It was partly, however, if not
                    entirely, the superiority of the climate of France, that determined him to
                    remove to Paris in the spring of 1802. He went in the summer to Munich, and the
                    following year he made a tour in Switzerland and in Bavaria, accompanied by
                    Mademoiselle Lavoisier, whom he married soon after their return; but their
                    habits were incompatible with matrimonial comfort, and they separated soon
                    after; Count Rumford retiring to Auteuil, about four miles from Paris, where he
                    occupied a house which had formerly belonged to Helvetius and to Cabanis, while
                    his lady continued to live in the metropolis. His latter years were passed
                    almost wholly in solitude; he saw only his neighbour Mr Cane-leux, Mr Underwood,
                    and a Mr Parker, an American. He did not even attend the sittings of the
                    Institute, though he had been made one of its eight foreign associates some time
                    before, and always retained a high esteem for its secretary’ Cuvier, and for
                    some others of its members. His income was abundantly sufficient for his own
                    expenses; for he had obtained from the gratitude of the king of Bavaria a
                    pension of L.1200 a year; and he was allowed by Bonaparte to remain unmolested,
                    though a British subject, when it was found that he had no intercourse with
                    society, amusing himself principally in walking about his garden, and in a
                    solitary game of billiards. In the latter part of his life he bad so completely
                    persuaded himself of the great superiority of broad wheels above narrow ones,
                    that he drove about the streets of Paris in a broad-wheeled chariot; and having
                    rediscovered, after Professor Leslie, that black bodies radiate more heat than
                    others, he wore, in the winter, a white hat and a white coat, in order to
                    economize the heat of his person. “These peculiarities, and a peremptory
                    unyielding disposition,” says one of his biographers, “were the causes that set
                    him apart from social intercourse, and in all his connexions in life seem to
                    have rendered him less the object of personal attachment than of esteem for his
                    talents and activity.” He was about to return to England when he died, on the
                    2lst of August 1814, leaving only one daughter, who afterwards resided in his
                    house at Brompton.</p>
                <p>1. Count Rumford’s first publication appears to have been the chapter on Marine

                <p>2. New Experiments on Gunpowder, with the Description of an Eprouvette. Phil.
                    Trans. 1781, p. 230. The effect of the powder on the ball was measured by the
                    recoil of the piece, with a correction deduced from the recoil when the piece
                    was empty. It was observed to be sooner heated when fired without ball than with
                    it. The force of the powder is made at least 1300 atmospheres, upon Robins’s
                    principles.</p>
                <p>3. New Experiments upon Heat. Phil. Trans. 1786, p. 273. These experiments relate
                    principally to the conducting powers of various mediums for heat; but the
                    results are unavoidably complicated with the effects of radiation, in
                    consequence of which a vacuum is supposed to possess a conducting power more
                    than half as great as that of common air.</p>

                    Substances. Phil. Trans. 1787, p. 84. These experiments tend to show that the
                    air obtained by Priestley and Ingenhousz, from plants under water, was derived
                    rather from the water itself than from the substances immersed in it.</p>
                <p>5. Experiments made to determine the Positive and Relative Quantities of Moisture
                    absorbed from the Atmosphere by various Substances. P. 240. He finds that wool
                    is more absorbent of moisture than any other substance compared with it; and
                    hence explains the supposed advantage of woollen worn next the skin.</p>
                <p>6. Experiments on Heat. Phil. Trans. 1792, p. 48. The author attributes the
                    effect of loose substances in obstructing the passage of heat to their
                    attraction for air, and to their impeding its circulation; and he supposes this
                    to be the only manner in which elastic fluids communicate heat.</p>

                <p>9. Experiments to determine the Force of Fired Gunpowder. P. 272. This force he
                    supposes to amount to between 20,000 and 50,000 atmospheres, instead of 10,000,
                    as Bernoulli computed it; but he makes a great mistake in supposing that the
                    whole of the water which can possibly be contained in the gunpowder would be
                    sufficient to furnish as much steam as would be required, since steam, under a
                    pressure of 20,000 atmospheres, must be considerably more dense than water
                    itself.</p>
                <p>10. Inquiry concerning the Source of the Heat excited by Friction. Phil. Trans.
                    1798, p. 80. The capacity of the chips of iron afforded by friction in boring a
                    cannon, was found not to differ from that of the iron in its original state:
                    hence it is inferred that the heat could not have been furnished by them, and
                    that it must probably have been generated. Mr Haldalt afterwards repeated the
                    experiment under circumstances still more decisive; and Sir Humphry Davy showed
                    that two pieces of ice rubbed together, in a room below the freezing
                    temperature, would melt each other.</p>
                <p>11. Inquiry concerning the Chemical Properties that have been attributed to
                    Light. P. 449. He attributes these properties to the effect of an intense heat
                    confined to a small space; but the latter experiments on the chemical effects of
                    the spectrum are sufficient to supersede this opinion.</p>
                <p>13. An Account of a Curious Phenomenon observed on the Glaciers of Chamouny, with
                    some Observations on the Propagation of Heat in Fluids. Phil. Trans. 1804, p.
                    23. An effect depending on the expansion of water in cooling near the freezing
                    point.</p>
                <p>14. Concerning the Nature of Heat, and the Mode of its Communication. P. 77. He
                    conjectures that cold is a positive quality, capable of being propagated by
                    radiation.</p>

                <p>16. There are several little papers on Steam Kitchens, on the Strength of Soft
                    Materials, and on some other similar subjects, in the first numbers of the
                    Journals of the Royal Institution. 8. Lond. 1800.</p>
                <p>17. The series of investigations relating to Heat and Light, which Count Rumford
                    began to communicate to the Royal Society, were continued, and rather more fully
                    detailed, in several of the volumes of the Memoirs of the Institute,
                    Mathematical Class; into which they were of course admitted as the productions
                    of a foreign associate. The first of these is in the sixth volume. 4. Par. 1806,
                    p. 71, containing a Description of a new Instrument; a Thermoscope, or a
                    Differential Thermometer, resembling that of Leslie. ( 18.) The second, p.74.

                <p>26. He was latterly engaged in composing a work on the Nature and Effects of
                    Order, which he never completed, although no person was better qualified to
                    write on the subject.</p>
                <p>Count Rumford certainly possessed considerable facility of invention, and there
                    was a very laudable spirit of originality in his views and modes of reasoning,
                    although he had never leisure to acquire profound learning in any department of
                    study. “In person he was above the middle size, with a dignified and pleasing
                    expression of countenance, and a mildness in his manner and his tone of voice.
                    He was ambitious of fame and distinction, and had too great a propensity to
                    dictate,” without sufficiently regarding the opinions of others who were of
                    equal authority with him self. His mode of life was abstemious, and his health
                    was even supposed to have suffered from too great abstinence, though his regimen
                    was much more the result of medical opinions respecting his health, than of his
                    own peculiar taste for temperance.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
