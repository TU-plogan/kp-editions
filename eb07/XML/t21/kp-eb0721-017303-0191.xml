                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    Musical Scale</hi></label>. “In the modern system, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >tempered,”</hi> says a German writer on music, “all the intervals are not
                    employed in their original perfection, as the nature of the harmonic scale
                    presents them, but lose, sometimes in this interval, sometimes in that other,
                    something of their acuteness or gravity. In fact, experience shows that, in
                    tuning the major and minor thirds, the fifths, and the fourths, in their
                    original perfection, when we reach a certain term, we meet with a fault of too
                    great excess or too great deficiency; and from this faultiness arises the
                    necessity of tempering this or that sound, in order to combine reciprocally the
                    intervals of one mode with those of another, the result of which is called <hi
                    rend="italic">temperament."</hi> The nature and the principle of temperament, as
                    applied to musical instruments of fixed sounds, may be understood by perusing
                    pp. 610, 611, of vol. xv., article <hi rend="smallcaps">Music</hi>, and p. 533
                    of vol. xvi., article <hi rend="smallcaps">Organ.</hi> We shall here content
                    ourselves with giving a very few additional remarks, and with indicating some
                    works whence further information may be derived, seeing that the subject of
                    musical temperament is not of sufficient importance to occupy much room in a
                    work like this. The various systems of temperament that have been proposed for
                    such instruments as the organ, the harpsichord, the piano-forte, &amp;c. offer
                    only a choice in the distribution of the imperfections of false intonation. The
                    unequal temperament is that usually adopted; but it must be observed, that
                    tuners in general proceed more by rule of routine and an indifferent ear, than
                    according to any scientific principle of temperament. Hence the great
                    differences found among instruments tuned by different tuners. It is a common
                    error to suppose that “a person who sings in tune, tempers without lmowing it.”
                    Even Chladni, following the lead, has asserted this; while the truth is, that
                    there is <hi rend="italic">no temperament</hi> in the voice of a singer whose
                    intonation is perfect, unless his voice and ear happen to be misguided by the
                    accompaniment of a <hi rend="italic">tempered</hi> instrument, that is, an
                    instrument <hi rend="italic">out of tune.</hi> When left to itself, the voice of
                    such a singer, in executing the most intricate modulations, forms the sounds in
                    their true ratios to the different tonics or key-notes that occur, and, in the
                    wonderful subtlety of the intonations of that only perfect musical instrument,
                    the human voice, possesses all the intonations that are necessary to form these
                    sounds exactly. Nearly the same thing occurs in the case of such a violin-player
                    as a Viotti or a Paganini when he plays alone, and undisturbed by the false
                    intonations of any accompanying instrument. This was actually proved in Paris
                    about thirty years ago, by the experiments made by M. Charles and the celebrated
                    violinist Viotti. We may here remark, that it <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=192" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0192-0174"/>is
                    of great detriment to the just intonation of a singer, to learn to sing by the
                    guidance of an instrument such as the piano-forte, as is the common practice;
                    for a habit of malintonation is then inevitably acquired. The same remark
                    applies to singers taught with the accompaniment of those instruments with
                    fretted finger-boards, such as the guitar, of which the intonation is also
                    imperfect. As to the imperfections of the common guitar, the reader may consult
                    the lively and ingenious work entitled Instructions to my Daughter, for playing
                    on the Enharmonic Guitar, London, 1829. The celebrated singer Madame Mara used
                    to say that every singer ought to learn to play the violin, in order to acquire
                    a knowledge of just intonation. Certainly that instrument, and others of the
                    violin kind, are the only ones we have that are capable of the nearest approach
                    to perfect intonation, making allowances for the mechanical imperfections of
                    their strings, as we have already hinted in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Music</hi>. But still the human voice is the only perfect musical instrument.
                    It has been a prevalent opinion among musicians and writers upon music, that the
                    ancient Greeks were ignorant of many of our musical intervals, and possessed no
                    instruments capable of executing our modern musical scales. But it is more than
                    probable that the knowledge of the ratios of musical intervals, and of perfect
                    intonation in a variety of scales, was much more exact among the ancient
                    Indians, Arabians, and Greeks, than is generally supposed, or than the scanty,
                    imperfect, and corrupted Greek relics of works on music, and the very limited
                    examination of Indian and Arabian manuscripts, have hitherto been able to show.
                    The reader may consult, on the subject of musical temperament, the following
                    works. Among these, one of the best is Professor Robison’s, for clearness, as
                    well as useful suggestions. Chapter 13, <hi rend="italic">et seg,</hi> of the
                    third book of Salinas de Musica, Salamanca, 1577. Dr Smith’s Harmonics, second
