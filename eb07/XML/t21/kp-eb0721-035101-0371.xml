                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ανυ</hi> survey of a country, which is carried on from a
                    single base by the computation of observed angular distances, may be properly
                    called a trigonometrical survey; but the term is usually confined to
                    measurements on a large scale, embracing a considerable extent of country, and
                    requiring a combination of astronomical and geodetical operations.</p>
                <p>There are two principal objects for which a trigonometrical survey may be
                    undertaken; the first being to ascertain the exact situation of the different
                    points of a country relatively to each other, and to the equator and meridians
                    of the terrestrial spheroid, for the pun&gt;ose of constructing an accurate map;
                    and the second to determine the dimensions and form of the earth, by
                    ascertaining the curvature of a given portion of its surface. Having already, in
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Figure of τηε Earth,</hi> given a general
                    account of the principal operations, which, in different ages and countries,
                    have been undertaken with a view to the second of these objects, and also
                    explained the methods by which the elements of the earth’s form and dimensions
                    are computed from the geodetical measurements, and stated the results which are
                    deducible from those measurements taken collectively, we shall not, in the
                    present article, enter into the general subject of Geodesy, but shall confine
                    ourselves to a more particular account than could have been properly given in
                    the article cited, of the great survey which during the last half-century has
                    been carrying on in our own country under the direction of the Board of
                    Ordnance. We accordingly propose to give, in the first place, a brief abstract
                    of the history of that operation, so far as it may be collected from the
                    accounts published in the Transactions of the Royal Society, and in the three
                    volumes of the work entitled “The Trigonometrical Survey of England and Wales
                    and, in the second place, to explain the methods by which the distances,
                    latitudes, longitudes, bearings, and relative heights of the several positions
                    are computed from the observations. The subject, though somewhat technical, is
                    important both in a scientific and national point of view; and few persons,
                    perhaps, have any just notions of the extremely refined nature of the operations
                    to be executed, or of the difficulties to be surmounted, when the question is to
                    determine terrestrial distances and positions with the extreme precision which
                    alone can be tolerated in the present advanced state of mathematical and
                    astronomical science.</p>
                <p>From the account given by General Roy, it appears that the origin of the British
                    trigonometrical survey goes back to the middle of the last century. The rise and
                    progress of the rebellion which broke out in the Highlands of Scotland in the
                    year 1745, convinced government of the importance of establishing military
                    posts, and opening roads of communication in the remotest parts of the country;
                    and a body of infantry having been encamped at Fort Augustus in 1747 with a view
                    to these objects, Lieutenant-general Watson, who was then officially employed at
                    that place as deputy quartermaster-general, conceived the idea of making a map
                    of the Highlands. The proposal having met with the approval of the Duke of
                    Cumberland, the survey necessary for the purpose was forthwith commenced under
                    the direction of General Roy; and although it was originally intended to confine
                    the operation to the Highlands, it was nevertheless extended to the Lowlands,
                    and at length included the whole of the mainland of Scotland. The breaking out
                    of the war in 1755 prevented the survey from being completed, and accordingly
                    the projected map was never published. General Roy states, that although the
                    work, which exists in manuscript, possesses considerable merit, and perfectly
                    answered the purpose for which it was intended, yet, having been carried on with
                    instruments of a common or even inferior kind, it is rather to be considered as
                    a magnificent military sketch than a very accurate map of a country.</p>
                <p>On the conclusion of the peace of 1763, the question of making a general survey
                    of the whole island came for the first time under the consideration of the
                    government; but although the utility of such a measure was acknowledged, no
                    steps were taken to carry it into effect until after the termination of the
                    American war in 1783. During this year a memorial, drawn up by Cassini de Thury,
                    was transmitted by the French ambassador to Mr Fox, then Secretary of State for
                    the Foreign Department, setting forth the advantages that would accrue to
                    astronomy by carrying a chain of triangles from the neighbourhood of London to
                    Dover, to be connected with those of the French are of meridian, which had now
                    been extended from Collioure to Dunkirk, and thereby determining, by actual
                    measurement, the relative positions of the Observatories of Greenwich and Paris.
                    Cassini’s proposal having been referred to the Royal Society, was warmly
                    approved by that body; in consequence of which the government undertook to give
                    the requisite assistance, and the execution of the operation was committed to
                    General Roy, who was then employing himself in the measurement of a base for a
                    projected survey of London, which he had undertaken with a view to connect the
                    different private observatories in and about the capital with that of Greenwich,
                    and, as he states, “that it might possibly serve as a hint to the public for the
                    now almost forgotten scheme of 1763.”</p>
                <p>Although the operation which was thus resolved upon did not embrace a general
                    survey of the kingdom, but was confined to the particular object of effecting a
                    junction of the Greenwich Observatory with the French triangulation, it was
                    still an object of great astronomical interest; and accordingly it was
                    determined that the measurement should be conducted with the utmost possible
                    care in all its details, and with the best instruments which could be provided
                    by the celebrated Ramsden, at that time acknowledged to be the first artist in
                    the world.</p>
                <p>The first step in the operation was the accurate measurement of a base, from
                    which the sides of a chain of triangles might be successively computed. For this
                    purpose General Roy selected a line on Hounslow Heath, a situation which
                    presented the advantages of proximity to the capital and the Observatory of
                    Greenwich; of great extent and levelness of surface; of being free from local
                    obstructions, and commodiously situate for any future operations of a similar
                    nature. The line extended from a place culled King’s Arbour, at the north-west
                    extremity of the Heath, and terminated at Hampton poor-house, near Bushy Park,
                    at the south-east extremity, the whole length being upwards of five miles.</p>
                <p>The preliminary operations having been completed, and the terminal points having
                    been marked by sinking wooden pipes into the ground, the measurement was
                    commenced about the middle of July 1784. The measuring apparatus consisted of
                    three deal rods, on which lengths of twenty feet were laid off by Ramsden, and a
                    standard rod, with which the former were from time to time to be compared. The
                    measuring rods were formed out of an old mast of Riga timber, their dimensions
                    being 20 feet 3 inches in length (including the tippings, which were of
                    bell-metaD, about 2 inches deep, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=372" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0372-0352"/>1¼
                    inch broad, and trussed both laterally and vertically, so as to be rendered
                    perfectly inflexible. They were constructed in such a manner that they might be
                    used either by butting the end of one rod against the end of another, or by
                    bringing fine transverse lines drawn upon them at the distance of an inch and
                    half from each extremity into exact coincidence; but although the last method
                    was considered by General Roy to deserve the preference, it was found on trial
                    to be attended with so much inconvenience and loss of time that it was
                    abandoned, and the measurement by contacts alone adhered to. The weather proved
                    wet and unfavourable, and before the measurement was half completed, the deal
                    rods were found, notwithstanding all the care which had been taken to prepare
                    them of the best materials, so liable to sudden and irregular variations of
                    length, from changes in the hygrometrical state of the atmosphere, as to leave
                    no hopes of determining by their means the length of the base with the precision
                    which was aimed at. As, however, so much of the work had been done, it was
                    thought desirable to continue it until the whole base was measured, in order
                    that the result might be compared with that which should afterwards be found by
                    a different method</p>
                <p>General Roy cites some experiments to show how unfit deal rods are for such a
                    purpose as the measurement of the base of a great trigonometrical operation. On
                    one occasion the measuring rods, when compared with the standard, were found to
                    exceed it, at a medium, one fifteenth part of an inch; so that if the whole base
                    had been measured with the rods in that state, the difference would have
                    amounted to more than 7½ feet, exclusive of any expansion or contraction of the
                    standard, which was of the same material. Another experiment, made after the
                    operation had been completed, was still more decisive. A line of 300 feet was
                    accurately measured off in the garden of Sir Joseph Banks when the rods were in
                    a dry state, the sun shining bright, and the temperature 68°. The rods were
                    exposed to the dew during the night, and when lifted from the grass on the
                    following morning were found to be quite wet excepting on the sides in contact
                    with the ground. The line was then remeasured, and its length as given by the
                    rods found to be less by 0·498 of an inch (or nearly half an inch) than on the
                    preceding evening. Hence it appeared that the dew imbibed in one night, or a
                    period not exceeding fourteen hours, caused such an expansion of the rods as in
                    the whole base would have amounted to 45·484 inches. (Trig. Survey, vol. i. p.
                    50.) There experiments were important, as deal rods had been employed in all the
                    principal operations of the kind which had previously been undertaken for
                    determining the magnitude and compression of the earth.</p>
                <p>The measurement with the deal rods being completed, and the proper allowance (so
                    far as it could be determined from the comparisons with the standard) made for
                    the expansion, the distance between the centres of the pipes terminating the
                    base, reduced to the level of the lower extremity at Hampton Court, and at the
                    temperature of 63°, was found to be 27,406∙26 feet of the standard scale from
                    which the lengths of the measuring rods were laid off.</p>
                <p>When it was discovered that the measurement by means of the deal rods would prove
                    unsatisfactory, and General Roy was considering the different alternatives that
                    might be adopted, it was suggested by Lieutenant-colonel Cal-del-wood that glass
                    rods should he substituted for those of deal. As it was found upon trial that
                    there would be no difficulty in obtaining glass tubes of the desired length, and
                    that they could be provided much sooner than rods of metal; and as it was
                    obvious that the rate of expansion could be determined with equal certainty, it
                    was resolved to adopt the suggestion. Accordingly, three hollow tubes, perfectly
                    straight, upwards of twenty feet in length and about an inch in diameter, were
                    selected, and converted by Ramsden into measuring rods. The tubes were placed in
                    cases, to which they were made fast at the middle, and braced at several other
                    points, so as to prevent them from bending or shaking, but not so closely as to
                    prevent their free expansion or contraction. Both ends were ground perfectly
                    smooth and at right angles to the axis of the bore; one end having a fixed
                    apparatus or metal button attached to it for making the contacts, and the other
                    end a moveable apparatus, or slider, which was pressed outwards by a slender
                    spring, and against which the fixed extremity of the succeeding rod was pushed,
                    until a fine line on the slider was brought into exact coincidence with another
                    fine line on the glass rod, in which state the distance between the extremities
                    was exactly twenty feet.</p>
                <p>The ground on which the base was measured not being quite level, the whole
                    distance was divided into hypothenuses or inclined lines in the same vertical
                    plane, each containing thirty lengths of the measuring rods, or 600 feet; and
                    the method pursued was to place the rods exactly in straight lines stretching
                    from one extremity of a hypothenuse to another, and then to determine the
                    relative heights of the two extremities of the hypothenuse by the spirit-level,
                    for the purpose of reducing to the horizon. The cases containing the measuring
                    rods were supported on trestles about two and a half feet above the surface of
                    the ground.</p>
                <p>The new measurement with the glass rods was begun on the 18th of August, and
                    concluded on the 30th. On arriving at the south-east extremity the end of the
                    1370th rod was found to overshoot the centre of the pipe terminating the base,
                    by 17∙875 inches; and after the rate of expansion of the rods had been
                    determined, and the proper equations applied, the difference between the present
                    and the former measure with the deal rods was found to be 20·964 inches, of
                    which the greater part is probably owing to the over-rated expansion of the deal
                    rods, which, when brought into use, appear to have contracted sooner than was
                    imagined, and thereby given a shorter distance than was assignable from the mean
                    of any two comparisons with the standard. No use was made of the measurement
                    with the deal rods in any of the subsequent operations.</p>
                <p>After the measurement on the ground had been completed, it was necessary to
                    determine by actual experiments the expansion of the glass rods, in order to
                    obtain the exact length of the base. For this purpose an ingenious microscopic
                    pyrometer, invented by Ramsden, was employed, by means of which the expansion of
                    the brass scale, and of glass rods and various other substances, was ascertained
                    for every degree of Fahrenheit from 32° to 212°. The glass measuring rods could
                    not themselves be submitted to experiment on account of their great length; the
                    rod on which the experiments were made was 5 feet in length, 0·93 inch in
                    diameter, weighing 1 lb. 13½ oz. and drawn from the same pot of metal as the
                    measuring rods. These experiments were made in the winter of 1784 and spring of
                    1785.</p>
                <p>In order to give a clearer idea of the number of minute circumstances to be
                    attended to in an operation of this kind, we shall here state the final result
                    in the words of General Roy. (Trig. Survey, vol. i. p. 84.)</p>

                <p>With respect to this measurement, General Roy remarks that “infinite pains were
                    taken, both in the field and otherwise, throughout the whole operation, to
                    obtain a just conclusion and as the means employed appear to be fully adequate
                    to the attainment of the object in view, there seems to be no good reason to
                    doubt that the accuracy of the result corresponded to the skill and attention
                    with which the operation was conducted.</p>
                <p>The measurement of the base having been effected, the next object was to proceed
                    with the triangulation; but a delay of three years intervened before the
                    operations were resumed. In the summer of 1787, the instrument intended for the
                    measurement of the angles (a large theodolite, having its horizontal circle of
                    three feet in diameter) was completed by Ramsden, and carried to the station at
                    the south end of the base on the 3lst of July. Sir Joseph Banks, as president of
                    the Royal Society, had in the mean time put himself in communication with Μ.
                    Cassini, whom the Academy of Sciences had appointed to co-operate in the
                    junction of the French and English triangles; but as the season was now too far
                    advanced to admit of the operation being completed before the winter set in, it
                    was resolved, after a few angles had been observed, to proceed to Dover and
                    Calais to execute the coast triangles, leaving the inland part of the series to
                    be executed afterwards. In this operation General Roy was accompanied by Dr
                    Blagden, and assisted by Mr Isaac Dalby (afterwards professor of mathematics in
                    the Military College), whose ingenuity and scientific knowledge rendered most
                    essential service. At Dover the party was met by Cassini, Mechain, and Legendre,
                    distinguished members of the Academy of Sciences, who had crossed the channel
                    for the purpose of concerting the measures necessary for making reciprocal
                    observations on both coasts. For the distant signals a great number of white
                    lights had been prepared, and also several reverberatory lamps; and the French
                    academicians having been furnished with a sufficient number of the lights for
                    the observations on their side of the channel, returned to Calais on the 25th of
                    September, when the observations were begun. The weather proved extremely
                    unfavourable, but, fortunately, on the particular nights on which the most
                    important observations on the English side were to be made, namely, those at
                    Dover and Fairlight Down, the atmosphere was clear, and the observers were
                    enabled to intersect with great accuracy the French stations of Blanenez in the
                    neighbourhood of Calais, and Montlambert (or Boulemberg), near Boulogne, and
                    thus establish the triangular connexion between the two countries.</p>
                <p>After this operation was concluded, the instrument was carried to a few more of
                    the stations; but two still remained unobserved, when, in the beginning of
                    November, the badness of the weather obliged the party to desist until the
                    following summer. The observations at the two remaining stations were made in
                    the ensuing August.</p>
                <p>In order that no precaution should be omitted to insure the accuracy of the
                    operation, it was resolved to measure a base of verification towards the
                    termination of the triangles. The ground selected for this purpose was Romney
                    Marsh, a tract which, on account of its levelness, was exceedingly well suited
                    to the purpose. The marsh had been previously covered by the sea, and a
                    considerable part of it, particularly towards the bottom of the range of hills
                    that separate it from the Wealds of Kent, is still lower than the sea at high
                    water. A preliminary survey of the marsh having been made, a line was selected
                    running from High Nook on the spire of Ruckinge church, and of nearly six miles
                    in length. The terminal points were marked by sinking two wooden pipes into the
                    ground. This base was not measured with the glass rods, but with a steel chain
                    of 100 feet in length, made by Ramsden, and of which the accuracy had been
                    tested by measuring with it a portion of the Hounslow Heath base simultaneously
                    with the glass rods. The measurement was executed by Lieutenant Fiddes of the
                    royal engineers. The apparent length of the base, or that given directly by the
                    measurement, was 28,536 feet 8∙835 inches; and after the proper reductions were
                    made, the correct horizontal distance between the pipes, in feet of the standard
                    brass scale, at temperature 62°, and at the level of the sea, was found to be
                    28,535 feet 8∙128 inches.</p>
                <p>On connecting the base with the series of triangles extending from Hounslow
                    Heath, its length, as deduced from the former base, was computed to be 28,533∙3
                    feet; so that the computed length fell short of the measured length about
                    twenty-eight inches. This agreement is probably as near as was to be expected,
                    and may be taken as conclusive proof of the general accuracy of the whole of the
                    operations; nevertheless, as there were reasons for supposing that the accuracy
                    attained in the base of verification was not equal to that of the original base,
                    the whole of the triangles were computed from the latter. The measurement on
                    Romney Marsh does not enter as a datum into any of the results of the
                    survey.</p>
                <p>By reason of the superior magnitude and excellence of the instrument employed,
                    the measurement of the angles was performed with a degree of accuracy which had
                    probably never been equalled in any former survey. Although the reduction to the
                    centre of the station requires a very simple calculation, it was thought
                    desirable to avoid, as much as possible, reductions of every kind, and
                    accordingly the centre of the great theodolite was adjusted by means of a
                    plummet over the precise points marking the stations. The whole number of
                    stations at which it was placed was twenty-three. In nine cases the instrument
                    was elevated to the top of a tower, church steeple, or other building; and in
                    the fourteen other cases, the station was marked by sinking a pipe into the
                    ground, to indicate the precise spot over which the instrument had been placed,
                    in order that the observations might be repeated, or the stations connected with
                    others in any future operation. The sides of the triangles were computed by
                    plane trigonometry; that is to say, the portion of the earth’s surface over
                    which the triangulation extended was regarded as a plane, and the measured bases
                    as straight lines on that plane. This supposition, though in the small portion
                    of surface in question it did not lead to errors of great magnitude, is
                    inadmissible in an extensive survey. The spherical excess was indeed roughly
                    computed for each triangle, but merely for the purpose of showing the amount of
                    the errors of observation; and the observed angles of each triangle were
                    adjusted so that the sum should equal 180°, by applying to each an arbitrary
                    correction.</p>
                <p>The calculation of the triangles, and the determination of the relative positions
                    of the Paris and Greenwich Observatories, with the lengths of the degree of
                    meridian and perpendicular, are given in detail in the Phil. Trans. for 1790;
                    but the results are not now of much importance, inasmuch<pb break="no"

                    as the whole of the observations have been since repeated and recomputed by more
                    scientific and accurate methods. General Roy’s operations gave the difference of
                    longitude between Greenwich and Paris = 2° 19' 51", or in time 9 <hi

                    This last determination would appear to be very near the truth, the difference

                <p>The account of the remeasurement to which we have just alluded is given by
                    Captain Kater in the Phil. Trans, for 1828. In 1821 the Academy of Sciences of
                    Paris communicated to the Royal Society their desire that the operations for
                    connecting the meridians of Paris and Greenwich should be repeated jointly by
                    both countries; and the proposal having been acceded to, Colonel Colby and
                    Captain Kater were appointed by the Royal Society to co-operate with M. Arago
                    and M. Mathieu, the commissioners chosen by the Academy of Sciences. The
                    requisite assistance having been readily obtained from the Ordnance department,
                    the operations were begun in the autumn of the same year.</p>
                <p>The instrument employed on this occasion was the great theodolite belonging to
                    the Royal Society, the same which had been used by General Roy. The signals for
                    connecting the stations on the opposite coasts were lamps with compound lenses,
                    constructed on the principle and under the direction of M. Fresnel; and Captain
                    Kater remarks, that the light far exceeded that of any of our light-houses,
                    appearing at the distance of forty-eight miles as a star of the first magnitude.
                    Having selected convenient stations on Fairlight Down and near Folkstone
                    turnpike, the party carried the instrument across the channel, and observed the
                    angles made at the stations of Cape Blanenez and Mont-lambert with those on the
                    English coast. They then recrossed the channel, and observed the angles
                    subtended by the signals at Cape Blanenez and Montlambert from the stations on
                    Fairlight Down and Folkstone. After some difficulty, General Roy’s station was
                    discovered on Fairlight Down, and the observations at both stations were
                    satisfactorily completed on the 27th of October. These reciprocal observations
                    sufficed to establish the connection between the two countries; and the object
                    now proposed by Colonel Colby and Captain Kater was to connect the triangles
                    with General Roy’s base on Hounslow Heath. On examination, the guns marking the
                    termination of the base were discovered; but in consequence of the erection of
                    numerous buildings since 1783, one end of it could not be seen from the other;
                    it was therefore necessary to adopt a side of one of General Roy’s triangles as
                    the measure of the linear distances, and that from Severndroog Castle, on
                    Shooter’s Hill, to Hanger Hill Tower, was selected, these being the nearest
                    stations to General Roy’s base which would be identified with sufficient
                    precision. In the course of the two following summers the angles were observed
                    at all the intermediate stations, and also the observations completed at
                    Greenwich which were necessary for determining the azimuths or bearings of the
                    sides of the triangles in respect of the meridian of the observatory. In the
                    calculation of the triangles Captain Kater made use of the theorem of Legendre
                    (which will be afterwards explained), whereas General Roy’s calculations, as
                    already stated, were made by considering the surface a plane. The latter method
                    is obviously incorrect; yet, from the near agreement of the results, it is
                    evident that no differences of any consequence arose from the different modes of
                    computation adopted. The following comparative table of distances given by
                    Captain Kater shews the agreement between the two independent operations. The
                    measures are here given in imperial feet.</p>

                <p>Although the geodetical operations which had been carried on by General Roy,
                    might be regarded as subservient to a general survey of the country, they did
                    not form part of any systematic plan for accomplishing that object; and on the
                    death of the General, which took place in 1790, some time elapsed before any
                    measures were taken to prosecute them further. In the introduction to the
                    account of the first part of the survey carried on under the direction of the
                    Board of Ordnance, the renewal of the operations is ascribed to the accidental
                    circumstance of the Duke of Richmond, then master-general, having had an
                    opportunity of purchasing “a very fine instrument, the workmanship of Mr
                    Ramsden, of similar construction with that used by General Roy, but with some
                    improvements; as also two new steel chains of one hundred feet each, made by the
                    same incomparable artist.” The new instrument is said<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Professor Playfair’s Review of Mudge’s
                    Account of the Survey, in the Edinburgh review, vol. v.</p></note> to have been
                    ordered by the East India Company for the purpose of surveying their possessions
                    in the East, and Ramsden had exerted all his ingenuity in endeavouring to render
                    it perfect; but some misunderstanding having arisen about the price, the
                    directors refused it, and it was thus thrown on the hands of the artist. The
                    Duke of Richmond having been advised to purchase it for the Ordnance, the
                    instrument thus became the property of the public, and has been employed as the
                    principal instrument of the survey down to the present time. It has been already
                    stated, that the instrument used by General Roy was the property of the Royal

                <p>In 1791 the Ordnance survey was begun, and its execution committed to Colonel
                    Williams and Captain (afterwards GeneraD Mudge of the Royal Artillery, and Mr
                    Dalby. The first operation which they undertook was the remeasurement of the
                    base on Hounslow Heath. It had been objected to the former measurement, 1st,
                    that some error might be supposed to arise from the ends of the two consecutive
                    rods being made to rest on the same trestle, because when the first rod was
                    taken off, the face of the trestle being pressed by one rod only, would have a
                    tendency to incline a little forward, the effect of which would be to shorten
                    the apparent length of the base; 2d, it was supposed that some error might arise
                    from the casual deviation of the rods from a straight line in the direction of
                    the base; and 3d, it was supposed, that from the manner of supporting the rods
                    on two trestles only, they would be liable to bend in the middle. For these
                    reasons it was determined to remeasure the base by a totally different method.
                    Instead of measuring rods, the two new steel chains above alluded to were used.
                    These were 100 feet in length, and containing 40 links of 2½ feet each. The
                    links were in form of a parallelogram of half an inch square, and their length
                    was considered advantageous, as rendering them less liable to apply themselves
                    to any irregularities of the coffers on which they were supported. In <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=375"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0375-0355"/> using the chains, five coffers were arranged in a
                    straight line and supported by courses of bricks; the chain was then placed on
                    the coffers, and stretched with a weight of fifty-six pounds. The method adopted
                    for bringing the marks denoting the two extremities of the measuring chain
                    successively over the same point was this. In any position the chain was
                    supported by a post at each end: that at the preceding end carried a pulley,
                    over which passed the rope sustaining the weight which stretched the chain,
                    while that at the following end supported a screw apparatus, by means of which
                    the chain could be drawn back against the weight. Another post at each end, not
                    connected with the former or with the chain, supported a scale. Now, the chain
                    being in one of its positions, the scale at the preceding end was moved by means
                    of screws, until one of its divisions coincided exactly with the mark on the
                    handle of the chain. This scale remaining in its place, the chain was then
                    carried forward into its next position, and adjusted by means of its screw
                    apparatus, until the mark on its following end coincided exactly with that
                    division of the scale with which the mark on the preceding end had coincided.
                    After thirty-eight chains had been measured, one of the chains was laid aside,
                    on account of one of the links appearing to be a little bent, and the remainder
                    of the base measured with the other; the former, after the defect had been
                    repaired, being kept as a standard. Experiments were carefully made for
                    determining the comparative lengths of the two chains, and also the rate of
                    expansion; and in the actual measurement five thermometers were laid close by
                    the chain in the coffers, and suffered to remain till they all indicated nearly
                    the same temperature. The time required for this was in general from seven to
                    fifteen minutes. The two chains were again compared after the measurement, and
                    it was found that the working chain had been lengthened, through the rubbing and
                    wearing of the joints, to the extent of 9∙7 divisions of the micrometer,
                    corresponding to ∙0373 of an inch. The whole base was divided into thirty
                    hypothenuses, but of unequal lengths, and each was reduced to the horizon by
                    calculation. After the measurement was completed, the lengths of the steel
                    chains were ascertained by Ramsden, by comparison with a 40-inch brass standard
                    scale. All reductions being made, the length of the base, by the new
                    measurement, at the standard temperature of 62° (but not reduced to the level of
                    the sea), was found to be 27,404·3155 feet, being about 2¾ inches greater than
                    was found from General Roy’s measurement with the glass rods. We shall
                    afterwards see, however, that the glass rods and steel chains were not referred
                    to the same standard, and that there is consequently reason to suspect a
                    considerably greater discrepancy. The mean of the two results, or 27,404∙2 feet,
                    was assumed as the true length of the base in the future calculations.</p>
                <p>Of two operations which agree so closely in their results, it can hardly be said
                    that the one is in point of fact better in any respect than the other. The
                    practical difficulty in measurements of this kind, is to form correctly the
                    contacts or coincidences of the extremities of two contiguous rods or chains;
                    and in this respect the chain has unquestionably an advantage, because, on
                    account of its greater length, there are fewer coincidences to be made.
                    Nevertheless, when it is considered that the chain is not uniformly supported at
                    every point, and that notwithstanding the weight by which it is stretched, some
                    doubt must remain whether all its points are in a straight line when brought
                    into its position in the coffers, and also the liability to irregular wear from
                    the stretching, we are inclined to think, that a measurement by means of rigid
                    rods is to be preferred to one by a flexible chain.</p>
                <p>After the measurement had been completed, the terminal points of the base were
                    permanently marked, by removing the wooden pipes and sinking iron guns into the
                    ground, in such a position that the axis of the cylinder was placed exactly in
                    the same vertical line with the terminal points. the muzzles were left above
                    ground, and iron caps were screwed over them to protect the cylinders from the
                    rain.</p>
                <p>In prosecuting the survey, it was resolved, in the first instance, to carry a
                    series of triangles from the base southwards, for the purpose of determining
                    some of the principal sta tions on the sea-coast, and also because this would
                    afford an opportunity of connecting the series with the triangles of General
                    Roy, and of thereby testing the accuracy of both operations. Another object of
                    importance to general science, was to determine the length of a degree of
                    longitude, by measuring the distance between Beachy Head on the coast of Sussex,
                    and Dunnose in the Isle of Wight, two stations lying nearly east and west of
                    each other, above sixty-four miles distant, and visible from each other in clear
                    weather, so that they could be made the angular pointe of a large triangle. In
                    the early part of the spring of 1792 the ground was examined, and the stations
                    fixed upon; and the great theodolite having undergone some improvements by Mr
                    Ramsden, and a moveable observatory having been erected for its reception, the
                    triangulation was begun in the summer of that year. Most of the angles were
                    observed more than once. When the stations were not more than about fifteen
                    miles distant, staffs were erected for signals, in which case the angles were
                    repeated till their truth became certain. For the more distant stations lamps
                    and white lights were employed. In the use of the latter, it was not always
                    possible to repeat the measures; but every precaution was taken to place the
                    lights in the proper positions, and the charge and firing of them were committed
                    to soldiers selected for their steadiness. The angle was taken when the light
                    was going out. In order to preserve the exact positions of the points over which
                    the axis of the instrument had been placed, large stones from a foot and a half
                    to two feet square were sunk in the ground, generally two feet under the
                    surface, having a hole of an inch square made in each of them, the centre of
                    which marked the precise point of the station.</p>
                <p>In the course of the summer of 1792, the instrument was carried to twelve
                    different stations, commencing with Hanger Hill, and ending with Chanctonbury
                    Ring, about six miles north-west of Shoreham. Early in the spring of the
                    following year the operations were resumed; and the principal object of this
                    year’s business was to determine the directions of the meridians of Dunnose and
                    Beachy Head, for the purpose of ascertaining the length of the degree of
                    longitude. The method employed for obtaining the meridian, was that of observing
                    with the theodolite the distance between a terrestrial object and the pole-star
                    upon each side of the pole when the star is at its greatest elongation. This
                    observation gives the double azimuth nearly, without any corrections for the
                    star’s apparent motion; and as the motion in azimuth when the star is near its
                    greatest elongation is slow, the time was shown sufficiently near by a good
                    pocket watch. In this manner the angle made by the arc of the great circle
                    joining the two places with the direction of the meridian, was observed at both
                    stations; and as the distance between the stations would become known from the
                    triangulation, all the elements were obtained for determining the length of the
                    degree of longitude on the terrestrial spheroid at that latitude. After the
                    observations at those two places were concluded, the instrument was taken to a
                    few stations in the neighbourhood of Salisbury, and the operations of the year
                    terminated at Highclerc.</p>
                <p>The greater part of the summer of 1794 was consumed in the measurement of a base
                    of verification on Salisbury Plain. The measurement was effected in the same
                    manner as at Hounslow Heath, one of the steel chains being used for measuring
                    the different hypothenuses, and the other kept as a standard. The working chain
                    was compared with <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=376"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0376-0356"/>the standard previous to the operation, and again
                    when the measurement was finished. The details of the operation are entirely
                    similar to those respecting the Hounslow Heath base; and the apparatus was
                    different in no material respect. The base contained ninety-two hypothenuses,
                    and the apparent length was 366 chains, minus 9∙939 feet. The absolute length of
                    the standard chain was assumed to be the same as it was found by Ramsden in
                    1791, by comparison with the standard scale; and after all the different
                    reductions had been applied, the correct length of the base, at the temperature
                    of 62° of Fahrenheit, and at the same level as the base on Hounslow Heath, was
                    found to be 36,574∙4 feet (nearly seven miles).</p>
                <p>On computing the distance between the terminal points of this base, deduced from
                    the Hounslow Heath base by different combinations of the triangles, the greatest
                    and least results were found to be 36,574∙8 and 36,573∙8; the mean being
                    36,574∙3 feet, or about one inch short of the measurement. So near an agreement
                    must doubtless be ascribed, in part at least, to casual compensation of error;
                    but it nevertheless affords a very satisfactory proof of the great accuracy with
                    which the different parts of the work had been conducted.</p>
                <p>The distance between Beachy Head and Dunnose, on which the determination of the
                    length of a degree of the great circle perpendicular to the meridian was to
                    depend, being computed from four different combinations of triangles, the mean
                    of the four results was found = 339,397∙6 feet, and the greatest difference from
                    the mean was less than four feet. On computing from this, and the observed
                    angles made by the straight line joining the two stations with the meridians at
                    each, according to the method which will be subsequently explained, the length
                    of a degree of the great circle perpendicular to the meridian at altitude 50°
                    41' (nearly that of the middle point between Beachy Head and Dunnose), was found
                    to be 61,182·3 fathoms, = 367,093∙8 feet; and hence the degree of longitude at
                    the two stations (which is found by multiplying the degree of the perpendicular
                    circle by the cosine of the latitude) was obtained as follows: Beachy Head
                    232,312 feet, Dunnose 232,914 feet, the assumed latitudes being respectively 50°
                    44' 24" and 50° 37' 7". These results are respectively greater by about 772 feet
                    than the corresponding degrees on the spheroid, which best represents the whole
                    of the measured arcs of meridian, and of which the elements are given in <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Figure of τηε Eλrth,</hi> p. 563.</p>
                <p>In order to mark permanently the two important stations of Beachy Head and
                    Dunnose, an iron gun was inserted in the ground at each of the places, having
                    the diameter of the bore in the same vertical line with the point over which the
                    axis of the instrument had been placed. Unfortunately this precaution did not
                    prove sufficient; for when Captain Kater was about to remeasure the angles at
                    Beachy Head in 1826, the gun was not to be found. <hi rend="italic">“In
                    consequence of some misapprehension,</hi> it had been removed along with some
                    old guns which were formerly near that place, and thus one of the valuable parts
                    of the survey of Great Britain was irrecoverably lost.” (Phil. Trans. 1828, p.
                    154.)</p>
                <p>The account of the survey for the years 1791-4 inclusive, in addition to the
                    particulars now stated, gives also the latitudes and longitudes of a great
                    number of places determined by intersections made from the principal stations,
                    and referred to the meridian of Greenwich, or, if towards the western extremity
                    of the series, to that of Dunnose. At all the principal stations the angles of
                    elevation and depression were observed; and these observations being reciprocal,
                    gave not only the relative altitudes of the stations, but also the mean
                    refractions, assuming the spherical surface of the earth. With a view to obtain
                    the absolute altitudes, the height of the station at Dunnose above low water was
                    ascertained by levelling down to the sea-shore near Shanklin, a distance of
                    about a mile. The mean refractions were found to vary from <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> th to <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 15</hi> th of the contained
                    arc. It was also noticed, that the relative heights deduced from elevations and
                    depressions cannot always be depended upon (on account of the variable state of
                    the refraction) to less than about ten feet, even supposing them to be the mean
                    of two or three independent results, except, perhaps, reciprocal observations
                    are made at the same instant of time. the observations from which the relative
                    altitudes were deduced were made on cloudy days, or towards the evenings, when
                    the tremulous motion of the air is commonly the least.</p>
                <p>During the years 1795 and 1796, the triangulation was continued from the stations
                    near the base on Salisbury Plain, along the coasts of Dorsetshire, Devonshire,
                    and Cornwall, to the Land’s End, as it was considered desirable to have an early
                    determination of the latitudes and longitudes of the great headlands in the
                    channel, and also of the Scilly Isles. The details of the operations, including
                    the calculations of the side of the principal triangles, the heights of the
                    stations, the mean refractions, the distances of a great number of intersected
                    objects from the principal stations, are given in the Philosophical Transactions
                    for 1797, and form the last part of the first volume of the Trigonometrical
                    Survey. The same paper also contains the bearings and distances from the
                    meridian and parallels, and also the latitudes and longitudes of a number of
                    places observed in Kent in 1795, with a smaller theodolite (half the size of the
                    principal one), for the purpose of completing the map of that county.</p>
                <p>The next account of the operations connected with the Ordnance survey is
                    contained in the Philosophical Transactions for 1800, and is given in the name
                    of Captain William Mudge alone, Mr Dalby having now retired from the service.
                    This account describes the operations in 1797, 1798, and 1799, and is divided
                    into three sections of which the first contains the calculations of the sides of
                    the principal and secondary triangles extended over the country in those three
                    years, together with an account of the measurement of a new base line on
                    Sedgmoor. The second section contains the computed latitudes and longitudes of
                    those places on the western coast which had been intersected in 1795 and 1796,
                    and also of such other places as were found conveniently situated in respect of
                    three new meridians, the determination of which forms part of the present
                    account. The last section contains the triangles which were carried over Essex,
                    the western parts of Kent, and portions of the counties adjoining Kent, Suffolk,
                    and Hertfordshire.</p>
                <p>With respect to the determination of meridians, just alluded to, it is to be
                    observed, that by reason of the curvature of the earth, and the errors
                    consequently arising from computing on the supposition that the earth is a
                    plane, it becomes necessary that the direction of the meridian be determined
                    anew where the operations are extended over distances of about sixty miles in an
                    eastern or western direction. The distance from Dover to Land’s End is somewhat
                    about 300 miles, and between these places five intermediate meridians were
                    observed, dividing the distance into six nearly equal parts. These were Beachy
                    Head and Dunnose (already mentioned), Black Down in Dorsetshire, Butterton Hill
                    in Devonshire, and St Agnes Beacon in Cornwall. In computing the longitudes and
                    latitudes, the places were of course referred to the nearest of those meridians;
                    and a place in the middle between two was referred to both, and the mean of the
                    results taken.</p>
                <p>The operations of 1797 commenced with the observation of the pole-star at Black
                    Down, early in April; and in the course of the summer the great theodolite was
                    taken to twenty-one other stations, at which the angles were determined, all
                    included between the meridian of that station and St Agnes Beacon. It was judged
                    inexpedient to carry <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=377" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0377-0357"
                    />the operations from this point into the north of Devonshire until a new base
                    had been measured, the triangles at present being dependent upon those made in
                    Cornwall in the previous year.</p>
                <p>In 1798 a series of secondary triangles was observed for completing the survey of
                    Kent and Essex; but the principal operation of this year consisted in the
                    measurement of a new base of verification on King’s Sedgmoor in Somersetshire.
                    This new measurement was conducted in the same manner, generally, as those of
                    the former bases; but on account of the irregularity of the ground, which was
                    cut up in all directions by numerous ditches and large drains, it was thought
                    expedient to have a new chain of fifty feet; and accordingly one was prepared by
                    Ramsden, similar in construction to the two 100 feet chains used at Hounslow
                    Heath and Salisbury Plain. This new chain was not used for the whole of the
                    measurement, but only in a few cases when the handles of the 100 feet chain
                    would have had their places over ditches, or in situations in which there would
                    not have been the means of correctly placing the register heads under the
                    handles. The measuring chains were compared with the standard, not before the
                    measurement commenced, but after it had considerably advanced, and again at the
                    end of the operation; and it was assumed that the length of the standard chain
                    had remained unaltered since its last determinadon by Ramsden. The reduced
                    length of the base was 27,680 feet, or nearly 5¼ miles; and it was supposed by
                    General Mudge that the error cannot exceed nine inches.</p>
                <p>The next account which we have of the survey is contained in a paper which was
                    read before the Royal Society in June 1804, entitled “An Account of the
                    Measurement of an Arc of the Meridian, extending from Dunnose in the Isle of
                    Wight, to Clifton in Yorkshire, by Major W. Mudge.” This forms part of the
                    second volume of the Survey. The measurement of an arc of the meridian was
                    contemplated from the commencement of the survey, but had been delayed for some
                    years on account of the zenith sector, with which the celestial arc was to be
                    determined, not having been completed by Mr Ramsden, whose health was then
                    declining, and who in fact died before the instrument was entirely finished.</p>
                <p>For the purpose of determining the figure and dimensions of the earth by the
                    measurement of meridional arcs, it is important that the arc be of considerable
                    length, in order to diminish the influence of any error in the determination of
                    the difference of the latitudes of its extreme points. On looking at the map of
                    Great Britain, it will be seen that the longest meridional line contained in it,
                    is one which passes from Lyme in Dorsetshire, northward into Scotland, and
                    terminates at Aberdeen, comprehending an arc of nearly 4° 47'. This line,
                    therefore, presented itself as the most eligible; but, on a closer examination,
                    it was found that the arc would run through a country abounding in hills of
                    considerable magnitude, and consequently that no advantage would probably be
                    gained from observing the zenith distances of stars at any of the intermediate
                    stations, on account of the irregular local attraction. General Mudge therefore
                    selected the meridional line passing from Dunnose to the mouth of the Tees, as
                    being the freest from apparent obstructions, and of sufficient length. The
                    choice of Dunnose as the terminal station likewise presented a considerable
                    advantage; for that station having been connected with the Royal Observatory by
                    the previous operations, the astronomical observations made there would serve to
                    correct the latitudes of the places formerly determined. The point selected for
                    the northern extremity was Clifton, a small village in the vicinity of
                    Doncaster, nearly on the meridian pf Dunnose; and a level of sufficient extent
                    for the measurement of a base of verification was found at Misterton Carr, in
                    the northern part of Lincolnshire. The two extreme stations were connected by a
                    chain of twenty-two triangles, lying nearly in the direction of the line to be
                    measured. Of these triangles, eleven, extending from Dunnose to Arbury Hill,
                    near the middle of the line, had been already observed, and their sides computed
                    from the Hounslow Heath base. The angles of the remaining eleven were observed
                    in the years 1811 and 1802, and the distances computed from the new base.</p>
                <p>The base on Misterton Carr was measured in the summer of 1802, by the same
                    apparatus, and exactly according to the same methods as had been employed in the
                    three former bases, on Hounslow Heath, Salisbury Plain, and Sedgmoor. Previously
                    to the commencement of the operations, the measuring chains (the hundred feet
                    and fifty feet ) were both compared with the standard chain; and a similar
                    comparison was made after the work was completed. It was assumed that the length
                    of the standard chain was the same as when it had been compared by Mr Ramsden;
                    an assumption which was subsequently proved to be correct (within very small
                    limits) by a new comparison of the standard chain with Ramsden’s brass scale.
                    The extremities of the base were marked by two large blocks of oak sunk into the
                    ground, having each a square hole in its upper surface, into which lead was
                    cast, and ground to a smooth plane; and the diagonals of the holes being drawn
                    on the lead, the intersections of the diagonals formed the terminal points.
                    After making the necessary reductions for temperature, the wear of the chains,
                    ,&amp;c. the true length of the base at temperature 62° was found — 2G,342∙7
                    feet. No reduction was made for height above the sea, the altitude of the ground
                    on which the base was horizontally measured being only thirty-five feet above
                    the surface of the sea in the mouth of the Humber at <hi rend="italic">half
                    tide.</hi> As the correct determination of this base was of great importance,
                    every precaution was taken in the course of the operations, and General Mudge
                    was of opinion that the error of the measurement in excess or defect could not
                    exceed two inches.</p>
                <p>On computing the first eleven triangles, beginning at Dunnose, the distance
                    between the stations at Corley and Arbury Hill, near the middle of the arc, was
                    found to be 117,463 feet; and this depended on the bases on Hounslow Heath and
                    Salisbury Plain. On computing directly from the measured base at Misterton Carr,
                    the remaining eleven triangles, the same distance between Corley and Arbury Hill
                    was found to be 117,457·1 feet. The difference, therefore, falls short of six
                    feet; but this cannot be regarded, as great, when it is considered that the
                    distance between the two stations is rather more than twenty-two miles, and that
                    the whole line from Dunnose to Clifton is nearly 200 miles. Had the computation
                    been carried on from Dunnose all the way to Clifton, the length of the base on
                    Misterton Carr, deduced from those of Hounslow Heath and Salisbury Plain, would
                    have been found to be about one foot greater than its measured length.</p>
                <p>The whole terrestrial distance between the parallels of the two stations was
                    computed by the method of parallels and perpendiculars, with reference to the
                    meridians of both the extreme stations. The bearings of certain sides of the
                    triangles from the meridian of Dunnose were deduced from the observed angles;
                    and the sides being respectively multiplied into the cosines of the bearings,
                    gave the distances on the meridian; the sum of which distances, of course, was
                    the length of the meridional arc, or rather the sum of the twenty-two chords
                    deduced from the sides of the triangles. This method proceeds on the supposition
                    of the earth’s surface, to some distance on both sides of the line, being plane;
                    but as the triangles ran nearly north and south, and most of them were
                    intersected by the meridian, and, moreover, as the distance between the
                    meridians of the two extreme stations was only a few feet, the supposition leads
                    to no sensible error. General Mudge states that he <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=378" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0378-0358"
                    />took the trouble to calculate the length of the whole line, by increasing each
                    portion computed from the sides of the triangles by the difference between the
                    chord and its arc, and that the result only exceeded the former computation by
                    about two and a half feet.</p>
                <p>The whole length of the arc, from Dunnose to the parallel of Clifton, was found
                    to be 1,036,337 feet; from Dunnose to the point over which the sector was placed
                    at Arbury Hill, 586,319∙5 feet; and, consequently, from the parallel of Arbury
                    Hill to that of Clifton, 450,017∙5 feet.</p>
                <p>The geodetical part of the operation being completed, it still remained to
                    determine the amplitude of the celestial arc. The instrument employed for the
                    purpose was a zenith sector, contrived and executed in greater part by Ramsden.
                    A description of this superb instrument would here be out of place; but it may
                    be proper to state the general principle of its construction. The object being
                    to measure the zenith distances of stars which pass near the zenith (in order to
                    diminish the effects of refraction), the sector is constructed by suspending a
                    telescope nearly vertical, and in such a manner that its axis shall have a
                    motion in a vertical plane, extending to only a few degrees on each side of the
                    vertical. From the axis of motion, which is placed very near the top of the
                    telescope, a plummet is suspended by a very fine wire; and on the lower end of
                    the telescope a scale is placed in the plane of the motion, and directly before
                    the plummet. Now, it will be obvious, that as the telescope carries the scale
                    along with it when it is moved in the vertical plane, while the plummet remains
                    at rest, the angular deviation of the axis of the telescope from the vertical
                    will be measured on the scale. It is necessary that the instrument be capable of
                    being turned half round in azimuth, for the sake of reversion. When in use, the
                    plane of the sector is placed in the meridian at one extremity of the arc, and
                    the zenith distances of some stars at their meridian passage observed. It is
                    then transported to the other extremity, and the zenith distances of the same
                    stars are there also observed; and the mean difference of these distances is the
                    amplitude of the arc, which is by this means obtained immediately and
                    independently of the latitudes of the stations or declinations of the stars. The
                    telescope of the sector in question was nearly eight feet long, and had an
                    object-glass of four inches in diameter.</p>
                <p>The sector, after some preliminary examination at the Tower, was first set up at
                    the Royal Observatory, for the purpose of observing the zenith distances of some
                    stars to be afterwards observed at Dunnose, in order to determine the latitude
                    of that station. It was then, in the spring of 1802, removed to Dunnose, where
                    it was set up, at a distance of about six and a half feet from the station where
                    the azimuth had been observed in 1791. The whole number of stars observed was
                    twenty-seven; and a sufficient number of observations having been obtained by
                    the end of June, the sector was then transported to Clifton, where seventeen of
                    the same stars were observed. Subsequently, in the same year, the instrument was
                    set up at the station at Arbury Hill, which is very nearly at the middle of the
                    arc, and where twelve of the stars which had been seen at Clifton were observed.
                    In October the party returned to London, and it was found, on examination, that
                    the sector was in as perfect a state as when first sent into the field, so that
                    no error was to be apprehended from derangement or injury during transportation
                    to the different stations.</p>
                <p>On computing the observations, the final results were found to be as follows
                    (Measurement of an Arc of Meridian, Trigonometrical Survey, vol. ii. p.
                    107):</p>
                <p>Mean amplitude of the celestial arc between Dunnose and Clifton 2° <hi

                    between Dunnose and Greenwich 0 51 31 ∙39</p>
                <p>For the deductions from those amplitudes combined with the above geodetical
                    measures relative to the degree of the meridian, we refer to the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Figure of the Earth,</hi> p. 563. It is however to be remarked,
                    that since the publication of that article, a paper by the celebrated astronomer
                    Bessel has appeared in <hi rend="italic">the Astronomische Nachrichten</hi>
                    (vol. xiv. No. 336), in which an error is pointed out in the determination of
                    the celestial arc. It appears that one of the stars (<hi rend="italic">α</hi>
                    Aurigae), observed at all the stations, was incorrectly reduced to the beginning
                    of 1802; and that the error (which probably arose from applying the correction
                    tor nutation with a wrong sign) amounted to 18". On correcting this error, and
                    deducing the mean result by a more exact method of reduction, Bessel finds the
                    amplitudes to be respectively as under:</p>
                <p>Dunnose to Clifton 2° 50' 23"∙497</p>
                <p>to Arbury Hill 1 36 20 ∙398 to Greenwich 0 51 31 ∙667 Adopting the above
                    amplitudes as corrected by Bessel, and assuming (according to the measurement)
                    the distance between Dunnose and Clifton to be 1,036,337 feet, the length of a
                    degree of the meridian at the latitude of the middle point (5’2° 2' 26") will be
                    found — 364,925·25 feet, or 60,820∙88 fathoms of the scale to which all the
                    measures given in the survey are referred. General Mudge states this distance to
                    be 60,820 fathoms. The length of the degree at the middle point of the arc
                    between Dunnose and Arbury Hill being found in like manner, gave 60,864 fathoms,
                    exceeding the above by forty-four fathoms. But as this latitude is farther to
                    the south, the length of the degree ought, on the supposition of the earth’s
                    compression, to be less by about nine or ten fathoms. This anomaly, presented by
                    the measurement, is usually ascribed to a deflection of the plumb-line of the
                    sector, occasioned by local attraction.</p>
                <p>The third volume of the Trigonometrical Survey appeared in 1811, under the joint
                    names of Colonel Mudge and Captain Colby. It contains an account of the progress
                    of the survey from 1800 to 1809 inclusive, and, when taken in connection with
                    the accounts previously published, comprises the survey of almost all England,
                    the south of Wales, and a part of Scotland. The volume embraces a great variety
                    of interesting topographical matter. It gives the angles observed with the great
                    theodolite at the principal stations; the calculation of the sides of the
                    triangles, amounting in number to 281; the elevations and depressions of the
                    stations, as seen from each other; a description of the situation of the
                    stations; an account of the measurement of a new base on Rhuddlan Marsh, near St
                    Asaph, in North Wales; and the prolongation of the arc of meridian from Clifton
                    northward to Burleigh Moor in Yorkshire. It likewise contains the computed
                    altitudes of the stations, and of many other remarkable hills, and also the
                    latitudes and longitudes of all the principal places in the country.</p>
                <p>The base on Rhuddlan Marsh was measured in October 1800, with the apparatus so
                    often referred to in the preceding statement. After the necessary reductions
                    were applied, its true length at temperature 62° was found to be 24,514·26 feet.
                    The ground was a flat about four miles north-west of St Asaph, and its mean
                    height above low-water mark being only twenty-five feet, no reduction was
                    requisite for height above the sea. In proof of the agreement between the
                    present and the former measurements, the following instances are given.
                    Computing from the base on Misterton Carr, the distance between Castle Ring and
                    Weaver Hill (two stations in Staffordshire) was found to be 111,144∙1 feet; the
                    same distance deduced from the triangulation proceeding from the new base in
                    Rhuddlan Marsh was 111,148·4; whence the difference between the two results in a
                    line exceeding twenty-one miles is only 4∙3 feet. Again, the distance from May
                    Hill to the station on Malvern Hills, depending on the Hounslow Heath base, was
                    found = 82,260 <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=379"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0379-0359"/>feet; the same distance, found by computing from
                    the Rhuddlan Marsh base, was 82,201·1 feet; the difference being thus 8·9 feet.
                    From this base several series of triangles were carried in different directions.
                    One series extended to Anglesea, and thence by Snowdown, down the western coast
                    of Wales, joining, near Abcrystwith, a series proceeding from the triangles
                    formerly observed in Gloucestershire. A second series proceeded southward from
                    the base, and joined the southern triangles in Glamorganshire. A third series
                    branched out towards the cast, and united with those proceeding westward from
                    the base on Misterton Carr; and a fourth series was carried from the Rhuddlan
                    Marsh base, through Lancashire, Westmoreland, and Cumberland, into Scotland, and
                    connected with another series extending from the Misterton Carr base, through
                    Yorkshire and Northumberland, and the east part of Scotland, as far as the north
                    side of the Frith of Forth.</p>
                <p>In the different series of triangles now mentioned, the third angle of the
                    triangle was not observed in many instances, the peculiar character of the
                    country rendering it impracticable, or at least very difficult, to carry the
                    large theodolite to the station. It is stated in the preface to the volume, that
                    “with an instrument so excellent as that used in the survey, except for the
                    purpose of intersecting surrounding objects, it is perhaps not necessary to
                    adhere tenaciously to the practice of observing the third angle of every
                    triangle.” Notwithstanding this opinion, we think it is much to be regretted
                    that the important verification obtained from the observation of the third angle
                    should have been dispensed with on any account whatever; and in fact the
                    observation of many of those very angles, and a consequent recomputation of the
                    sides, have since been found necessary, in order to reconcile the results.</p>
                <p>One of the most interesting portions of the volume is the account of the
                    extension of the arc of meridian northward from Clifton to Burleigh Moor, a
                    place situated about three miles north from the town of Gisborough in Yorkshire.
                    In July 1806, the sector was erected at this station, and the zenith distances
                    of several stars observed. The observations were reduced to the first of January
                    1806, and those formerly made at Dunnose having been reduced to the same epoch,
                    the mean of the whole gave the difference of latitude between the parallels of
                    Dunnose and Burleigh Moor = 3° 57' 13''·1. The terrestrial distance between the
                    parallels of the two places was calculated both on the meridian of the station
                    at Burleigh Moor and on that of Dunnose, and the mean of the two results was
                    found = 1,442,852∙5 feet. This determination agrees very closely with the former
                    determination of the arc between Dunnose and Clifton; for it has been stated
                    that, in respect of that arc, the terrestrial distance was 1.036,337 feet, and
                    the amplitude of the corresponding arc in the heavens = 2° 50’ 23''∙38; and
                    assuming the length of the arc to be proportional to its amplitude (which is not
                    sensibly erroneous for an arc of three or four degrees), the difference of the
                    latitudes of Dunnose and Burleigh Moor will be found by a simple proportion = 3°
                    57' 18"∙6. But the difference of the latitudes, as determined by the sector
                    observations, was 3° 57 <hi rend="italic">'</hi> 13"· 1, and therefore
                    disagreeing only to the extent of half a second, or about fifty feet on the
                    ground. The resulting length of the meridional degree at the mean latitude is
                    364,943 feet.</p>
                <p>Another determination of the length of a meridional degree was obtained by
                    erecting the sector at the station of Delamere Forest, in Cheshire, about five
                    miles north of Tarporley. Eight of the stars which had been observed at Dunnose
                    were observed at this station; and the mean of the observations gave 2° 36' 12"·
                    2 as the difference in latitude between the stations on Dunnose and Delamere
                    Forest. The direction of the meridian was likewise observed at this station, and
                    the bearing of one side of a triangle thereby determined; which being carried
                    through the series of triangles connecting Delamere Forest with Black Down in
                    Dorsetshire, the distance between the parallels of Dunnose and Delamere Forest
                    was found = 925,188∙5 feet. By carrying on the calculation through the same
                    series of triangles, but with an azimuth determined at a different station, the
                    distance between the parallels was obtained = 925,180·7 feet. The mean is
                    925,184∙6 feet. Now if we seek an arc having the same proportion to the arc
                    between Dunnose and Burleigh Moor which the distance between those stations has
                    to this distance, we shall find 2° 36' 13"∙2 for the amplitude. But the
                    amplitude derived from the sector observations is 2° 36' 12''∙2. Hence the
                    difference between the observed and computed amplitude is only 1", which
                    corresponds to an error of 0"∙4 in one degree. The agreement may be considered
                    as satisfactory; but by reason of the distance of Dunnose from the meridian of
                    Delamere, this determination of the length of the meridional arc cannot be
                    admitted as of equal certainty with that of the meridian of Burleigh Moor, in
                    any deductions relative to the figure of the earth. The result, however, gives
                    60,823 fathoms, or 364,938 feet, for the length of a meridional degree in
                    latitude 53° 34', or nearly the centre of Englund.</p>
                <p>It would far exceed our limits to give a detailed description of the immense mass
                    of observations and results contained in this volume, and it is beside our
                    purpose to enter into any critical examination of its contents. In a work of
                    such magnitude, and abounding with such a multiplicity of minute details, it
                    will not be expected that errors can be entirely avoided; and a considerable
                    number, it must be admitted, have found their way into the volume. In some
                    respects, also, the deductions have not been made so as to furnish results
                    possessing all the accuracy possible to be attained by means of the improved
                    science of the present day; but it is to be observed, that many of the more
                    refined methods of calculation have been introduced into the practice of geodesy
                    since the volume was published. The method of assigning weights to the several
                    results, of estimating the probable errors, and applying corrections according
                    to an uniform fixed rule derived from the theory of chances, and thereby
                    avoiding arbitrary adjustments, was then scarcely known. It is due, however, to
                    the present able and enlightened superintendent of the survey to state, that all
                    these less perfect methods of computation and reduction have long been
                    abandoned, and that every advantage which can be derived from the refined
                    theories of Gauss and Bessel has been brought to bear on the work; and we have
                    little doubt, that when the next account of it shall appear, the scientific
                    skill displayed in the reductions will be found to be quite on a par with the
                    instrumental precision.</p>
                <p>The preceding abstract brings down the history of the survey to the end of the
                    year 1809, and we regret that our account must here be brought to a conclusion;
                    for although the work has continued to be prosecuted with more or less
                    intermission since that time, no further detailed account has been given to the
                    public. It may not be without interest, however, to state generally a few
                    particulars respecting its subsequent progress.</p>
                <p>Since 1809, the prosecution of the survey has been placed under the able
                    direction of Colonel Colby of the Royal Engineers. The triangulation which had
                    been carried to the south-east part of Scotland, as far as the Frith of Forth,
                    was first continued along the east coast to the borders of Ross-shire, and
                    subsequently extended to the Shetland Islands. A series was also carried from
                    the Cumberland triangles, along the western coast, through Dumfriesshire, and to
                    the summit of Ben Lomond, connecting all the remarkable points in Perthshire. In
                    1817 a base of verification was measured with the steel chains by Colonel Colby,
                    on Belhelvie Links, near Aberdeen. Shortly after this, the <pb break="no"

                    />survey of Scotland was interrupted for a number of years, and the scene of
                    operations transferred to Ireland, an accurate survey of that country being
                    considered, from political reasons, as of more urgent importance.</p>
                <p>The Ordnance survey of Ireland is perhaps the most complete operation of the kind
                    that has ever been executed in any country. Hitherto the different bases of
                    verification had all been measured with the same apparatus, and according to the
                    same methods, as were used on Hounslow Heath; but doubts having arisen
                    respecting the accuracy attainable by means of the steel chains, Colonel Colby,
                    on entering upon this new field, resolved to have recourse to an entirely
                    different method of proceeding, and, instead of chains, to adopt the ingenious
                    compensating apparatus which has been described in <hi rend="smallcaps">Figure
                    of τηε Earth,</hi> p. 553. By this method, metallic bars of ten feet in length,
                    and defined by points whose distance remains invariable in all temperatures, are
                    placed accurately along the line to be measured; and the distance between the
                    terminal points of the preceding and following bars is measured by a micrometer
                    microscope, with a certainty altogether unattainable by measuring rods abutting
                    against each other, or by observing the coincidence of straight lines on the
                    handles of the steel chains. The ground selected for the base lies on the east
                    shore of Lough Foyle, on the north coast of Ireland, and the line itself forms
                    part of a straight line drawn from Shaw Mountain to Mount Sandy, nearly north
                    and south. The whole line measured was nearly eight miles in length. For a
                    verification, it was divided into two parts, one about half the length of the
                    other, and the length of the one deduced from the other in various ways by
                    triangulation. By this means it was estimated that the greatest possible error
                    could not exceed two inches. It was also prolonged by triangulation from the
                    north end to Mount Sandy, whereby two additional miles were given to it, so that
                    it may be considered as a base of ten miles, the probable accuracy of the last
                    part being quite as great as that of the part determined by the actual
                    application of the measuring bars. From this base a series of triangles
                    commenced, which proceeded all over the island, and were connected with those
                    formerly observed in Wales, the Isle of Man, the west coast of Scotland, and the
                    Hebrides. Some of these triangles were of enormous extent, the sides exceeding a
                    hundred miles.</p>
                <p>The survey of Ireland having been completed, at least so far as regards the
                    primary triangles, that of Scotland was recommenced in 1838, and has already
                    been carried from the eastern counties westward to the island of Lewis in the
                    north. At the present time (1840), surveying parties are also employed at
                    different places in Wales and the north of England, in observing the angles
                    which had formerly been omitted, and verifying others which had not been
                    satisfactorily observed.</p>
                <p>We cannot conclude this brief and imperfect sketch without alluding to the
                    admirable maps which have been published from time to time, and are now in
                    progress. These are all designed from the materials collected in the field, and
                    are not only drawn, but also engraved and printed, at the Ordnance Map Offices
                    in the Tower, and at Dublin. Of the maps of England, thirty-eight counties,
                    embracing all the southern part of the island, have now been published, engraved
                    on a scale of one inch to the mile. The maps of Ireland, of which eighteen
                    counties arc published, are given on the magnificent scale of six inches to the
                    mile, and not only exhibit, with the utmost distinctness, the natural features
                    of the country, but even the minutest topographical details. This series of maps
                    forms a splendid national work; and as no part of the map of Scotland has yet
                    been engraved, we trust that the whole of that country will be given on the same
                    scale.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>From the

                    operations, it is necessary to determine the relation of this unit to other
                    known measures.</p>
                <p>General Roy’s measurement of the Hounslow Heath base was performed with glass
                    rods, on which lengths of twenty feet had been set off by Ramsden, from a
                    standard scale, which is described “as a finely divided brass scale of the
                    length of forty-two inches, with a Vernier’s division of 100 at one end and one
                    of fifty at the other, whereby the thousandth part of an inch is perceptible. It
                    was originally the property of Mr Graham, the celebrated watchmaker; has the
                    name of Jonathan Sisson engraved on it, but was known to be divided by Bird.”
                    From this scale the measure was transferred to the glass rods as follows. A deal
                    plank upwards of thirty feet long, nine or ten inches broad, and about three
                    inches thick, was set up edgewise on stands, and planed perfectly straight and
                    smooth. A silver wire was then stretched along the middle of the edge from one
                    end to the other, and six distances of forty inches each were marked off by the
                    side of the wire, at which points brass pins were driven into the wood, and
                    their tops polished. A fine dot being then made on one of the extreme pins, and
                    the silver wire being stretched over the dot and the middle of the other pins,
                    the extent of forty inches was, with the utmost care, taken from the scale, by
                    means of a pair of beam-compasses, whose micrometer screw shewed very
                    perceptibly a motion of the 5000th part of an inch, and transferred to the
                    following brass pin on the plank. In this manner all the six lengths were laid
                    off. Two brass rectangular cheeks were then placed on the plank so as to bisect
                    the two extreme dots, and present relatively to each other surfaces perfectly
                    parallel. The glass rods were then placed between the cheeks, and the bell-metal
                    buttons which formed their extremities ground down until the length (determined
                    by the coincidence of a fine line on the glass rod with another on the moveable
                    apparatus on the extremity of the rod) was accurately fitted between the cheeks,
                    and was consequently twenty feet of the brass scale.</p>
                <p>The scale which it has been usual of late years to adopt in works of science as
                    the standard of English measure, goes by the name of Sir George Shuckburgh’s
                    scale, and is described at length in the Phil. Trans. for 1798. The relation
                    between this scale and several other standards was investigated by Captain
                    Kater, whose experiments and results are given in the Phil. Trans. for 1821.
                    From these experiments it was found that thirty-six inches of General Roy’s
                    scale are equal to 36∙000930 inches of Sir George Shuckburgh’s; whence, in order
                    to reduce distances expressed in terms of General Roy’s scale to Sir George
                    Shuckburgh’s, we must multiply by ∙9999742.</p>
                <p>Now it has been stated that the length of the Hounslow Heath base, as measured by
                    the glass rods, was found to be 27404∙98 feet. Using the above multiplier, the
                    same distance expressed in terms of Shuckburgh’s scale is 27403∙38 feet.</p>

                <p>In the Ordnance survey, all the bases, excepting the recent one in Ireland, were
                    measured with a steel chain, which was compared from time to time, generally
                    before and after the operation, with a similar steel chain of 100 feet, which
                    was not otherwise used in the measurement. The primary measure in this case was
                    a brass standard forty-inch scale, belonging to Mr Ramsden, and not General
                    Roy’s. From this standard, six lengths of forty inches were transferred, by
                    means of the beam-compass, to a prismatic bar of cast iron, into which brass
                    points were inserted at the proper distances, so that the bar formed a measure
                    of twenty feet. In order to transfer this to the steel chain, a portion of the
                    chain was placed on rollers exactly parallel to the iron bar, and stretched, as
                    in the measurement of the several bases, with a weight of fifty-six pounds. From
                    the extreme points on the edge of the bar, marking the distance of twenty feet,
                    fine wire plummets were suspended, so as nearly to touch the chain. One end of
                    the chain, determined by a fine line drawn on the brass handle, being then
                    brought under the wire by means of an adjusting screw, a point coinciding with
                    the other wire was made in the chain. This part of the chain was then shifted,
                    and another twenty feet measured in the same manner; and thus the whole chain
                    was determined at five successive operations.</p>
                <p>The brass scale which was used in this operation is supposed to be lost, but the
                    prismatic bar is still in existence, and forms, therefore, the only authentic
                    standard of the survey, the standard steel chain being probably liable to some
                    alteration from rust or wear at the joints. This bar was also examined by
                    Captain Kater, who found the mean yard on it to be equal to 36·00254 inches of
                    Shuckburgh’s scale. Assuming this determination to be correct, it follows that
                    every distance given in the Ordnance survey, in order to be expressed in terms
                    of Shuckburgh’s scale, must be multiplied by ∙9999694. Now the Hounslow Heath
                    base was found by the measurement with the steel chains to be 27,404·3165 feet
                    of Ramsden’s standard scale. The length, therefore, in terms of Sir George
                    Shuckburgh’s scale, is 27,402∙38 feet.</p>
                <p>It thus appears that the two measurements of this important base, when reduced to
                    the same standard, give the following results:</p>
                <p>with the glass rods 27,403∙38 feet, with the steel chain 27,402∙38 feet.</p>
                <p>The difference is one foot, which is larger than can well be considered probable,
                    supposing the steel measuring chain to have been exactly five times the length
                    of each of the glass rods. In the account of the survey, the difference is
                    stated to be 2¾ inches; but this was on the supposition that the two standards
                    were precisely of the same length.</p>
                <p>Prior to Captain Kater’s experiments, it had been assumed, from some comparisons
                    with an intermediate scale belonging to the Royal Society, that Ramsden’s scale
                    exactly agreed with General Roy's. The latter states (Trigonometrical Survey,
                    vol. i. p. 16), that he placed the two scales (his own and the Society’s)
                    together on a table with thermometers alongside, and that after they had
                    remained in this position two days, Mr Ramsden carefully took a length) of three
                    feet from the Royal Society’s standard with his beam-compasses, and applied it
                    to the other scale, and it was found to reach <hi rend="italic">exactly</hi> to
                    thirty-six inches, the temperature being 65°. In like manner, when the length of
                    the steel chains was determined, Mr Ramsden compared his own brass standard with
                    that of the Royal Society, “and after the two standards had been allowed to
                    remain together about twenty-four hours, they were found to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >precisely</hi> of the same length.” The temperature is not stated. Now this
                    perfect agreement leads to the inference that the comparisons were not made with
                    the requisite care, or that the means employed were insufficient,<note

                    excellent paper by Mr Baily in the ninth volume of the Memoirs of the Royal
                    Astronomical Society.</p></note> In fact, it was found by Captain Kater, that
                    the difference between General Roy’s scale and that of the Royal Society
                    amounted to ·00047 of an inch; a quantity, however, within the limits of the
                    distance measurable with the beam-compasses. The principal cause of the
                    difference between the two determinations of the base may probably be ascribed
                    to errors committed in transferring the length of the scale to the twenty-feet
                    iron prism; and perhaps also in part to an erroneous comparison of this rod with
                    Shuckburgh’s scale; for it is said that the points on the brass pins inserted in
                    the rod are so worn and enlarged by the application of the beam-compass as to
                    render any exact comparison impossible.</p>
                <p>the standard measure of the Irish base is a distance of ten feet, defined by two
                    fine points on a bar of cast. iron. We arc not acquainted with the length of the
                    mean foot in terms of Shuckburgh’s scale; but as none of the results yet
                    published are given in terms of this base, its accurate length, in relation to
                    other standards, is at present unimportant.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the Stations tend the Signals.</hi></p>
                <p>In conducting a survey over an extensive country, the choice of stations must in
                    a great measure be determined by the nature of the ground; for it Is obvious
                    that signals can only be erected at places mutually visible from each other. But
                    although the natural irregularities of the surface of the ground render an
                    entirely arbitrary disposition of the signals impracticable, there will
                    frequently be room for a choice between two or more points; and it is therefore
                    important to determine the conditions which must be fulfilled, in order that the
                    inevitable errors of observation may have the least effect on the measured
                    distances.</p>
                <p>Let A, B, C be the three angles of a triangle, and <hi rend="italic">a, b, c</hi>
                    the sides respectively opposite. In each case the data are the three angles, and
                    one of the sides, as <hi rend="italic">a;</hi> and the elements to be calculated
                    are <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> the remaining Sides.
                    the question therefore is to determine the species of triangle, in order that
                    the computed lengths of <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                    may be the least affected by small indeterminate errors in the measurement of
                    the angles. Suppose each of the angles to have been observed, and let the errors
                    of observation be respectively <hi rend="italic">α</hi>, <hi rend="italic">β,
                    γ.</hi> When the sum of the observed angles differs from 180°, or rather from
                    180° + the spherical excess, each angle is corrected by applying to it one third
                    of the excess or defect. After the angles have thus been corrected, they still
                    remain affected with the errors of observation; but as the sum is now correct,
                    it is plain that the sum of the errors is nothing, or that <hi rend="italic"

                <p>It now remains to determine the conditions under which these expressions have the
                    smallest values. Since α 4- <hi rend="italic">β</hi> 4- 7 = 0, in every case two
                    of these quantities must have the same sign, and the third the opposite. If
                    therefore <hi rend="italic">α</hi> and <hi rend="italic">β</hi> are both
                    positive, 7 is negative; and if they are both negative, 7 is positive; so that
                    as 7 must of necessity be either positive or negative, there are only two
                    chances for <hi rend="italic">α</hi> and <hi rend="italic">β</hi> having the
                    same sign. In like manner, there are also two chances only for <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> and 7 having the same sign and <hi rend="italic">β</hi> the opposite,
                    and for <hi rend="italic">β</hi> and 7 having both the same sign and <hi
                    rend="italic">α</hi> the opposite. It thus appears, that for any two specified
                    errors, there are only two chances for both having the same sign, and four
                    chances for their having opposite signs; so that in the above expressions the
                    probability that <hi rend="italic">β</hi> and 7 are of opposite signs, is twice
                    as great as the probability of both having the same sign. Now if they have
                    opposite signs, both expressions will be diminished if cos. A be positive, that
                    is, if the third angle A be less than 90°, or less than a right angle. With
                    respect to the relation between B and C, which gives the smallest chances of
                    error, it may be assumed as probable that the two errors <hi rend="italic"
                    >β</hi> and 7, though they have opposite signs, will not differ greatly in
                    magnitude. But if they are nearly equal, the two expressions for the errors of
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and c will have the smallest values when B and C are
                    nearly equal. Hence the conditions which afford the greatest probability of the
                    smallest errors are these: 1. That the angle opposite to the measured side be
                    less than a right angle; and, 2. that the angles adjacent to that side be nearly
                    equal. These conditions will be best fulfilled on the average of a series, by
                    making the triangles as nearly as possible equilateral.</p>
                <p>If only two angles B and C have been observed, then there is the same probability
                    of <hi rend="italic">β</hi> and 7 having the same sign or opposite signs. In
                    this case the chance of smallest error is obtained by making cos. A = ft, that
                    is, when A is a right angle.</p>
                <p>In the earlier part of the British survey, the signals made use of were of
                    various kinds, but principally flag-staffs carrying reverberatory lamps, and
                    furnished with concave copper reflectors about nine or ten inches in diameter,
                    well polished and silvered, and enclosed in tin cases, having plates of ground
                    glass in front, to prevent the bad effects of unequal and unsteady light from
                    exposure to the wind. Such signals can be seen at the distance of twenty or
                    twenty-four miles. For more distant stations, Bengal or white lights were fixed
                    in small sockets, supported on a tripod of about five or six feet in height. By
                    means of a plummet, these could be readily placed precisely over the point
                    marking the station. The now well-known Drummond light (for the description of
                    which see Mr Drummond’s paper in the Phil. Trans, for 1826) was practically
                    applied as a night-signal at some of the stations in Ireland, and the west of
                    Scotland. But the difficulties and inconveniences of night-signals are so great,
                    and the observations attended with so much uncertainty from the unsteadiness and
                    scintillation of the light, that the practice of observing by night has of late
                    years been abandoned. At present the signals are usually formed by building a
                    conical pile of stones, in some instances exceeding twenty feet in diameter at
                    the base, over the point which marks the centre of the station. Such signals are
                    of course subject to this great inconvenience, that they can only be seen in
                    favourable states of the atmosphere; but in all other respects they are found
                    preferable to any others. In some of the late operations where the distances
                    were not very great, a plate of metal was used, having a narrow vertical slit
                    cut in it; and in this case the signal consists of the line of light passing
                    through the slit, and which can be rendered more brilliant by means of
                    reflectors suitably disposed. Colonel Colby has also on some occasions
                    successfully employed the <hi rend="italic">heliotrope;</hi> a method
                    recommended by Gauss, and which consists in throwing a beam of solar light upon
                    a distant station by reflexion from a small plane mirror, as that of a sextant
                    or reflecting circle. A description of this ingenious but not very convenient
                    method of forming signals for geodetical purposes is given in Zach’s <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Calculation of the Sides of the Triangles.</hi></p>
                <p>In measuring angular distances with the theodolite, the plane of the instrument
                    is carefully adjusted to the horizon, so that the angle observed is the
                    horizontal angle at the station; and, consequently, no previous reduction is
                    necessary, on account of the three summits of the triangle to be computed being
                    unequally distant from the earth’s centre, as is the case when the angles are
                    measured with a sextant or repeating circle. The practice which was always
                    followed in the Ordnance survey, of placing the centre of the theodolite
                    directly under the centre of the signal, also obviated the necessity of a
                    calculation for reducing the observed angle to the centre of the station.
                    Formulae for both these reductions will however be found in <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Figure of the Earth,</hi> p. 555.</p>
                <p>The three angles of any spherical triangle, as is well known, exceed 180° by a
                    certain quantity, called the <hi rend="italic">spherical excess,</hi> which is
                    proportional to the area of the triangle. Let A, B, C denote the angles of a
                    spherical triangle, <hi rend="italic">r</hi> the radius of the sphere expressed
                    in feet, <hi rend="italic">π</hi> = 3·14159 the ratio of the circumference to
                    the diameter, and S the number of square feet in the surface or area of the
                    triangle, then, by trigonometry,</p>
                <p>***S _ <hi rend="subscript"> ltj</hi> θ <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> r ⅛.</p>
                <p>Let E denote the spherical excess = A + B + C —180°, , ***_ S × 180°. , <hi
                    rend="subscript"> r</hi> SX 648000*</p>
                <p>then E = —— tn degrees, or L = ——— express ed in seconds. In any triangle which
                    can be measured on the surface of the earth, S is very small in comparison of r
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, and therefore E is a very small quantity. (In
                    practice it seldom exceeds four or five seconds, though in some of the large
                    triangles observed in the west of Scotland, whose sides exceed 100 miles, it
                    amounted to thirty or forty seconds.) Hence an approximate value of S will
                    enable us to compute E with sufficient precision. For this purpose, therefore,
                    the triangle may be regarded as a plane one; and on denoting by <hi
                    rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi> the number of feet in the sides respectively
                    opposite to A, B, C, we shall have for the area, S = ½ <hi rend="italic">ub</hi>
                    sin. C. Substituting this in the formula for the spherical excess, we get, in
                    seconds, <hi rend="italic subscript"> ***r</hi><hi rend="italic">, ab</hi> sin.

                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0383-0363"/> This formula is deduced on the hypothesis that
                    the triangle is on a spherical surface, but it applies also to triangles on the
                    surface of a spheroid; for it may be demonstrated that the spherical excess is
                    the same for triangles on a spheroid and on a sphere, when the latitudes of the
                    stations and their differences of longitudes are the same.</p>
                <p>In order to compute the spherical excess of any triangle, it is necessary to know
                    the value of <hi rend="italic">r</hi>, the radius of curvature of the spherical
                    surface. Now the curvature of the arc joining any two stations on a spheroid
                    varies with the latitude of the stations, and also with the direction of the arc
                    in question in respect of the meridian; but for the present purpose it will, in
                    general, be sufficient to assume the value of <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> which
                    corresponds to the curvature of the meridian at the mean latitude of the
                    stations, and even to suppose it constant for a whole series of triangles
                    contained between two parallels of latitude not distant more than a few degrees.
                    If, however, the triangles are very large, it may be necessary to compute more
                    accurately; and in such cases the nearest approximation to the true spherical
                    excess will be found by computing, for the mean latitude of the three stations,
                    the curvature of the meridian, and of the circle perpendicular to the meridian,
                    and taking the mean of the two for the value of <hi rend="italic">r</hi>; or,
                    which is nearly the same thing, by computing the radius of the vertical circle
                    which cuts the meridian at an angle of 45° at that mean latitude. As the
                    determination of the curvature of the meridian, the arc perpendicular to the
                    meridian, and the geodetical line making any oblique angle with the meridian,
                    are required for various other purposes connected with the survey as well as the
                    present, we shall here subjoin the formulae by which they are severally computed
                    from assumed dimensions and ellipticity of the earth.</p>

                    of the degrees of the meridian and perpendicular.</p>
                <p>Having computed the spherical excess Ε from approximate values of the lengths of
                    the sides (obtained by supposing the triangle a plane one), the sum of the three
                    observed angles should be = 180° + E. But as every observation is attended with
                    some degree of uncertainty, the probability is infinitely small that the sum
                    will be precisely equal to this quantity in any case. The difference (which in
                    general will amount to some seconds) is the error of the observed angles; and
                    the next question to be considered is, how should the error be apportioned among
                    the three angles, so that the probability of the result being true may be
                    greater than if any other mode of distribution were adopted? If no reason exists
                    for supposing that one angle has been determined more accurately than another,
                    the error should of course be equally divided among the three angles; but in
                    practice this is seldom the case, for it will usually happen that one or other
                    of the angles has been determined by a greater number of observations, or by
                    observations made under more favourable circumstances than the others, and
                    consequently the three determinations are not affected with the same probable
                    errors. In the earlier period of the Ordnance survey, and indeed so far as the
                    published account extends, the apportionment of the error appears to have been
                    made in a manner entirely arbitrary, or at least according to the observer’s
                    judgment of the relative goodness of the observations; but this objectionable
                    practice is now abandoned, and a uniform method, founded on the theory of
                    chances, adopted. Suppose several observations to have been made of the same
                    angle, and that the seconds of reading are <hi rend="italic">l</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">l' l'',</hi> &amp;c., and let <hi rend="italic">m</hi> be the
                    average or arithmetical mean of the whole; then <hi rend="italic">m — l, m — l',
                    m — l'',</hi> &amp;c., are the errors of the individual observations, and the
                    <hi rend="italic">weight</hi> of the determination, or of the average <hi
                    rend="italic">m,</hi> is equal to the square of the number of observations
                    divided by twice the sum of the squares of the errors. See. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Probability,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 635, No. 145. In this manner the <hi
                    rend="italic">weight</hi> is found for each angle, and the error of the
                    triangle, that is, the difference between the sum of the three angles (each
                    being the average of the observed values) and 180° + E, is divided into three
                    parts respectively proportioned to the reciprocal of the weights, which parts
                    form the corrections to be added to or subtracted from the angles to which they
                    respectively correspond. We have then three corrected spherical angles, the sum
                    of which is exactly 180° + E.</p>
                <p>The three spherical angles of the triangle being thus determined, the next step
                    in the operation is to compute the lengths of the two remaining sides; one side
                    being always known, either by the measurement of a base, or by the previous
                    computation of another triangle. Three different methods of computation have
                    been practised. That which first suggests itself is to transform the side whose
                    length is already known in feet, into an arc of a circle (which is done by
                    comparing it with the radius of the earth), and solving the triangle by the
                    usual formulae of spherical trigonometry. This was the method followed by
                    Boscovich in his measurement of the Italian arc of meridian; and it was also
                    practised in some instances by Delambre; but as it involves a somewhat tedious
                    process of calculation, it is not that which is generally adopted. As the
                    distance of any two stations mutually visible from each other is very small in
                    comparison of the whole circumference of the earth, the chord of the intercepted
                    arc will <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=384"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0384-0364"/>differ from the arc itself by a quantity which may
                    be computed from the known ratio of the chord to the radius of the earth, but
                    which in general is so small as to be insensible. If, therefore, from the
                    observed spherical angles we deduce in each case the corresponding angles formed
                    by the chords, and with these compute the sides by plane trigonometry, we shall
                    obtain the chords of the arcs intercepted between the stations, and thence the
                    arcs themselves or the true geodetical lines on the spheroid. On this principle
                    all the triangles of the Ordnance survey have been computed. A third method,
                    which has been followed in all the recent continental surveys, and which was
                    also adopted by Captain Kater in the verification of General Roy’s triangles,
                    depends on a theorem first demonstrated by Legendre; namely, that a triangle on
                    a sphere or spheroid, which is small in comparison of the whole spherical
                    surface, differs insensibly from a plane triangle of which the sides are
                    respectively equal in length to the sides of the triangle on the sphere, and
                    whose angles are respectively equal to those of the spherical triangle, each
                    diminished by one third of the spherical excess. We shall here give formulae for
                    the two last methods, with an example of their application.</p>

                <p>In like manner, the corrections are found for the two other horizontal angles B
                    and C, each being expressed in terms of the angle itself and its containing
                    sides. Let these corrections be respectively <hi rend="italic">x'</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">x",</hi> then it is evident that <hi rend="italic">x</hi> + <hi

                    and consequently, that when the true horizontal angles are respectively

                    sum of the three angles thus reduced will be exactly 180°. These reduced angles
                    are the angles for calculation; and on computing from them the sides, we obtain
                    the chords of the spherical arcs intercepted between the stations, whence the
                    arcs themselves are easily obtained by means of the following formula:</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> be any small arc in parts of the radius = 1; then
                    chord <hi rend="italic">2φ</hi> = 2 sin. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi>; but we have

                <p>In the last term of this expression the chord may be taken for the arc, and we
                    have therefore this rule for finding the arc in terms of the chord. Divide the
                    cube of the chord expressed in feet by twenty-four times the square of the
                    radius (in feet), and add the result to the computed length of the chord; the
                    sum is the corresponding length of the arc.</p>
                <p>We shall now give an example of the application of the preceding formulae by
                    computing the sides of one of the large triangles connecting the west of
                    Scotland with Ireland, with the requisite data for which we have been obligingly
                    furnished by Colonel Colby. The three stations or angular points are Benlomond
                    in Stirlingshire, Cairnsmuir-on-Deugh in Kirkcudbright, and Knocklayd in the
                    county of Antrim; the longest side, from Benlomond to Knocklayd, exceeding
                    ninety-five miles. The data are as follows</p>
                <p>At Benlomond the angle subtended by the stations on Knocklayd and
                    Cairnsmuir-on-Deugh was determined from three observations, giving respectively
                    (we repeat only the seconds) 56° 43' 29"∙97, 27'64, 28"∙72. The mean is <hi
                    rend="italic">56°</hi> 43' 28"∙58; whence the errors are respectively + 1·39,
                    —1∙54, + 0·14; the squares of the errors 1·8321, 2·3716, ·0196; the sum of the
                    squares 4·3233; the weight (the square of the rule of observations divided by
                    twice the sum of the squares of the errors) = 9 ÷ 8·6466 = 1·4041; and the
                    reciprocal of the weight ∙96l.</p>
                <p>At Cairnsmuir-on-Deugh, one observation gave the angle 79° 42' 28''∙69. The
                    weight is assumed = ∙1, whence the reciprocal of the weight is 10.</p>
                <p>At Knocklayd, two observations gave the angles 43° 34' 38"∙36, and 35"∙43. The
                    mean is 43° 34' 36''∙89; the errors respectively + 1∙47 and — 1∙46; the weight
                    found as above = ∙4660; and the reciprocal of the weight 2446.</p>
                <p>We have therefore the following data for the computation of the triangle: <pb

                <p>together with the chord of the arc joining A and B, obtained from the computation
                    of a former triangle, viz. chord c = 352,033·48 feet.</p>
                <p>The first step of the operation is to compute approximate values of the two sides
                    <hi rend="italic">a, b.</hi> For this purpose we have the formulae *** <hi

                <p>Hence the approximate values of the three sides are <hi rend="italic">a</hi> =
                    426,960, <hi rend="italic">b =</hi> 502,470, c = 352,030 feet.</p>
                <p>We have next to find the corrections for reducing the observed angles to the
                    chord angles, and for this purpose it is necessary to have an approximate value
                    of the curvature of the surface. Now the approximate latitude of Benlomond (the
                    northernmost station) is 56° 11', and that of Knocklayd (the southernmost) is
                    55° 10'; the mean of the two is 55° 40'; and if we adopt this as the value of
                    <hi rend="italic">l,</hi> and assume the elements of the spheroid given in the

                    301∙02o the formulae (2), (3), and (4), give the following values of R, R', and

                <p>With the value of <hi rend="italic">r</hi> thus found, we proceed to find the

                    —l"∙23l = 10 ’ ∙352. As the corrections for the other angles B and C are found
                    precisely in the same manner, it is unnecessary to give the calculation. The
                    results are respectively <hi rend="italic">x</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">=</hi>
                    14"∙684, <hi rend="italic">x</hi> " = 9''∙724.</p>
                <p>From this we have the spherical excess E (= <hi rend="italic">x</hi> + <hi
                    rend="italic">x' + x'')</hi> = 34"∙760. But the excess of the sum of the three
                    observed angles above 180° was 34"·16, consequently the error of the
                    observations is — 0"·60. Now, on dividing this error into three parts
                    proportionally to the three numbers ∙96l, 10, 2·146 (the reciprocals of the
                    weights), we find the corrections for the observed angles to be respectively +
                    0''·04, + 0"·46, and + 0''·10. On applying these corrections, we obtain the true
                    spherical angles; and on diminishing each of these last by the corresponding
                    corrections for reduction to the chords, viz. 10''∙35, 14"∙68, 9"∙73, we obtain

                    result will be found for B and C, we shall have *** A = A' + ∣ (S -jr <hi
                    rend="superscript"> s</hi>), B = B'+ ⅜(S÷ r <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>), C =
                    C + J ( S -jr <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>); therefore, since A' -fB' + C' =
                    180°, A + B + C — (8 ÷ r <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi>) = 180°, so that S -÷- r
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> may be regarded as the excess of the three angles
                    A, B, C of the spherical triangle above two right angles.</p>
                <p>From this demonstration it follows, that if from each of the angles of any small
                    triangle on the surface of a sphere or spheroid (for the proposition holds true
                    for both surfaces) one third of the spherical excess be deducted, the sines of
                    the angles thus diminished will be proportional to the lengths of the opposite
                    sides, and consequently the sides may be computed as if the triangle were
                    rectilineal. It is to be remarked, that the angles to be diminished by one third
                    of the spherical excess, are not the observed angles but the horizontal angles
                    corrected for the errors of observation.</p>
                <p>As an example of this method, we shall take the same triangle as before.</p>
                <p>The three angles having been observed, the first step is to compute the spherical
                    excess E from the formula (1), and for this purpose we take the same value of
                    the radius of the oblique circle as was determined above, namely, log. <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> = 7∙32112. With this radius, the constant part of the
                    spherical excess, namely, 648000÷2r <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">π</hi>, becomes 0∙37116, and hence the formula (1) becomes</p>
                <p>Log. E = log. <hi rend="italic">a</hi> + log. <hi rend="italic">b</hi> + log.
                    sin. C + 0∙37116. Approximate values of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> (one of them may be the given side) must now be found. Now,
                    we found above log. <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = 5∙63039, log. <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> = 5∙70111; and we have also log. sin. C = 9∙83842. Adding these and the
                    constant number 0∙37116 into one sum, we get log. E = 1·54108, and consequently
                    E = 34'∙760. This value of the spherical excess agrees exactly (as it ought)
                    with the sum of the three chord corrections found above.</p>
                <p>Having computed the spherical excess, the error of the three observed angles is
                    found, and apportioned among the angles in the reciprocal proportion of their
                    respective weights, and the correct spherical angles deduced in the same manner
                    as already explained in describing the other method. Each of the spherical
                    angles is then diminished by <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi

                    by the reduction to the chord angles, the greatest difference being less than a
                    tenth of a foot in a distance exceeding ninety-five miles.</p>
                <p>On comparing the two methods of calculation which have now been explained, it
                    will be obvious that the latter, or that of Legendre, is the simpler of the two,
                    inasmuch as it requires only the calculation of the spherical excess by a single
                    operation, whereas the reduction to the chords requires an equivalent operation
                    for each of the three angles. The calculation of the chord angles is however, in
                    practice, rendered easy by an auxiliary table, in which the correction is given
                    for different values of the angle, and of the sum and difference of its
                    containing sides. But the spherical excess may be entered in a table in the same
                    manner. A sufficient approximation to this quantity, or rather to the area of
                    the triangle on which the excess depends, may frequently be obtained by making a
                    plan of the triangle, and measuring the length of the perpendicular upon the
                    known side by means of a scale of equal parts. In fact, if the three angles have
                    been equally well observed, so that the error is to be divided equally among
                    them, the calculation of the spherical excess is not even necessary for
                    computing the sides; as the same mean angles will be obtained by diminishing
                    each of the observed angles by one third of the excess of the sum above 180°.

                <p>When two angles only of a triangle were observed, the practice adopted in the
                    Ordnance survey was to compute the reduction of the two observed angles to the
                    plane of the chords, and to give the angles thus reduced, as the angles for
                    calculation, true to the nearest quarter of a second. The third angle was then
                    assumed, so that when added to the two chord angles the sum was 180°.</p>

                    Azimuths.</hi></p>
                <p>The formulae which have now been given suffice for the computation of the sides
                    of the principal triangles, or the distances of the stations from each other;
                    but for the purpose of mapping the country, it is also necessary to determine
                    the latitudes and longitudes of the several stations, and the inclinations of
                    the sides of the triangles to the meridian. In order to effect this by means of
                    the geodetical measurements, the latitude of one station at least, and the
                    inclination of a side of one of the triangles to the meridian of that station,
                    must be determined by astronomical means; and when this has been done, the
                    geographical latitudes and longitudes of all the other stations in a chain of
                    triangles, and the inclinations of their several sides to the meridians which
                    pass through their extremities, may be computed. The computation, however, is of
                    such a nature that a small error in determining the direction of the meridian
                    leads to errors of considerable magnitude in the latitudes and longitudes
                    deduced from it; and it accordingly becomes necessary, in the progress of a
                    large survey, to verify the computed results by astronomical observations at
                    various stations not very remote from each other in respect of longitude. It has
                    been stated in the preceding historical sketch, that eight different meridians
                    were determined by direct observation in the progress of the survey of England.
                    The problem which usually occurs in practice may be enunciated as follows.</p>
                <p>Given the latitude and longitude of a station A, and the distance of A from
                    another station B, and also the direction of the meridian at A in respect of the
                    straight line AB, to determine the latitude and longitude of B, and the
                    direction of the meridian at B in respect of AB.</p>
                <p>On the surface of a sphere whose centre is at the point where the normal at A
                    intersects the polar axis of the spheroid, let PAX be the meridian of A, PBY the
                    meridian of B, meeting the former in P; then in the spherical triangle PAB there
                    are given PA the colatitude of A, the side AB determined from the triangulation,
                    and the observed angle PAB which (in the annexed figure) is the supplement of
                    the azimuth at A, the azimuths being supposed to be reckoned from the south
                    towards the west, all round the circle; and from these data we have to deduce PB
                    the co-latitude of B, the angle APB the difference of the longitudes of A and B,
                    and PB A, which, added to 180°, is the azimuth of A as seen from B.</p>
                <p>***Let <hi rend="italic">l</hi> = 90° — AP = latitude of A, <hi rend="italic"

                    at the two stations to be parallel. Substituting this value of λ in the second

                <p>This new value of λ may be again substituted in the equation (9), by which a

                    approximation farther.</p>
                <p>The difference of latitudes λ is here expressed in parts of the radius 1. Let λ"
                    be the number of seconds in λ; then λ = λ* sin. 1’ = <hi rend="italic">(l —

                    sphere from A to B in parts of the radius; therefore, if D be the number of feet
                    in AB, and R' the number of feet in the radius of the circle perpendicular to
                    the meridian at A, we shall have <hi rend="italic">d</hi> ≡ D ÷ R'. Making these

                <p>This formula gives the latitude of the station B, supposing the surface that of a
                    sphere; but a small correction is required on account of the compression. To
                    investigate this, let AM and BN be the normals to the spheroidal surface meeting
                    the polar axis in M and N; join BM, and draw MX and NY parallel to the plane of
                    the equator. The angle AMX is the astronomical latitude of the station A, or the
                    latitude Z, and the angle BMX is the latitude of B, determined by the above
                    formula. But the true astronomical latitude of B is the angle BNY, which is less
                    than BMX by the angle MBN; we have therefore to compute this angle, and add its
                    value to λ, the difference between Z and <hi rend="italic">t.</hi> ***Let MBN =
                    ∙ψ. In the triangle BMN we have sin. -ψ: sin. BNM:: MN: MB. Now sin. BNM = cos.
                    BNY = cos. <hi rend="italic">I</hi>; and if C be the centre of the spheroid,
                    then MN = CM — CN; and because AB is always a small arc on the spheroid, MB is

                <p>Let B be the azimuth of AB on the horizon of the station B. To find B we may
                    employ the following property of spherical triangles, which also holds good for
                    triangles on a spheroid, viz. tan. ∣P: cot. ^(PAB -∣- PB A):: cos. ^(PB — PA):
                    cos. A(PB + PA); that is, since PAB = 18θ ’ — A, and PBA = B — 180°, and
                    consequently PAB -∣- PBA = B — A,</p>

                <p>Now cot. ⅜(B — A) = tan. (90° — ⅜(B —A)); and since the difference of the two
                    azimuths, or, which is the same, the sum of the two angles PAB and PBA, is
                    always very nearly equal to 180’, the angle 90° — ^(B — A) is always very-small,
                    and we may therefore substitute the arc for the tangent without sensible error.
                    For the same reason we may take ∣P for tan.^P. Making these substitutions,
                    doubling, and transposing, we get</p>

                <p>The two formulae (13) and (14) require no correction on account of the
                    ellipticity; for with respect to the first, the angle APB at the pole is the
                    same on the spheroid as on the sphere; and with respect to the second, the
                    correction is so small as to be altogether insensible.</p>
                <p>In deducing the above formulae, it has been supposed that the azimuth at the
                    station A only has been observed. If the direction of the meridian at B has
                    likewise been determined astronomically, then another value of P will be
                    obtained by substituting B and Z for A and <hi rend="italic">l'</hi> in the
                    equation ( 13); and the mean of the results should of course be taken as the
                    correct value.</p>
                <p>We shall now apply the preceding formulae to the computation of the latitude,
                    longitude, and azimuth of one of the principal stations of the survey; and we
                    shall select that of Black Down in Dorsetshire, referring it to the station at
                    Dunnose in the Isle of Wight. The following elements are given in the Survey,

                    7"∙3; angle at Dunnose between Black Down and the direction of the meridian
                    towards the north (= 180° — A) = 84° 54' 52"·5. From this last angle it is
                    obvious that Black Down lies westward and a little to the north of Dunnose.</p>
                <p>Assuming the same elements of the spheroid as before, we have <hi rend="italic"

                    perpendicular to the meridian = 20,963,000 feet, in round numbers; with this
                    value of R', and the given value of D, the computation of the equation (12) is
                    as follows:</p>

                    which amounts to 16'', arises from the different elements of the earth’s figure
                    assumed in the Survey, which give the length of a degree of the circle
                    perpendicular to the meridian at the latitude of Dunnose = 367,038 feet; whereas
                    the length of the degree corresponding to the more correct value of the radius
                    assumed in the preceding calculation is only 365,874 feet. It is now known that
                    the differences of the longitudes of the stations on the southern coast of
                    England are all given too small, in consequence of this erroneous assumption of
                    the length of the perpendicular degree.</p>
                <p>The longitude of Dunnose west of Greenwich having been found by a previous

                <p>It now remains to find the azimuth at Black Down, by computing the formula ( 14).

                    ’ ∙12, or B = 274° 2' 27"∙38. The observed angle PBA was 94° 2' 22 ’ '∙75. Hence
                    the azimuth reckoned from the south towards the west was 274° 2' 22''·75, which
                    differs from the computed value by 4''∙63. It may be remarked, that the method
                    of determining the azimuths adopted in the Survey is attended with some degree
                    of uncertainty. It consists, as has been already stated, in taking the mean of
                    the two angles observed with the theodolite between a flag-staff and the
                    pole-star at its greatest elongation west and east. Now, by reason of the
                    altitude of the pole-star in our latitudes above the terrestrial signal, any
                    error in the adjustment of the cross axis of the theodolite to horizontality
                    produces a greater error in the resulting azimuth. Captain Kater(Phil. Trans.
                    1828, p. 188) considers the observations of the pole-star for determining the
                    perpendicular degree in our latitudes, as wholly unworthy of credit.</p>

                    of the same problem.</p>
                <p>Let A and B be two stations whose distance from each other is known, and let AC
                    and BC be the directions of gravity, meeting in C, the earth being supposed
                    spherical. Let AD and BD be the horizontal lines in the plane ACB, and suppose
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> to be the apparent planes
                    of A and B respectively, as seen from each other. Now, if the rays of light
                    proceeded in straight lines, the angle DAB would be the depression of B below
                    the horizon of A, and DBA the depression of A below the horizon of B; and since
                    AD and BD are perpendicular to AC and BC respectively, the sum of these two
                    angles is equal to C, or to the arc of the great circle intercepted between A
                    and B. But this arc is known from the measured distance of A from B, and the
                    assumed dimensions of the earth; consequently the sum of DAB and DBA is given.
                    If, therefore, from this given sum we subtract the sum of the two observed
                    depressions, namely, DA <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and DB <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi>, there will remain the sum of BA <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and AB <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi>, that is, the sum of the two refractions, the half of which
                    is the mean refraction, and assumed to be the actual refraction at each station.
                    Let us put <hi rend="italic">d —</hi> DA <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, the observed
                    depression at A, <hi rend="italic">d'</hi> = DB <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, the
                    observed depression at B, C — ACB, the measure of the contained arc, <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> = the mean refraction, and we have <hi rend="italic">g</hi>
                    = ½{C-(<hi rend="italic">d+d''</hi>)} (15).</p>
                <p>Now, let II be the point in CB which is on the same level surface with A, so that
                    CH = CA; then HB is the altitude of B above A, which we have to determine. Join
                    AH, and the angle DAH is equal to half of C. But the angle BAH is obviously the
                    difference between DAH and the sum of DA <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> AB. Hence if <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> denote the angle BAH,
                    we have <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> = ½C-(<hi rend="italic">d+g</hi>) (16).</p>
                <p>This gives the angular elevation of B above A; consequently if <hi rend="italic"
                    >φ</hi> is expressed in seconds, and AB in feet, then BH will be obtained in
                    feet from the formula</p>
                <p>BH = AB× <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> sin. 1’ (17).</p>
                <p>It has been assumed that the objects observed at both stations are depressed. If
                    one of them is elevated, then <hi rend="italic">d or d'</hi> must be taken
                    negatively. It is also to be remarked, that for the purpose of finding the
                    refraction, each observation must be reduced, previously to the calculation, to
                    the axis of the instrument; that is to say, allowance must be made for the
                    difference of level between the axis of the instrument at either station, and
                    the object (as the top of a flag-staff) at the same station observed from the
                    other. This allowance is made by computing the angle subtended by that
                    difference at the distance between the stations, and deducting it from the
                    observed depression, or adding it to the observed elevation.</p>
                <p>For the determination of the absolute altitudes, it is necessary that the heights
                    of one or more of the stations be ascertained by actually levelling down to the
                    surface of the sea. the heights of all the intermediate stations are then
                    established in the manner now explained, by the reciprocal angles of elevation
                    or depression, carried on from station to station; and it is obvious that a
                    verification will be obtained for every three stations; for the difference of
                    altitude between A and B, when found by direct observation, ought to be the same
                    as when deduced from the difference of the heights of each of those stations,
                    and a third station C.</p>
                <p>For estimating the altitudes of places at which the theodolite was not placed,
                    and where, consequently, reciprocal observations were not obtained, it was
                    necessary to assume a mean value of the refraction <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> in
                    order to obtain the angle <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> in the equation (16). On
                    account of the wide limits within which the horizontal refraction is found to
                    vary, this is attended with some uncertainty, even when every attention is paid
                    to the condition of the atmosphere. In general the effect of refraction was
                    assumed to be from <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    12</hi> th to <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 14</hi> th
                    of the whole difference of altitude.</p>
                <p>As an example, we select the following case from the Survey. At the station of
                    Black Comb in Cumberland, Scilly Bank appeared depressed 49' 14"; and at Scilly
                    Bank, Black Comb was observed elevated 31' 31”; and the distance between the two
                    stations is 121,028 feet. From these data we have to compute the mean refraction
                    and the difference of altitude.</p>
                <p>The height of the instrument at both stations was 5½ feet. Hence if R' denote the
                    number of seconds in the are equal to the radius, and <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    the correction for the height of the instrument, we have this proportion,
                    121028: 5 ∙ 5 :: R'': <hi rend="italic">x</hi>; whence, since R" = 206,264∙8,
                    <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is found = 9'. Subtracting this from the seconds of
                    observed depression, and adding it to the seconds of observed elevation, we find
                    <hi rend="italic">d</hi> = 2944'' and — d’ = 1900"; whence <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> + <hi rend="italic">d'</hi> = 104 +''. Now allowing the length of a
                    second of are at the mean latitude to be 101½ feet, the distance in seconds is
                    121,028 ÷ 101½ = 1192, or C = 1192'', and we have by formula (15) the mean
                    refraction <hi rend="italic">g</hi> = ½ { C — <hi rend="italic">(d</hi> + <hi
                    rend="italic">d')}</hi> = 74", which is very nearly <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 16</hi> th of the intercepted arc.</p>
                <p>With this value of <hi rend="italic">g</hi> we obtain (16) <hi rend="italic"
                    >φ</hi> = — 2422''; whence, since sin. 1" = ∙00000485, we have for the
                    difference of altitudes (17)</p>
                <p>121028 × —2422 × ∙00000485 = — 1422, or the depression of Scilly Bank below Black
                    Comb is 1422 feet. In the Survey, vol. iii. the altitudes of the two stations
                    are stated to be respectively, Black Comb 1919 feet; Scilly Bank 500 feet;
                    whence the difference is 1419 feet.</p>
                <p>We have now explained, with as much detail as the limits which must be prescribed
                    to the present article would permit, the methods of calculation by which the
                    mutual distances of the several stations of an extensive survey, and their
                    geographical co-ordinates, that is to say, their latitudes, longitudes, and
                    altitudes, are deduced from the observations. These form the principal and
                    essential objects of a trigonometrical survey of a country. There are however
                    various other points of great importance connected with geodetical measurements,
                    into which, in the present outline, it is impossible for us to enter; and
                    particularly the methods of estimating the probable errors of the observations,
                    and of the results deduced from them, and of applying these results to the
                    determination of the form of the earth’s surface in the country over which the
                    operation <hi rend="italic">extends.</hi> For information on these points, and
                    indeed on all other questions relating to the higher geodesy, we refer the
