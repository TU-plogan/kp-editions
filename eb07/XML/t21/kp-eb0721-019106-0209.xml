                <p><label type="entry">THEATRE</label>, a place in which dramatic pieces are
                    exhibited. The article <hi rend="smallcaps">Drama,</hi> besides relating the
                    literary history of the stage, has furnished as minute an account of the plan
                    and arrangements of the ancient theatres as the purposes of this work allow.
                    Similar details as to the modern theatres of the Continent, would lead into a
                    field far too wide to be traversed; and we must here confine ourselves to a
                    brief notice of the establishments devoted to dramatic entertainments in
                    Britain.</p>
                <p>The earliest positive mention of professional actors in England, as a class
                    distinctly separable from minstrels or others, occurs about the middle of the
                    fifteenth century; and a sumptuary law of Edward IV., passed in 1464, makes an
                    exception in favour of “players in their enterludes.” Richard III., when duke of
                    Gloucester, kept a company of players and musicians in his pay. The children of
                    the king’s chapel were trained for acting as well as singing; and Henry VII. had
                    two distinct sets of players, the one being composed of the gentlemen of the
                    chapel, who performed regularly at certain seasons; and the other, the “players
                    of interludes,” being more like those strolling companies whom about that time
                    we find to have been often taken into the pay of noblemen throughout the
                    country. In the reign of Henry VIII. the court amusements became more expensive
                    and diversified, in this respect as in every other; and the royal example was
                    eagerly imitated by the wealthy nobles. Besides the annual payments from the
                    king to the Lord of Misrule, and the large sums expended on masques and other
                    entertainments, we find salaries to have been regularly paid to two companies of
                    the “king’s players,” in addition to the children of the chapel; and the royal
                    players, as well as those of the nobility, travelled through all the provinces.
                    In 1Ô28, Henry entertained the French ambassadors at Greenwich with a Latin
                    moral play, acted by the pupils of St Paul’s school, in which the reformation
                    was ridiculed, and Luther and his wife were prominent characters. The
                    corporations, especially that of Chester, so celebrated for its patronage of
                    religious theatricals, continued to exhibit dramatic shows on occasions of
                    festivity; although the corporation of London appear, even before the middle of
                    the sixteenth century, as decidedly opposing stage plays, and attempting to
                    suppress them within their jurisdiction. In 1543 was passed the earliest act of
                    parliament for the regulation of the stage; and in 1546, if not earlier, was
                    established the office of Master of the Revels, for managing and superintending
                    the pastimes of the court. The disturbances of the two short reigns which
                    succeeded Henry’s, checked the progress of theatrical amusements; but their
                    prosperity revived on the accession of Elizabeth, who lived to witness the rise
                    of the dramatic art to its highest literary excellence. The companies of
                    itinerant players multiplied so excessively, and their irregularities were
                    considered so dangerous, that a statute of the queen, passed in 1572, stamped
                    the first public brand on the profession; declaring that all players, fencers,
                    bearwards, not belonging to any nobleman,—and all tinkers, jugglers, pedlars,
                    &amp;c. not having license from two justices of the peace,—should be dealt with
                    as rogues and vagabonds.</p>
                <p>About the year 1570, or very little later, were erected the earliest buildings in
                    London that were devoted exclusively to theatrical representation. These were
                    two, both in Shoreditch; the one called “The Theatre,” by way of eminence, the
                    other called “The Curtain.” A third theatre, within the privileged precinct of
                    the Blackfriars, was built in 1576, by Burbadge, the father of the famous
                    player, whose company had been driven out of the city by the corporation; and
                    the Globe on the Bankside in Southwark (which afterwards became the summer
                    theatre of Shakspeare’s company, while the Blackfriars was their place <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=210"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0210-0192"/> of acting in winter) was erected about the year
                    1594. But between 1570 and 1600, there arose eleven buildings, if not more, in
                    or about London, applied to the purpose of dramatic exhibitions. Several of
                    these were always obscure, but others possess interest, on account of the merit
                    of the works produced on their stages. The Globe and Blackfriars always
                    maintained the first rank, and continued in the possession of the company called
                    the Queen’s Players; Paris-Garden, an old building, was used both for
                    stage-playing and bear-baiting; and the Rose, built about 1585, and the Fortune,
                    in 1599, were especially under the control of the pawnbroker Philip Henslowe,
                    whose manuscript diary is one of the most instructive documents which we possess
                    relating to the dramatic history of that age. An attempt of the government in
                    1598 to limit the license of playing in London to two companies, bearing the
                    names of the Lord Chamberlain and Lord Admiral, seems to have been completely
                    unsuccessful. In the reign of James, the Globe and Fortune were successively
                    burnt, but both rebuilt; and no new theatre of consequence was erected except
                    the Phoenix or Cockpit in Drury Lane, and the Red Bull in Saint John Street, if
                    indeed the latter was not somewhat older.</p>
                <p>In the same reign the principal companies of players were three. Those who
                    obtained the royal patent of 1603, at the head of whom stood Shakspeare,
                    Burbadge, and Laurence Fletcher, had been recently called the Lord Chamberlain’s
                    men, but now resumed their older title of the King’s Players or Servants. The
                    company at first named Players of the Lord Admiral (or of the Earl of
                    Nottingham, who held that office) were afterwards called the Players of Prince
                    Henry: these were the actors especially connected with Henslowe; and his
                    celebrated son-in-law Edward Alleyn, the founder of Dulwich College, was the
                    most distinguished among them. Those actors who had formerly been called
                    Children of the Chapel, but of whom many were persons of mature age, were now
                    called Children of the Revels, and appear frequently in connection with Ben
                    Jonson’s works.</p>
                <p>James had passed an act against profanity in plays: his son passed one, the first
                    of his reign, against the acting of them on Sundays, an impropriety which it had
                    been formerly attempted to remove, and which the growing spirit of puritanism
                    regarded with increasing horror. But Charles, whose taste for literature and art
                    was the best feature in his character, was a liberal and judicious patron of the
                    theatre during those few early years of his reign that preceded the
                    disturbances. In the same year as the act last named (1625), he renewed his
                    father’s patent to the “King’s Players,” in favour of Heminge and Condell,
                    Shakspeare’s executors, and others; annexing a condition which we find often
                    insisted on in regard to dramatic exhibitions in those days, that no performance
                    should take place in London unless the persons infected by the plague fell short
                    of a certain number in the week. About 1635 there were in the metropolis,
                    besides a French troop and a Spanish, five settled companies of English players
                    ;—the King’s Servants, under Lowin and Taylor, who played, as of old, at the
                    Globe and Blackfriars ;—the Queen’s, who played at the Cockpit ;—the Prince’s
                    men, at the Fortune ;—the Children of the Revels, probably at the Red Bull ;—and
                    the company attached to a new theatre in Salisbury Court. The civil war broke
                    out in 1642; and in September of that year an “ordinance of both houses of
                    parliament,” setting forth the necessity of fasting and prayer, and of all other
                    means “to appease and avert the wrath of God appearing in these judgments,”
                    ordained that, “while these sad causes and set times of humiliation do continue,
                    public stage-plays shall cease and be forborne.” In 1647 a more peremptory act
                    declared stage-players punishable by public whipping for the first offence, and
                    authorized the demolition of the theatres. And for nearly ten years from that
                    time we hear of only one or two unimportant infractions of the prohibition.</p>
                <p>During those early ages of our dramatic annals, which the civil wars thus brought
                    to a close, the theatres were divided into two classes, the Public and the
                    Private, the distinctions of which are not yet very clear, and do not seem to
                    have been ever very important. The private theatres, it is said by Mr Collier,
                    were smaller than the others, and were entirely roofed over, which the latter
                    were not; the performances in them were by artificial light; their “pits” had
                    seats; and there were other minor differences of arrangement. The Blackfriars,
                    the Cockpit, and the house in Salisbury Court, were private theatres; the Globe,
                    Fortune, and Bull, were public. There has been loud controversy on the question
                    whether moveable scenery was at all used in the time of Shakspeare; but it may
                    be considered as having been authoritatively settled in the negative. There was
                    a balcony or upper stage, which served, on multifarious occasions, the purposes
                    of a second scene, representing the walls of a town in King John and
                    elsewhere,—-Juliet’s balcony,— or the seat of the audience at the performance of
                    the play in Hamlet, in which the player-king and queen occupied the front of the
                    main stage. Besides the curtain which concealed this balcony when it was not
                    required, other curtains, called traverses, crossing the back of the stage,
                    served to separate a portion, which, by drawing these partly or wholly, could be
                    made to pass for an inner room. There is good evidence of the use of trap-doors
                    in the stage; and descents from above were also attempted, as in Greene’s
                    Alphonsus, a play older than most of Shakspeare’s, in which one direction was
                    this—“let Venus be let down from the top of the stage and another, in the same
                    play, orders that Venus shall either simply make her exit, “or, if you can
                    conveniently, let a chair come down from the top of the stage and draw her up.”
                    The performances, in Shakspeare’s time, took place but once a day; the usual
                    hour seems to have been three o’clock; and nothing except the short and rude
                    pieces called jigs seems to have been exhibited besides the principal play.
                    There were play-bills pasted up in the streets as early at least as the middle
                    of the sixteenth century; and in 1620 a royal patent was granted for the
                    printing of them. The purchases which theatrical companies made from authors
                    seem to have been understood as comprehending, not merely the right of
                    representing the pieces, but the entire copyright; and the care of the players
                    to keep popular pieces in manuscript was one of the causes especially
                    destructive to the dramatic literature of those times. Before the year 1600,
                    Henslowe, whose loans had made most of the dramatists of the time his
                    bond-slaves, seems never to have paid an author more than eight pounds for a
                    play; and even authors of reputation, such as Dekker, sometimes received much
                    less. But the value of literary labour rose in the beginning of the next
                    century, and we then find even inferior writers, like Daborne, stipulating for
                    sums as high as twenty pounds. The usual price, however, till the closing of the
                    theatres, was about twelve pounds, to which were sometimes added the receipts,
                    in whole or in part, of one of the early performances. The actors were divided
                    into two classes: the Shareholders, who were joint proprietors of the
                    establishment, and ranked according to the amount of their interest, as whole
                    sharers, three-quarter sharers, or half sharers; and the Hired Men, who were the
                    inferior actors, receiving weekly salaries from the sharers. In 1608, when the
                    corporation contemplated removing the players of the Blackfriars, but proposed
                    giving them compensation for the loss of their property and employment, a
                    statement was produced which gives some curious results. It appears that the
                    whole interest in the profits of the establishment was divided into twenty
                    shares, which belonged to eleven actors. Burbadge owned the building and four of
                    the shares; Shakspeare owned four shares, with the wardrobe and properties;
                    Fletcher had three shares; Heminge and Condell <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=211" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0211-0193"
                    />two shares each; Taylor and Lowin a share and half each; and four others
                    parted the remaining two shares equally among them. Each share was valued at
                    L.33. 6s. 8d. per annum, and was offered to the corporation at seven years’
                    purchase: the building was valued at L.1000, the wardrobe and properties at
                    L.500. The whole property was thus estimated by the players themselves at
                    L.6166. 13s. 4d., besides compensation demanded by the hired men, and allowances
                    to the widows and orphans of deceased players. Shakspeare’s interest was valued
                    by him at L.1433. fis. 8d., which might be equal to between L.6000 and L.7000 in
                    modern money. All these valuations, however, must have been above the truth. <hi

                <p>The representation of Sir William Davenant’s Siege of Rhodes, in 1656, was the
                    first step towards a revival of theatrical amusements; and three years later,
                    two rival companies began to act openly in London, the one at the Cockpit, the
                    other at the Red Bull. The former, originally organized by one Rhodes, a
                    bookseller, was composed chiefly of new actors, among whom the best, Betterton
                    and Kynaston, were youths who had been his own apprentices; the latter embraced
                    those old actors who had survived the wars, in which several of them had served
                    with some distinction. Two royal patents (the origin of the modem monopoly) were
                    issued in 1663. The one was in favour of Devenant, who placed himself at the
                    head of Rhodes’s players, and acted for some time at a new house in Lincoln’s
                    Inn Fields, calling his company the Duke of York’s, though they were sworn in as
                    servants of the king. The other patent was given to the witty Killigrew, whose
                    actors, called the King’s Company, were those who had begun to play at the Red
                    Bull, but who were removed to a new theatre built in Drury Lane. The new
                    companies presented one remarkable novelty, in the accession of several females
                    to their number. Before the Restoration, the female parts had been performed by
                    the younger male actors; and the only instance in which an innovation had been
                    tried was in 1629, when a French company appeared at the Blackfriars, consisting
                    partly of women, or, as Prynne is pleased to express it, “monsters rather”—“an
                    impudent, shameful, unwomanish, graceless, if not more than meretricious
                    attempt.” Those who looked on the matter in a more candid and philosophical
                    temper, might not unreasonably have expected that the introduction of actresses
                    to the stage would have helped to purify it from that coarseness which had
                    disfigured the drama in its preceding ages. But after the Restoration, the
                    players, the public at large, and the court, which gave law to the public and
                    the players, were all alike corrupt; and if the new addition did nothing to
                    deteriorate, it did at all events nothing to retard the increasing degradation.
                    That which, in most of the dramas produced in Elizabeth’s reign, had been merely
                    coarseness of language, had been accompanied in very many of the later plays
                    with real licentiousness of principle and feeling; and the profligacy of Charles
                    the Second and his minions was now aped with applause in works full of the most
                    disgusting and disgraceful obscenity. The injury which morality received from
                    the stage was accompanied by injury to taste, inflicted not only by that
                    undramatic spirit which pervaded the very best works of the time, but by the
                    pomp of decoration, the singing, music, and dancing, by which Davenant sought to
                    make his theatre a match for the superior histrionic skill displayed by his
                    rivals. The licentiousness was greatly amended after the Revolution, but the
                    corruption of taste gave way much more slowly.</p>
                <p>In 1671 the Duke’s players opened a new theatre in Dorset Gardens, probably on
                    the site of the old house in Salisbury Court; and in 1674 the King’s players
                    opened a second new theatre in Drury Lane, in the place of their former one,
                    which had been burned down. A union of the two patents, and of both companies,
                    produced discontents both among the actors and the public; and a new patent
                    having been granted by King William to Betterton and some of the rebellious
                    players, a third theatre was built by them in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, for which
                    was afterwards substituted a splendid but ill-designed house in the Haymarket,
                    planned by Sir John Vanbrugh, and opened in 1705. In the mean time, various
                    disputes and misfortunes happened among the old patentees. The interference of
                    the Lord Chamberlain, whom, as coming in the place of the Master of the Revels,
                    the actors and the public sometimes considered as having exclusive jurisdiction
                    over the playhouses, while at other times the managers voluntarily submitted
                    their disputes to his arbitration, was repeatedly exerted, and often very
                    arbitrarily, to restore something like order and prosperity; and at length
                    matters were placed for a time on a footing not materially different from the
                    modern one. The theatre in the Haymarket was appropriated solely to the opera;
                    and the two old patents of Charles the Second were the warrant under which the
                    regular drama was played at Drury Lane by a company acting under Killigrew’s
                    patent, and at the theatre in Lincoln’s Inn Fields (once more rebuilt) by a
                    company directed by the younger Rich, the holder of the patent which had been
                    granted to Davenant. At Drury Lane, plays which, however indifferent, were the
                    best the age could produce, or the public endure, were acted with excellent
                    skill by a company directed by the first actors of the day, Wilks, Dogget,
                    Booth, and Cibber, with whom, for a good many years, Sir Richard Steele was
                    associated in the patent. At Lincoln’s Inn Fields were produced those execrable
                    abortions called pantomimes, on which the manager Rich prided himself so much,
                    and whose scenery and drolleries gained for his house a popularity which he
                    probably thought cheaply purchased by the ridicule showered on him without
                    ceasing by the wits of Queen Anne’s reign.</p>
                <p>In 1720 there arose new quarrels, new financial embarrassments, and new
                    interferences and prohibitions by the Lord Chamberlain; but of the events which
                    took place for many years, two or three only demand notice. The first was the
                    opening, in 1729, of a new theatre in Goodman’s Fields, rebuilt in 1732, which
                    did not for some time obtain such success as to tempt the patentees to suppress
                    it. A second occurrence was the transfer of Rich’s company, in 1733, to a new
                    house in Covent Garden. In 1737 there was passed, in spite of energetic and
                    well-founded opposition, an act of parliament, taking from the crown the right
                    of granting any new patents for theatres in the metropolis, and forbidding the
                    representation of any plays not previously licensed by the Lord Chamberlain. In
                    1741 Garrick appeared at Gcβd∙ man’s Fields, in the character of Richard the
                    Third.</p>
                <p>In 1747 the patent of Drury Lane was renewed in favour of Lacey, who was to be
                    the man of business of the establishment, and Garrick, who was to support it
                    both as actor and author. Under the direction of these managers the theatre
                    enjoyed uninterrupted prosperity’ for nineteen years; and, however faulty
                    Garrick’s ideas of the literary qualities of the drama may in some respects have
                    been, we owe him a heavy debt of gratitude for the benefits he conferred on
                    public taste by his restoration of Shakspeare’s works to that place on the stage
                    from which they had been banished with equal constancy by the debauchery of
                    Charles the Second’s time, and the pedantic coldness of Queen Anne’s. In the
                    mean time, after the death of Rich in 1761, Covent Garden was chiefly supported
                    by its musical pieces; and the new management, begun in 1767, at the head of ’

                <p>which stood the elder Colman, produced little advantage to any except the lawyers
                    who received fees in the lawsuits between the proprietors. In 1766, a theatre in
                    the Haymarket, not that which held the patent, but another which had been built
                    in 1720, and which had received occasional licenses for performances during the
                    summer, received a regular patent, granted in favour of Foote, which recognized
                    its actors as the king’s servants, and allowed performances in it from the 14th
                    of May to the 14th of September. The patentee immediately pulled down the old
                    house, and built a new one, which was opened in 1767.</p>
                <p>In 1790 there was built, on the site of Sir John Vanbrugh’s Haymarket Theatre, a
                    new house devoted to the Italian opera, which received the name of the King’s
                    Theatre, and has since then suffered no very material alteration in the general
                    structure of its interior. In 1794 was opened a new theatre in Drury Lane,
                    built, after a plan by Holland, on the site of the former one; and two or three
                    years earlier, Covent Garden had received such improvements as amounted nearly
                    to a total renovation. Long before these events, however, the management of
                    Covent Garden had passed to Harris; while at Drury Lane, Garrick had been
                    succeeded by Sheridan, Ford, and Linley; and Foote’s place at the Haymarket had
                    been filled by Colman. In 1803 the stage-management of Covent Garden passed to
                    John Philip Kemble; and the subsequent changes which took place for some time in
                    that and the other theatres are not of such literary moment as to require
                    notice. In September 1808, Covent Garden Theatre was burnt to the ground; and
                    the present building, erected on its site, after a plan by Smirke, was opened
                    within twelve months from the catastrophe. In 1809 a similar calamity destroyed
                    the theatre in Drury Lane, which was rebuilt by Wyatt, and opened for
                    performances in 1811. Foote’s summer theatre in the Haymarket made way, in 1821,
                    for a new house planned by Nash, and possessing a patent extending its
                    performances to seven months.</p>
                <p>It would not be too much to say, that the excellence of the dramas which our
                    modern stage has produced, bears, in comparison with those of our older times, a
                    proportion nearly inverse to that of the dimensions and adornment of the
                    edifices in which the works of the two ages have been respectively acted. The
                    question as to the causes of our decay, and as to our probable prospect of
                    revival, has been handled elsewhere, and would lead us beyond the proper
                    province of this article; but the discouraging state of the drama during the
                    whole period which has elapsed in the present century may be admitted as a
                    sufficient reason for declining to trace the history of our great theatres
                    through that series of misfortunes which has hung over all of them, especially
                    Drury Lane, for the last thirty years. The ruinous consequences of their
                    injurious monopoly have not, it should appear, been even yet made sufficiently
                    obvious to those who possess the power of remedying the evil; and the many minor
                    theatres, which, if allowed free scope, might perhaps become the nurseries of a
                    new school in dramatic art, are left to struggle against obstacles arising from
                    this cause, and seconded but too faithfully by the general corruption of
                    dramatic taste.</p>
                <p>The evils produced by the monopoly of the great theatres in the metropolis were
                    till lately aggravated tenfold by the laws affecting copyright in dramatic
                    performances. Literary property of this sort was continually invaded, and
                    towards the end of the eighteenth century the courts of law formally authorized
                    the encroachments. The decisions were founded on very curious and subtile
                    distinctions.</p>
                <p>The first case brought forward was that in which Macklin, in 1770, applied to the
                    Court of Chancery for an injunction to stay the printing of his farce of
                    “Love-a-la-Mode” in a magazine, in which it was appearing piecemeal. The farce
                    had never yet been printed or published; and the booksellers obtained their
                    manuscript from a shorthand writer, whom they employed to attend the theatre and
                    take down the dialogue from the mouths of the actors. The court held that this
                    was a <hi rend="italic">publication</hi> of the play, and forbidden by the act
                    of Queen Anne. In terms of this decision, it was always afterwards held, that
                    the author or his assignce retained the exclusive right of <hi rend="italic"
                    >printing</hi> and <hi rend="italic">publishing</hi> a play, although it might
                    have been already acted.</p>
                <p>But in 1790, the Court of King’s Bench laid down the law very differently for the
                    case in which redress is claimed against the unauthorized <hi rend="italic"
                    >representation</hi> of a play on the <hi rend="italic">stage.</hi> O’Keeffe’s
                    farce, “The Agreeable Surprise,” had been acted on various stages, although the
                    copyright had been sold by the author to Colman of the Haymarket. Colman
                    prosecuted the manager of the Richmond theatre for infringement of the act of
                    Queen Anne, maintaining that his acting of the piece was a publication of it in
                    the sense of the statute. The court found that acting (or, as one of the judges
                    called it, repeating a book from memory) was <hi rend="italic">not
                    publication,</hi> nor prohibited by the act. The provincial managers thenceforth
                    continued to plunder dramatic authors with impunity, as soon as, by the
                    publication of their works, or in other ways, they were able to procure access
                    to them. No endeavour was made in the courts to shake the decision given in
                    Colman’s case, tiD the year 1822, when Murray the bookseller prosecuted Elliston
                    for acting Byron’s tragedy of Marino Faliero, “altered and abridged for the
                    stage,” the play having been previously printed and published by Murray, the
                    proprietor of the copyright. The attempt in this case to found the action for
                    redress independently of the statute, was equally unsuccessful with the previous
                    attempt to rest it solely on the statutory words.</p>
                <p>These decisions, it is true, left several very important questions still
                    undetermined; but the letter of the law, and the spirit of the interpretations
                    which had been long put upon it, were equally unfavourable to the dramatic
                    author. Writers of plays continued to depend for remuneration on the small sums
                    which they could obtain from booksellers for the right of printing and
                    publishing, with any other sum which the managers of the London theatres chose
                    to give for the privilege of acting the drama till publication.</p>
                <p>This unfair state of things was altered in 1833 by Sir Edward Lytton Bulwer’s
                    act, “To amend the laws relating to dramatic literary property.” By this statute
                    it is enacted, first, that the author of every dramatic piece <hi rend="italic"
                    >not</hi> printed or published (or the assignce of the author) shall have, as
                    his own property, the sole liberty of representing it, or causing it to be
                    represented, at any place of dramatic entertainment; secondly, that the author
                    of every dramatic piece which has been or shall be printed and published (or the
                    assignce of the author) shall have, as his own property, the same liberty of
                    representing it, or causing it to be represented, till the end of twenty-eight
                    years from the date of the publication, and also during the residue of the
                    author’s life; thirdly, that the penalty for infringement of the act shall be,
                    for each representation, an amount not less than forty shillings, or the full
                    amount of the benefit or advantage arising from the representation, or the
                    injury or loss sustained by the proprietor of the drama, recoverable in an
                    action to be brought within twelve months after the offence. <hi
