                <p><label type="entry">TELFORD, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi></label>, a very
                    able and distinguished engineer, was born in the parish of Westerkirk and county
                    of Dumfries, on the 9th of August 1757. His father, who followed the occupation
                    of a shepherd, died before the close of that year; and the orphan boy was thus
                    left to the sole care of his mother, whose maiden name was Janet Jackson. She
                    survived till the year 1794, and had the high satisfaction of seeing him already
                    entered upon a very prosperous career. In his correspondence with her, he is
                    said to have written all his letters in printed characters, that she might be
                    able to read them without assistance. His very limited education he received at
                    Westerkirk school; and, during the summer season, was employed by his uncle as a
                    shepherd boy. This occupation left him abundant leisure for reading; and his
                    early and eager love of knowledge he was enabled to gratify by the kindness of
                    some individuals, who accommodated him with the loan of books. At an early age,
                    he quitted Westerkirk school and the care of his uncle’s flock, in order to
                    learn the trade of a mason in the neighbouring town of Langholm. After the
                    completion of his apprenticeship, he continued for some time to work as a
                    journeyman. Langholm bridge, over the river Esk, was partly reared by hands
                    which were destined for more scientific occupations.</p>
                <p>At this early period of his life, he was remarkable for his elastic spirits and
                    gay humour. In his native district of Eskdale, he was long remembered as
                    “laughing Tom.” His favourite pursuits were not yet scientific, but literary,
                    and he even aspired at the reputation of a poet. He was a contributor to the

                    Telford, author of the following Poem, was bred a mason at the village of
                    Langholm, on the banks of the Esk; a young man of no education but common
                    reading, assisted by some few books lent him by the neighbouring gentlemen."
                    Langholm, it is to be remarked, is not a village, but a market-town, containing
                    about 2000 inhabitants. An improved edition of the poem was printed at
                    Shrewsbury. It is inserted in the appendix to the Life of Telford, p. 655. An
                    “Epistle to Mr Walter Ruddiman,” signed <hi rend="italic">EMale Tarn,</hi> and
                    dated at Langholm, is subjoined to “Two Scots Poems; the Silver Gun, in three
                    cantos, and Hallow-E'en. By John Main.” Glasgow, 1783, 4to. This epistle, which
                    is commendatory of the Dumfries poet, was first printed in the year 1779 in the
                    Weekly Magazine, vol. xliv. p. 151. Telford acknowledged himself to be the
                    anthor. In the last edition of the principal poem, be is mentioned with
                    commendation as a poet as well as engineer. See Mayne's Siller Gun, p. 78, 227.

                    at least displays some command of poetical language and imagery. He subsequently
                    wrote many verses; and from a poetical epistle which he had addressed to Burns,
                    some extracts were printed by Dr Currie.</p>
                <p>Telford at length quitted Eskdale, and sought for better employment in Edinburgh,
                    where he is said to have continued, with unremitting application, to study
                    architecture on scientific principles. In the mean time, however, he must have
                    earned his daily bread by the labour of his hands. Here he remained till the
                    year 1782, when he was emboldened to try his fortune in London. He had now
                    reached the age of twenty-five, and seems to have acquired new confidence in the
                    resources of his own talents. In his descriptive poem, two Eskdale families have
                    each received their mead of praise; and to two individuals belonging to those
                    families he owed many obligations.</p>

                <p>Mr John Pasley, a wealthy merchant, was the brother of Sir Thomas Pasley, and the
                    uncle of Sir John Malcolm. He was remarkable, even in a proverbial degree, for
                    his anxious attention to the welfare of the Eskdale youth who repaired<pb

                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The son of an unprosperous farmer had been
                    recommended to him by his kind-hearted relations at Burnfoot; and as the young
                    man had not been trained to business of any kind, he thought the best way of
                    serving him was to procure him a clerkship in a man of war. He accordingly lost
                    no time in writing to his brother Admiral Pasley; but the admiral informed him
                    that he had no employment for any such person. The application was immediately
                    renewed. An answer was returned, that he really had no employment for the young
                    man, and could not make employment for him. Even this answer was not received as
                    final. One letter followed another so rapidly, that at length the admiral wrote
                    to this effect: “For God's sake, send me S. I.. and let me see if any thing can
                    be done for him.” This young man speedily became a purser; and at the
                    termination of the first French war, retired from the service in very prosperous
                    circumstances.</p></note> This ingenious young man, then a journeyman mason, he
                    received with his habitual kindness, and not only treated him with hospitality,
                    but, we have every reason to believe, rendered him very important services, and
                    greatly contributed to his subsequent advancement. In his account of his own
                    life, it is observable that Telford makes not the slightest allusion to his
                    benefactor. As to his occupation, he states that he was fortunate in being
                    employed at the quadrangle of Somerset-place, where he acquired much practical
                    information, both in the useful and ornamental branches of architecture. After a
                    residence of two years in London, he was engaged in superintending the building
                    of a house in the dock-yard at Portsmouth, intended for the resident
                    commissioner. For this appointment we suppose him to have been indebted to the
                    influence of Mr Pasley, exercised through his brother the admiral. “During the
                    three years,” he remarks, “that I attended the building of the commissioner’s
                    house, and of a new chapel for the dock-yard, I had an opportunity of observing
                    the various operations necessary in the foundations and construction of graving
                    docks, wharf-walls, and similar works, which afterwards became my chief
                    occupation.”’</p>
                <p>Having terminated his engagement at Portsmouth in 1787, he was employed by Sir
                    William Pulteney to superintend some alterations in Shrewsbury Castle, which he
                    wished to fit up as a temporary residence. This baronet likewise belonged to
                    Westerkirk, being a younger son of Sir James Johnstone of Westerhall. For
                    several years he practised at the Scotish bar, but by his marriage with Frances
                    Pulteney, niece to the carl of Bath, he acquired a princely fortune; and being a
                    man of penurious habits, he continued till the end of his life to accumulate
                    riches, which his only child, created countess of Bath, was miserably incapable
                    of enjoying. It is more than probable that Telford had been recommended to him
                    by Mr Pasley; and to this new connexion he was indebted for a very favourable
                    opening of his career as a civil engineer. He was appointed surveyor of the
                    public works in the rich and extensive county of Salop; and this office he
                    retained till the time of his death. His chief attention was thus devoted to
                    building and repairing bridges; but, as an architect, he was likewise employed
                    in superintending the erection of churches and other edifices. His politics did
                    not coincide with those of his patron. “Telford in his youth,” says Mr Rickman,
                    “is known to have been tinctured with the then fashionable doctrines of
                    democracy, while the strong mind of his patron derided and detested the flimsy
                    tissue, as might be expected from his penetration and experience. A dangerous
                    rupture was once likely to ensue, when Telford rather improperly transmitted
                    some of the political trash of the day under his patron’s frank;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It was most probably
                    addressed to his intimate friend Andrew Little, who kept a private and very
                    small school at Langholm, and who completely agreed with him in his political
                    creed. Telford did not neglect to send him a copy of Paine’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Right, of Man;</hi> and as he was totally blind, he employed one of his
                    scholars to read it in the evenings. Mr Little had received an academical
                    education before be lost his sight; and, aided by a memory of uncommon powers,
                    he taught the classics, and particularly the Greek classics, with much higher
                    reputation than any other schoolmaster within a pretty extensive circuit. Two of
                    his pupils read all the Iliad, and all or the greater part of Sophoclea After
                    hearing a long sentence of Greek or Latin distinctly recited, be could generally
                    construe and translate it with little or no hesitation. He was always much
                    gratified by Telford’s visits, which were not infrequent, to his native
                    district.</p></note> but the latter pardoned him, after due animadversion.”</p>
                <p>Telford’s progress in his professional career, though not uncommonly rapid, was
                    steady and certain; and every new opportunity of exerting his talents
                    contributed to extend a reputation which at length became unrivalled. In 1790 he
                    was employed by the British Fishery Society to inspect the harbours at their
                    several stations, and to devise a plan for an extensive establishment in the
                    county of Caithness; and after an interval of three years he was intrusted with
                    the management of the Ellesmere Canal. In 1803 the parliamentary commissioners
                    for making roads and building bridges in the Highlands, as well as the
                    commissioners for the Caledonian Canal, appointed him their engineer. Under the
                    former board, eleven hundred and seventeen bridges were erected, and nine
                    hundred and twenty miles of new roads were made; and under the latter board was
                    completed the Caledonian Canal, a work of great labour and expense. Under the
                    road commissioners on the Carlisle, Glasgow, and Lanarkshire roads, thirty
                    bridges were erected; one of them having a span of a hundred and fifty feet, and
                    another being a hundred and twenty-two feet high. In both parts of the kingdom,
                    he afterwards conducted a great variety of public operations; and in 1808 he was
                    employed by the Swedish government to execute a regular survey, and lay down
                    correct plans and sections of the country between Lake Wenern and the shore of
                    the Baltic, near Soderkoping, and to make a detailed Report on the subject, with
                    the view of connecting the great fresh-water lakes, and forming a direct
                    communication between the North Sea and the Baltic. Having completed this
                    service, he embarked at Gottenburg early in October. In August 1813 he again
                    visited Sweden, and inspected all the works then commenced, which chiefly
                    consisted of excavations. The king bestowed upon him a Swedish order of
                    knighthood, but his good sense prevented him from assuming the title. In our
                    days, such honours “be good cheap.” As a further mark of the royal approbation,
                    he received the king’s portrait set in valuable diamonds.</p>
                <p>He continued for many years to be engaged in a great variety of similar
                    undertakings, indeed in all the most important undertakings that were then in
                    progress; and a simple enumeration of his roads, bridges, canals, and harbours,
                    would itself occupy a very considerable space. “It has been said, and no doubt
                    truly, that Mr Telford was inclined to set a higher value on the success which
                    attended his exertions for improving the great communication from London to
                    Holyhead, the alterations of the line of road, its smoothness, and the
                    excellence of the bridges, than on that of any other work he executed. The Menai
                    Bridge will unquestionably be the most imperishable monument of Mr Telford’s
                    fame. This bridge over the Bangor ferry, connecting the counties of Carnarvon
                    and Anglesea, partly of stone and partly of iron, on the suspension principle,
                    consists of seven stone arches, exceeding in magnitude every work of the kind in
                    the world.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Annual

                <p>Telford was possessed of a robust frame, and till he reached the age of seventy,
                    he had never been visited with any serious illness. While at Cambridge in the
                    year 1827, he was afflicted with a severe and dangerous disorder; and although
                    he gradually recovered a certain degree of health, he never recovered his former
                    vigour. He became subject<pb break="no"

                    to bilious derangements in an alarming degree; and these recurring in the spring
                    and autumn of 1832 and 1833, and again in the spring of the ensuing year,
                    greatly impaired his strength. On the 23d of August 1834 he experienced an
                    attack, which, after affording some delusive expectations of his recovery,
                    reached its fatal termination on the second of September, after he had completed
                    the seventy-seventh year of his age. He died at his house in Abingdon Street,
                    Westminster, and his remains were deposited in the Abbey.</p>
                <p>He bequeathed legacies to the amount of L.16,600, but his own relations were
                    entirely overlooked. “After his mother’s death,” we are instructed, “Telford had
                    few family connections to provide for; and although he was ready to help these,
                    when occasionally in want of pecuniary assistance, yet he did not divide his
                    property amongst them, having from experience formed a strong opinion against
                    the removal of any man from his station in life.” Telford’s original station was
                    that of a journeyman mason at Langholm; and was it for him to appeal to his own
                    experience, and to form a strong opinion against the removal of any man from his
                    station in life? He had a cousin named James Jackson, whose labours as a mason
                    had rounded his ample shoulders almost to deformity; and being no longer fit for
                    hard work, he endeavoured to earn a livelihood by teaching a very humble school
                    in Westerkirk. If he received any pecuniary assistance from his more fortunate
                    relation, it must to all appearance have come in very scanty portions. The moral
                    philosophy of this engineer and his editor is by no means suited to our
                    unrefined taste. To Colonel Pasley, the nephew of his early benefactor, he
                    bequeathed a legacy of five hundred pounds. We likewise mention to his credit
                    that he bequeathed a thousand pounds to the subscription library of Westerkirk,
                    and the same amount to that of Langholm. In the last days of a lengthened life,
                    he had not utterly forgotten</p>
                <p>Thy pleasant banks, O Esk, and verdant groves, The seat of innocence, and purest
                    loves.</p>
                <p>The defects of his early education he had endeavoured to remedy by his own
                    unaided exertions in his mature years. We are informed that he had taught
                    himself Latin, French, and German, and could read those languages with facility,
                    and converse freely in French. He is likewise said to have been well acquainted
                    with algebra, but to have placed more reliance on experiment than on
                    mathematical investigation. A combination of science with experiment he
                    doubtless understood and practised, as the best method of proceeding in his more
                    difficult undertakings. He was a lover of literature, and was fond of
                    miscellaneous reading. His relish for poetry never deserted him; and two poets,
                    Campbell and Southey, were remembered in his will. To the Edinburgh
                    Encyclopa?dia he contributed the articles Architecture, Bridge-building, and
                    Canal-making. His account of his own life is however the most lasting monument
                    of his professional talents. Of his personal history, the details are very
                    meagre and unsatisfactory; but the record of his proceedings, and the result of
                    his experience, as an engineer who had been engaged in such important and
                    multifarious operations, constitute it a work of great interest in its own
                    department.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Life of
