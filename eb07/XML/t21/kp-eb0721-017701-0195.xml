                    >Templum</hi></label>, a public building erected in honour of some deity, either
                    true or false; and in which the people meet for the purpose of religious
                    worship. The word is formed from the Latin <hi rend="italic">templum,</hi> which
                    some derive from the Greek <hi rend="italic">τέμενος</hi>, signifying the same
                    thing. The word <hi rend="italic">templum,</hi> in its primary sense among the
                    old Romans, signified nothing more than a place set apart and consecrated by the
                    augurs, whether enclosed or open, in the city or in the fields. Clemens
                    Alexandrinus and Eusebius refer the origin of temples to the sepulchres built
                    for the dead. This notion has been illustrated and confirmed by a variety of
                    testimonies by Mr Farmer in his Treatise on the Worship of Human Spirits, p.
                    373, &amp;c. Herodotus and Strabo represent the Egyptians as the first who built
                    temples to the gods. The first erected in Greece is ascribed to Deucalion, by
                    Apollonius, Argonaut, lib. iii. Some ancient people performed their sacrifices
                    in all places indifferently, from a persuasion that the whole world is the
                    temple of God, and that he required no other. This was the doctrine of the magi,
                    followed by the Persians, the Scythians, the Numidians, and many other nations
                    mentioned by Herodotus, lib. i., Strabo, lib. xv,, and Cicero in his second
                    oration against Verres. The Persians, who worshipped the sun, believed it would
                    wrong his power to enclose him within the <pb break="no"

                    />walls of a temple, who had the whole world for his habitation; and hence, when
                    Xerxes ravaged Greece, the magi exhorted him to destroy all the temples he met
                    with. The Sicyonians would build no temple to their goddess Coronis; nor the
                    Athenians, for the like reason, erect any statue to Clemency, who, they said,
                    was to live in the hearts of men, not within stone walls. The Bithynians had no
                    temples but the mountains; nor had the ancient Germans any other but the woods.
                    Even some philosophers have blamed the use and building of temples, particularly
                    Diogenes, Zeno, and his followers the Stoics. But it may be said, that if God
                    has no need of temples, men have need of places to meet in for the public
                    offices of religion; and accordingly temples may be traced back even into the
                    remotest antiquity. See Hospinian <hi rend="italic">De Origine
                    Templorum.</hi></p>
                <p>The Romans had several kinds of temples. Those built by the kings, &amp;c.
                    consecrated by the augurs, and in which the exercise of religion was regularly
                    performed, were called, by way of eminence, <hi rend="italic">templa.</hi> Those
                    that were not consecrated were called <hi rend="italic">(aedes.</hi> The little
                    temples that were covered or roofed they called <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ediculae;</hi> those open, <hi rend="italic">sacella.</hi> Some other
                    edifices, consecrated to particular mysteries of religion, they called <hi
                    rend="italic">fana</hi> and <hi rend="italic">delubra.</hi> All these kinds of
                    temples, Vitruvius tells us, had other particular denominations, according to
                    the form and manner of their construction. The Romans indeed surpassed all
                    nations with regard to temples: they not only built temples to their gods, to
                    their virtues, to their diseases, &amp;c., but also to their emperors, and that
                    in their life-time. These particulars are sufficiently ascertained from medals,
                    inscriptions, and other monuments. Horace compliments Augustus, and sets him
                    above Hercules and all the heroes of table; because those were only admitted
                    into temples after their death, whereas Augustus had his temples and altars
                    while living. Epist ad Aug.</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N">Praesenti tibi maturos largimur honores,</l>
                    <l part="N">Jurandasque tuum per nomen ponimus aras.</l>
                </lg>
                <p>Suetonius gives an instance of the modesty of that emperor, who would allow of no
                    <hi rend="italic">temples</hi> being erected to him in the city; and who, even
                    in the provinces, where he knew it was usual to raise temples to the very
                    proconsuls, refused any but those erected in the name of Rome as well as his
                    own. The most celebrated temples among the Romans were the Capitol and Pantheon.
                    The temple of Saturn served for the public treasury.</p>
                <p>The temple at Jerusalem was similar in its plan to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tabernacle.</hi> The first temple was begun by Solomon about the year of the
                    world 2992, and before Christ 1012 according to some chronologers, and finished
                    in eight years. Great mistakes have been committed respecting the dimensions of
                    this temple, by confounding the emblematical description of Ezekiel with the
                    plain account of it in the books of King and Chronicles. It consisted of the
                    holy of holies, the sanctuary, and a portico The holy of holies was a square
                    room of twenty cubits; the sanctuary, or holy place, was forty cubits long and
                    twenty broad, consequently the length of both these together was sixty cubits.
                    The portico which stood before the sanctuary, was twenty cubits long and ten
                    cubits broad. Whether the portico was separated by a wall from the rest of the
                    temple is not mentioned in Scripture. If it was, the whole length of the temple,
                    computing the cubit at twenty-two inches, did not exceed 110 feet in length and
                    thirty-six feet eight inches in breadth. In the porticostood the two brazen
                    pillars called <hi rend="italic">Jachin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Boaz;</hi>
                    which, upon comparing and reconciling the seemingly different accounts in
                    different places, appear to have been forty cubits high, and about four cubits
                    diameter. The court probably at first extended all round the temple. We are
                    informed that the court about the tabernacle was 100 cubits long and fifty
                    broad; and as Solomon made every part of the temple about twice as large as the
                    corresponding part in the tabernacle, we have reason to conclude that the court
                    around the temple was 200 cubits long and 100 broad. According to this
                    description, which is taken from the Scripture history, the temple of Solomon
                    was by no means so large as it is commonly represented. Still, however, it was
                    very magnificent in size and splendid in ornament. It was plundered of its
                    treasures in the reign of Rehoboam, and repaired by Joash: it was again spoiled
                    in the time of Ahaz and of Hezekiah; and after being restored by Josiah, was
                    demolished by Nebuchadnezzar in the year of the world 3416, after it had stood
                    476 according to Josephus, and according to Usher 428 years.</p>
                <p>The second temple was built by the Jews, after their return from the Babylonish
                    captivity, under the direction and influence of Zerubbabel their governor, and
                    of Joshua the high priest, with the leave and encouragement of Cyrus the Persian
                    emperor, to whom Judea had now become a tributary kingdom. According to the
                    Jews, this temple was destitute of five remarkable appendages, which were the
                    chief glory of the first temple; the ark and mercy-seat, the Shechinah, the holy
                    fire on the altar, which had been first kindled from heaven, the urim and
                    thummim, and the spirit of prophecy. This temple was plundered and profaned by
                    Antiochus Epiphanes, who also caused the public worship in it to cease. It was
                    afterwards purified by Judas Maccabaeus, who restored the divine worship; and
                    after having stood 500 years, was rebuilt by Herod, with a magnificence
                    approaching to that of Solomon’s. Tacitus calls it “immensae opulentiae templum
                    and Josephus states that it was the most astonishing structure he had ever seen,
                    as well on account of its architecture as its magnitude, and likewise the
                    richness and magnificence of its various parts, and the reputation of its sacred
                    appurtenances. This temple, which Herod began to build about sixteen years
                    before the birth of Christ, and so far completed in nine years and a half as to
                    be fit for divine service, was at length destroyed by the Romans on the same
                    month and day of the month on which Solomon’s temple was destroyed by the
                    Babylonians.</p>
