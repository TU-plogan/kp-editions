                    the phenomena denominated <hi rend="italic">the tides.</hi> These form what are

                    between high and low water is called a <hi rend="italic">tide;</hi> the water is
                    said to <hi rend="italic">flow</hi> and to <hi rend="italic">ebb;</hi> and the
                    rising is called the <hi rend="italic">flood tide,</hi> and the falling the <hi
                    rend="italic">ebb tide.</hi> This rise or fall of the waters is exceedingly
                    different at different places, and is also variable everywhere. At Plymouth, for
                    instance, it is sometimes twenty feet between the greatest and least heights of
                    the water in one day, and sometimes only twelve feet. These different heights of
                    tide succeed each other in a regular series, diminishing from the greatest to
                    the least, and then increasing from the least to the greatest. The greatest is
                    called a <hi rend="italic">spring tide,</hi> and the least a <hi rend="italic"
                    >neap tide.</hi> This series is completed in about fifteen days. More careful
                    observation shows that two series arc completed in the time of a lunation. For
                    the spring tide in any place happens at a certain interval of time, generally
                    between one and two days, after new or full moon; and the neap tide at a certain
                    interval after the quarter: or, more accurately speaking, the spring tide occurs
                    when the moon has got a certain number of degrees eastward either from the line
                    of conjunction with the sun or of opposition to him, and the neap tide when she
                    is at a certain distance from her first or last quadrature. Thus the whole
                    series of tides appears to be chiefly regulated by the moon, and seems to be
                    only to a small extent under the influence of the sun; for it is further
                    observed that high water happens when the moon has nearly a certain position
                    with respect to the meridian of the place of observation, preceding or following
                    the moon’s southing by a certain interval of time; which, at new and full moon,
                    is generally not far from being constant with respect to the same place, but
                    very different in different places; whereas the interval between the time of
                    high water and noon changes almost everywhere about six hours in the course of a
                    fortnight.</p>
                <p>The interval between two succeeding high waters is variable. It is shortest about
                    new and full moon, being then about 12 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ 19 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> m</hi> ∙; and about the time of the moon’s quadra-ratures it
                    is 12 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ 30 <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi> ∙ But
                    these intervals are somewhat different at different places. The tides in similar
                    circumstances are greatest when the moon is in the equator, and at her smallest
                    distance from the earth, or in her perigee; and, gradually diminishing, are
                    smallest when she is in her apogee, and farthest from the equator.</p>
                <p>Such are some of the more general and regular phenomena of the tides. In certain
                    places there are four tides in the lunar day, in others but one; and in some
                    there is scarcely any perceptible variation of level, which regularly keeps time
                    with the moon. The tides being important to all commercial nations, great
                    exertions have recently been made to obtain the means of predicting them. Some
                    account <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=280"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0280-0260"/>of these and other empirical researches, which
                    have of late been conducted on an extensive scale and with great care, will be
                    given in the latter part of this article.</p>
                <p>It is of tides, most probably, the Bible speaks, when God is said to set bounds
                    to the sea, and to say, “thus far shall it go, and no farther.” Homer would be
                    the earliest profane author who notices the tides, if indeed it be to them he
                    refers (in the 12th book of the Odyssey) when he speaks of Charybdis rising and
                    retiring thrice a day. Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus speak more distinctly of
                    the tides in the Red Sea. Pytheas of Marseille is the first who says any thing
                    of their cause. According to Strabo, he had been in Britain, where he must have
                    observed the tides of the ocean. Plutarch says expressly that Pytheas ascribed
                    them to the moon. It is remarkable that Aristotle says so little about the
                    tides. The army of Alexander, his pupil, were startled at first seeing them near
                    the Persian Gulf; and Aristotle would probably be well informed of all that had
                    been observed there. But in all his writings there are only three passages
                    concerning them, and these are very trivial. In one place he speaks of great
                    tides in the north of Europe; in another, of their having been ascribed by some
                    to the moon; and in a third, he says, the tide in a great sea exceeds that in a
                    small one.</p>
                <p>The Greeks had little opportunity of observing the tides. The conquests and the
                    commerce of the Romans gave them more acquaintance with them. Caesar speaks of
                    them in the fourth book of his Gallic War. Strabo, after Posidonius, classes the
                    phenomena into daily, monthly, and annual. He observes, that the sea rises as
                    the moon approaches the meridian, whether above or below the horizon, and falls
                    again as she rises or falls; that the tides increase at the time of new and full
                    moon, and are greatest at the summer solstice. Pliny explains the phenomena at
                    some length, and ascribes them to the sun and moon dragging the waters along
                    with them (b. ii. c. 97). Seneca (<hi rend="italic">Nat. Quest,</hi> iii. 28)
                    speaks of the tides with correctness; and Macrobius (<hi rend="italic">Somn.
                    Scip.</hi> i. 6) gives a tolerable description of their motions. Such phenomena
                    naturally exercise human curiosity as to their cause. Plutarch (<hi
                    rend="italic">Placit. Phil.</hi> iii. 17), Galileo <hi rend="italic">(Sgsr.
                    Mund.</hi> dial. 4), Riccioli in his <hi rend="italic">Almagest,</hi> ii. p.
                    374, and Gassendi, ii. p. 27, have collected most of the notions of their
                    predecessors on the subject; but they are of so little importance as not to
                    deserve our notice. Kepler, in accounting for the tides (<hi rend="italic">De
                    Stella Martis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Epit. Astron.</hi> p. 555), had
                    evidently been aware of the principle of gravitation, but not of the law. He
                    says that all bodies attract each other, and that the waters of the ocean would
                    all go to the moon were they not retained by the attraction of the earth. He
                    then proceeds to explain their elevation under the moon and on the opposite
                    side, because the earth is less attracted by the moon than the nearer waters,
                    but more than the waters which are more remote. The honour of a complete
                    explanation of the tides in a general way was reserved for Sir Isaac Newton. He
                    laid hold of this class of phenomena as the most incontestable proof of
                    universal gravitation, and has given a most beautiful and synoptical view of the
                    whole subject; contenting himself, however, with merely exhibiting the chief
                    consequences of the general principle, and applying it to the phenomena with
                    singular address.</p>
                <p>The investigation of the phenomena of the tides has been justly considered as
                    uniting some of the greatest difficulties that occur in the various departments
                    of natural philosophy and astronomy. It implies, first, a knowledge of the laws
                    of gravitation, concerned in the determination of the forces immediately acting
                    on the sea, and of the periods and distances of the celestial bodics, which
                    modify the magnitudes and combinations of these forces; and, secondly, of the
                    hydraulic theories of the resistances of fluids, and of the motions of waves and
                    undulations of all kinds, and of the theoretical determination of the form and
                    density of the earth, as well as of the geographical observation of the breadth
                    and depth of the seas and lakes which occupy a part of its surface; so that the
                    whole subject affords abundant scope for the exercise of mathematical skill, and
                    still more for the employment of that invention and contrivance which enables
                    its possessor to supersede the necessity of prolix com· putations wherever they
                    can be avoided.</p>
                <p>The history of the theory of the tides is naturally divided into several periods
                    in which its different departments have been progressively cultivated. The
                    ancients from the times of Posidonius and Pytheas, and the moderns before
                    Newton, were contented with observing the general dependence of the tides on the
                    moon, as following her transit at an interval of about two hours, and their
                    alternate increase and decrease not only every fortnight, but also in the lunar
                    period of about eight years. The second step consisted in the determination of
                    the magnitude and direction of the solar and lunar forces, by which the general
                    effects of the tides were shown, in the <hi rend="italic">Principia,</hi> to be
                    the necessary consequences of these forces. The third great point was the
                    demonstration of Maclaurin, that the form of an elliptic spheroid affords an
                    equilibrium under the action of the disturbing forces concerned; while the
                    further contemporary illustrations of the subject by Euler and Bernoulli, though
                    they afforded some useful details, involved no new principle that can be put in
                    competition with Maclaurin’s demonstration. The fourth important step was made
                    by Laplace, who separated the consideration of the <hi rend="italic">form</hi>
                    affording mere equilibrium, from that of the <hi rend="italic">morion</hi>
                    occasioned by the continual change of that form; while former theorists had
                    taken it for granted that the surface of the sea very speedily assumed the
                    figure of a fluid actuated by similar forces, but remaining perfectly at rest,
                    or assuming instantly the form in question. Laplace’s computation is however
                    limited to the case of an imaginary ocean, of a certain variable depth, assumed
                    for the convenience of calculation, rather than for any other reason. Dr Thomas
                    Young has extended Laplace’s mode of considering the phenomena to the more
                    general case of an ocean covering a part only of the earth’s surface, and more
                    or less irregular in its form; he has also attempted to comprehend in his
                    calculations the precise effects of hydraulic friction on the times and
                    magnitudes of the tides. As far as the resistance may be supposed to vary in the
                    simple ratio of the velocity, Dr Young’s theory is sufficiently complete, and
                    explains several of the peculiarities which are otherwise paradoxical in their
                    appearance; but there still remains a difficulty to be combated with respect to
                    the effects of a resistance proportional to the square of the velocity, and
                    this, it is hoped, will be in great measure removed in the present article,
                    which, however, from the space that is allotted to it, must be considered rather
                    as a supplementary fragment than as a complete treatise. This theory will be
                    divided into four sections: the first relating to the contemporaneous progress
                    of the tides through the different seas and oceans, as collected from
                    observation only; the second to the magnitude of the disturbing forces tending
                    to change the form of the surface of the earth and sea; the third to the theory
                    of compound vibrations with resistance; and the fourth to the application of
                    this theory to the progress and successive magnitudes of the tides, as
                    observable at any one port.</p>

                    Contemporary Tides, as inferred from the times of High Water in different
                    Ports.</hi></p>
                <p>The least theoretical consideration relating to the tides, is that of their
                    progress through the different parts of the ocean, and of its dependent seas.
                    The analysis of these ought to be very completely attainable from direct
                    observation, <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=281"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0281-0261"/>if the time of high water had been accurately
                    observed at a sufficient number of ports throughout the world; and, on the other
                    hand, if the earth were covered in all parts with a fluid of great and nearly
                    uniform depth, the tides of this fluid would be so regular, that a very few
                    observations would be sufficient to enable us to deduce the whole of the
                    phenomena from theory, and to trace the great waves, which would follow the sun
                    and moon round the globe, so as to make its circuit in a day, without any
                    material deviation from uniformity of motion and succession. Having collected,
                    for the actual state of the sea and continents, an abundant store of accurate
                    observations of the precise time of high water with regard to the sun and moon,
                    for every part of the surface, and having arranged them in a table according to
                    the order of their occurrence, as expressed in the time of any one meridian, we
                    might then suppose lines to be drawn on a terrestrial globe, through all the
                    places of observation, in the same order; and these lines would indicate,
                    supposing the places to be sufficiently numerous, so as to furnish a series of
                    tides very nearly contemporary, the directions of the great waves, to which that
                    of the progress of the tides in succession must be perpendicular. If, however,
                    we actually make such an attempt, we shall soon find how utterly inadequate the
                    observations that have been recorded are, for the purpose of tracing the forms
                    of the lines of contemporary high water with accuracy or with certainty,
                    although they are abundantly sufficient to show the impossibility of deducing
                    the time of high water at any given place from the Newtonian hypothesis, or even
                    from that of Laplace, without some direct observation. It might at least be
                    supposed very easy to enumerate the existing observations, scanty as they may
                    be, in a correct order; but there is a number of instances in which it is wholly
                    uncertain whether the time observed at a given port relates to the tide of the
                    same morning in the open ocean, or to that of the preceding evening. This
                    inconvenience may, however, in some measure be remedied, by inserting such
                    places in two different parts of the table, at the distance of twelve and a half

                <p>It may be immediately inferred from this table, first, that the line of
                    contemporary tides is seldom in the exact direction of the meridian, as it is
                    supposed to be universally in the theory of Newton and of Laplace; except,
                    perhaps, the line for the twenty-first hour in the Indian Ocean, which appears
                    to extend from Socotora to the Almirantes and the Isle of Bourbon, lying nearly
                    in the same longitude. Secondly, the southern extremity of the line advances as
                    it passes the Cape of Good Hope, so that it turns up towards the Atlantic, which
                    it enters obliquely, so as to arrive, nearly at the same moment, at the Island
                    of Ascension, and at the Island of Martin Vaz, or of the Trinity. Thirdly, after
                    several irregularities about the Cape Verd Islands, and in the West Indies, the
                    line appears to run nearly east and west from St Domingo to Cape Blanco, the
                    tides proceeding due northwards; and then, turning still more to the right, the
                    line seems to run north-west and south-east, till at last the tide runs almost
                    due east up the British Channel and round the north of Scotland into the
                    Northern Ocean, sending off a branch down the North Sea to meet the succeeding
                    tide at the mouth of the Thames. Fourthly, towards Cape Horn, again, there is a
                    good deal of irregularity; the hour-lines are much compressed between South
                    Georgia and Tierra del Fuego, perhaps on account of the shallower water about
                    the Falkland lslands and South Shetland. Fifthly, at the entrance of the Pacific
                    Ocean, the tides seem to advance very rapidly to New Zealand and Easter Island;
                    but here it appears to be uncertain whether the line of contemporary tide should
                    be drawn nearly north and south from the Gallapagos to Tierra del Fuego, or
                    north-east and south-west from Easter Island to New Zealand; or whether both
                    these partial directions are correct: but on each side of this line there are
                    great irregularities, and many more observations are wanting before the progress
                    of the tide can be traced with any tolerable accuracy, among the multitudinous
                    islands of the Pacific Ocean, where it might have been hoped that the phenomena
                    would have been observed in their greatest simplicity, and in their most genuine
                    form. Lastly, of the Indian Ocean the northern parts exhibit great
                    irregularities, and among the rest they afford the singular phenomenon of one
                    tide in the day, observed by Halley in the port of Tonkin, and explained by
                    Newton in the <hi rend="italic">Principia:</hi> the southern parts are only
                    remarkable for having the hour-lines of contemporary tides considerably crowded
                    between New Holland and the Cape of Good Hope, as if the seas of these parts
                    were shallower than elsewhere.</p>
                <p>These inferences respecting the progress of the tides are not advanced as the
                    result of any particular theory, nor even as the only ones that might possibly
                    be deduced from the table. Thus the supposion that the direction in which the
                    tides advance must be perpendicular to the hour-lines of contemporary tides, is
                    not by any means absolutely without exception, since a quadrangular lake, with
                    steep shores in the direction of the meridian, would have the times of high
                    water the same for every point of its eastern or western halves respectively,
                    and there could be no correctly defined direction of the hour-lines in such a
                    case. But if any portion of the sea could be considered as constituting such a
                    lake, its properties would be detected by a sufficient number of observations of
                    high water; and the existing table does not appear to indicate any such cases
                    that require to be otherwise distinguished than as partial irregularities. There
                    may also be some doubt respecting the propriety of the addition of twelve and a
                    half hours that has been made to the time of high water in the north-eastern
                    parts of the Atlantic: but it seems extremely improbable that the same tide
                    should travel north-easterly into the English Channel and into the Northern
                    Ocean, and at the same time westerly across the Atlantic, as it must be supposed
                    to do, if it were considered as primarily originating in the neighbour hood of
                    the Bay of Biscay. On the other hand, the bending of the great wave round the
                    continents of Africa and Europe seems to be very like the sort of refraction
                    which takes place on every shelving coast with respect to the common waves,
                    which, whatever may have been their primitive origin, acquire always, as they
                    spread, a direction more and more nearly parallel to that of the coast which
                    they are approaching: and the suppositions which have been here advanced
                    respecting the succession of the tides in different ports, allowing for the
                    effect of a multitude of irregularities proceeding from partial causes, appear
                    to be by far the most probable that can be immediately inferred from the table,
                    at least in its present state of imperfection.</p>

                    that occasion the Tides.</hi></p>
                <p>Since the phenomena of the tides, with regard to their progress through the
                    different oceans and seas, as they exist in the actual state of the earth’s
                    surface, appear to be too complicated to allow us to hope to reduce them to
                    computation by means of any general theory, we must, in the next place, confine
                    our attention to the order in which the successive changes occur in any single
                    port; and having determined the exact magnitude of the forces that tend to
                    change the form of the surface of the ocean at different periods, and having
                    also examined the nature of the vibratory motions of which the sea, or any given
                    portion of it, would be susceptible, in the simplest cases, after the cessation
                    of the disturbing forces, we must afterwards endeavour to combine these causes,
                    so as to adapt the result to the successive phenomena which are observed at
                    different times in any one port.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> A. (“E.”—Nicholson’s Journal, July 1813.) The
                    disturbing force of a distant attractive body, urging a particle of a fluid in
                    the direction of the surface of a sphere, varies as the sine of twice the
                    altitude of the body.</p>
                <p>The mean attraction exerted by the sun and moon on all the separate particles
                    composing the earth, is exactly compensated by the centrifugal force derived
                    from the earth’s annual revolution round the sun, and from its monthly
                    revolution round the common centre of gravity of the earth and moon; but the
                    difference of the attractions exerted at different points of the earth, must
                    necessarily produce a disturbing force, depending on the angular position of the
                    point with regard to the sun or moon, since the centrifugal force is the same
                    for them all; the disturbing force being constantly variable for any one point,
                    and depending partly on the difference of the distance of the point from the
                    mean distance, and partly on the difference of the direction of the luminary
                    from its direction with respect to the centre, or, in other words, on its
                    parallax.</p>
                <p>In the case of a sphere covered with a fluid, it will be most convenient for
                    computation to consider both these forces as referred to the direction of the
                    circumference of the sphere, which will differ but little from that of the
                    fluid; and it will appear that both of them, when reduced to this direction,
                    will vary as the product of the sine and cosine of the distance from the
                    diameter pointing to the luminary, that is, as half the sine of twice the
                    altitude: for the difference of gravitation, which depends on the difference of
                    the distance, will always vary as the sine of the distance from the bisecting
                    plane perpendicular to that diameter, and will be reduced to the direction of
                    the surface by diminishing it in the ratio of the cosine to the radius; and the
                    effect of the difference of direction will be originally proportional to the
                    sine of the distance from the diameter, and will in like manner be expressed,
                    when reduced, by the product of the sine and cosine; and each force, thus
                    reduced, will be equal, where it is greatest, to half of its primitive
                    magnitude, since sin. cos. 45° = ½. “Thus, the gravitation towards the <pb

                    [F.] The inclination of the surface of an oblong spheroid, slightly elliptical,
                    to that of the inscribed sphere, varies as the sine of twice the distance from
                    the circle of contact; and a particle resting on any part of it, without
                    friction, may be held in equilibrium by the attraction of a distant body
                    [situated in the direction of the axis].</p>
                <p>If a sphere be inscribed in an oblong spheroid, the elevation of the spheroid
                    above the sphere must obviously be proportional, when measured in a direction
                    parallel to the axis of the spheroid, to the ordinate of the sphere, that is, to
                    the sine of the distance from its equator; and when reduced to a direction
                    perpendicular to the surface of the sphere, it must be proportional to the
                    square of that sine; and the tangent of the inclination to the surface of the
                    sphere, which is equal to the fluxion of the elevation divided by that of the
                    circumference, must be expressed by twice the continual product of the sine, the
                    cosine, and the ellipticity, or rather the greater elevation <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi>, the radius being considered as unity: so that the elevation <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> will also express the tangent of the inclination where it
                    is greatest, since 2 sin. cos. 45° = 1; and the inclination will be everywhere
                    as the product of the sine and cosine.</p>
                <p>If, therefore, the density of the elevated parts be considered as evanescent, and
                    their attraction be neglected, there will be an equilibrium, when the
                    ellipticity is to the radius as the disturbing force to the whole force of
                    gravitation; for each particle situated on the surface will be actuated by a
                    disturbing force tending towards the pole of the spheroid, precisely equal and
                    contrary to that portion of the force of gravitation which urges it in the
                    opposite direction down the inclined surface. Hence, if the density of the sea
                    were supposed inconsiderable in comparison with that of the earth, the radius
                    being 20 839 000 feet, the greatest height of a lunar tide in equilibrium would

                    divided by a plane perpendicular to the meridian of the point, and consequently
                    bisecting the equatorial plane of the spheroid: it is obvious, that if the
                    elevations on the opposite sides of the plane be equal at the corresponding
                    points of each circle, no lateral force will be produced; but when they are
                    unequal, the excess of the elevated matter on one side above that of the other
                    side will produce a disturbing or lateral force. Now, the elevation being
                    everywhere as the square of the distance <hi rend="italic">x</hi> from the
                    equatorial plane, we may call it <hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> and the difference corresponding to
                    any point of that semicircle which is the nearer to the pole of the spheroid,
                    will be <hi rend="italic">e (x'</hi><hi rend="italic

                    But <hi rend="italic">x'</hi> + <hi rend="italic">x''</hi> is always twice the
                    distance of the centre of the supposed circle from the equatorial plane; and the
                    distance of this centre from that of the sphere will be cos. ψ, if ψ be the
                    angular distance of the circle from its pole; and calling <hi rend="italic"
                    >φ</hi> the distance of this pole from the equatorial plane of the spheroid, the
                    distance in question will be cos. ψ sin. <hi rend="italic">φ,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">x' + x" =2</hi> cos. ψ sin. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi>; and the
                    difference <hi rend="italic">x'</hi> — <hi rend="italic">x''</hi> is twice the
                    actual sine of the arc <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> in the supposed circle, that is,
                    twice the natural sine, reduced in the ratio of unit to the radius of this
                    circle, which is sin. ψ. reduced again to a direction perpendicular to the
                    equatorial plane; whence <hi rend="italic">x'</hi> — <hi rend="italic">x''</hi>
                    = 2 sin. <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> sin. ψ cos. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi>; and <hi

                    sin. cos. ψ sin. cos. <hi rend="italic">φ.</hi> Hence it follows, that, in
                    different , positions of the gravitating particle, the effective elevation at
                    each point of the surface, similarly situated with respect to it, is as the
                    product of the sine and cosine of its angular distance <hi rend="italic">φ</hi>
                    from the equatorial plane, the other quantities concerned remaining the same in
                    all positions. But the inclination of the surface of the spheroid, as well as
                    the original disturbing force, varies in the same proportion of the product of
                    the sine and cosine of the distance <hi rend="italic">φ</hi>; consequently the
                    sum of this disturbing attraction and the original force will also vary as the
                    inclination of the surface, and may be in equilibrium with the tendency to
                    descend towards the centre, provided that the ellipticity be duly commensurate
                    to the density of the elevated parts.</p>
                <p>Now, in order to find the actual magnitude of the disturbing attraction for a

                <p><hi rend="italic">Scholium.</hi> The demonstration of this theorem implies that
                    water is incompressible, and that the pressure of each particle placed on the
                    surface is instantaneously communicated through the whole depth of the fluid to
                    the bottom. These suppositions are not indeed strictly accurate in any case, but
                    they introduce no sensible error when the surface of the wave similarly affected
                    is large in comparison with the depth of the fluid. A modern author of celebrity
                    seems to have taken it for granted that the pressure is propagated with the same
                    velocity downwards and laterally; at least, if such is not his meaning, he has
                    been somewhat unfortunate in the choice of his expressions; but there seems no
                    reason whatever why water should communicate force more slowly when it is
                    perfectly confined, than ice would do; and the divergence of the pressure of a
                    certain portion of the surface of water, elevated a little, for example, above
                    the rest, may be compared to the <hi rend="italic">divergence</hi> of a sound

                    another opposite obstacle at twice that distance, there may be a perpetual

                    compared with the surface of the sphere of equal magnitude, exhibits a

                    the shores should be very rocky or perpendicular, in order to produce a strong
                    reflection; for even the vibration of the water in the bottom of a common
                    hemispherical basin is considerably permanent.</p>

                    contained in a canal, following the direction of the equator, and 90° in length,
                    would be synchronous with the passage of a wave 180° in breadth, over any point
                    of a canal of the same depth, and surrounding the whole globe.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scholium</hi> 2. It has been usual to consider the elevation of
                    the tides as identical with that of an oblong spheroid, measured at its vertex,
                    and therefore as amounting to twice as much as the depression of the same
                    spheroid at the equator, considered in relation to the mean height belonging to
                    a sphere of the same magnitude; but the supposition is by no means applicable to
                    the case of a globe covered partially and irregularly with water, so that in
                    almost all cases of actual tides, the elevation must be considered as little if
                    at all greater than the depression, as far as this cause only is concerned;
                    there are, however, some other reasons to expect that the elevation of the great
                    wave might often arrive at a distant port in somewhat greater force than the

                    points which are subjected to compound regular vibrations, of which the
                    constituent periods are completed in half a lunar and half a solar day [or in
                    some particular cases a whole day].</p>
                <p>Supposing the surface of the sea to remain at rest, each point of it would become
                    alternately elevated and depressed, in comparison with the situation in which it
                    might remain in equilibrium; its distance from this situation varying according
                    to the regular law of the pendulum (see Theorem B); and, like all minute
                    vibrations, it will be actuated by forces indirectly dependent on, and
                    proportional to, this distance; so that it may be compared to a pendulous body
                    remaining at rest in the vertical line, about which its point of suspension
                    vibrates, and will consequently follow the motion of the temporary horizon, in
                    the same manner as the pendulum follows the vibration of its point of
                    suspension, either with a direct or a retrograde motion, according to
                    circumstances, which will be hereafter explained: the operation of the forces
                    concerned being perfectly analogous, whether we consider the simple hydrostatic
                    pressure depending on the elevation, or the horizontal pressure derived from the
                    inclination of the surface, or the differential force immediately producing
                    elevation and depression, depending on the variation of the horizontal pressure,
                    and proportional to the curvature of the surface. It becomes therefore
                    necessary, for the theory of the tides, to investigate minutely the laws of
                    these compound and compulsory vibrations, which, together with the resistances
                    affecting them, will be the subject of the next section.</p>

                    investigation which will be employed in these propositions, it will be proper to
                    premise some remarks on the investigation of fluxional equations, by means of
                    multipliers. A person unacquainted with the language of modern mathematicians,
                    would naturally understand by a “criterion of integrability,” some mode of
                    distinguishing an expression that would be integrated, from one that was
                    untractable; while, in fact, this celebrated criterion relates only to the
                    accidental form in which the expression occurs, and not to its essential nature.
                    If we take, for instance, the well-known case of the fluxion of hl <hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> x</hi><hi rend="italic">/</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> y</hi> = hl <hi rend="italic">x</hi> — hl <hi rend="italic">y ,</hi>
                    we have <hi rend="superscript"> dx</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> x</hi>- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> dy</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> y</hi> = <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ydx-xdy</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> xy</hi>, and making
                    this = 0, we have also <hi rend="italic">ydx—</hi> xdy = 0; and this expression
                    no longer fulfils the conditions of integrability, until we multiply it again by
                    —, and restore it to its perfect form. The direct investigation of such a
                    multiplier is generally attended by insuperable difficulties; and the best
                    expedient, in practical cases, is to examine the results of the employment of
                    such multipliers as are most likely to be concerned in the problem, with
                    indeterminate co-efficients, and to compare them with the equations proposed. In
                    common cases, the finding of fluents, when only one variable quantity is
                    concerned, requires little more than the employment of a table of fluents or
                    integrals such as that of Meier Hirsch; and the truth of the solution is in
                    general tested at once, for each case, by taking the fluxion of the quantity
                    inserted in the table: but for the separation of different variable quantities,
                    where they are involved with each other, the employment of proper multipliers is
                    one of the most effectual expedients; and it is still more essential to the
                    solution of equations between fluxions of different orders, or their
                    coefficients. Such equations require in general to be compared with some
                    multiple of the exponential quantity <hi rend="italic">e</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> mt</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> which affords fluxions of
                    successive orders, that have simple relations to each other, especially when d
                    <hi rend="italic">t</hi> is considered as constant. The multiples of sin. <hi
                    rend="italic">Ct,</hi> and cos. <hi rend="italic">Ct,</hi> are also very useful
                    in such investigations, and for a similar reason; but the solutions that they
                    afford are commonly less comprehensive than the former, though they are often
                    simpler, and more easily obtained. It is not however necessary that the exponent
                    of the multiplier should flow uniformly, as will appear from the first example
                    of a problem which has been solved by Euler in his Mechanics: the subsequent
                    examples will possess somewhat more of novelty.</p>

                    merely expanded the value of into a new series, by means of the Newtonian
                    theorem; but the fluents thus obtained for the expression of the time are
                    deficient in convergency; and a similar difficulty would occur if we expressed

                    supposing the time to begin at the point where the velocity is a maximum; and it
                    will be necessary, in this investigation, to follow his steps, with some slight

                    the time of a vibration will be to the length of the pendulum as the

                <p><hi rend="italic">Scholium</hi> 5. There is a paradox in the relations of the
                    diminution of the vibration to the distance measuring the greatest resistance,
                    which it will be worth while to consider, in order to guard ourselves against
                    the too hasty adoption of some methods of approximation which appear at first
                    sight unexceptionable. The pendulum, if it set out from a state of rest at the
                    point of greatest resistance, would perform a vibration to the extent of double
                    the distance of that point, or 2 λ, the initial force being measured by that
                    distance. Now, when the resistance is very small, its magnitude may be obtained
                    without sensible error from the velocity of the pendulum vibrating without
                    resistance at the corresponding part of the arc; and the velocity may be
                    supposed to vary as sin. <hi rend="italic">Ct,</hi> and the resistance, in the
                    case of this proposition, as sin. <hi rend="italic">ct</hi> or sin. <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> also. Hence it may be inferred by means of the Lemma, that
                    the whole diminution of the space will be to <hi rend="italic superscript">

                    />been found to be the actual difference of two successive semivibrations. The
                    accuracy of this result, however, must depend on the mutual compensation of its
                    errors; for the approximation supposes, that if the resistance vanished at the
                    lowest point, the subsequent retardation would be such as to diminish the space
                    by the effect of the diminution of the velocity acting uniformly through the
                    remainder of the vibration, while in fact the diminution of the space from this
                    cause would be simply equal to a part of the arc proportional to the diminution
                    of the velocity, since the arc of ascent is simply as the velocity at the lowest
                    point. Hence it is obvious, that the effects of the resistance are too much
                    complicated with the progress of the vibration to allow us to calculate them
                    separately; and accordingly, when the resistance is as the square of the
                    velocity, or as sin. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">x,</hi> the

                    motion of the pendulum will then be represented by the sum of the sines of two
                    unequal arcs in the same circle; and if these arcs are commensurate with each
                    other, the vibration will ultimately acquire a double extent, and nearly
                    disappear in a continued succession of periods, provided that no resistance
                    interfere. And the consequences of any other initial conditions may be
                    investigated in a manner nearly similar. Thus, if the time of free vibration,

                    greatest excursion forwards, after three semivibrations, at the same moment with
                    the fixed vibration, and after three complete vibrations more would be at its
                    greatest distance in the opposite direction, so as to increase every subsequent
                    vibration equally on each side, and permanently to combine the whole extent of
                    the separate arcs of vibration. But in this and in every other similar
                    vibration, beginning from a state of rest in the vertical line, that is, at the
                    point where the periodical force is evanescent, the effect of the free or
                    subordinate vibration with respect to the place of the body will obviously
                    disappear whenever an entire number of ιsemi-vibrations has been performed.</p>

                    the last theorem may be illustrated by means of this proposition, and will serve
                    in its turn to justify the mode of computation here employed in a remarkable
                    manner. It has been observed in Nicholson’s Journal for July 1813, that the mode
                    of investigating the effects of variable forces, by resolving them into parts
                    represented by the sines of multiple arcs, and considering the vibrations
                    derived from each term as independent in their progress, but united in their
                    effects, may be applied to the problem of a pendulum vibrating with a resistance
                    proportional to the square of the velocity; and that for this purpose the square
                    of the sine may be represented by the series sin. <hi rend="superscript">

                    of the Periodical Forces which Act on the Sea or on a Lake.</hi></p>
                <p>In order to compute, by means of the theory which has been laid down in the two
                    preceding sections, the primitive tides of any sea or any portion of the ocean,
                    we must compare its spontaneous oscillations with those of a narrow prismatic
                    canal, situated in a given direction with respect to the meridian, which in
                    general must be that of the greatest length of the sea in question, neglecting
                    altogether the actual breadth of the sea, which, if considerable, may require to
                    have its own distinct vibrations compounded with those of the length, each being
                    first computed independently of the other. Now, supposing the time required for
                    the principal spontaneous oscillation of the sea or lake to be known, we must
                    find the length of the synchronous pendulum, and taking <hi rend="italic">B

                    force in terms of the sine, or cosines of multiple arcs, increasing uniformly
                    with the time.</p>
                <p>Now the force is measured, for the direction of the meridian of the spheroid of
                    equilibrium, by sin. cos. <hi rend="italic">z</hi> (Theorem A), <hi
                    rend="italic">z</hi> being either the zenith distance or the altitude; and it is
                    obvious that, when the canal is situated obliquely with respect to the meridian
                    of the spheroid, the inclination of the surface, and with it the force, will be
                    diminished as the secant of the obliquity increases, or as the cosine of the
                    obliquity diminishes; so that the force will vary as sin. cos. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alt.</hi> sin. <hi rend="italic">Az.</hi> if the canal be in an easterly and
                    westerly direction; or if it deviate from that direction in a given angle, as
                    sin. cos. <hi rend="italic">Alt.</hi> sin. <hi rend="italic">(Az.</hi> + <hi
                    rend="italic">Dev.);</hi> and it is obvious that this force will vanish both
                    when the luminary is in the horizon, and when it is in the vertical circle,
                    perpendicular to the direction of the canal; that is, if we consider the force
                    as acting horizontally on a particle at the middle of the length of the given
                    canal; and the same force may be considered as acting vertically, with a proper
                    reduction of its magnitude, at the end of the canal; for the horizontal
                    oscillations at the middle must obviously follow the same laws as the vertical
                    motions at the end.</p>
                <p>The case, however, of a canal running east and west, admits a very remarkable
                    simplification; and since it approaches nearly to that of an open ocean, which
                    has been most commonly considered, it will be amply sufficient for the
                    illustration of the present theory. For, in general, sin. <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The effect of that part of the hydraulic resistance, which is proportional to the
                    square of the velocity, must be expressed by an approximation deduced from the
                    periodical character of the force, as depending on that of the primitive forces
                    concerned; taking, however, the precaution to use such expressions only as will
                    always represent this resistance in its proper character as a retarding force:
                    for if we simply found for it an equivalent expression, denoting accurately the
                    square of the velocity, this square, being always positive, would imply a force
                    acting always in the same direction. Now, we have already seen (Theorem J, Cor.
                    3), that sin. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">x</hi> may be
                    considered, with respect to its principal effect, as equivalent to ∙8484 sin.
                    <hi rend="italic">x:</hi> and if we neglect, in the determination of the
                    resistance, the effect of the smaller forces, and compute only that of the
                    principal terms ½ L' sin. <hi rend="italic">2t,</hi> and ½ <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >l'</hi> sin. <hi rend="italic">2t',</hi> we may call the velocities depending
                    on these forces 6’ cos. (2 <hi rend="italic">t</hi> + <hi rend="italic">s</hi>

                    the tides depending on their combination with the conditions of the given sea or
                    lake. The resistance will then be as the square of *** <hi rend="italic">S'</hi>

                    resistance, and a very near approximation to its magnitude.</p>

                    afterwards reduced it in the proportion of sin. 0. Hence it is obvious, that for
                    all modifications of the forces greatly exceeding in their periods the period of
                    spontaneous oscillation, the effects may be computed as if the forces were
                    exempt from those modifications, and then supposed to be varied in the same
                    proportion as the forces; but we cannot be quite certain of the magnitude of the
                    error thus introduced, unless we know the exact value of <hi rend="italic"
                    >B,</hi> which determines the time of spontaneous oscillation.</p>
                <p>***Considering, therefore, in this simple point of view, the correct expression

                    <hi rend="italic">Hor.</hi> ≤, we may observe that the phenomena for each
                    luminary will be arranged in two principal divisions, the most considerable
                    being represented by <hi rend="smallcaps">⅛l' cos.</hi><hi rend="superscript
                    smallcaps"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">Decl.</hi> sin. 2 <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hor.</hi> &lt;≤, and giving a tide every twelve hours, which varies in
                    magnitude as the square of the cosine of the declination varies, increasing and
                    diminishing twice a year, being also proportional to the cosine of the latitude
                    of the place, and disappearing for a sea situated at the pole. The second part
                    is a diurnal tide, proportional to the sine of the latitude of the given canal,
                    being greatest when the luminary is farthest from the equinox, and vanishing
                    when its declination vanishes.</p>
                <p>From these general principles, an attentive student may easily trace for himself
                    the agreement of the theory here explained, with the various modifications of
                    the tides as they are actually observed. It however remains for us to inquire
                    more particularly into the cause of the hitherto unintelligible fact, that the
                    maximum of the spring tides in the most exposed situations is at least half a
                    day, if not a whole day, later than the maximum of the moving forces.</p>
                <p>Now it is easy to perceive, that since the resistance observing the lunar period
                    is more considerable than that which affects the solar tide, the lunar tide will
                    be more retarded or accelerated than the solar; retarded when the oscillation is
                    direct, or when <hi rend="italic">G</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">— B</hi> is positive, and accelerated when it is inverted, or when
                    that quantity is negative; and that in order to obtain the perfect coincidence
                    of the respective high waters, the moon must be farther from the meridian of the
                    place than the sun; so that the greatest direct tides ought to happen a little
                    before the syzygies, and the greatest inverted tides a little after; and from
                    this consideration, as well as from some others, it seems probable that the
                    primitive tides which affect most of our harbours are rather inverted than
                    direct.</p>
                <p>If we wish to apply this theory with precision to the actual state of the solar
                    and lunar motions, we must determine the value of the co-efficients, from the
                    tables of those luminaries. And, first, making the unit of time a whole solar
                    day, in which the horary angle <hi rend="italic">t</hi> extends from 0° to 360°,
                    the sun’s mean longitude will be <hi rend="italic superscript"> t</hi> / <hi

                    horary angle <hi rend="italic">t'</hi> will be found from the variation, or the
                    moon’s age in space.</p>
                <p>Now, in Burckhardt’s Tables, p. 87, we find the variation for the midnight ending
                    1823, by adding the constant quantity 9° to the epoch for 1824, and (11 <hi

                    astronomical time at Paris, the variation is — (9' 33"), corresponding to the

                <p>The sun’s mean longitude for the same epoch is (279° 35' 23∙1'') = ·77666; his

                <p>We may compute, with sufficient accuracy, the effect of the modifications
                    produced by the change of the moon’s distance, or the inequality of her motion
                    in her orbit, or of the periodical change of the inclination of her orbit to the
                    equator, which takes place from the revolution of the nodes, by simply
                    considering the changes which will be produced in the forces concerned by these
                    inequalities, and supposing the effects simply proportional to their causes. If,
                    however, it were desired to determine these modifications with still greater
                    precision, we might deduce approximate formulas for expressing them from the

                <p>Although the value of the co-efficient <hi rend="italic">B</hi> is not directly
                    discoverable, we may still obtain a tolerable estimate of its magnitude in
                    particular cases, by inquiring into the consequences of assigning to it several
                    different values, equal, for example, to the co-efficient of the solar or lunar
                    tide, or greater or less than either; while we assume, also, for the
                    co-efficient of the resistance, <hi rend="italic">A,</hi> a great and a smaller
                    value, for instance <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">

                <p>Hence it appears, that the resistance tends greatly to diminish the variation in
                    the magnitude of the tides, dependent on their near approach to the period of
                    spontaneous oscillation, and the more as the resistance is the more
                    considerable; and supposing, with Laplace, that in the port of Brest, or
                    elsewhere, the comparative magnitude of the tides is altered from the proportion
                    of 5 to 2, which is that of the forces, to the proportion of 3 to 1, the
                    multipliers of the solar and lunar tides being to each other as 5 to 6, we have

                    suppose the latter nearer the truth; and the magnitude of the tides will become
                    1∙663 and 1·998. And it appears from the same equations, that, <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> remaining = ∙93442, <hi rend="italic">A</hi> cannot be greater than
                    ******632, and <hi rend="italic">B</hi> would then be *78540; and if <hi

                    or *6QΘ1. It seems probable, however, that the primitive tides must be in a
                    somewhat greater ratio than this of 2 to 1 and 5 to 3, when compared with the
                    oscillations of the spheroid of equilibrium; and if we supposed <hi
                    rend="italic">B</hi> = ∙9 and <hi rend="italic">A</hi> still = -⅛, we should
                    have 7∙07l and 9∙756 for their magnitude. Now if <hi rend="italic">B</hi> =
                    ∙6328, the tangents of the angular measures of the <hi rend="italic">,. , β

                    ~</hi> ∙9, these angles become 45° and 70° 24 ’ respectively; the difference in
                    the former case 2° 50', and in the latter 25° 24', which corresponds to a motion
                    of more than twenty-four hours of the moon in her orbit.</p>
                <p>It appears, then, that, <hi rend="italic">for this simple reason only,</hi> if
                    the supposed data were correct, the highest spring tides ought to be <hi
                    rend="italic">a dag later</hi> than the conjunction and opposition of the
                    luminaries; so that this consideration requires to be combined with that of tire
                    effect of a resistance proportional to the square of the velocity, which has
                    already been shown to afford a more general explanation of the same pheno-menon.
                    There is indeed little doubt, that if we were provided with a sufficiently
                    correct series of minutely accurate observations on the tides, made, not merely
                    with a view to the times of low and high water, but rather to the heights at the
                    intermediate times, we might by degrees, with the assistance of the theory
                    contained in this article, form almost as perfect a set of tables for the
                    motions of the ocean as we have already obtained for those of the celestial
                    bodies, which are the more immediate objects of the attention of the practical
                    astronomer. There is some reason to hope that a system of such observations will
                    speedily be set on foot by a public authority; and it will be necessary, in
                    pursuing the calculation, on the other hand, to extend the formula for the
                    forces to the case of a sea performing its principal oscillation in a direction
                    oblique<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=294"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0294-0274"/> to the meridian, as stated in the beginning of
                    this section.</p>
                <p>For such a sea, the calculations would be somewhat complicated, except in the
                    case of its being situated at or near the equator. We should then obtain, by
                    proper reduction, for the volume of the force, putting D the sine of the
                    duration, or of the angle formed by the length of the canal with the equator,
                    and D' its cosine, the expression D sin. cos. <hi rend="italic">Decl.</hi> cos.
                    <hi rend="italic">Hor.</hi> &lt; + D' cos. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi

                    order of the phenomena would be less affected by the alteration of the situation
                    of the canal than could easily have been supposed, without entering into the
                    computation. This expression, when D = 0, becomes, as it ought to do, identical
                    with the former, making <hi rend="smallcaps">l</hi> = 0. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(l. l.)</hi> the preceding theoretical part of this article is that which the
                    late Dr Thomas Young contributed to the Supplement to the former edition of this
                    work, nearly at the time when the concluding volume of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mécanique Céleste</hi> appeared, treating on the same subject. But we presume
                    that, on a close examination, Dr Young’s mode of investigation will be found to
                    be of a far more elementary and intelligible description than that of Laplace;
                    and not only so, but it accords much more closely with the phenomena, without
                    requiring the aid of certain very questionable assumptions, which are
                    indispensable in the method followed by this illustrious foreigner. Indeed,
                    under so many different aspects had Dr Young at one time or another studied the
                    subject, that even in his earlier writings are to be found some of the
                    speculations on the tides, which have recently been advanced as entirely new.
                    But in his time, as he was well aware, the real facts recorded and published
                    were so scanty, and the rest so uncertain, that he had no proper data on which
                    to speculate with confidence.</p>
                <p>Considering how important it must be for the purposes of navigation and commerce
                    that the tides should be predicted with some degree of certainty, it might have
                    been expected, that when once Newton had furnished a satisfactory mode of
                    explaining in a general way the phenomena of the tides, attention would
                    immediately have been directed, in the maritime parts of all civilized
                    countries, to obtain if possible such an acquaintance with the actual state of
                    the tides as might, with the aid of theory, have served for predicting them, at
                    least approximately. So far, however, were Newton’s speculations from being
                    immediately followed up by extensive and accurate observations in every trading
                    port, that during a whole century which succeeded to his time, the subject had
                    been most unaccountably neglected, observations having been made in but very few
                    places, and those only during portions of that long period; nor had any proper
                    efforts been made to deduce from them so much as the empirical laws of the
                    tides. Thus it was only in 1829 that the very general interest which is now
                    taken in the subject may be said to have commenced, with Mr Lubbock’s
                    examination of the tide observations which are regularly made and recorded at
                    the London docks. The discussion of these he undertook with the view of
                    obtaining correct tables for predicting the time and height of the tides for the
                    British Almanac. When, however, the principal inequality of the tides, the
                    half-monthly or semimenstrual inequality, had been determined with sufficient
                    accuracy for practical purposes, the further researches in this difficult
                    problem could not have been so soon undertaken, but for the interest felt in the
                    subject by some other distinguished men of science, particularly by Mr Whewell,
                    and for the pecuniary assistance afforded by the British Association.</p>
                <p>The publication of the above-mentioned researches of Mr Lubbock in the
                    Philosophical Transactions for 1831, drew the attention of mathematicians as
                    well as of navigators to the subject of the tides; but it was Mr Whewell who
                    aroused more general interest, and, assisted by the Admiralty, engaged the
                    co-operation of observers in various parts of the world. The subject is well
                    deserving the attention and assistance of every enlightened maritime and
                    commercial nation; for, to do it justice, the study of the tides ought to be
                    pursued in the same manner as that of the other provinces of astronomy; that is,
                    constant and careful observations of the phenomena should be made, reduced, and
                    discussed, at the public expense, so as both to test the accuracy of the tables
                    already framed, and to supply the means of rendering them still more accurate.
                    In this manner also any new corrections, and any changes in the elements of the
                    old corrections, would be brought into view as soon as there were evidence of
                    their existence. Till the problem of the tides is thus treated in a manner
                    worthy of its scientific importance, and of the promise which it now holds
                    forth, it must be regarded as a blot in that system of the national cultivation
                    of astronomy, of which our public observatories afford, in other departments of
                    that science, such effective and magnificent examples.</p>
                <p>Mathematicians have not yet succeeded in referring the phenomena of the tides to
                    mechanical principles by rigorous reasoning; and, considering the difficulties
                    of the subject, there is reason to suppose it will be some time before this
                    problem can be fully solved. In the mean while we have an intermediate type of
                    comparison in the equilibrium theory of Daniel Bernoulli, as given in his
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">Du Flux et Reflux de la Mer;</hi> for, by modifying
                    the epochs and other elements which enter into the formulae furnished by that
                    theory, these may be made to represent in an approximate manner the laws of the
                    phenomena.</p>
                <p>The equilibrium theory supposes, that if the earth were a perfect sphere
                    completely covered by water, this fluid would assume the same form at any given
                    instant as it would do if the forces then acting upon each particle were
                    invariable in magnitude and direction. Although our globe, being only partially
                    covered by water, does not admit of this system accurately taking place, the
                    distribution of the land is such as to allow a closer approximation to it in the
                    southern hemisphere than in northern latitudes and on our coasts; so that if we
                    further suppose the tide-wave nearly to follow such a law at the Cape of Good
                    Hope, or in some still more southern region, and that it is thence propagated
                    northward along the Atlantic Ocean, and round our island, preserving all the
                    while a certain proportion of the magnitude and velocity which it had when first
                    formed under the action of the sun and moon; then, upon these suppositions,
                    which are virtually those of Bernoulli, formulae may be framed which will admit
                    of being adjusted by comparison with observation, so as to express the
                    variations in the time and height of high water at any given place, if the time
                    in which the tide-wave is propagated do not vary. But although to a certain
                    extent this equilibrium theory seems thus to suggest and express the laws of the
                    various inequalities of the tides, it must not be rated above its value. It is
                    not the true theory, but a very inaccurate and insufficient substitute for it,
                    which we are compelled to adopt in the present imperfect state of the science of
                    hydrodynamics. The tides are a problem of the motion, not of the equilibrium, of
                    fluids; and we can never fully explain the circumstances of the phenomena till
                    the problem has been solved in its genuine form. Mr Whewell however thinks it is
                    not too much to expect that it may hereafter be rigorously shown from mechanical
                    principles, that the form of an irregular fluid mass constantly dragged along by
                    certain forces, shall at every instant resemble the form of equilibrium which
                    the forces would produce at some anterior epoch, the anterior epoch being
                    somewhat different for the different features of the fluid form. If such a
                    hydrodynamical proposition could be established, almost all the facts hitherto
                    discovered respecting the tides would be fully explained.</p>

                <p>In the able article by Mr Lubbock, we have the first accurate comparison of
                    Bernoulli’s theory of the tides, with the results of observation as deduced from
                    a period of nineteen years in the port of London. The results are important, not
                    merely as furnishing materials and general rules for constructing tide-tables,
                    but also for their general accordance with the theory in question, particularly
                    as regards the semimenstrual inequality. This agreement was the more important,
                    as affording the indication of a sort of physical connection between that theory
                    and observation, and consequently as justifying such a further examination of
                    its consequences as might lead to the discovery or suggestion of such
                    modifications as would conduce to its general accordance with the laws of all
                    the facts observed. In a Subsequent discussion of the tides of Liverpool, in the
                    Phil. Trans. for 1835 and 1836, Mr Lubbock found further evidence in favour of
                    the sort of law to which we have already alluded, and which had indeed been
                    previously suggested by Mr Whewell in his papers on the tides of London and
                    Liverpool; that by referring the tide, not to the lunar transit immediately
                    preceding, but to a transit anterior to the tide by one, two, or more days, the
                    formulae furnished by the equilibrium theory of Bernoulli would be brought into
                    a very near accordance with the observed inequalities in the heights and times
                    of the tides which are due to the changes in the moon’s parallax. This was in
                    some respects an important step, particularly as affording convenient
                    expressions for the corrections, since it has been found to apply to a
                    considerable extent to all the periodical inequalities, and seems to be in
                    conformity with the idea that the tides are primarily generated in the Southern
                    Ocean, and thence reach our coasts in the derivative form only. But in one
                    respect it is not satisfactory; for even at the same place very different
                    anterior epochs are required for the several inequalities. Thus, though each
                    formula furnished by the theory can be separately adjusted by trial to represent
                    generally the results of observation for one particular correction at any
                    assigned station, yet since, in the several expressions, the same symbol
                    requires a different value for almost every different correction, such formulae
                    cannot consistently represent the laws of nature; so that Bernoulli’s theory,
                    even when thus modified, is quite incompetent to assign any physicomathematical
                    reasons for the adjustments in question. The complete solution of the problem
                    would therefore probably require a far more thorough knowledge of the laws of
                    hydrodynamics.</p>
                <p>Mr Whewell’s researches, on which he has now published a dozen papers, have been
                    chiefly directed to the three following points; first, the motion of the
                    tide-wave at different parts of the ocean; secondly, the comparison of the
                    observed laws at certain places with the theory; and, lastly, the laws of the
                    diurnal inequality of the tide, which seem the most intricate of all. His first
                    memoir, entitled an “Essay towards a first Approximation to a Map of Coti-dal
                    Lines,” appeared in the Phil. Trans. for 1833. By a co-tidal line is meant such
                    as may be drawn through all those points of the ocean which have high water
                    simultaneously. The cotidal line for any hour may be considered as representing
                    the summit or ridge of the tide-wave at that time; meaning by the tide-wave,
                    that protuberance of water upon the surface of the ocean which moves along the
                    seas, and by its motion brings high water and low water to any place at the time
                    when the elevated and the depressed parts of the watery surface reach that
                    place. The cotidal lines for successive hours represent the successive positions
                    of the summit of this wave; so that if a spectator were detached from the earth
                    to perceive the summit of the wave, he would see it travelling round the earth
                    in the Southern Ocean once in twenty-four hours, accompanied by another at
                    twelve hours distance from it, and both sending branches into the narrower seas;
                    and the manner and velocity of all these motions will be assigned by means of a
                    map of co-tidal lines. By analysing the movements of the tides according to the
                    most simple considerations of the laws of fluid motion in open seas and in
                    channels, and by explaining the circumstances of their convergence or
                    divergence, their interference with each other, their retardation in shallow
                    water, and their consequent tendency to sweep around the coasts, and to approach
                    them almost perpendicularly; and further, by discussing very carefully all the
                    materials with which nautical surveys and books of navigation could furnish him,
                    Mr Whewell was enabled to construct a map, which not only represented the
                    general circumstances of the tides of the coasts of Britain, but likewise, as he
                    supposed, of the movement of the great tidal wave from the Southern Ocean to the
                    coasts of Europe through the Atlantic; as also its progress in the Indian Seas,
                    and on the coasts of New Zealand.</p>
                <p>In order to correct his first approximation to a map of cotidal lines, the
                    British Association, at the instance of Mr Whewell, procured a very extensive
                    series of observations to be made on the coasts of Britain and Ireland, at 537
                    stations of the coast-guard, in June 1834. These were not only repeated in June
                    1835, but simultaneous observations were also made, at the request of our
                    government, by the other great maritime powers of Europe and North America. The
                    chain of places of observation extended along the coast of North America, from
                    the mouth of the Mississippi, round the keys of Florida, and northward as far as
                    Nova Scotia; and along the shores of Europe, from the Straits of Gibraltar to
                    the North Cape of Norway. The number of stations was, twenty-eight in America,
                    seven in Spain, seven in Portugal, sixteen in France, five in Belgium, eighteen
                    in the Netherlands, twenty-four in Denmark, and twenty-four in Norway; and
                    observations were made by the coast-guard of this country at 318 places in
                    Britain, and at 219 in Ireland. The observers were directed to record the times
                    of high and of low water, and the height of the surface at each of these times,
                    measured from a fixed point. At each place, the differences between the time of
                    high water, and the time of a preceding transit of the moon, which differences
                    Mr Whewell calls the luni-tidal intervals, were taken for the whole series of
                    observations. The immense mass of observations thus furnished was reduced under
                    Mr Whewell’s directions; and some of the results, which are extremely important
                    and interesting, have been published in the Phil. Trans. for 1835 and 1836. The
                    last of these publications is accompanied by a second map of the cotidal lines
                    of the coasts of Europe, and by a chart, which shews, by means of a peculiar
                    notation, the range, in yards, of the spring tides at the different stations of
                    observation.</p>
                <p>Among other remarkable conclusions which have resulted from these observations,
                    may be mentioned the rotatory motion of the tide-wave, which, entering the
                    German Ocean between the Orkneys and Norway, sends a southerly detachment along
                    the coasts of Britain, which is reflected from the projecting coast of Norfolk
                    upon the north coast of Germany, and meets the tide-wave again on the coast of
                    Denmark. Owing to this interference of different tide-waves, the tides are
                    almost entirely obliterated on the coast of Jutland, where their place is
                    supplied by nearly perpetual high water. Indeed this must always be the case
                    wherever one tide-wave continually arrives about six hours later than another,
                    or where more tide-waves successively arrive at still shorter intervals.</p>
                <p>Mr Whewell’s second object was to compare the observed laws of the tides with the
                    theory, or to propose such modifications of the forms of the theory as would
                    reconcile it with observations. In his very ingenious memoir “On the Empirical
                    Laws of the Port of London,” he attempts to deduce from observation, and from
                    very simple considerations, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=296" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0296-0276"/>
                    the character of the formulae for determining the establishment, the
                    semimenstrual inequality, the corrections for lunar and solar parallax and
                    declination, both as affecting the times and the height of high water. His
                    papers on the “Empirical Laws of the Tides of the Port of Liverpool,” and on the
                    “Solar Inequality and Diurnal Inequality” of the tides at the same place, are
                    full of valuable suggestions, which the subsequent investigations of Mr Lubbock
                    have in some cases very remarkably confirmed and extended. Several of the last
                    of Mr Whewell’s papers relate to the constancy of the half-tide level, and the
                    diurnal inequality of the heights and intervals of the times of the tide. The
                    discussion of the Liverpool observations had exhibited this last, though under
                    circumstances much less striking than those which characterize its appearance at
                    other places, as will be noticed more particularly afterwards. His first memoir
                    on this subject relates to the diurnal inequality at Plymouth and Sincapore; at
                    the last of which places its magnitude is very remarkable, making a difference
                    of not less than six feet in the height of the morning and evening tides, and
                    quite sufficient to obliterate, under certain circumstances, one of the
                    semidiurnal tides, and explaining certain peculiarities in the phenomena which
                    have hitherto been considered as cases of interference.</p>
                <p>The researches of Mr Lubbock and Mr Whewell on the tides, and their discussions
                    of the observations made at various ports, have now reached such an extent as to
                    be distributed through ten successive volumes of the Phil. Trans. (1831-1840).
                    Some shorter articles have been also published in the Reports of the British
                    Association, and abstracts in the Philosophical Magazine and other journals. Mr
                    Lubbock has besides published a small Elementary Treatise on the Tides. Before
                    these gentlemen took up the subject, which they have done with great credit to
                    themselves and advantage to the public, the theory of the tides, though little
                    cultivated and little known, was in advance of observation. Tide-tables were
                    constructed by unpublished rules, which, though generally very imperfect, formed
                    a profitable possession to those to whom they were known; and the distinctive
                    characters of the tides in the different ports of this kingdom, that of
                    Liverpool perhaps excepted, were confined to the experience and tact of those
                    who were accustomed to use them; but how different is the case at present. The
                    rules for the construction of tide-tables are not only public property, but are
                    based upon the most extensive observations; laws whose existence was hardly
                    suspected, are now distinctly laid down; the progress of the waves in the most
                    frequented parts of the ocean is beginning to be accurately developed; theory,
                    which formerly was in advance of observation, though greatly improved in those
                    parts of it which do not involve the hydrodynamical laws of the ocean, is now
                    greatly behind it; and such a basis of facts has been laid down as may enable
                    the mathematician to commence such a series of investigations as may terminate
                    in enabling some one to give to the theory of the tides a form more closely
                    resembling, in the certainty of its predictions, the almost perfect theory of
                    physical astronomy.</p>
                <p>Mr Lubbock and Mr WheweD have, among other subjects, treated at considerable
                    length on the causes of inaccuracy in tide records and observations. We shall
                    here endeavour to notice the chief of these; and it will serve two purposes if
                    we give a popular account of them, in connection with the principal empirical
                    corrections which these gentlemen have found requisite to compensate for the
                    various inequalities of tidal phenomena. On comparing the times of the tide at
                    different places, as hitherto stated by the best authorities, we find very many
                    cases which seem quite incompatible with any notion of obvious continuity and
                    simple laws prevailing in this class of facts. For instance, if the time of high
                    water at Plymouth were five o’clock, and at Eddystone eight, as usually stated,
                    the water must be falling for three hours on the shore, while it is rising at
                    ten or twelve miles distance, and this through a height of several feet. It is
                    difficult to conceive how any elevation at the one place should not be
                    transferred to the other in a much shorter time. In fact, eight o’clock, instead
                    of being the time of high water at Eddystone, is the time of slack water, or
                    when the current changes. Thus there is reason to think tl&gt;at very many, if
                    not the whole, of such inconsistencies have originated in confounding two
                    different phenomena, namely, the time of high water, and the time of the change
                    from the flow to the ebb current. In some cases the one, and in some cases the
                    other, of these times has been recorded as the hour of the tide. The time of
                    slack water, or of the change of current, only coincides with the time of high
                    water very near the shore, and within its influence, and especially in harbours
                    which have only one opening. The difference between these times is generally
                    considerable, and great confusion has arisen from not properly distinguishing
                    between them. The persuasion, that in waters affected by tides, the water always
                    rises while it runs one way, and falls while it returns in the opposite
                    direction, though very erroneous, has long been quite general. For example, it
                    has been usual to state that the time of tide in the British Channel must be
                    three hours later in the mid sea than near the shore, because the current
                    continues running eastward three hours after the time of high water on the
                    coast. Many instances could be given of the perplexities which have arisen from
                    this assumption.</p>
                <p>The times most usually recorded as the tide-hours for different places, are those
                    of the tides on the days of new and full moon; which times are often called the
                    establishments of the places to which they belong, and are supposed to regulate
                    the times of the tide on all other days of the lunation, because the tide is
                    primarily governed by the moon. This, however true as a first approximation,
                    assumes that the tide always occurs at the same hour-angle from the moon. But
                    the hour of the tide on any day expresses its hour-angle from the sun; and as
                    the moon changes her right ascension by about forty-eight minutes every day, the
                    observed hour of the tide being given on the day of full and new moon, the
                    hour-angle from the moon may be different according to the time of the day when
                    the conjunction takes place, compared with the time of the observed tide. Thus,
                    if the conjunction take place at one o’clock in the morning, and the observed
                    tide at eleven at night, the distance of the tide from the sun is eleven hours;
                    but at eleven at night the moon is to the east of the sun by her motion in
                    twenty-two hours, which is forty-four minutes of hour-angle, and therefore the
                    tide is only ten hours sixteen minutes behind the moon. But if the observed tide
                    occur at one in the morning, and the conjunction at eleven at night, the moon,
                    at the time of the tide, is forty-four minutes to the west of the sun, and the
                    tide occurs at one hour forty-four minutes. In the former case the establishment
                    is forty-four minutes less, in the latter forty-four minutes more, than the
                    observation of the hour of the tide gives it. If the observed hour of tide were
                    six in the evening, and the conjunction occurred at one in the morning, the true
                    establishment would be 5 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi>. 26 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> m</hi>; but if the tide be at six in the morning, and the
                    conjunction at eleven at night, the true establishment will be 6 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h.</hi> 34 <hi rend="superscript"> m.</hi> Thus, an
                    observation of the hour of the tide on the day of new or full moon leaves an
                    uncertainty of at least 1 <hi rend="superscript"> h.</hi> 8 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> m.</hi> as to the establishment, if we do not take into
                    account whether the morning or afternoon tide was observed, and at what hour the
                    conjunction or opposition of the moon took place. Besides, the time of high
                    water may often be doubtful to the extent of ten or fifteen minutes, from
                    inaccuracy in the observation; and as this error may occur in opposite
                    directions at two different observations, and may be combined with that of the
                    observation just mentioned, we may thus have two establishments, differing above

                    observations at the same place.</p>
                <p>In the determination of the establishment little accuracy is to be expected,
                    unless numerous observations be used; and in this case, the mean of the morning
                    and evening tide-hours may be taken, the effect of the intervals by which the
                    conjunctions and oppositions of the moon precede and succeed noon being supposed
                    to compensate each other. But when the establishment is to be collected from
                    only a few observations, it will be proper to calculate in each case the
                    lunitidal interval or hour-angle by which the tide is distant from the moon.</p>
                <p>The time of high water does not follow the moon’s transit by the same interval at
                    every period of the lunation; on the contrary, this lunitidal interval is
                    sometimes greater and sometimes less than that corresponding to the new and full
                    moon, and is regulated by the distance of the moon from the sun. The difference
                    between this and the mean interval is called the half-monthly or semimenstrual
                    inequality. When the moon and sun are in conjunction, the corresponding tide
                    follows the moon by its mean interval. When the moon is at various hour-angles
                    after the sun, the following are the mean corrections of the mean interval,
                    negative and positive. But the law and magnitude of such numbers depend on the
                    relative effect of the sun and moon upon the tides: the amount is different at
                    different places, and varies with the declinations and parallaxes of the
                    luminaries.</p>
                <p>Hour-angle of the moon. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 hours.</p>
                <p>Correction of establishment...0, —16, —31, —41, —44, —31, 0, +31, +44, +41, +31,
                    +16, 0 minutes.</p>
                <p>Thus, if the establishment corresponding to the new and full moon be six hours,
                    the time of the high water, when the moon is one hour from the sun, will be 5
                    <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ 44 <hi rend="superscript"> m.</hi> after the
                    moon’s transit; when the moon is two hours from the sun, the time of tide will
                    be 5 <hi rend="superscript"> h.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">29</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> m.</hi> after the transit; and so on. When the moon is six
                    hours from the sun, the corresponding time of high water will again coincide
                    with the mean, after which the lunitidal interval will exceed the mean, till the
                    next conjunction or opposition, and then the same cycle recurs. Hence if the
                    establishment were collected from any observation of the tide not corresponding
                    to the day of new or full moon, it would be liable to an error. If the
                    establishment were six hours by an observation made when the moon’s hour-angle
                    was four hours, and compared with the time of the moon’s transit, it would
                    appear to be 5 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ 16 <hi rend="superscript">
                    m.</hi>; but by an observation made when the moon’s hour-angle was eight hours,
                    it would appear to be 6 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ 44 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> m</hi> ∙ This difference in the results would be avoided by
                    taking the tide which corresponds to new or full moon, or by applying the proper
                    correction according to the preceding table when any other tide was observed.
                    Some authors make this correction depend on the day of the moon’s age; but as
                    this is a very inaccurate mode of determining the angular distance of the sun
                    and moon, the proper way is to make the correction depend on the difference of
                    right ascensions of the Sun and moon, that is, on the time of the moon’s transit
                    expressed in apparent time as above. The chance of error would be removed more
                    effectually by taking the mean of all the intervals between tide and transit,
                    during a half lunation, or any whole number of half lunations.</p>
                <p>Although, according to theory, the semimenstrual inequality of the time depends
                    on the ratio of the force of the moon to that of the sun, yet the observations
                    shew it to be different at different places. The total amount of this
                    inequality, that is, the difference between the greatest and least lunitidal
                    intervals, is 95 minutes at Plymouth and 93 at Bristol, which exceed its values
                    at many other places. It is 90 minutes at London and Sheerness, 86 at Liverpool
                    and Howth, 84 at Leith, 83 at Portsmouth and Pembroke, 82 at Ramsgate, and only
                    80 at Brest. Each of these is determined from observations so numerous as to be
                    certain within a minute or two. We see, therefore, how different the mass of the
                    moon would be found to be when deduced from the observations of different
                    places; so that the near agreement of the mass deduced by Laplace from the tides
                    of Brest, with the mass obtained from other phenomena, must have been merely
                    accidental; and this also puts an end to all attempts to correct the tables of
                    the tides by means of the mass of the moon.</p>
                <p>The semimenstrual inequality of the height of the tides, when compared at
                    different places, gives a similar result. It is not, however, the actual amount
                    of this inequality, but its proportion to the mean tide, that is to be taken. At
                    Portsmouth, the mean range of the tide is 12∙5 feet; the total semimenstrual
                    inequality, or difference between the high waters at neap and spring tides, is
                    2∙5 feet; that is, only ]∙th of the mean tide. But at Plymouth, where the mean
                    tide is also 12∙5 feet, the total semimenstrual inequality is 3∙4 feet, and thus
                    the fraction is <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3·4</hi>
                    At Bristol, again, where the mean range of the tide is 33 feet, the
                    semi-menstrual inequality is 10 feet, or of the mean tide. In tide records, as
                    formerly kept, it is often uncertain whether the height marked, mean that of the
                    stream tide, or only the high water on the days of new or full moon.</p>
                <p>From the general observations made simultaneously in Europe and America in June
                    1835, it appears that the amount of the semimenstrual inequality of the time is
                    very different at different parts of the world; and though these observations
                    were of too rude a kind to give the amount of the difference, they are
                    sufficient to prove its existence; especially when coupled with a reason for the
                    difference, namely, that the spring tides being higher than the neaps, the tides
                    of the two kinds may travel with velocities which at different places have
                    different relations. Mr Whewell conceives that the observations afford evidence
                    of a local as well as a general semimenstrual inequality. The changes of this
                    inequality are not obviously explicable. On the coast of North America, the
                    amount of the difference of the greatest and least lunitidal intervals is small,
                    being generally less than 80 minutes, and at Newport as low as 56. On the coast
                    of Portugal, at several places, this difference is so small as almost to throw
                    doubt on the accuracy of the observations. At Pera in Algarve it is only 42, at
                    Lagos Bay 24, while at Peniche it is 130. On the greater part of the French
                    coast it ranges with great steadiness from 80 to 100, except at the little
                    harbour of Abrevrak, where it is 125 minutes. At Torr Head, on the north coast
                    or Ireland, it is 146, and at Rachlin Island 240; but these are cases of extreme
                    irregularity. On many parts of the south coast of England it is small, being
                    from 70 to 74, as at Exmonth, Weymouth, St Alban’s Head, St Lawrence, Swanage
                    Bay, Brighton, and Hastings.</p>
                <p>From the same observations, it appears that the amount of the semimenstrual
                    inequality of the height also varies. In general, the greatest range is twice or
                    twice and a half the smallest; but this is so far from being a universal rule,
                    that many of the cases which at first seem to agree with it, really differ
                    widely when allowance is made for the diurnal inequality. Thus, at Mount Desert
                    Island, near the coast of America, the whole amount of the semimenstrual
                    inequality of high water is about three feet in a tide of thirteen feet, thus
                    reducing the smallest range to eleven; but the diurnal inequality reduces it
                    further to eight feet.</p>
                <p>If, as is generally believed, the most of the tides be generated<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=298" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0298-0278"/>
                    in the Southern Ocean, the tide which is produced under the more immediate
                    influence of the new or full moon cannot, at most places, be that which takes
                    place on the day of new or full moon; and in reading the preceding sketch of the
                    phenomena, these must not be confounded. The latter, however, is that which has
                    commonly been observed for the purpose of determining the establishment; but it
                    often differs materially from the former, and in the tide-records anomalies
                    frequently occur which seem referable to this difference. It has already been
                    mentioned, that the agreement between the empirical laws of the tides and the
                    equilibrium theory is much improved, by referring the tides to a transit
                    anterior to their occurrence by two or three days. To illustrate this, Mr
                    Lubbock denotes the successive transits of the moon at intervals of about twelve
                    hours) by the letters A, B, C, D, E, F; F being the transit which immediately
                    precedes, by about two hours, the high water at London: and he finds that the
                    laws of the tides at London and Liverpool agree best with theory when they are
                    referred to the transit B. The tide which reaches London at two hours after the
                    transit F, was at Plymouth about six hours after the transit E; and as from
                    transit B to transit E is about thirty-eight hours, if we refer the Plymouth
                    tides to B, we take a transit about forty-four hours before the tide. Transits A
                    and C are about fifty-six and thirty-two hours anterior to the tide. Nearly the
                    same may be said of Bristol. The general result is, that the transit B gives the
                    best tables.</p>
                <p>We cannot, however, in this way completely reconcile observation and theory, even
                    as regards the semimenstrual inequality. From Mr Lubbock’s researches on the
                    Liverpool tides (Phil. Trans. 1836, p. 57), it appears, that while the transit A
                    very nearly reconciles the theoretical and observed times, we must take a still
                    earlier transit if we would obtain the like agreement in the heights. Nor does
                    that selection of a transit which best represents the semi-menstrual inequality
                    bring about an agreement with theory in the parallax and declination
                    corrections. Hence, although there appear to be in the actual laws of the tides
                    inequalities <hi rend="italic">corresponding</hi> to all those which arise from
                    the supposition of the equilibrium tide of an anterior epoch transmitted along
                    the ocean to our shores, we cannot so assume the epochs to produce all the
                    inequalities at once even for the same place. The epoch is of one value for the
                    times, of another for the heights; different for the parallax correction, and
                    again for the effect of declination.</p>
                <p>The relation between a change in the epoch and the semimenstrual inequalities may
                    be examined as follows. The successive lunar transits occur at intervals of
                    about twelve hours twenty-four minutes of solar time. The semimenstrual
                    inequality, both of interval and of height, is referred to the solar time of the
                    moon’s transit. The height is the same whether it be referred to the transit E
                    immediately preceding, or to the transit B a day and a half sooner. If the moon
                    moved uniformly in her orbit, the inequality of the interval between the tide
                    and transit would be the same, whether the tide were referred to the transit E,
                    or any anterior one, as B; for the interval is increased by the constant
                    quantity twelve hours twenty-four minutes nearly for every transit that we go
                    back. But though the inequality of the interval for any given tide would be the
                    same, it would not occupy the same place in the table or curve, since it would
                    be referred to a different hour of the transit. For example, if the mean
                    interval of transit and tide at Bristol referred to E be 7 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙, and if, when the moon’s transit is 2 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙, the tide be at 8 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙,
                    the interval is 6 <hi rend="superscript"> h.</hi>, and therefore in this case
                    the inequality is minus one hour. If now we refer this tide to the transit B a
                    day and a half sooner, the interval of the transit and tide will be 6 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h.</hi> + 36 <hi rend="superscript"> h.</hi> + 72 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> m.</hi>, and the mean interval will be 7 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ + 36 <hi rend="superscript"> h.</hi> + 72 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> m.</hi>; and therefore, as before, the inequality is minus
                    one hour. But the moon’s transit E taking place at 2 <hi rend="superscript">
                    h</hi> ∙ solar time, the transits D, C, B will take place at 1 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h.</hi> 36 <hi rend="superscript"> m.</hi>, 1 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ 12 <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi> ∙, 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ 48 <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi> ∙ respectively;
                    and therefore the inequality of minus one hour, which was referred to the
                    transit happening at 2 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ when transit E was used,
                    is referred to the transit at 0 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ 48 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> m</hi> ∙ when we employ the anterior epoch B. Thus, by
                    referring to an anterior epoch, the whole semimenstrual inequality is shifted
                    backward through twenty-four minutes of lunar transit, for every step of one
                    transit backwards. This is the mean result, supposing the moon’s motion uniform,
                    and neglecting all other inequalities; on which suppositions nothing would be
                    gained or lost in accuracy by the change of the epoch. But in the actual case,
                    this mean result is modified by the influence of the other inequalities, which
                    make one transit a better epoch than another.</p>
                <p>The tide which comes to the shores of narrow and long seas is not immediately
                    produced by the luminaries, but is derived from the tide in the main ocean. Its
                    circumstances are governed by those of the primary tide from which it is
                    derived; and whatever interval may elapse during its transfer, it is regulated
                    by the position which the sun and moon had at the time when they determined the
                    primary tide. Now this time may have been one, two, or more days before the tide
                    reaches the place where it is observed. Thus the tide on the shores of North
                    America and Spain, conformably with its being supposed to be generated in the
                    Southern Ocean, and sent up the Atlantic, seems to correspond to the
                    configuration of the sun and moon at a day and a half previous. The tide in the
                    port of London appears to be two days and a half old when it arrives. The time
                    spent in the transfer of the tide is very different in different parts of the
                    world, and has not yet been ascertained for many places. But it affects the
                    determination of the establishment from observations, in a manner which may be
                    thus explained. If the tide at London be determined by the position of the sun
                    and moon two and a half days before it occurs, the moon must then have been more
                    to the west of the sun by an angle of two hours (her motion in <hi rend="italic"
                    >A</hi> R in two and a half days) than she is when the tide arrives. Hence the
                    tide which happens on the day of full moon, corresponds to the period when the
                    moon was in <hi rend="italic">A</hi> R, two hours west of the point opposite to
                    the sun, or ten hours east of the sun. Therefore, by the preceding small table,
                    the tide is thirty-one minutes later than the mean interval between the tide and
                    moon’s transit. The tide at London takes place nearly at two o’clock on the days
                    of new and full moon; and therefore 1 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ 29 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> m</hi> ∙ is the corrected establishment for London.</p>
                <p>The establishment is usually defined to mean the hour of high water at new and
                    full moon. Mr Whewell calls this the vulgar establishment. Observations of tides
                    have most commonly been made with the view of determining this vulgar
                    establishment, which it now appears is not a corresponding quantity at different
                    places. The mean of all the lunitidal intervals for a half lunation, he calls
                    the corrected establishment. Hence the vulgar establishment seems to be greater
                    than the other by a quantity depending on what Mr Whewell calls the age of the
                    tide; namely, the length of time which has elapsed since its real or theoretical
                    origin. This is also what Mr Lubbock, following Bernoulli, calls the <hi
                    rend="italic">retard.</hi> It is considered as the principal reason why the
                    greatest tides do not occur on the days of new and full moon, nor the least at
                    the quadratures, but one, two, or more days after. Both Mr Lubbock and Mr
                    Whewell frequently use the term epoch in the same sense as the age of the tide,
                    or at least as the time during which any particular inequality has been
                    transferred from the Southern Ocean to the place of observation.</p>
                <p>The doctrine of the age of the tide, as thus laid down, not unfrequently leads to
                    inconsistencies, some of which are only apparent, being referable to the mixture
                    and interference<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=299"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0299-0279"/> of different tides; but another reason for some
                    of them, we presume, is, that the luminaries, after generating the primary
                    tides, are not, as they are usually assumed to be, mere idle spectators of the
                    derivative tides, but often continue to act upon them in various ways,
                    accelerating some and retarding others.</p>
                <p>Although the observations make the parallax corrections both of height and time
                    vary as the parallax, yet some of the observations do not make the height of the
                    tide itself proportional to the cube of the parallax, as theory requires, but
                    make it more nearly proportional to the square of the parallax, being as the 2-2
                    power. The declination corrections both of height and time are found by
                    observation to vary as the square of the sine of the declination, which,
                    according to theory, they should do.</p>
                <p>But the difference between the tidal phenomena of the morning and evening of the
                    same day, called the diurnal inequality, is often so considerable, and at some
                    places so remarkable, that it is far less perfectly understood than any of the
                    other inequalities, and furnishes, as we shall afterwards see, a source of far
                    greater uncertainty in the determination of the establishment than any yet
                    mentioned. It had not till of late been introduced, and still very sparingly,
                    into tide-tables. To it, or rather to a want of the knowledge of it, are no
                    doubt owing many of the uncertainties or ambiguities and errors which occur in
                    recorded tide observations. It is of great importance both to the theory of the
                    tides and to the purposes of navigation, that this diurnal inequality should be
                    fully analysed. Mr Whewell’s researches have opened a wide field, but here we
                    can only notice them in a very general manner.</p>
                <p>Were the earth wholly covered by water, the diurnal inequality of the heights of
                    high and low waiter would depend on the semidiurnal transits of the poles of the
                    equilibrium spheroid being alternately north and south of the equator. For
                    example, if the moon had 20° north declination, the tide spheroid would have one
                    pole in lat. 20° north, and the other in 20° south: and while the earth
                    revolved, a place in lat. 50° north would have the tide which belongs to these
                    two poles alternately; and being 30° from the one pole and 70° from the other,
                    the two tides would be very unequal. On the same principles, in northern
                    latitudes the tide which belongs to an upper transit of the moon should be the
                    greater (of the two on the same day) when the moon’s declination is north: when
                    the moon crosses the equator, the difference of the two tides should vanish;
                    when she has south declination, the tide which belongs to her upper transit
                    should be the smaller. The contrary (as to greater and smaller) should be true
                    of the tide which belongs to the inferior transit. The diurnal inequality may
                    therefore be conceived to arise from a wave oscillating in the direction of the
                    meridian, and of which the maximum height comes to each place once in
                    twenty-four lunar hours; the minimum height arriving, of course, at the
                    intermediate twelve hours. For such oscillations the Atlantic and Pacific both
                    afford the most ample scope. If the time of the maximum height of this wave
                    arriving at any port coincide every day with the time of high water, the
                    alternate high water being at twelve hours interval, will be affected
                    alternately with the greatest and least heights of the diurnal wave; and the
                    intermediate low waters will coincide with the mean height of this wave, and
                    will not be at all affected. In this case there will be a decided diurnal
                    inequality in the height of the high water, but none in that of the low water.
                    In like manner, if the time of the maximum height of the diurnal wave coincide
                    with the time of low water, the height of low water will be marked with a
                    diurnal inequality, while the height of high water will exhibit no such feature.
                    But if the diurnal wave arrive every day at a time intermediate between high and
                    low water, it will raise both the high and the low water which are nearest it,
                    and will depress both the high and the low water which happen in the other half
                    of the day. Hence both the high waters taken separately, and the low waters
                    taken separately, will be marked by a diurnal inequality; and this inequality
                    will be greater for high water or for low water, according as the time of the
                    maximum of the diurnal wave is nearer to the time of high or low water.</p>
                <p>There are various places at which it has long been known that there is commonly a
                    difference in the morning and evening tide of the same day. It is stated by
                    Colepress in 1668 (Phil. Trans. vol. iii. p. 633), that at Plymouth the tides,
                    from about the end of March till the end of September, are about a foot higher
                    in the afternoon than in the forenoon, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi> the
                    rest of the year. But we shall soon see that this way of expressing the fact, by
                    speaking of evening and morning tides, is quite inaccurate. The other
                    inequalities of the tides having been found to follow the laws of the
                    equilibrium theory (although the constant elements, the magnitudes and epochs,
                    can be determined only by observation), and Mr Whewell having found the diurnal
                    inequality very clearly marked in the Plymouth observations, he attempted to
                    trace its laws by assuming a similar correspondence with the equilibrium theory.
                    the result confirmed the assumption in a striking manner, the age or epoch of
                    this inequality for Plymouth being about four days.</p>
                <p>At Sincapore the diurnal inequality of low water is of a magnitude which could
                    not have been anticipated, the height of the evening and morning tide often
                    differing six feet; although the whole rise of the mean tide is only seven feet
                    at spring tides, and the difference of mean spring and neap tides not more than
                    two feet. The epoch at that place is about a day and a half. It is a curious
                    circumstance, that the sun affects the low water at Plymouth more than the high
                    water; and that the moon’s declination at Sincapore affects the low water four
                    times as much as the high water, while at Plymouth it affects it less.</p>
                <p>It is easy to conceive the diurnal inequality carried a little farther than it is
                    at Sincapore, so that at a certain stage of it the alternate tides would
                    entirely vanish. This is equivalent to supposing the highest low water and the
                    lowest high water to have the same height, of which examples will afterwards be
                    given.</p>
                <p>Captain Fitzroy having caused observations be made at King George’s Sound, on the
                    south coast of New Holland, every half hour for some days, and for a portion of
                    the time every quarter of an hour, found that on March 7th and 8th 1836 there
                    were two very unequal tides, and that on the 9th and 10th there was only one
                    tide; but a recession and return in the high water, which had been barely
                    perceptible on the 11th, became more and more marked on the 12th, 13th, and
                    14th, so as again to give two tides each day. Thus at this place it appears to
                    be only at one particular period of the semilunation that we have a single-day
                    tide. That of Tonquin was referred by Newton to the interference of two tides
                    which arrive by different channels. The great diurnal inequality of Sincapore,
                    which is in the same seas, appears to be clearly due to the effect of the moon’s
                    declination; and the determination of this point, and the circumstances
                    ascertained to occur in the reputed single-day tide of King George’s Sound,
                    throw some doubt on the explanation just referred to; nor can this doubt be
                    removed till the tides of those seas have been more fully observed.</p>
                <p>That this inequality cannot properly be called an excess of the evening tide at
                    one season of the year, and of the morning tide at another, must now be evident
                    from the circumstance that the high water at Plymouth is on the average five
                    hours after the moon’s transit. Suppose the moon to move in the ecliptic, which
                    is her average path when the sun’s right ascension is five hours (that is, about
                    <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=300"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0300-0280"/>June 7), the tide which follows the moon’s transit
                    will follow the sun’s transit also as soon as the moon is north of the equator;
                    that is, if the diurnal inequality were rcgu-lated by the moon’s place on the
                    same day, the afternoon tide would be greatest, and so it would continue till
                    the moon was seven hours after the sun, and the tide following the moon would
                    become the morning tide: but at the same time the moon would pass to the south
                    of the equator, and so the tide following the moon would be the smaller. In this
                    situation, therefore, the evening tide would be the greater during the whole
                    lunation.</p>
                <p>It was only of late that the diurnal inequality of the tides began to be attended
                    to as it deserves; for however imperfectly understood, it is no doubt a regular
                    change, considerable in its amount, and almost universal in its prevalence. It
                    would be easy to adduce many cases in which the safety or loss of a ship has
                    been determined by it. Though the existence of such an inequality in particular
                    places has long been known, its laws have been sadly misunderstood. For example,
                    it has been supposed always to affect the morning and evening tides in opposite
                    ways, which is only an accidental and local expression of its rule. In the Phil.
                    Trans, for 1836, p. 57, Mr Lubbock has described how he obtained it for
                    Liverpool; while Mr Bywater, who has introduced it into his tide-tables for that
                    port, and Mr Bunt into those for Bristol, have also collected it from
                    observations. But the connection of this inequality, as it exists in different
                    parts of the world, was never brought into view till Mr Whewell discussed
                    together the European and American observations of June J835. The laws which the
                    inequality follows, when thus considered on an extensive scale, appear to be
                    very curious, though they are still but very imperfectly known.</p>
                <p>In some cases this inequality is most clearly seen in the heights of high water,
                    in others in the low water, and in some cases it greatly affects the times of
                    both. Mr Whewell exhibited the results of June 1835 in curves, by erecting a
                    series of equidistant ordinates to represent the heights of the successive tides
                    above a fixed point at each place; and these curves generally showed a series of
                    parallel zigzags (the tides being alternately higher and lower); and they were
                    so regular and similar as to prove both the goodness of the observations and the
                    existence of the diurnal inequality. This was so remarkable on the coast of
                    America, that scarcely any exception occurred. Next to this, it was conspicuous,
                    especially during a portion of the observations, in Spain and Portugal; then on
                    the west of France, the coast of Cornwall, and parts of the west of Ireland. In
                    the German Ocean this inequality was obvious, but, owing to the mixture of
                    different tides, it was less steady and regular.</p>
                <p>Although the diurnal inequality is generally believed to depend upon the sun or
                    moon’s being north or south of the equator, yet, as we shall afterwards see,
                    there are cases which it seems very difficult to explain on this principle. Nor
                    does the sign of this inequality, as was long supposed, depend on the place
                    being north or south of the equator. Its maximum corresponds to, but is not
                    necessarily simultaneous with, the moon’s greatest declination; nor does the
                    period of its vanishing everywhere coincide with the time of the moon’s passing
                    the equator, but more generally is somewhat later. Between periods
                    corres∣ponding to, or rather at equal intervals after, two such passages, the
                    inequality increases from 0 to a maximum, and decreases to 0 again, alternately.
                    The curves which represent the heights really exhibit such alternate increase
                    and diminution; and the inquiry naturally occurs, after how long a time does the
                    moon’s position show its effect in the diurnal inequality? ln the case of
                    Liverpool, Mr Whewell has endeavoured to show that this inequality expresses the
                    effect of the forces upon the equilibrium spheroid, as they existed six days
                    previously. But this interval is very different at other places, and its range
                    is curious.</p>
                <p>From the general tide observations made in Europe and America in June 1835, the
                    results of which have been given by Mr Whewell (Phil. Trans. for 1836, p. 302),
                    it appeared that the diurnal inequality on the east coast of Scotland was,
                    during that semilunation, irregular, passing over a tide in the middle of the
                    series. This and others of its anomalies on the coasts of the German Ocean,
                    appear to show that the waters in that region are affected by the mixture of
                    different tides. On the east coast of America, the changes of this inequality
                    seem contemporaneous with those of the moon’s declination; so that the epoch
                    there is zero. On the coasts of Spain, Portugal, and France, it is successively
                    two and three days, which is quite consistent with this epoch, being four days
                    on the coast of Cornwall and Devonshire.</p>
                <p>A circumstance not less remarkable in the progress of the diurnal inequality is,
                    that it is seen much more distinctly and steadily at some places, than at others
                    which are near them; nor does it seem easy to assign any rule which it follows
                    in this respect. It is very marked, and almost universal, on the coast of the
                    United States, and was conspicuous in the observations of June 1835 in Spain and
                    Portugal, the west of France, and part of the west of Ireland; yet at
                    intermediate places it could not be detected. It is large on the east coast of
                    New Holland, as we know from Cook’s getting his ship off a reef by means of it;
                    and the north and south coasts of Australia appear to exhibit the extreme case
                    of it. We might suppose it to affect the whole of the Indian Ocean; yet at
                    Keeling Island, in the middle of that ocean, it did not decidedly show itself in
                    Captain Fitzroy’s observations from the 2d to the 8th April 1836.</p>
                <p>The epoch of the diurnal inequality being different in different parts of the
                    world, is a very curious fact, and not easily reconcileable with the notion of a
                    tide-wave travelling to all shores in succession. In accordance with this view,
                    the tide on the shores of America had been considered as identical with the
                    almost contemporaneous tide on the coasts of Spain and Portugal; nor does it
                    seem easy to imagine the form of the tide-waves, so that this shall not be the
                    case. Yet we find that the tides on these two sides of the Atlantic cannot be
                    identical in all respects; for on the 9th, 10th, and 11th of June 1835, when the
                    diurnal inequality was great in America, it was nothing in the west of Europe;
                    and on the 18th and 19th, when this inequality had vanished in America, it was
                    great in Europe. It would seem as if the tidal phenomena on this side the
                    Atlantic corresponded to an epoch of the equilibrium theory, two or three days
                    later than the same phenomena in America; and different kinds of phenomena do
                    not seem to travel at the same rate. Thus the equilibrium theory, though it may
                    explain the general form of the inequalities, cannot give their epochs and
                    amounts by any possible adjustment of constants. The notion of the progress of
                    the tide-wave from south to north in the Atlantic is still further involved in
                    difficulties by its appearing, from the observations of Sir John Herschel, that
                    at the Cape of Good Hope the diurnal inequality showed itself most clearly on
                    the 17th, 18th, and 19th of June, that is, as late as in Spain and Portugal. The
                    diurnal inequality appears also, but not so generally, in the curves which
                    represent the times; nor is this difference always in the same direction. Thus
                    on the coast of America, at some places, the afternoon tides were later than the
                    mean, and those of the forenoon earlier than the mean, for a great part of June
                    1835, while at other places the reverse was the case.</p>
                <p>From certain title observations made in the Indian Seas, and examined by Mr
                    Whewell, we select the following as striking features in those of Surat Roads in
                    the Gulf of Cambay, Gogah on the opposite side of the same gulf, and Bassadore
                    in the Island of Kismis at the entrance of the Persian Gulf. In the first two
                    places there is an enormous diurnal inequality of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=301" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0301-0281"
                    />the heights, amounting sometimes to seven or eight feet. It appears that this
                    inequality vanishes and changes its sign about two days after the moon’s
                    declination does so. At Bassadore there is a very large diurnal inequality of
                    the times, sometimes exceeding two hours, and sufficient to displace the tides.
                    For instance, about the 23d November 1834, the tide-hour of the forenoon was
                    greater by almost two hours than that of the afternoon, the former being at 5

                    this anomaly still more remarkable is, that at this place there is little or no
                    diurnal inequality of the heights, which is a most curious tidal feature, in
                    addition to those already remarked in the Indian Seas.</p>
                <p>From observations made at Petropaulofsk, in the Bay of Avatcha, latitude 53° 1'
                    N., long. 158° 44' E. in 1827 and 1828, by the Russian Admiral Lütke, and
                    transmitted to Mr Whewell, it appears that the high water there is affected in
                    its time by a very large diurnal inequality, while the height is only slightly
                    affected by an inequality of that kind. The height of the surface was carefully
                    observed every ten minutes, day and night; and when near its maximum, every two
                    minutes. This great care and labour, which would have been superfluous at most
                    places, was quite necessary in this instance; for if the observations had not
                    been thus continued, they would not have enabled Mr Whewell to detect the very
                    curious laws of the phenomena about to be described. This diurnal inequality of
                    the time reaches the enormous amount of above four hours. Thus the intervals
                    between moon’s transit and high water, on October 11 and 12,1827,were as
                    follows: 5 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙38 <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi> ∙,

                    rend="superscript"> m</hi> ·; showing an alternate increase and diminution to
                    the extent above mentioned. The greatest alternate inequalities of the heights
                    of high water during these series of observations, were something more than a
                    foot. But the observations of low water are marked by additional features still
                    more curious. For though in these the diurnal inequality of the times really
                    appears, it is neither so large nor so regular as that of high water; it seldom
                    exceeds an hour. The diurnal inequality of the height of low water, on the other
                    hand, is much larger than that for high water, amounting to three or even four
                    feet; and this in a tide of which the whole range rarely exceeds five feet. The
                    diurnal inequality is supposed to depend principally upon the moon’s
                    declination; and its maximum and its disappearance have been found, at most
                    places hitherto examined, to follow at a short interval (one or two days) the
                    maximum and the vanishing of the moon’s declination. On examining the
                    Petropaulofsk observations with regard to this point, we find that the greatest
                    and most regular of the diurnal inequalities above noticed (the inequality of
                    the time of high water and of the height of low water) correspond with the
                    moon’s declination; so that the epoch or age is zero. On the contrary, not only
                    is the epoch of the other two inequalities, that of the heights at high water
                    and of the times of low water, different from that of the preceding, but they
                    alternate with them, vanishing when the others reach their maxima, and showing
                    their maxima when the others vanish. This is a very perplexing circumstance; for
                    if the diurnal inequality depend upon the moon’s declination, it is difficult to
                    conceive how its effect upon the height of high water and the time of low water
                    should be greatest just when the moon is in the equator, and that the reverse
                    should hold in respect to the other two inequalities.</p>
                <p>The tides of Petropaulofsk show more clearly than any yet examined, how the
                    diurnal inequality may be so large as to lead to the appearance of only one tide
                    in the twenty-four lunar hours. The heights of the high waters are alternately
                    greater and less; as are also, in a still greater degree, the heights of the low
                    waters. Thus some of the high waters are depressed, and some of the low waters
                    elevated, till there is little vertical difference between the two. On the 17th
                    of June, the rise from low to high water in the afternoon was only eight inches,
                    although the rise in the forenoon had been four feet. In the same manner the
                    fall from high to low water in the afternoon of June 22 was only two inches, and
                    in the forenoon of June 23, only one inch, although the intermediate fall in the
                    afternoon of those days was above four feet. From 6 <hi rend="superscript">
                    h</hi> ∙ to 8 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ on the 24th the surface remained
                    stationary. Thus one of the two half-day tides being obliterated, we have only
                    one tide in the twenty-four hours. It is to be recollected, however, that this
                    takes place only at a particular period of each lunation, depending upon the
                    declination of the moon. When, therefore, a traveller meets with such a
                    phenomenon, if he would pursue his tide observations for a few days with
                    assiduity, he would probably find the single-day tide resolve itself into the
                    usual case of two daily tides.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">establishment</hi> ceases to be applicable when the
                    diurnal inequality affects the time of high water to so very large an amount as
                    we have seen it does at Petropaulofsk; because at almost any time of the
                    lunation the interval of moon’s transit and high water may vary very much from
                    one tide to another, and this uncertainty deprives the establishment of all
                    utility in such cases, unless we also take into account the diurnal
                    inequality.</p>
                <p>If the usual diurnal inequality at any place be the effect of a tide-wave
                    arriving at the shore once a day and super-imposed upon the semidiurnal
                    tide-wave, it is natural to ask whether such a mode of representation can be
                    applied to the tides now under consideration. Mr Whewell, after attempting at
                    considerable length to effect this, acknowledges that he is fairly outdone by
                    the inequalities alternating in their vanishing and maxima, as above
                    described.</p>
                <p>The tides at the Isle of Sitkhoe, latitude 57° 2' N. and longitude 135° 18' W.,
                    exhibit a very great diurnal inequality both in the heights and times. The
                    amount of this in the time of high water reaches an hour (30 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> m.</hi> positive and 30 <hi rend="superscript"> m.</hi>
                    negative); at low water it is somewhat less. The diurnal inequality of the
                    height of high water is two and a half feet, at low water its maximum amounted
                    to five feet; the greatest rise from low to high water being about fifteen feet.
                    In other respects this case is similar to that of Petropaulofsk, except that the
                    tides never become single. The same communication of Admiral Lütke contained an
                    account of the great diurnal inequalities of Port de la Coquille and of Port
                    Lloyd, as also of the establishments of several other places in the North
                    Pacific; but, as already stated, the term establishment becomes extremely vague,
                    and almost unmeaning, when applied to seas in which the phenomena of the tides
                    are such as above described.</p>
                <p>From the account of Admiral Freycinet’s voyage, it appears that at several places
                    in the North Pacific, the tides, as observed in that expedition, exhibit
                    features similar to those here noticed. It has often been lamented that so few
                    tide observations have been made in distant parts of the world; but it is now
                    sufficiently clear, that if, in places such as those now noticed, the
                    observations are not made with great care, and continued for a length of time,
                    they can only serve to mislead.</p>
                <p>The Rev. John Williams, who, from observations continued during several years’
                    residence in the islands of the Pacific Ocean, had it in his power to furnish
                    more certain information than could be obtained by any transient visitor,
                    however profound in knowledge or diligent in research, has given a very
                    intelligent account of certain tides in those regions in his “Narrative of
                    Missionary Enterprises in the South Sea Islands,” p. 200. It is a fact well
                    known to the missionaries, that the tides in Tahiti and the Society Islands are
                    uniform throughout the year, both as to the time <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=302" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0302-0282"/>of
                    the ebb and flow, and the height of the rise and fall; it being high water
                    invariably at noon and midnight, and low water at six in the morning and
                    evening. The total range from low to high water seldom exceeds eighteen inches
                    or two feet. Generally once, and frequently twice in the year, a very heavy sea
                    rolls over the reef, and bursts with great violence upon the shore. But the most
                    remarkable feature in this periodically high sea is, that it invariably comes
                    from west and south-west, which is just the opposite of the trade-wind. The
                    eastern sides of the islands are never injured by these periodical inundations.
                    Mr Williams is anxious to call the attention of scientific men to this
                    remarkable phenomenon, which he believes to be restricted to the Tahitian and
                    Society Island groups in the South Pacific, and the Sandwich Islands in the
                    North. But he cannot speak positively respecting the islands eastward of Tahiti;
                    but at all the islands he has visited in the same parallel of longitude to the
                    southward, and in those in the same parallel of latitude westward, the same
                    regularity is not observed, but the tides vary with the moon, both as to the
                    time and magnitude of the tide, which is the case at Rarotonga. He is also
                    anxious to correct the erroneous statements of some scientific visitors,
                    particularly of Kotzebue, who asserts that “every noon the whole year round, at
                    the moment the sun touches the meridian, the water is highest, and falls with
                    the sinking sun till midnight!” According to Captain Beechy, “the tides in all
                    harbours formed by coral reefs are very irregular and uncertain, and are almost
                    wholly dependent upon the sea-breezes. At Oututaunoa, it is usually low water
                    about six every morning, and high water half an hour after noon. To make this
                    deviation from the ordinary course of nature intelligible, it will be better to
                    consider the harbour as a basin, over the margin of which, after the breeze
                    springs up, the sea beats with considerable violence, and. throws a larger
                    supply into it than the narrow channels can carry off in the same time, and
                    consequently during that period the tide rises. As the wind abates, the water
                    subsides; and the nights being generally calm, the water finds its lowest level
                    by the morning.”</p>
                <p>“This statement,” says Mr Williams, “is certainly most incorrect; for not only
                    have I observed for years the undeviating regularity of the tides, but this is
                    so well understood by the natives, that the hours of the day and night are
                    distinguished by terms descriptive of its state: as, for example, instead of
                    asking 'What is the time ?’ they say ‘ Where is the tide ?’ Nor can the tides,
                    as Captain B. observes, be ‘ wholly dependent upon the sea breeze ;’ for there
                    are many days during the year when it is perfectly calm, and yet the tide rises
                    and falls with the same regularity as when the trade-winds blow; and we very
                    frequently have higher tides in calms than during the prevalence of the
                    trade-wind; besides which, the tides are equally regular on the westward or
                    leeward side of the islands, which the trade-wind does not reach, as on the
                    eastward, from which point it blows. But the perfect fallacy of Captain Becchy’s
                    theory will be still more apparent, if it be recollected that the trade-wind is
                    most powerful from mid-day till about four or five o’clock, during which time
                    the tide is actually ebbing so fast, that the water finds its lowest level by
                    six o’clock in the evening; and that in opposition to the strength of the
                    sea-breeze, Captain Beechy adds, * that the night being calm, the water finds
                    its lowest level by morning;’ whereas the fact is, that the water finds its
                    highest point at midnight when it is perfectly calm. How then can the tides be
                    dependent on the sea-breeze ?”</p>
                <p>Mr Lubbock thinks some of these extraordinary anomalies may perhaps be accounted
                    for by considering the continent of South America as a dam, preventing the
                    derived tide-wave from flowing freely into the Pacific from the great Southern
                    Ocean.</p>
                <p>Owing to the tide-wave which enters the German Ocean by the north coast of
                    Scotland, not reaching the mouth of the Firth of Forth at the same time with the
                    other tide-wave which conies through the Straits of Dover, there are frequently
                    four, and sometimes six tides a day, observed in the upper part of the Firth of
                    Forth. These peculiarities are most conspicuous about the time of spring tides,
                    and gradually decrease till the neaps, when they vanish altogether. For the
                    particulars, we beg to refer to the Reports of the British Association on Waves,
                    by Sir John Robison and Mr Russell. But so long ago as the year 1750,
                    peculiarities had been observed in the tides of the Forth, as described by
                    Wright in the Phil. Trans. for that year.</p>
                <p>When a tide-wave arrives at the mouth of a river, it enters in a manner similar
                    to that of a derivative tide into a narrow sea; and though there are generally
                    some features peculiar to each river in the entrance of the tide-wave, it
                    afterwards assumes a direction at right angles to the current, and advances
                    regularly up the stream. If the channel gradually narrows upward like a funnel,
                    the height of the tides will be increased by this convergence. Where the width
                    is nearly uniform, the tide will gradually die away, and still more rapidly if
                    the channel spreads out. In the Amazons the tide continues to ascend for several
                    days against the stream, and is still sensible at 200 leagues from its mouth.
                    Seven or eight tides, with intermediate low waters, follow in continual
                    succession up this mighty river. Something similar takes place in the St
                    Lawrence, the tides reaching 432 miles up the main channel to a point between
                    Montreal and Quebec. Among other plausible reasons to account for the tide not
                    ascending the Mississippi, its crookedness has been assigned as a very
                    sufficient one. But the best of all reasons seems to be, that there is next to
                    no tide in the sea at its mouth; the total rise there being only about eighteen
                    inches. When the tide, on entering a river, is made to rise greatly by the
                    contraction of the channel, the part of the water so affected maybe abruptly
                    terminated on the inland side, owing to the depth and quantity of the water on
                    that side not admitting of the surface there being immediately raised by means
                    of transmitted pressure. A tide-wave thus rendered abrupt has a close analogy
                    with the waves which curl over, and break on a shelving shore, and is called a
                    <hi rend="italic">bore.</hi> In many places it occurs in such magnitude as to
                    produce great noise by the violent intestine motion of the water. Though it
                    appears to travel with great rapidity, it in fact moves more slowly than the
                    tide-wave under any other circumstances. The bore which enters the Severn is
                    nine feet high; that in the creek of Fundy is said to be still higher. In the
                    Garonne this phenomenon takes place near Bordeaux, and is called there the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mascaret:</hi> at Cayenne it is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Barre.</hi> It occurs on a grand scale in the river Amazons, at the junction
                    with the Arawary, having there a face twelve or fifteen feet in height, and
                    producing a noise which may be heard at two leagues distance. The Indians of the
                    neighbourhood call it <hi rend="italic">Pororoca.</hi> Ships are often exposed
                    to considerable danger from the bore, especially in the more shallow parts of a
                    river, and near the shore.</p>
                <p>The range of the tide, that is, the height of high water above low water, is very
                    different at different places, and is affected by circumstances which it is
                    often very difficult to analyse. It is however clear that the configuration of
                    the coast exercises a very considerable influence upon the amount of this range,
                    according as it makes the tides converge or diverge. Thus the range is very much
                    increased in deep in-bends of the shore, which are open in the direction of the
                    tide-wave, and gradually contract like a funnel, such as the Bristol Channel,
                    the Gulf of Avranches, the Bay of St Malo, and the Bay of Fundy, where sometimes
                    it very considerably exceeds seventy feet, some say 100. On the contrary<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=303"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0303-0283"/>, the tide is much diminished at promontories
                    under certain circumstances. Thus at the south-east point of Ireland (at Arklow,
                    Glynn, and Cahore) the greatest range is not more than three feet, while at a
                    little distance along the coast each way it becomes twelve or thirteen feet; and
                    this small amount of the tide on one side of the channel is the more remarkable,
                    because it is just opposite the enormous range which occurs in the Bristol
                    Channel, amounting at Chepstow to sixty feet The smallness of the tide in the
                    middle of wide oceans, as at the islands of the Pacific, where it amounts only
                    to two or three feet, affords no proof that this would be the amount on a globe
                    entirely covered with water; for the interruption produced by the continents
                    entirely modifies the direction, height, or other circumstances of the general
                    tide. This interruption will diminish, and in some cases entirely obstruct, the
                    original tide-wave; and when a derivative tide does enter the oceans in
                    question, it is diffused over so wide a space that its height is greatly
                    reduced; so that in the same manner as the tides are augmented by convergence,
                    they are diminished by diffusion.</p>
                <p>Mr Lubbock and Mr Whewell seem to have adopted the most promising mode of
                    advancing our knowledge of the tides. This is to examine the laws which can be
                    collected from observations, taking so great a number of these that the effects
                    of all accidental causes may disappear in the average results. The collection
                    registered at the London docks, and first discussed by Mr Dession under the
                    direction of Mr Lubbock, afforded an admirable opportunity for such an
                    examination, since it included 13,073 observations, and a period of nineteen
                    years, from January 1, 1808, to December 31, 1826. But it is very unlikely that
                    the discussion, however systematica], of observations at any one place, should
                    exhibit clearly the true principles of the theory; and, besides, with respect to
                    the phenomena of the tides at London, they are in some measure masked by a
                    curious combination of circumstances, namely, by the mouth of its river being in
                    a sort of inland sea, and at a part of an island turned away from the side
                    against which the tide-wave impinges, and so situated, too, that the progress of
                    the tide round the one end of this island occupies about half a day more than
                    that round the other. These two tides, being thus of different ages, and meeting
                    near the mouth of the Thames, must affect the character of the tide at London.
                    It will no doubt require the accumulation and discussion of many large
                    collections of observations nt various places to put us in the certain
                    possession even of the empirical laws of the phenomena; and whether or not this
                    be the only practicable way of arriving at the true theory, it is at least that
                    to which, founding our expectations on the past history of science, we may look
                    with most hope. When we consider the enormous accumulation of observed phenomena
                    and empirical laws which preceded the discovery of the true principles of the
                    celestial motions, we may reasonably suppose that we are only at the outset of
                    what is requisite to obtain the same success with regard to the tides. It is
                    therefore to be wished that such additional observations may be made and
                    discussed as may most speedily lead to a complete and scientific knowledge of
                    the subject.</p>
                <p>The object, in examining a large collection of observations, being to ascertain
                    the manner in which the positions and distances of the heavenly bodies affect
                    the time and height of the tide, the mode of proceeding is to examine how these
                    two quantities depend upon the right ascension, declination, and parallax of the
                    sun and moon, and upon other astronomical elements, should such be required. The
                    mean time of high water will be found to be affected by inequalities depending
                    on the elements just mentioned; and the law and amount of these inequalities for
                    any particular place may be collected from observations made there, without any
                    reference to theory, provided the observations be sufficiently numerous, and
                    their circumstances sufficiently varied. For it was in this manner that the
                    greater inequalities of the moon’s motion, the variation, the evection, and
                    annual equation, were detected by observation, long before the celestial motions
                    were referred to their true causes. Indeed, in the history of science, the
                    instances seem to be comparatively few in which the general laws of the
                    phenomena have been pointed out by the theory, before they had been gathered, at
                    least approximately, from observation. The laws thus empirically obtained,
                    besides serving for predicting the tides, may be used either as tests of the
                    existing theories, or as suggestions for the improvements of those portions of
                    mathematical hydraulics on which the true theory may be expected to depend.
                    This, besides, is the way in which we are most likely to discover how the theory
                    must be applied.</p>
                <p>The best mode of obtaining from a considerable series of tide observations, at
                    the same place, the establishment and age of the tide, which are the principal
                    elements necessary for constructing tide-tables of the time for any particular
                    place, appears to be that which was employed by Mr Lubbock and Mr Whewell. The
                    times of high water are arranged according to the half-hour of the moon’s
                    transit on the day of the tide. Thus, all those tides which took place when the
                    moon passed the meridian between 0 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ and 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ 30 <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi> ∙ apparent time,
                    are put in one class; all those when the moon passed between 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ 30 <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi> ∙ and 1 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ in another class, and so on. The mean of all the
                    times of transit in each class is taken, and the mean of the lunitidal
                    intervale, or those between the times of transit and high water. We have thus a
                    series of times of transit, with the corresponding lunitidal intervals. The
                    interpolation for other times is most easily performed by means of a curve drawn
                    on paper, ruled into small squares. The times of transit being laid down as
                    abscissae, the lunitidal intervals are erected as ordinates, and a curve is
                    drawn approximating, as far as a regular form will allow, to the points thus
                    found. This curve gives the intervals for any times of transit, and a table may
                    be constructed by means of it. A similar course is followed for the heights; but
                    for this and various particulars, we beg to refer to the Philosophical
                    Transactions.</p>
                <p>It has hitherto been usual, in discussing tide observations for obtaining from
                    them the laws of the phenomena, to proceed upon the supposition that a series of
                    several successive years was requisite, in order that the accidental
                    irregularities might be compensated in the <hi rend="italic">means of</hi> the
                    observations, and the effects of the lunar inequalities thus come clearly into
                    view. But in the Phil. Trans. for 1838, p. 231, Mr Whewell has shown that the
                    laws of the phenomena, and the effects of the inequalities, may be deduced with
                    considerable exactness from shorter series of observations; for example, from
                    those of one year. He conceives that such an investigation will be of value in
                    several ways. If the principal elements of tide-tables for each particular place
                    can be obtained with moderate accuracy from short series properly discussed, the
                    formation of such independent tide-tables for different places and times will
                    become far less laborious, and may therefore be expected to be far more commonly
                    practised. This will be a great advantage, not only because the tide-tables will
                    thus become better, but also because several important questions may thus be
                    settled; for instance, whether and how far the laws of tide phenomena change
                    from place to place, and from time to time. But it is besides desirable to
                    compare the results of short series with those of long ones, in order to
                    appreciate the <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> accuracy of our tide-tables. If,
                    for instance, the mean of nineteen years gave a very exact rule for the effect
                    of lunar parallax, while each single year deviated widely from this rule, it
                    would be clear that the individual observations must be commonly affected by
                    casual irregularities considerably greater than the parallax <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=304" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0304-0284"
                    />correction; and therefore the practical accuracy of the tables would be very
                    little improved by introducing into them the parallax correction. But Mr Whewell
                    has shown that the general law and the approximate amount of the parallax
                    correction may be traced in the observations of a single year; and that thus the
                    tables are rendered practically as well as theoretically better by such a
                    correction being employed. The same is true, though less conspicuously, of the
                    correction for lunar declination.</p>
                <p>Although the establishment and mean range of tide were known or given for every
                    several port, yet no general tables have yet been framed, which, even with the
                    help of those data, would equally apply to the computation of the several times
                    and heights of their tides. So extremely imperfect is the present state of the
                    general theory, that each place still requires to have its own particular tables
                    for this purpose. Mr Lubbock has constructed auxiliary tables from which both
                    the times and heights may be computed for Plymouth, Portsmouth, Sheerness,
                    London, Pembroke, Bristol, Liverpool, and Leith, and the times for Brest and
                    Howth. The hydrographer royal, Captain Beaufort, has actually computed and
                    published the tide-tables to that extent for all those places, with the addition
                    of the time for Ramsgate. Mr Lubbock’s tables are also used for computing the
                    tide-tables of the British and the Nautical Almanacs. With regard to the
                    accuracy of the tide predictions so computed, Mr Lubbock says they will
                    sometimes, though rarely, deviate an hour from the observed time of high water,
                    owing to accidental causes. Generally, however, they may be depended on to
                    within ten minutes; and it should be recollected that it is difficult to
                    ascertain within five minutes the instant of high water, the fluctuations of
                    height being then so very minute that the water is said to hang. The predicted
                    amount of the height is liable to still greater uncertainties; which is the more
                    to be regretted, because disastrous effects often arise from unexpected and
                    unusually high tides, which are occasioned by storms and reduced atmospheric
                    pressure.</p>
                <p>Tolerably accurate tide-tables have long been published annually for London, and
                    still better for Liverpool. But it has been the practice in this country to form
                    tide-tables for other places, merely by taking the time which is stated in the
                    London or Liverpool tables, and, if necessary, to add or subtract some constant
                    quantity, according to the place. Even without this alteration the Liverpool
                    tables have been generally used for the whole of the west coast of England. But
                    tables are published, professing to give the hours at most of the principal
                    ports of England in parallel columns, the times for different pinces having
                    constant differences. Thus the hour of high water at Plymouth is stated as
                    always 1 <hi rend="superscript"> h.</hi> 55 <hi rend="superscript"> m.</hi>
                    later than the hour in the same half day at London, although they belong to
                    different transits. The like may be said of the American Almanac, which in a
                    similar manner professes to predict the tides for a great many places. Nor does
                    the British Almanac or Edinburgh Almanac follow a more correct course. Indeed
                    the tides in the latter have as yet been computed from the obsolete rules of
                    Laplace. The assumption of a constant difference in the tide-hours at different
                    places is by no means correct, as we might expect it to be from considering how
                    the tide is transmitted from place to place, and as it appears to be from
                    observation.</p>
                <p>According to Mr Lubbock, the great obstacle to perfection in calculations or
                    predictions of the tides, consists in the fluctuations of the establishments.
                    Suppose the establishment to change a minute per annum, and that, having
                    determined it from all the observations of twenty-one years, we employ it in
                    calculations of the time of high water for the eleventh year, and compare the
                    calculated times with the observed, they will not be affected with any constant
                    error; but if we calculate for the twenty-first year, the calculated times will
                    have a constant error of ten minutes. Similar remarks apply to the height. If
                    the channel become deeper, the title-wave travels with greater velocity, and the
                    high water happens sooner. From a very ancient tide-table discovered by Mr
                    Yates, and copied by Mr Lubbock into the Phil. Trans. for 1837, p. 103, it would
                    appear that the tide at London had formerly been fully an hour later than at
                    present. The argument or entry of the table is the day of the moon’s age, which
                    runs up to thirty days. The tide-hour on the first day is 8 <hi

                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On this however we have to remark, that since
                    the mean lunation consists of little more than twenty-nine days and a half,
                    almost half the number of new ninons would occur on the thirtieth day; so that,
                    although the table had been in every other respect correct, it would not make
                    the mean time of “find at london brigge” on the day of new moon to have exceeded
                    3 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ 26 <hi rend="superscript"> m.</hi>.
                    Flamsteed, in 1683, made it just 3 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙. Ilia tables
                    were the first which gave the time of the tide for the moon’s lower transit, or
                    twice a day.</p></note> But Mr Lubbock finds that the establishment of the port
                    of London has been subject to changes even within the present century; and he
                    notices the difficulty of predicting the time of high water with certainty,
                    unless these changes can be accounted for. The high water appears now to be
                    nearly as late as in 1804; in 1821 it was fully ten minutes earlier. The removal
                    of the Old London Bridge appears to have affected neither the time nor the
                    height of high water; but it has made the low water sink about eighteen inches
                    more than formerly. The following table shows the establishment of the port of
                    London, and mean height of tide when the moon’s transit occurs at 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h.</hi>; in other words, the mean time and height of tide at
                    new and full moon from 1802 to 1835; supposing the moon’s horizontal parallax
                    57', and declination 15°.</p>

                <p>In 1832 none of the lower portions of the Old London Bridge, which obstructed the
                    natural flow of the tidal waters, was removed excepting two piers; and in the
                    following year almost the whole of that structure was cleared away as regarded
                    the masonry and starlings, although the course of the river was far from being
                    completely cleared, many portions still remaining a foot or two above low-water
                    mark, and which were finally removed in 1834.</p>
                <p>Hitherto no care has been taken to specify to which transit of the moon the tide
                    at any place is referred, and various mistakes have originated in this want of
                    precision. It seems desirable that some conventional agreement were adopted upon
                    this point. Mr Lubbock has employed the transit which precedes a given high
                    water at London by about two days three hours, and which, according to the
                    notation already described, he terms transit B. If transit A, which occurs about
                    twelve hours and twenty-five minutes sooner, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=305" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0305-0285"/>be
                    preferred, he does not object. This latter transit corresponds in syzygy to the
                    average interval. At this period of the moon’s age, the lunitidal interval
                    changes rapidly, whereas the height of high water is stationary; so that it is
                    impossible to determine directly and with accuracy, how long, after a given
                    transit, the highest tide takes place.</p>
                <p>From Mr Lubbock’s examination of the progress of the tide-wave, the vulgar
                    establishments of the following places are, at h. m.</p>

                <p>From this it is evident that the establishments of ports as given in various
                    works, often very inaccurately, are besides referred to different transits of
                    the moon without distinction, thereby creating great confusion.</p>
                <p>Hence also it is found that the tide arrives at Days, h. m.</p>

                <p>So that the tide takes twenty-three hours forty-nine minutes in travelling from
                    Brest round the north coast of Scotland to the London docks. We are deficient of
                    information with respect to the course of the tide-wave in the Pacific Ocean;
                    and even on our own coasts the number of places of which the establishment is
                    accurately known is probably very small. The tide takes about twelve hours in
                    proceeding from the Cape of Good Hope to Cape Blanco; thence it reaches Brest in
                    about four hours. the crest of the tide-wave thus travels over the open ocean
                    with immense rapidity, and gives rise to a slow current, with which, however, it
                    must not be confounded.</p>
                <p>At the instance of Mr Whewell, the British Association, with the view of
                    ascertaining what surface ought to be taken as the permanent level of the sea,
                    caused a level line to be carried with great accuracy from the north shore of
                    Somersetshire to the south shore of Devonshire; and the position of this line
                    has been fixed, so as to be recognised at any future time, by means of marks at
                    Axmouth, at East Quantockshead, at Stolford, and at Portishead. This line has
                    also been referred to the sea at its extremities; and the observations show that
                    the mean between the heights of high and low water coincides, at least very
                    nearly, at different places, as well as at the same place at different times.
                    While the difference of the levels of low water at Axmouth on the English
                    Channel, and Wick Rocks on the Bristol Channel, is not less than twelve feet,
                    the mean water at those two places coincides in level within a few inches.
                    Against these conclusions, Mr Thomas has, in the Philosophical Magazine for
                    August 1840, alleged various facts, which we have no means of testing or
                    deciding upon. To one part however there seems a more serious objection than any
                    that he has stated; for though we should think the mean water very likely to be
                    nearly constant everywhere, it cannot be all on the same level if there be
                    perpetual high water at some places, as Mr Whewell himself alleges.</p>
                <p>From six years’ observations made at Plymouth, it appears that the height of mean
                    water is constant from year to year within two or three inches. It appears also
                    that the mean water for each fortnight has a semimenstrual inequality amounting
                    to six or seven inches, the height of the mean water being greatest when the
                    moon’s transit is at 6 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ and least when it is at
                    12 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ The immediate cause of this is, that the
                    semimenstrual inequality of low water is greater than that of high water at
                    Plymouth. The result of one year’s observations made at Dundee is, that the
                    half-tide level is constant within 1∙5 inch, except at eleven and twelve
                    o’clock, when it deviates two inches on a tide of fourteen feet. At any rate, Mr
                    Whewell’s scheme of taking the half-tide level as a standard must be an immense
                    improvement on the old system, in which the heights of buildings and mountains
                    are referred to the level of the sea, or to high or low water mark. The heights
                    of spring or neap tides, although not subject to so much uncertainty, are also
                    quantities too vague to be used with propriety as standards of reference.</p>
                <p>It had been long observed by the people about Stockholm, that when the water in
                    the harbour, which is an inlet of the Baltic Sea, subsides so as to allow the
                    waters of the Malar Lake, which has almost the mean level of the sea, to have
                    free exit, the air is clear and dry; but when the reverse occurs, or the sea
                    flows into the Miilar, wind and rain are likely soon to follow. This phenomenon
                    was investigated by N. G. Schulten, who, after he had ascertained the truth of
                    the popular belief, and compared it with the corresponding state of the
                    barometer, explained it at considerable length in the Transactions of the Royal
                    Academy of Stockholm for 1806, by referring it to opposite changes taking place
                    simultaneously in the atmospheric pressure at Stockholm and in that at some
                    considerable distance. The increment of pressure at the one place tending to
                    depress the water there, just when the decrement of pressure at the other allows
                    the water to rise, and the total pressure over the whole ocean being supposed
                    constant, a tendency to equilibrium will result. Schulten’s explanation, of
                    which we suppose this to be the substance, is embarrassed with some irrelevant
                    considerations; but there can be no doubt that it at the same time involves the
                    true principle. His ideas, although well known at Stockholm, have not in other
                    countries met with the attention they deserve. Some years ago they received a
                    confirmation from Μ. Daus-sy, who, without being aware of Schulten’s researches,
                    has, from his own observations made at Brest, deduced the effects due to the
                    changes of atmospheric pressure. Some account of these, accompanied by
                    barometric tables, has been published <hi rend="italic">(Connaissance des
                    Terns</hi> for 1834, and <hi rend="italic">Annales de Chimie,</hi> tome lxii.),
                    and clearly exhibits the connection between the phenomena in question.</p>
                <p>Mr Lubbock verified the same fact both at Liverpool and at London. At Liverpool
                    he found the water rise eleven times as much as the barometer falls; and
                    therefore the range of the barometer being three inches, the correction due to
                    change in the atmospheric pressure may there amount to thirty-three inches. At
                    London the water rises seven times as much as the mercury falls, and hence the
                    range of the correction there is about twenty-one inches. On the coasts of
                    Cornwall and Devon, Mr Walker found, that in ordinary cases a change of one inch
                    in the barometer corresponds to sixteen on the height of the sea; but that in
                    very sudden changes of pressure, one inch of mercury corresponds to twenty of
                    sea-water. This last has been accounted for by considering that a sudden impulse
                    given to the water would cause a rise or fall in the manner of a wave, beyond
                    that strictly due to mere change of pressure. But this would at best hold good
                    near the time of such change; and Mr Lubbock has remarked that it is sometimes
                    very difficult to distinguish between the effects of pressure and those of the
                    wind. Both wind and pressure may require to be attended to, especially where
                    tide observations are continued during only a limited period. From the facts
                    above stated, it would rather seem that the more confined the situation, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=306"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0306-0286"/> the less is the effect of change of pressure;
                    though this may, after all, be no general rule. But since the effects of
                    variations of pressure do not accurately follow the inverse ratio of the
                    specific gravities of water and of mercury, it is doubtful if the tides and
                    these effects be independent of each other.</p>
                <p>The effects of wind on the level of the sea do not seem to have been much
                    attended to; but Mr Lubbock has collected some important facts regarding its
                    influence on the Thames. During strong north-westerly gales, the tide in the
                    port of London marks high water earlier than otherwise, and does not give so
                    much water, while the ebb tide runs out later, and marks lower; but upon the
                    gales abating and the weather moderating, the tides put in and rise much higher,
                    while they also run longer before high water is marked, and with more velocity
                    of current, nor do they run out so long or so low. The reason assigned for all
                    this is, that the strong north-west winds drive the sea along the Dutch coast,
                    through the Straits of Dover, and consequently away from the mouth of the
                    Thames; so that the tides during north-west winds are always much higher
                    (producing frequently ruinous flooding) on the Dutch than upon the English
                    coast. A south-westerly gale generally has a contrary effect, and an easterly
                    one gives some water; but the tides in all these cases always improve the moment
                    the weather moderates. This is the opinion of those most competent to form one
                    from their daily experience, and is no doubt correct. The subject is one of
                    considerable importance as regards the accuracy of which tide predictions are
                    susceptible, and merits further inquiry, in order to ascertain if possible the
                    error which may be expected for a wind of a given force and direction.</p>
                <p>The progress of the tide-wave in most places must obviously be liable to be
                    disturbed by great storms. Thus, during a violent hurricane, January 8. 1839,
                    there was no tide at Gainsborough, twenty-five miles up the Trent, a
                    circumstance unknown before. At Saltmarsh, only five miles up the Ouse from the
                    Humber, the tide went on ebbing, and never flowed, till the river was dry in
                    some places; while at Ostend, towards which the wind was blowing, contrary
                    effects were observed. It has been supposed, that, owing to the sheltered
                    situation of the port of London, the great undulations produced by the winds
                    will be less sensible there than on the coasts of France, as, for example, at
                    Brest. But it should be recollected, that if the tide at London come from the
                    Atlantic, the irregularities felt at Brest will equally tend to affect it at all
                    those places which it subsequently reaches.</p>
                <p>In the Phil. Trans. for 1838, p. 249, there is a particular description of a very
                    complete machine, by Mr Bunt, for registering, in a continuous form, the rises
                    and falls of the tides, or their height for any instant of time. The principal
                    parts are, an eight-day clock, which turns a vertical cylinder revolving once in
                    twenty-four hours; a wheel, to which an alternate motion is communicated by a
                    float rising and falling with the tide, in an almost close chamber, and
                    connected by a wire with the wheel, which is kept constantly strained by a
                    counterpoise; and a small drum, on the same axis with the wheel, which by a
                    suspending wire communicates one eighteenth of the vertical motion of the float
                    to a bar carrying a pencil, which marks a curve on the cylinder, or on a sheet
                    of paper wrapped round it. The leading principle is obviously the same with that
                    which Mr Keith first applied to the register thermometers and barometers.
                    Various tide-gauges on similar principles have been constructed by others,
                    particularly by Captain Lloyd, Mr Mitchell, and Mr Palmer, and are described in
                    previous volumes of the Philosophical Transactions.</p>
                <p>Hitherto the phenomena of the tides have to a certain extent been referred to the
                    equilibrium theory, the actual elevation of the waters being compared with the
                    elevation which the moon would produce if the earth and moon were both at rest.
                    But on account of the interruption of the land, the general motion of the waters
                    of the ocean cannot conform to this theory, or admit of a fluid elevation
                    resembling that of the equilibrium spheroid following the moon from east to
                    west, except in some parts of the southern hemisphere. The Pacific, the largest
                    ocean of all, has very small tides in its central parts; and at its eastern
                    shore, near Cape Horn, the tide-wave runs from west to east, although there is
                    apparently nothing to prevent its following the usual course. From such
                    considerations, viewed in connection with various tide observations on the
                    eastern and western sides of the Pacific and of the Atlantic, Captain Fitzroy
                    (Voyage of the Adventure and Beagle, vol. ii. appendix, p. 279) has been led to
                    propose a considerably different theory, in which the tide of each large ocean
                    is considered to be nearly as independent of the tides of other waters as if it
                    were a lake. The central area of each ocean is further supposed to be occupied
                    by a lunar wave oscillating so as to keep time with the moon’s transits, and
                    having its motion kept up by the attraction of that luminary acting at each
                    return. From the skirts of this oscillating central area, tides are supposed to
                    be carried on all sides by free waves, the velocity of which would depend upon
                    the depth and local circumstances of the sea; and thus the littoral tides may
                    travel in any direction, while the oceanic tides near the centre of the
                    oscillating area may be small, or may altogether vanish. Such we take to be the
                    substance of this theory, as explained, with some improvements, to the Cambridge
                    Philosophical Society, by Mr Whewell. Single observations, as that gentleman has
                    remarked, can be of little use in deciding upon such a theory. More light would
                    be thrown upon it if the real forms and positions of the co-tidal lines could be
                    ascertained for the shores of the Pacific. With this view it is desirable that
                    numerous and connected observations were made on the eastern shores of
                    Australia, the Indian Archipelago, the Philippine isles, the Loo Choo Isles, and
                    those of Japan. But we suspect that the magnitude and peculiarities of the
                    diurnal inequality in some of those regions would throw great difficulties in
                    the way of determining the cotidal lines, if they even admit of them at all.</p>
                <p>Some of the facts which Captain Fitzroy considers most difficult to be reconciled
                    with the theory which deduces tides in the Northern Atlantic from the movement
                    of a tide-wave originating in the Southern Ocean are, lst, the comparative
                    narrowness of the space between Africa and America, with the certainty, that the
                    sea is neither uniformly nor excessively deep in that space, and the trifling
                    rise of the tide, not only upon each nearest shore (where it does not exceed
                    four or five feet), but at Ascension Island, where the highest rise is not quite
                    two feet; 2dly, the absence of any regular tide about the wide estuary of the
                    river Plata, the situation and shape of which seem so well disposed for
                    receiving an immense tide; 3dly, the flood-tide moving towards the west and
                    south along the coast of Brazil, from near Pernambuco, to the vicinity of the
                    river Plata; and, lastly, the almost uniformity of the time of high water along
                    that extent of the coast of Africa which reaches from near the Cape of Good Hope
                    to the neighbourhood of the Congo.</p>
                <p>Against the supposition that a tide-wave travels southward along the west coast
                    of America, are the facts, that the flood-tide impinges upon Chilóe and the
                    adjacent outer coast from the southward of west; that it is high water within
                    half an hour of the same time at Cape Pillar and at Chilóe, including the
                    intermediate coast; that from Valdivia to the Bay of Mexillones (differing 18°
                    in latitude), there is not an hour’s difference in the time of high water; that
                    from Arica to Payta, and from Panama to California, the times change gradually
                    as the coast trends westward; and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=307" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0307-0287"
                    />that from forty to sixty north latitude, high water takes place at one
                    time.</p>
                <p>In about 55° south latitude is the only zone of ocean which could follow any
                    thing like the law that would govern its undulations if the globe were wholly
                    covered with water. In other zones (taking about ten degrees in latitude as the
                    breadth of a zone), it is high water, generally speaking, at one side of an
                    ocean near the time it is low on the other. In oceans about 90° wide, this
                    happens very nearly; but as the width diminishes, so do the times of high water
                    at each side approach; and as the width increases beyond 90°, as in the case of
                    zones of the Pacific, the times of high water still approach, in consequence of
                    the tendency to high water simultaneously at opposite sides of the globe.</p>
                <p>Along the east side of the Atlantic, from the Canary Isles to Scotland, it is
                    high water within an hour of four o’clock on the salient points of the coast;
                    and if the opposite coast were straight, like that of Chili, and uninfluenced by
                    derivative tides or by currents, we might expect that it would be high water
                    there at about 7 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙, allowing that the tide-wave
                    moved as it is found to do generally. But it is high water at about 1 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h.</hi> from 30° to 40°, the times increasing northward from
                    40° N. to the Bay of Fundy, and also increasing southward from 50° N. to that
                    bay, where the tides probably rise higher than in any other part of the world.
                    This sequence of times, each ending in about 43° N., the adjacent gulf-stream,
                    and the excessive; accumulation of water, show that we cannot there expect to
                    find data for tidal rules. In that quarter it is evidently a marked exception,
                    caused by the conflux of at least two primary tides, two derivatives, and a
                    powerful current, aided by the peculiar configuration of the land. On the west
                    coasts of Ireland and Scotland, the hour of high water is from 5 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ to 6 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ·; on the coast
                    of Labrador, it is from 10 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ to 11 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙ in the same parallels. The meridian distances are
                    from three to four hours; but as we approach the parallel of 60° N., the
                    Northern Ocean and Davis Straits open, which probably affect the tide between
                    Ireland and Labrador.</p>
                <p>The Indian Ocean appears to have high water on all sides at once, though not in
                    the central parts at the same time. Thus, it is high water at the north-west
                    extremity of Australia, on the coast of Java, on that of Sumatra, at Ceylon, at
                    the Laccadiva Islands, at the Seychelles, on the coast of Madagascar, and at
                    Amsterdam Island, at 12 <hi rend="superscript"> h.</hi>; but at the Chagos
                    Islands and Mauritius it is high water at about 9 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi>
                    ∙, and at the Keeling Isles about 1 1 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙. It is to
                    be observed, that the various tide-hours above mentioned arc meant to be in
                    Greenwich time.</p>
                <p>High water taking place within an hour of the same time all along the east coast
                    of Africa, shows that the rise of the sea or tide-wave there moves westward or
                    eastward, and the times of high water at the islands are further confirmations;
                    for the wave is at Chagos and at the Mauritius three or four hours before it is
                    high water on the African coast. The Keeling time shows that there the water
                    rises longer, in consequence of that part of the ocean being affected by the
                    advancing swell of the Pacific.</p>
                <p>Such is the substance of a few of the ingenious statements which Captain Fitzroy
                    has advanced in favour of his theory; for we have not room for one fourth of
                    them, and they do not readily admit of abridgement. He seems however to proceed
                    upon the supposition that the moon could keep detached oceans of any dimensions
                    in a state of perpetual oscillation; whereas it is easy to conceive oceans of
                    exceedingly different dimensions, and yet not so much as one of which the moon
                    could make oscillate to an extent deserving the name of a tide, or in fact
                    produce in it any motion which would both continue till, and have the proper
                    direction at, the next transit; because the times of oscillation, which
                    naturally belonged to these oceans, might neither be equal to the intervals
                    between the lunar transits, nor yet have any other ratio or relation to them
                    which would tend to continue the movement. Some of Captain Fitzroy’s reasoning,
                    it is true, seems to imply that without any previous oscillation in the water, a
                    single transit of the moon could produce a sufficient tide; and should it be
                    able to effect this, which is very improbable, the above objection would rather
                    be applicable to that theory as explained by Mr Whewell. The circumstance
                    however of the tide-hour varying but little along a great extent of coast,
                    instead of arguing much in favour of the new scheme, is quite in conformity with
                    the principles upon which Mr Whewell has laid down his cotidal lines. But
                    whatever may be the merits of Captain Fitzroy’s theory, we have some doubts if
                    it has much novelty to recommend it; something very similar having been
                    proposed, and rather more systematically, by Dr Young, considerably above thirty
                    years ago (Natural Philosophy, vol. ii. p. 343); and he has also comprehended it
                    in an improved form in the theoretical part of the present article, more
                    particularly in the fourth section. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. e. e.)</hi></p>
