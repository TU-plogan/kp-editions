                <p><label type="entry">TOLEDO</label>, a province of Spain, forming a part of the
                    ancient kingdom of Old Castille. It extends in north latitude from 39° 3' to 40°
                    54', and in west longitude from 3° 1' to 5° 32', and comprises 734 Spanish
                    square leagues, or about 9060 English square miles. It is bounded on the north
                    by the provinces of Madrid and Guadalaxara, on the east by Cuença, on the south
                    by La Mancha, on the southwest by Estremadura, and on the north-west by Avila
                    and Salamanca. The land is lofty and mountainous, with wide and uniform plains,
                    almost destitute of trees. The soil is mostly calcareous and sandy, and on the
                    hills stony, but <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=342"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0342-0322"/>highly productive in situations in which it can be
                    duly watered. The mountains of this province form a distinct chain, which shoots
                    from Cuença, commences with small hills in the vicinity of Tarascon and
                    Tembleque, then turns to the south, and by Madrilejos gradually attains the
                    height of 2500 feet. It next turns to the west, and forms the Sierra of Yevemes;
                    and then, under the name of Guadalupe, enters the province of Estremadura. The
                    several spurs from this chain are called by various names.</p>
                <p>The chief river of the province is the Tagus, which receives a great number of
                    tributary streams within it, and others in Estremadura, through which province
                    it passes in its course to Lisbon, where it terminates. It is not navigable in
                    Toledo, though, with little expense, it might be easily made so. The river
                    Guadiana enters the province in the south-east part, and is soon lost in the
                    sands, and does not re-appear till it enters La Mancha. It then continues its
                    course as a considerable stream by Badlajos, having its water increased by
                    various tributary rivers and rivulets, till it enters the sea at Ayamonte, on
                    the south-east frontier of Portugal. Notwithstanding these rivers, the want of
                    water is a subject of complaint, as there are few or no wells. According to the
                    latest, not very satisfactory, statement by Canga Arguelles, the population in
                    1797 was 370,641 persons, composing 74,128 families, occupying 68,953 dwellings,
                    but leaving 4979 ruined or unoccupied houses. The description of the people, as
                    given by the same author, is as follows: Nobles, 1430; labouring proprietors,
                    11,215; labouring tenants, 7155; day-labourers, 37,075; artisans, 10,127;
                    traders and merchants, 797; public officers, 682; domestic servants, 6969;
                    secular ecclesiastics, 2929; regular ecclesiastics, or monks and friars, 2969;
                    and females in convents, 1569.</p>
                <p>T <hi rend="smallcaps">oldeo</hi>, a city of Spain, the capital of a province,
                    and of a subdivision or partido, of the same name. It is remarkable in history
                    from having been the capital of the Moorish kings during their government of the
                    peninsula; and it was distinguished at the commencement of the reign of Charles
                    V. as the scene of the insurrection, in 1522, of Don Juan de Padilla, who was
                    here executed after his defeat. It stands on the river Tagus, on some hills
                    rising from it; and the city is thus rendered uneven and very irregular. There
                    are two old strong bridges over the river. Toledo is surrounded by ancient
                    walls, protected by towers, but is not defensible against modern modes of
                    attack. The interior of the city has narrow streets, and many large buildings of
                    very antique architecture. The most remarkable is the cathedral, an enormous
                    pile in the Gothic style, ornamented with a vast quantity of decorations. It is
                    410 feet in length, 210 in breadth, and 112 feet in height. The other remarkable
                    churches are those of St Thomas, of the Dominicans, and the Carmelites. The
                    ancient palace of the Moorish kings is a very striking object, now converted
                    into an hospital. The city suffers much from the want of water, the only supply
                    being from the river, and conveyed to the houses on the backs of asses. Toledo
                    is the seat of a university. The archbishopric is the richest in Spain, and the
                    dignity is commonly filled by a member of the royal family. The archbishop has
                    eight suffragan bishops under him, and enormous revenues, which are distributed
                    largely in provisions, and this circumstance causes the city to swarm with idle
                    beggars. This place was celebrated for the excellence of its sword blades; a
                    manufacture introduced by the Moors, but now nearly, if not wholly, extinct. The
                    silk and soap trades give some occupation. The number of inhabitants at present
                    is supposed to be about 25,000, but is uncertain. Toledo was the birth-place of
                    the dramatic poet Garcilaso de la Vega, and of the great critic Tostado. Long.
