                    in Ireland, is bounded on the north by the counties of Donegal and Londonderry,
                    on the east by Lough Neagh and the county of Armagh, on the south by the
                    counties of Monaghan and Fermanagh, and on the west by those of Fermanagh and
                    Donegal. It lies between 54° 20' and 54° 59' north latitude, and 6° 15’ and 7°
                    57' west longitude; measuring forty-six miles in its greatest length from north
                    to south, and sixty-three in its greatest breadth from east to west, and
                    containing an area of 1269 square miles, or 806,296 acres, of which 714,500 are
                    land, and of these, 544,000 acres are cultivated, and 170,000 bog or
                    uncultivated mountain-land; and 31,796 are covered with water, part of which is
                    a section of Lough Neagh. lt is the ninth county as to its total extent of

                <p>According to some authorities, the <hi rend="italic">Brdini,</hi> and to others,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Scoti</hi> were the earliest known inhabitants of this
                    district. It was afterwards distinguished by the name of Kineal-Evgain, or
                    Tyr-Owen, and was the territory of the O’Neills, descendants of Neal of the Nine
                    Hostages, king of Ireland, and virtually sovereigns of the greatest part of the
                    north of Ireland for several centuries after the English settlement under Henry
                    II. In a writ of Henry III., the head of the sept is styled king of Kenihιm or
                    Tiroen. The chief scat of the family was at Dungannon, which, though several
                    times taken and sacked by the English forces in their attempts to reduce the
                    country to obedience to the royal authority, continued to be so until the close
                    of the reign of Elizabeth, when it was burned by Hugh O’Neill, earl of Tyrone,
                    to prevent its falling into the hands of Lord Mountjoy, who then commanded the
                    queen’s forces in Ireland. The insurrection of 1641 may be said to have had its
                    commencement in this county, by the capture of Charlemont Fort and Dungannon by
                    Sir Phelim O'Neill; and in 1646 the parliamentary forces under General Munroe
                    received a signal defeat from Hugh Roe O’Neill at Benburb. During the greater
                    part of the war between King William and King James, this county was in the
                    possession of the forces of the latter, and suffered much from the partisan
                    warfare carried on there, chiefly by the townsmen of Enniskillen. It was also
                    here that the voluntecr convention of Dungannon assembled in 1782, and passed a
                    series βf resolutions expressive of their opinion of the right of the Irish
                    parliament to make laws independently of that of Great Britain.</p>
                <p>The surface is much varied, mostly hilly, with but little level ground. In the
                    north it rises into the mountain range of Sperin, forming the boundary between
                    the county and that of Londonderry. Its greatest elevations are Mullaghearne,
                    1590 feet; Straw Mountain, 2085; Muinard, 2064; and Sawell, 2236. South of these
                    is the lower ridge of Slievekirk, Slievemore, and Munterlony, whose highest
                    point is 1432 feet. Mullaghearne, north of Omagh, is 1778 feet high;
                    Slieve-Gallion, in the north-east, 1730; Croagh, west, 1260; the mountains south
                    of Clogher, which form its boundary towards Monaghan, 1265 feet. Two mountains,
                    detached from the main group, and situate on each side of the Mourne river, are
                    distinguished by the popular names of Bessy Bell and Mary Gray. The former name
                    has been supposed to owe its origin to the pagan rites celebrated on its summit
                    to the god Bel or Beal; for the latter no conjecture has been hazarded. The
                    eastern districts are chiefly flat, declining towards Lough Neagh. The valleys,
                    several of which are very romantic, serve as the channels to the minor streams,
                    whose confluence forms the river Foyle. The principal arc, the Mourne,
                    Munterlony, Owenreagh, Owen-kelloe, Derg, from Lough Derg in Donegal, and the
                    Dennet. The Foyle forms a small portion of the western boundary, the Blackwater
                    a considerable part of the southern, and the Ballinderry of the north-eastern.
                    There are but few lakes, and those very small. Lough Fae, at the foot of
                    Slieve-Gallion, and Lough Creevy, are the largest.</p>
                <p>The substratum of the northern mountainous district is mica slate, interspersed
                    with primary limestone in small detached portions. To the north-west is yellow
                    sandstone with conglomerate, which shows itself also in the central part near
                    Omagh, and again in the south-west, where it plunges into Fermanagh. A bed of
                    granite, enclosed in crystalline greenstone trap, extends from Slieve Gallion
                    nearly to Omagh. The formation across the county from Lough Erne to Lough Neagh
                    is the old red sandstone and sandstone conglomerate. In the south and south-east
                    the carboniferous or mountain limestone appears; and near the borders of Lough
                    Neagh are lyas, green sand, and chalk, with new red sandstone. In the sandstone
                    formation in this part, fossil fish have been found, with the characteristic
                    features of their various species strongly marked. Near Cookstown a great number
                    of organic remains has been discovered. Coal is raised in large quantities in
                    the eastern part, between Dungannon and Lough Neagh, in a district formed of a
                    collection of low bills, not more than a hundred feet in perpendicular
                    elevation, with steep sides and flattened summits. There are two principal
                    fields; Coal Island, measuring about eight miles by three, and comprehending an
                    area of 1200 acres; and Annahone, about a mile each way, and containing 500
                    acres. The coal, which is of the bituminous or blazing kind, like that of the
                    west of Scotland, burning rapidly, and with a bright abundant flame, rests upon
                    beds of fire-clay, sandstone, or blue clunch. The shale has impressions of
                    vegetable substances, among which are reeds of very large dimensions. The
                    quantity of coal raised is abundant in proportion to the extent of the field;
                    but it is difficult to be worked, from the greatness of the angle formed by the
                    layers of coal in many places, which increases the difficulty of drainage, and
                    also from the soft nature of the bottom or flooring, which requires many
                    precautions to prevent the passages from closing. Indications of coal have been
                    perceived at Drunquin, to the north-west of Omagh, but no practical advantage
                    has yet been taken of the discovery. Iron ore and potters clay are found in the
                    coal districts. A range of escars extends across the southern part of the
                    county, from near Dungannon to Five-mile-town; and the ridges are in some places
                    as regularly arranged as if formed by the hand of man. There are many small bogs
                    dispersed through the county.</p>
                <p>The soil in the parts adjacent to Lough Neagh is alluvial, of considerable depth,
                    and based upon limestone. The lowlands along the Blackwater are extremely
                    fertile, well timbered, and afford many prospects of great beauty. The valley of
                    the Foyle, which belongs to this county, is also very fertile. The mountainous
                    tracts to the north have a shallow soil, resting either on a tenacious clay, or
                    on bog, which impedes the passage of the water, and renders the land moist,
                    cold, and unproductive. Much of the central parts present tracts of unprofitable
                    bog and heath. The southern districts are well wooded.</p>
                <p>The progress of population during the last hundred years is as follows, according
                    to the authorities stated:</p>
                <p>Year. Authority. Number.</p>
                <p>1760 De Burgo 76,278</p>
                <p>1792 Beaufort 159,000</p>
                <p>1812 Parliamentary census 250,74 6</p>
                <p>1821 Ditto 261,865</p>
                <p>1831 Ditto 302,943</p>
                <p>the proportion of population to the entire surface of the county is, according to
                    the latest of these statements, as 1 to 2Ί2, and to the entire of the cultivated
                    land as 1 to 1∙63. There is therefore one individual to somewhat more than every
                    two acres of land in general, and to every 1 <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> /
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> ths of an acre of productive land. According to the
                    returns of the Commissioners of Public Instruction in 1834, which, being taken
                    by dioceses instead of counties, afford but an approximation to strict accuracy,
                    the total population was 312,500, of which 69,320 were members of the
                    established church, 69,620 Protestant Dissenters, and the remaining 173,560
                    Roman Catholics. The proportions of the different persuasions, the total
                    population being taken as unity, arc therefore 0∙222, 0∙223, and 0∙555 nearly;
                    whence it appears that the Roman Catholic population is more than equal to that
                    of the Protestant, which also is almost equally divided between the established
                    church and the Dissenters. The number of children receiving instruction in
                    public schools, according to the population returns of 1821, <pb break="no"

                    />and the Reports of the Commissioners of National Education in 1824-6 and in
                    1837, was as follows:</p>
                <p>Year. Male.. Females. Sex not ascertained. Total.</p>
                <p>1821 8,484 4,078 — 12,562</p>
                <p>1824-6 10,783 7,598 447 18,828</p>
                <p>1837 4.383 2,581 — 6,964</p>
                <p>Of the numbers stated in the return of 1824-6, there were, of the established
                    church, 4824; Protestant Dissenters, 6404; Roman Catholics, 7480; besides 120
                    whose religious persuasion was not ascertained. And according to the same
                    return, the number of schools was 435, of which eighty-nine, with 4861 pupils,
                    were supported by grants of public money; eighty, with 5250 pupils, by private
                    subscriptions; and the remaining 226, with 8717 pupils, wholly by the pupils’
                    fees.</p>
                <p>After the flight and attainder of the earl of Tyrone in 1607, the county was
                    parcelled out by King James among English and Scotish settlers, or, as they were
                    then styled, “planters,” among whom the native Irish were distributed as
                    tenants, except the swordsmen, who were dispersed throughout the waste districts
                    of Munster and Connaught. Before that period, it was divided into two districts,
                    called North and South Tyrone; but the northern part was about that time
                    transferred to Londonderry, and the remainder divided into the five precincts of
                    Clogher, Dungannon, Mountjoy, Omy, and Strabane. It now consists of the four
                    baronies of Clogher, Dungannon, Omagh, and Strabane, which are subdivided into
                    thirty-five parishes, of which twenty are in the diocese of Armagh, eleven in
                    that of Derry, and four in Clogher; the cathedral and bishop’s seat of the last
                    named being in the county. Tyrone was represented in the Irish parliament by ten
                    members, two for the county, and two for each of the boroughs of Augher,
                    Clogher, Dungannon, and Strabane. By the act of union the number has been
                    reduced to three, two for the county and one for the borough of Dungannon. The
                    numbers of electors at different periods were as follows;</p>

                <p>1835 2057</p>
                <p>The local government is vested in a lord lieutenant, twenty-two deputy
                    lieutenants, and eighty-two other magistrates, besides a stipendiary appointed
                    and paid by the crown, under whom there is a constabulary force of one county
                    inspector, five sub-inspectors, six head constables, and 150 constables and
                    sub-constables. The assizes are held at Omagh, where also are the county
                    court-house and prison. There are bridewells at Clogher, Dungannon, and
                    Strabane. General sessions of the peace are held at Strabane, Omagh, Dungannon,
                    and Clogher; and there are eighteen stations for holding petty sessions. The
                    number of committals for 1839 was 558, disposed of as follows: Discharged in
                    consequence of want of prosecution, sixty; no bill being found, 100; acquitted
                    by jury, 151; bailed and not tried, twenty; total, 331; convicted, 227, of whom
                    there were discharged on securities, twenty-nine; fined, thirty; imprisoned for
                    six months or under, 127; for one year, ten; for two years, three; transported
                    for periods under seven years, ten; for seven years, fourteen; for fourteen
                    years, four; for life, none; sentenced to death, none; to which general total
                    are to be added seventy-three cases of summary convictions at petty sessions,
                    and 190 for drunk enness. The public establishments for medical purposes are in
                    different places. The county infirmary is at Omagh, the fever hospital at
                    Strabane, and the accommodation for lunatics in the district-asylum at
                    Londonderry. There are twenty dispensaries distributed through the county.
                    Workhouses for unions under the new poor-law are in course of erection at
                    Castlederg, Cookstown, Dungannon, Gortin, Omagh, and Strabane.</p>
                <p>The modes of agriculture differ according to the character of the soil. In the
                    alluvial lands in the east, tillage is pursued universally, and according to the
                    most approved systems, both as to the treatment of the land and the construction
                    of the implements. It is also extending into the mountainous district, wherever
                    the nature of the soil or the declivity of the land admits of it The spade, as
                    an instrument of general husbandry, is less used every year, and the plough is
                    substituted for it. Farms are generally small, not often extending beyond fifty
                    acres. The land is much subdivided, except in the mountain districts, where
                    farms are often held by a number of tenants, each of whom tills a quantity of
                    the land proportionate to the amount of his rent, and enjoys the benefit of the
                    remainder as pasture-land for his cattle, in common with the rest of the
                    holders. In the more highly cultivated parts the fences are of white thorn; in
                    the hilly country either of stone carelessly piled together, or, where stone is
                    scarce, of sods topped with furze, here called whins. Land is now seldom allowed
                    to lie fallow, as formerly, but is kept in a productive state by a judicious
                    rotation of crops. Though it is not a pasturage country, and possesses but few
                    extensive dairies, much butter is made, chiefly for the Scotish markct. Cheese
                    is also made in small quantities. The native cows are small, but good milkers.
                    Great numbers of young cattle are fed on the mountains, and after a short time
                    driven down to the lowlands for sale, where they are slaughtered, and sold under
                    the name of horse-beef, because carried to the markets on horseback. The horses
                    are hardy and excellent for field purposes, but are ill shaped. The breed of
                    sheep is little attended to, whether for wool or carcase; nor are swine reared
                    in the numbers usual in most other parts of Ireland, the vicinity of Strabane
                    being the only part in which they form an important part of the farming
                    stock.</p>
                <p>The linen manufacture was long the staple trade; and though it lately declined
                    here, as in other parts, for some years, yet it was never wholly relinquished:
                    it is reviving to such a degree that it may now be considered to be in a
                    flourishing and improving state. Bleach-greens were very numerous, but most of
                    them have been applied to other uses, the linens wrought in the country being
                    sold in a green state in all the principal towns. Wool is manufactured for
                    domestic use into coarse cloths, blankets, and druggets; which last are still
                    worn by the women, though their use is much diminished by the demand for cheap
                    cottons. The favourite colour for broad cloths is a light blue. In spinning the
                    wool, the oleaginous juice of the fern-root pounded is used instead of butter.
                    Agricultural implements of every kind are manufactured at Coal Island; as are
                    fire-bricks, considered to be equal to those of Stourbridge clay, and also
                    crucibles. There are potteries in several places. Flour, tobacco, soap, and
                    candles are manufactured to a considerable extent. There are several tanneries,
                    distilleries, and breweries. The northern mail-road to Londonderry, through
                    Strabane, traverses the county. The Ulster Canal passes along the southern
                    border from Lough Neagh to Caledon, near which it enters Monaghan in its
                    progress towards Lough Erne. The Foyle is navigable for small craft to St
                    Johnstown, a village on the confines of the county, but on the Donegal bank of
                    the river, and thence by an artificial cut to Strabane. The Blackwater is
                    navigable for boats to Moy, and communicates with the collieries by a short
                    canal. There is also a communication between the river and the collieries <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=471"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0471-0441"/> by a railroad. The line of railroad proposed by
                    the commissioners of railways to proceed from Armagh to Coleraine is intended to
                    pass through Tyrone, near the western coast of Lough Neagh, by Coal Island and
                    Coagh. There are nine banking establishments; three of which are branches of the
                    Belfast, three of the Provincial, and three of the Agricultural and Commercial
                    Banks. There are also eight registered loan-societies.</p>
                <p>As every settler placed here by James I. was bound by the conditions of his
                    grant, if he held upwards of 1000 acres, to erect a castle with a bawn or
                    fortified enclosure, numerous large buildings were raised, of a mixed character
                    between the feudal fortress and the modern mansion, several of which are still
                    the residences of the representatives or successors of the original grantees.
                    Besides these there are many elegant modern mansions and villas of the landed
                    gentry. The Imuses of the more substantial farmers are of stone, generally well
                    built and slated; the habitations of the peasantry very poor, owing partly to
                    the want of timber, partly to the poverty of the inmates. Turf is the general
                    fuel, except in the immediate vicinity of the collieries. The food of the poorer
                    classes is potatoes and oatmeal, with milk and salt fish occasionally;
                    flesh-meat is used only on festal occasions. In their dress, customs, and
                    dispositions, they vary little from those of similar station throughout the
                    province. Irish is scarcely spoken except in the retired mountain-districts.</p>
                <p>A singular mode of medical treatment is practised in some parts. A kind of rude
                    cell is scooped out of the side of a hill or bank, and closed in the front with
                    wicker-work or clay, leaving only a small opening for the entrance. the interior
                    being heated with charred turf, the patient is laid down in it, and the door
                    being closed up so as to prevent the admission of air, he is suffered to remain
                    thereuntil the action of the heat is supposed to have produced the desired
                    effect. This system is used in all complaints, but chiefly in rheumatic
                    affections, which are very prevalent. The poorer classes are much addicted to
                    superstitious practices: they stand in great age of fairies, or, as they call
                    them, “the wee people and still adhere to the custom of driving their cattle
                    round fires lighted at midsummer. An antique bell, found among the ruins of a
                    church, and known by the name of the Clogh of Termon, is used as a test to swear
                    upon; and the donach, a box or casket containing some relics, is employed for
                    the same purpose.</p>
                <p>There are many remains of raths and Danish forts, several in a state of good
                    preservation; but their number is yearly diminishing, by their being dug up and
                    carried away for farming uses. Several fine monuments described as Druidical are
                    to be seen. A very large cromlech rests on a hill near Newtown-Stewart; another
                    is near Coagh. Some remains of a round tower were visible at Errigal-keroge in
                    the beginning of the present century, but no trace of it now exists. Near
                    Dungannon is an ancient relic, consisting of two circles marked by upright
                    stones, and connected together in the shape of the figure 8. Several brazen
                    trumpets of singular construction were discovered about a century ago near the
                    same town. The remains of monastic buildings and of ancient castles are
                    numerous. Among the most remarkable of the latter is that at Benburb, near which
                    was one of the ancient residences of the O’Neills.</p>
                <p>The population is chiefly rural. The largest town does not contain 6000
                    inhabitants, and there are but nine containing a population which exceeds 1060.
                    The county town is Omagh, nearly in its centre, on the Drumragh water or
                    Stroule, a branch of the Foyle. This town was twice destroyed by fire; the first
                    time in 1689, by the garrison placed in it by King James, in order to render it
                    useless to the enemy when they evacuated it; afterwards in 1743, by an
                    accidental fire, which left but two houses standing. Like most other places that
                    have suffered by such a cala mity, it rose much improved from its ashes, and is
                    now remarkable for its general neatness, and the elegance of some of its
                    buildings, particularly the court-house. The other public buildings are, the
                    parish-church, with a lofty tower and spire, the Roman Catholic chapel, four
                    dissenting chapels, the county -prison and infirmary, and a barrack. Omagh has
                    some trade, and is one of the markets for brown linens.. The population is 2211.
                    Strabane, on the Moume, near its confluence with the Finn, is the largest and
                    most improving town in the county. Its situation is very picturesque; the
                    natural beauties of its site being heightened by the numerous orchards and
                    fruit-gardens in which it is embosomed. Its public buildings arc, the parochial
                    church, a Roman Catholic chapel, and four dissenting places of worship. It is a
                    chartered borough, but the corporation is little regarded since it lost by the
                    union its right of representation. Its only corporate property are the town
                    tolls and customs. It carries on a brisk trade in grain and provisions, which is
                    greatly promoted by a canal, three miles long, to Leck, on the Foyle, and
                    navigable for barges of forty tons. The linen manufacture, after having been
                    carried on here to a large extent, gave way to that of cotton, which has also
                    declined. The present thriving state of the place is owing to its general trade,
                    and its position as a mart for receiving the agricultural produce of the
                    interior and transmitting it to Londonderry: it also enjoys the advantage of a
                    profitable fishery. The population is 5457. Dungannon, three miles west of the
                    south-west extremity of Lough Neagh, was the principal residence of O’Neill, the
                    head of the family, who here erected a large castle, which he afterwards burned,
                    together with the town, when driven from it by Lord Mountjoy. The castle was
                    rebuilt after the restoration, and the town much improved. Its public buildings
                    are, the parish church, a Roman Catholic chapel, several dissenting places of
                    worship, and one of the royal schools endowed by James I. The linen manufacture
                    is still carried on with great spirit; and there are several bleach-greens in
                    the neighbourhood. It has also manufactories of earthenware, fire-bricks, iron,
                    and flour. It returns a member to the imperial parliament, for which purpose a
                    new and more limited boundary has been laid down, comprehending but 224 acres
                    out of 830, which is its extent for other municipal purposes. The population is
                    3515. Cookstown, on the road from Dungannon to Coleraine, has also a respectable
                    share of the linen manufacture, chiefly for the supply of the English market.
                    Its population is 2883. The other towns whose population exceeds 1000 souls each
                    are, Auch-nacloy, 1742; Newtown-Stewart, 1737; Fintona, 1714; Caledon, 1079; and
                    Stewartstown, 1010. Clogber, where stood the cathedral of the diocese of the
                    same name, a building of small dimensions and few architectural pretensions,
                    though dignified with the title of city, from the circumstance of its being the
                    seat of a bishop, is but a village, with a population of 523 inhabitants, who
                    chiefly derive their subsistence from the expenditure of the family and
                    dependents of the bishop, whose palace and demesne arc in its vicinity. (<hi
