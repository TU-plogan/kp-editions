                <p><label type="entry">TENNANT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Smithson</hi></label>, a
                    distinguished chemist, born at Selby in Yorkshire, 30th November 1761, was the
                    only child of the Rev. Calvert Tennant, younger son of a respectable family in
                    Wensley Dale, near Richmond, and vicar of Selby. His mother was Mary Daunt,
                    daughter of a surgeon of that town. His father had been a fellow of St John’s
                    College, Cambridge, and began to teach his son Greek when he was only five years
                    old. He had the misfortune to lose him four years after; and before he grew up,
                    his mother also, while he was riding with her, was thrown from her horse and
                    killed on the spot. He was sent, after his father’s death, to different schools,
                    at Scerton, Tadcaster, and Beverley. In these he was remembered as a boy retired
                    in his manners, and somewhat melancholy, and indolent with respect to puerile
                    amusements. He learned but little at school, and may be considered as in a great
                    measure self-educated; having been fond, almost as a child, of reading books of
                    science, and of amusing himself with little experiments which he found described
                    in them; and while he was at school at Tadcaster, he took great delight in
                    attending a course of Walker’s lectures on experimental philosophy which were
                    given there. At Beverley he was under the care of Dr G. Croft, who had made
                    himself known to the public by some controversial writings. Here he never
                    entered much into the pursuits of his contemporaries, but profited by a good
                    library belonging to the school; and among other books which he read with
                    avidity was Sir Isaac Newton’s Treatise on Optics.</p>
                <p>He had entertained a great desire to complete his chemical studies under the
                    immediate instruction of Dr Priestley, who was then enjoying deserved reputation
                    for his recent experimental discoveries; but Dr Priestley’s occupations did not
                    permit him to undertake the task of directing his education, however agreeable
                    it might have been to him to have assisted such a pupil. In the mean time he had
                    not neglected his classics, but had acquired a sufficient knowledge of the
                    learned languages to appreciate with <pb break="no"

                    />correct taste the beauties of the great writers of antiquity. Notwithstanding
                    his admiration for Dr Priestley, he was an early convert to the antiphlogistic
                    theory of chemistry; which, with all its errors, was still a material step in
                    the advancement of science.</p>
                <p>In 1781 he went to Edinburgh, with the view of ouali-fying himself for the
                    profession of physic, and he had the advantage of attending Dr Black’s lectures,
                    which were then in great reputation. In October 1782, he entered as a pensioner
                    of Christ’s College, Cambridge, where he became intimately acquainted with the
                    late Professor Harwood, who had been first a surgeon in India, but having lost,
                    by the misconduct of an agent, the fortune which he had there acquired,
                    submitted cheerfully to the toil of recommencing his career as a physician,
                    though already past the middle age. His talents for conversation were such as
                    were extremely likely to captivate a young man of superior discernment; and he
                    formed a friendship with Tennant which continued uninterrupted throughout their
                    lives. At Cambridge he studied a little of the mathematics in the works of
                    Newton, but much more of chemistry and botany: he already began to exercise his
                    inventive powers in an attempt to economize the consumption of fuel in
                    distillation, which he did not make public until twenty years after, though he
                    mentioned it at the time to some of his friends. He also occupied himself
                    incessantly in general, and especially in political reading, though he was far
                    from having the air of a student; but his rooms were always in confusion, from
                    the mixture of heterogeneous materials that were accumulated in them. His
                    residence at Cambridge was perhaps the happiest time of his life; his spirits
                    unwearied, his health unbroken, his feelings acute, and his conversation
                    brilliant though simple and unaffected.</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1784 he paid a visit to Denmark, to Sweden, and to Scheele,
                    whose acquaintance extremely delighted him, and most of all from the simplicity
                    of the apparatus that he employed in his researches. A year or two afterwards he
                    went to France, and being taken ill at Paris, he was joined there by his friend
                    Harwood, with whom he returned through Holland and the Netherlands, at the time
                    when the bigoted people of the Low Countries were in insurrection against a
                    philosophical despot, while Holland remained free and prosperous.</p>
                <p>He was particularly intimate with Dr Milner, the master of Queen’s College, and
                    was recommended by his signature, together with those of Waring, Maskelyne,
                    Jebb, and Watson, as a fellow of the Royal Society, into which he was admitted
                    in January 1785. He removed, together with his friend Harwood, in December 1786,
                    from Christ’s College to Emanuel, and in 1788 he took the degree of bachelor of
                    physic. In 1791 he communicated to the Royal Society his very interesting
                    discovery of a mode of obtaining carbon from the carbonic acid. Having observed
                    that charcoal did not decompose the phosphate of lime, he concluded that
                    phosphorus ought to decompose the carbonate of lime; and the result fully
                    justified his manner of reasoning.</p>
                <p>He paid a third visit to the Continent in 1792, intending to pass through France
                    into Italy, and arrived at Paris not long before the 10th of August; but he saw
                    some indications of an impending convulsion, and was fortunate enough to quit
                    Paris on the 9th. He visited Gibbon at Lausanne, and was much interested in the
                    sagacity which this eminent writer displayed in his conversation. He proceeded
                    to Rome and Florence, where he was fully impressed with all the admiration that
                    he had been taught to anticipate for the treasures of ancient and modern art
                    possessed by those cities; and in his return through Germany, he was greatly
                    amused by the mixture of knowledge and credulity which he observed among the
                    studious of that country. At Paris in 1793 he found every thing enveloped in
                    gloom and overwhelmed with terror. His friend Lametherie was alarmed by the
                    visit which he paid him; but he had the integrity to preserve for him entire
                    some property of considerable value, with which he had intrusted him.</p>
                <p>Upon his arrival in London. Mr Tennant took chambers in the Temple, and was in
                    the habit of living much with some of his early acquaintance, who had adopted
                    the law as their profession; to his own he was in great measure indifferent,
                    neither seeking to practise it, nor being well calculated to succeed greatly in
                    it with the public, though he studied it with attention, and took pains to make
                    himself master of its history and philosophy, being a particular admirer of
                    Sydenham, when considered in relation to the age in which he lived. He took his
                    degree of doctor of physic in 1796; and in the same year he gave the Royal
                    Society a paper on the quantity of carbonic acid afforded by the diamond, which
                    he measured by heating it with nitre, and obtaining a precipitate by the
                    addition of muriate of lime; and he found that the diamond afforded no more
                    carbonic acid than an equal weight of charcoal. A subsequent communication
                    contained the result of his observations on the action of heated nitre on gold
                    and platina.</p>
                <p>The love of travelling appeared to be his predominant passion. In his travels, he
                    studied not only the natural and political history of the countries which he
                    saw, but also their languages, and the philosophy of their etymologies. He
                    likewise observed the peculiarities of their agriculture; and, in 1797, he
                    determined, after visiting an agricultural friend in Lincolnshire, to devote his
                    attention to practical farming as a serious pursuit. He purchased some
                    allotments of unenclosed land in that neighbourhood, but he left the management
                    of them chiefly to his friend, and afterwards made considerable additions to the
                    property by further purchases. In 1798 or 1799, he bought a tract of newly
                    enclosed land on the Mendip Hills, near Chedder, where he built a house, and
                    resided for some months every summer through the remainder of his life. These
                    speculations, though their results were at first doubtful, yet succeeded
                    remarkably well on the whole; more especially considering the benefit which his
                    health derived from the travelling and the exercise that they rendered
                    necessary; but they occupied too much of his attention, and of that time which
                    might have been employed so much more to the advantage of the public, and to his
                    own ultimate satisfaction.</p>
                <p>In 1799 he gave the Royal Society a paper on the magnesian limestone, or
                    dolomite, which he considers as rather a combination than an accidental mixture;
                    and the forms of the crystals, as they have been determined by later observers,
                    together with the laws of definite proportions, have tended to confirm this
                    conjecture. He found that grain will scarcely germinate, and soon perishes, when
                    sown in the neutral carbonate of magnesia. In 1802 he published his paper on
                    emery, which he showed to be a substance similar to the corundum or adamantine
                    spar of China, and not an ore of iron, as had been commonly supposed. In the
                    month of July he was making some experiments on crude platina, when he
                    discovered in it a singular dark powder, which was left undissolved by the
                    nitro-muriatic acid, and which was also observed the next year by Messrs
                    Descotils and Vauquelin. In 1804 Dr Tennant showed that the powder contained two
                    new metals, which he named <hi rend="italic">iridium</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >osmium;</hi> and he received the Copleian medal from the Royal Society in
                    November, as an acknowledgment of the merit of his various chemical discoveries.
                    In 1805 and 1806 he paid two successive visits to Ireland, by way of Scotland,
                    one of them in company with Browne the traveller, for whom he had a high esteem,
                    and to whom he suggested the observation of the temperature of boiling water as
                    a mode of determining the heights of mountains; a method, however, which bad
                    been long before recommended by Achard and others.</p>

                <p>He became latterly more fond of general society than he had been in his earlier
                    years, and he used to receive miscellaneous parties at his chambers, and to show
                    them prints, and minerals, and novelties of various kinds. In 1812 he was
                    persuaded to convert these mixed exhibitions into a more regular course of
                    lectures, principally upon mineralogy, calculated especially for the ladies of
                    his acquaintance, and which highly delighted all his audience: “Their attention
                    was perpetually kept alive by the spirit and variety with which every topic was
                    discussed, by anecdotes and quotations happily introduced, by the ornaments of a
                    powerful but chastised imagination, and, above all, by a peculiar vein of
                    pleasantry, at once original and delicate, with which he could animate and
                    embellish the most unpromising subjects;" a circumstance which, though not of
                    much immediate importance to the public, yet probably led him the more readily
                    to accept the professorship at Cambridge, and would thus, if he had survived
                    longer, have greatly extended the sphere of his utility.</p>
                <p>In 1813 he delivered a lecture on mineralogy to the Geological Society, and gave
                    them also an account of his analysis of a volcanic substance from the Lipari
                    Islands, containing the boracic acid, which has since been examined on the spot
                    by Dr Holland. In the month of May he was elected professor of chemistry in the
                    university of Cambridge, all opposition having been withdrawn before the
                    election. The following spring he gave his first and last course of lectures
                    there. His introductory lecture still exists in manuscript, and is said to
                    contain a masterly sketch of the history of the science. He communicated to the
                    Royal Society, in 1814, a paper on the easiest mode of procuring potassium, and
                    another on the economy of heat in distillation, proposing to heat a second
                    boiler by the condensation of the steam of the first. In the spring and summer
                    of this year he was occupied in searching for the origin of iodine, and he
                    succeeded in detecting this substance in sea-water, by the test of its
                    tarnishing the surface of leaf silver. One of the last services that he rendered
                    the Royal Society, was in the capacity of a member of a committee which was
                    formed in order to investigate, at the request of the government, the degree of
                    danger that might attend the general introduction of gas-lights into the
                    metropolis. He undertook, together with his friend Dr Wollaston, to make some
                    experiments upon the inflammation of the gas, and they discovered conjointly the
                    very important fact, that the gas contained in a small tube will not communicate
                    the flame; a fact which, in the hands of Sir Humphry Davy, has been rendered
                    productive of consequences so important to the public safety; although Sir
                    Humphry having been abroad at the time of this investigation, and the report of
                    the committee not having been then published, he had to rediscover this truth,
                    and many more, in his most ingenious and successful researches.</p>
                <p>It was early in the month of September that Dr Tennant went for the last time to
                    France, being impatient to observe the changes which an eventful interval of
                    twenty years had produced in that highly interesting country. He was greatly
                    delighted with Lyon and Marseille; and, returning to Paris in November, he
                    lingered there till February 1815. On the 15th of that month he arrived at
                    Calais; on the 20th he went to Boulogne with Baron Bulow, in order to embark
                    there. They did embark on the 22d, but were forced back by the wind, and meant
                    to try again in the evening. In the mean time they took horses and went to see
                    Bonaparte’s Pillar, about <hi rend="italic">a</hi> league off; and going off the
                    road on their return, to look at a small fort, of which the drawbridge wanted a
                    bolt, they were both thrown, with their horses, into the ditch. Bulow was only
                    stunned, but Tennant’s skull was so severely fractured, that he died an hour
                    after.</p>
                <p>His papers published in the Philosophical Transactions were eight in number. 1.
                    On the Decomposition of Fixed Air, 1791, p. 182. 2. On the Nature of the

                <p>Dr Tennant was tall and slight in his person; his face was thin and his
                    complexion light; he resembled a little the portraits of Locke; he was generally
                    negligent in his dress, but, on the whole, agreeable in his appearance. He was
                    distinguished for good sense, for quickness of perception, and for penetration;
                    but, as his friend and biographer Mr Whishaw observes, in the admirably
                    energetic sketch which he has given of his character, he was one of those who,
                    to use the words of Dr Johnson, “without much labour have obtained a high
                    reputation, and are mentioned with reverence rather for the possession than the
                    exertion of uncommon abilities.” “His curiosity and activity were incessant; he
                    hail a vigilance of observation which suffered nothing to escape him, and was
                    continually gaining new information from a variety of interesting sources. But
                    although the knowledge thus acquired was remarkable for its correctness, and
                    complete for the purposes of its possessor, yet the industry and perseverance,
                    by which it ought to have been embodied and made permanent for the benefit of
                    others, were too often altogether wanting. The ardour and energy of Dr Tennant’s
                    mind co-operated unfortunately, in this respect, with his want of method and of
                    systematic habits of application; since he was constantly pressing on to new
                    discoveries, instead of arranging and bringing to perfection those which he had
                    already made. His memory was a great storehouse of discoveries, and hints for
                    discovery, of ascertained facts, probable conjectures, and ingenious trains of
                    reasoning relative to the various important subjects upon which he had at any
                    time been engaged. These he was continually treasuring up, with the intention of
                    reducing them to order, and preparing them for use at a more convenient season.
                    But that period rarely arrived. In the carelessness of intellectual wealth, he
                    neglected those stores of knowledge which he had accumulated, and suffered them
                    to remain useless and unproductive, till his attention was recalled to them,
                    perhaps after a long course of years, by some new fact or discovery, some remark
                    in conversation, or other accidental occurrence.”</p>
                <p>The effect of his peculiar cast of humour was heightened by a perfect gravity of
                    countenance, a quiet familiar manner, and a characteristic simplicity of
                    language. He was firmly attached to the general principles of freedom, being
                    fully convinced “of their influence in promoting the wealth and happiness of
                    nations; a due regard to these principles he considered as the only solid
                    foundation of the most important blessings of social life, and as the peculiar
                    cause of that distinguished superiority which our own country so happily enjoys
                    among the nations of Europe.” “The cheerful activity of a populous town, the
                    improvements in the steam-engine, the great Galvanic experiments, and above all
                    the novelty and extent of the prospects afforded by that revolution in chemical
                    science which has illustrated our own age and country; these magnificent
                    objects, when presented to Dr Tennant’s mind, excited in him the liveliest
                    emotions, and called for the most animated expressions of admiration and
                    delight.” “He thought himself passionate and irascible; and certainly his
                    feelings were quick, but <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=200" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0200-0182"
                    />they were transitory.” He possessed a strong sense of high honour, as well as
                    of duty; and his liberality and humanity were evinced by some practical
                    occurrences in which he had occasion to exercise them: his steward had defrauded
                    him, and when the day of reckoning came, had destroyed himself: he not only
                    forgave the debt, but provided also for the widow and her family.</p>
                <p>“His amiable temper and unaffected desire of giving pleasure, no less than his
                    superior knowledge and talents, had rendered him highly acceptable to a numerous
                    and distinguished circle of society, by whom he was justly valued, and by whom
                    his premature death was sincerely lamented. But the real extent of his private
                    worth, the genuine simplicity and virtuous independence of his character, and
                    the sincerity, warmth, and constancy of his friendship, can only be felt and
                    estimated by those to whom he was long and intimately known, and to whom the
                    recollection of his talents and virtues must always remain a pleasing though
                    melancholy bond of union.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
