                <p><label type="entry">TIPPERARY</label>, an inland county in the province of
                    Munster, in Ireland, is bounded on the north by Galway and King’s counties; on
                    the east by King’s, Queen's, and Kilkenny; on the south by Waterford and Cork;
                    and on the west by Cork, Limerick, and Clare. It extends from 52° 11’ to 53° 10'
                    north latitude, and from 7° 23’ to 8° 25’ west longitude; being about seventy
                    miles in its greatest length, on a meridional line, from the confluence of the
                    Lesser Brosna and Shannon, north, to the Knockmeledown Mountains, south, and
                    forty miles from O’Brien’s Bridge, on the Shannon, west, to Urlingford, east,
                    and comprehending an area of 1583 square miles, or 1,013,173 acres, of which
                    819,618 are cultivated, 182.147 mountain and bog, and 11,328 under water. It
                    ranks as the sixth county in Ireland as to its total extent, and the fourth as
                    to its extent of cultivated land.</p>
                <p>According to the statement of Ptolemy, this district was inhabited in the second
                    century by the tribes of the Darini and Coriundi, but Whitaker attributes it to
                    the Scoti. It was afterwards possessed by various native septs, the principal of
                    which were those of O’Kennedy, O’Mulrian, O’Fogarty, O’Heffernan, O’Hickey,
                    M‘Egan, Everard, <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=333"

                    it was granted by Henry 1I., who obtained possession of it after several
                    sanguinary contests, to Theobald Fitz-Walter, surnamed Butler, from the office
                    which he held in the king’s household. It was reduced to the form of an English
                    county by King John in 1210, and in 1328 Edward III. erected it into a county
                    palatine, in favour of the first earl of Ormond; and though that king shortly
                    after re-assumed the regal prerogatives, they were regranted in 1337, and in
                    1372 confirmed, to James the son of Theobald, and his heirs male for ever. This
                    grant affected only the lay lands of the county, those belonging to the church
                    being a separate jurisdiction, with its own courts and officers, under the name
                    of the county of the Cross of Tipperary. The county continued to be thus divided
                    both in fact and name until after the restoration, when the grant of the
                    regalities was not only confirmed to the duke of Ormond by Charles II., but
                    extended over the whole of the county. The jurisdiction continued in the family
                    till the attainder of the last duke of Ormond, in consequence of which the whole
                    of the ducal property reverted to the crown, the palatinal rights were
                    abolished, and the records belonging to it deposited in the king’s courts of
                    chancery and common pleas, where they still remain. The county suffered greatly
                    during the civil wars of 1641, in the course of which the town of Clonmell,
                    after a gallant resistance, obtained honourable terms from Cromwell, who
                    conducted the siege in person.</p>
                <p>The surface is much varied. To the south it. rises into the range of the
                    Knockmeledown Mountains, the highest summit of which is 2698 feet above sea
                    level. North of these are the Galtees, the highest of which, Galtymore, rises to
                    an elevation of 3008 feet. Proceeding still farther north, are the
                    Slievenamanagh Mountains, 2582 feet high: the Keeper, 2265; Arragh, 1558; and a
                    portion of the Devil’s Bit, 1572; the remainder of which last-named range
                    extends north-easterly, forming the line of demarcation between King’s and
                    Queen’s counties. The rest of the county presents an undulating surface, seldom
                    perfectly level, and in some parts rising into hills of some elevation, the most
                    considerable of which are the Slieveardagh Hills, bordering Kilkenny county, and
                    Slievenamuck, near the base of which the town of Tipperary is situate. The only
                    large river that passes through the county is the Suir, which has its source in
                    the last-named range of mountains, near Roscrea, and after flowing in a southern
                    direction, by Templemore, Thurles. and Cahir, to Ardfinnan, takes a western
                    course by Clonmell, and, passing through Carrick-on-Snir, enters the county of
                    Waterford, and discharges itself into the Atlantic through the estuary of
                    Waterford harbour. The Shannon forms part of the western boundary of the county,
                    from its most northern point, at the junction of this river with the Lesser
                    Brosna, through its expansion called Lough Derg, and thence to O’Brien’s Bridge.
                    The Lesser Brosna is the northern boundary from Parsonstown to the Shannon, and
                    the Nore traverses a small portion of the north-east of the county. There are no
                    lakes of any extent; three of small size, worthy of notice chiefly from their
                    shape and romantic position, he in the glens of the Galtees.</p>
                <p>The mountains are mostly composed of clay-slate, surrounded by sandstone; those
                    of Knockmeledown are also capped with horizontal strata of this latter mineral.
                    The part of the Devil’s Bit range which projects into the county is wholly
                    sandstone, as are also the groups of the Galtees and Slievenamuck. The beds of
                    the latter range horizontally, so as to furnish large quantities of excellent
                    flags from the quarries there. Slates of good quality are raised in the district
                    adjoining the southern extremity of Lough Derg, and carried in large quantities
                    to various distant places by the Shannon navigation. There is also a very
                    extensive and valuable slate-quarry near Clonmell, which enjoys equal facilities
                    of transport by the Suir. In the east of the county, from Killenaub eastward, is
                    a coal-field, generally considered to be an offset or continuation of that in
                    Kilkenny and Queen’s counties. The seams, which lie between strata of sandstone
                    and shale, are in some cases single, in others double, and even treble. The
                    thickness of those in the Coal-brook mines, which have been long worked, is from
                    one to two feet. The produce of these works consists of one fourth coal and
                    three fourths culm. The former is in considerable demand for manufacturing
                    purposes, being highly esteemed on account of the large portion of pure carbon
                    contained in it; the latter is equally so for making lime, and is also used for
                    culinary purposes when wrought up into balls with clay. Ironstone, though found
                    in large quantities in the Coalbrook works, is not applied to any profitable
                    account. The village of Silvermines, on the northern side of the Keeper
                    Mountains, derives its name from the mines of silver in its neighbourhood, which
                    at a former period had been largely worked, as were copper-mines in the same
                    neighbourhood; but both have been relinquished. Copper was also raised at
                    Lacka-more, near Newport, but with a similar result. Zinc, manganese, malachite,
                    galena, and white lead, have been found in various places. The natural caves
                    discovered in 1833 in a low limestone hill, near the southern base of the Galtee
                    Mountains, and about midway between Cahir and Mitchels-town, present a peculiar
                    feature in the geology of the county. They are entered by a passage sloping
                    downwards, about 200 feet in length, which opens into a subterraneous chamber
                    nearly eighty feet long and upwards of thirty at its greatest height; whence
                    proceed other passages communicating with a number of interior caves of various
                    sises, that have obtained names chiefly from their discoverers, or from some
                    peculiar resemblance, whether real or fanciful, to objects of general notoriety.
                    Their roofs, sides, and floors are adorned with a great variety of stalactites
                    of singular appearance, and in some parts there are small reservoirs of the
                    purest water. The number of these apartments has not yet been accurately
                    ascertained; nor has a detailed geological account of the interior yet appeared.
                    They are generally known by the name of the Mitchelstown caves from their
                    vicinity to that town, and are objects of much care to Lord Kingsborough, on
                    whose estate they were discovered. The level part of the county is chiefly
                    limestone, constituting one extremity of the great field of that formation,
                    which spreads over all the central portion of Ireland. Its most striking
                    peculiarity is the rock of Cashel, consisting of a mass of limestone arranged in
                    concentric strata, rising precipitously from the surrounding plain.</p>
                <p>The soil in the plain country, and in the extended valleys, is a rich calcareous
                    loam, capable of producing the finest crops with little aid from human industry.
                    The town of Tipperary forms the centre of a tract of flat country lying between
                    the Galtee and Slievenamanagh ranges, and extending from the county of Limerick
                    westward to Golden and the Slieveardagh Hills in the opposite direction, which,
                    from its extraordinary fertility, has been called the Golden Vale. Another tract
                    of similar character, but not so extensive, lies in the northern baronies of
                    Ormond. The soil on the hills and mountain sides is light and poor, partaking
                    much of the character of the substrata of clay-slate and sandstone on which it
                    rests. The southern extremity of the great Bog of Allen spreads itself into this
                    county in its north-eastern quarter, from Roscrea to Holycross, not however in
                    one continuous sheet, but in detached portions. It appears to have owed its
                    origin to the obstructions in the channel of the Nore, a small portion of which
                    skirts the county here. The whole of these detached portions of be; contains
                    35,000 acres, the most elevated part of their surface being about 400 feet above
                    the sea, and therefore perfectly capable of drainage. The timber found here is
                    chiefly fir. yew, and oak, the latter perfectly black, from the action of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=334"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0334-0314"/> the iron in the bog-water, or the gallic acid in
                    the tree. The substratum is universally limestone or gravel. In one of these
                    bogs three growths of timber have been found lying under one another; the upper
                    about five feet from the surface, the middle about two feet lower, and the
                    third, which is always in a more or less decomposed state, near the gravelly
                    bottom. The land in the neighbourhood of the bog tract is generally swampy,
                    producing little but reeds and other aquatic vegetables. The sides of the
                    valleys, watered by the streams that pass through the bog and marshes, throw up
                    a good herbage without any artificial aid, except that of setting fire to the
                    surface in the heat of summer. The heath and moss are thus destroyed, and scope
                    is given to a spontaneous growth of grass, on which cattle feed eagerly in all
                    seasons, bat chiefly in summer, the cool and moist sward being peculiarly
                    grateful to their feet. Several tracts near the margin of the bog have been
                    reclaimed, and the process is extending, although slowly, owing to the
                    obstructions arising from individual interests, to a general and effective
                    system of drainage. There is little, if any, native timber; but plantations,
                    sometimes very extensive, are to be seen around all the gentlemen’s seats and
                    the residences of the wealthier farmers. The growth of timber thus raised is as
                    yet by no means sufficient to remove the appearance of bareness which the
                    landscape, otherwise abounding in natural beauties, exhibits.</p>
                <p>The progressive increase of the number of inhabitants appears from the following
                    table of the population as taken at different periods.</p>
                <p>Year. Authority. No,</p>
                <p>1760 De Burgo 101,370</p>

                <p>1821 Ditto 346,896</p>
                <p>1831 Ditto 402,538</p>
                <p>According to the latest of these returns, the population is to the entire surface
                    as 1 to 2∙517, and to that of the number of cultivated acres as 1 to 2∙036.
                    There is therefore a family of six individuals to every fifteen acres of the
                    total surface, and to every twelve acres of cultivated land. According to the
                    census taken by the commissioners of public instruction in 1834, which being
                    calculated by dioceses, allows only an approximation to accuracy as compared
                    with those calculated by counties, the total population amounted, in round
                    numbers, to 413,000, of which 16,840 were of the established church, 660
                    Protestant dissenters, and the remaining 395,500 were Roman Catholics, who were
                    then to the total Protestant population as twenty-three to one. The number of
                    children receiving instruction in the public schools, according to returns made
                    under the population act in 1821, the commission of education in 1824·6, and the
                    latest return of the commission of national education, was,</p>

                <p>1837 3,694 2,588 6,282</p>
                <p>The return of 1824·6 is the only one in which the religious persuasion of the
                    pupils is noticed. According to it the numbers were, members of the established
                    church 2871, Protestant dissenters eighty-four, Roman Catholics 30,407, religion
                    not ascertained 314, which gives an average of thirty Roman Catholics to one
                    Protestant. In the same return the total number of schools is stated to be 657,
                    of which forty-three, affording instruction to 2747 pupils, were maintained
                    wholly by grants of public money; seventy-one, with 5256 pupils, by voluntary
                    subscriptions; and the remaining 543, with 25,673 pupils, wholly by the fees of
                    the pupils.</p>
                <p>The county is divided into the eleven baronies of Clan william, Eliogarty, Iffa
                    and Offa East, Iffa and Offa West, Ikerrin, Kilnemanagh, Middlethird, Lower
                    Ormond, Upper Ormond, and Slieveardagh, which are subdivided into 189 parishes,
                    of which ninety-six were in the diocese of Cashel, twenty in that of Emly,
                    thirty-two in Lismore, and forty-one in Killaloe. The cathedrals of the dioceses
                    of Cashel and Emly are both within the county, in places from which the sees
                    have received their names. The former, which retains the rank of a city, is
                    still a place of some note; the latter, though said to be the ancient Imlagh,
                    noted by Ptolemy as one of the three principal cities in the island, is now an
                    inconsiderable village, with a population of 701 souls. Under a late order of
                    council, the county has been divided into two ridings. It returned eight members
                    to the Irish parliament, two for the county, and two for each of the boroughs of
                    Cashel, Clonmell, and Fethard. The number was reduced to four by the act of
                    union, which disfranchised the last-named borough, and deprived each of the
                    others of one of its members. The constituency of the county, at several periods
                    since the disfranchisement of the forty-shilling freeholders in 1829, is as

                <p>The local government is under the control of a lord lieutenant, twenty-eight
                    deputy-lieutenants, and 118 other magistrates, besides eight stipendiaries
                    specially appointed, and receiving salaries from the crown; under whom is a
                    constabulary force, which in 1836 consisted of twelve chief constables and 686
                    constables and subconstables, and, since the division of the county, of one
                    county inspector, six sub-inspectors, seven head constables, and 351 constables
                    and subconstables for the north riding, and one county inspector, seven
                    subinspectors, ten head constables, and 391 constables and subconstables for the
                    south. The county prison, at Clonmell, is ill adapted for carrying into effect
                    the improvements now generally introduced into the prisons of Ireland. A prison
                    for the north riding is at present building in Nenagh. The number of committals
                    in 1839 was 2110, of whom 1164 were acquitted or liberated for want of
                    prosecution, and 946 were convicted. Of this latter class, 256 were fined or
                    liberated on securities, 608 imprisoned, seventy-three transported, and nine
                    sentenced to death, of whom four were executed. Besides the convictions above
                    stated, 583 were convicted before the magistrates at petty sessions for trivial
                    offences, and 3889 for intoxication. The total number of convictions is to the
                    population as one to sixty-three, and of convictions for capital or
                    transportable offences as 1 to 5037. The county infirmary, fever hospital, and
                    lunatic asylum, are also in Clonmell. The last-named institution maintains
                    ninety-nine patients, fifty-five male and forty-one female. Of the cases there
                    are, idiots four, epileptic one, curable maniacs sixty, incurable thirty-one;
                    besides which there are in the Clonmell house of industry nineteen cases of
                    idiocy and seven of epilepsy. The sites of the work-houses under the new
                    poor-law act have been fixed at Carrick-on-Suir, Cashel, Clogheen, Clonmell,
                    Nenagh, Roscrea, Thurles, and Tipperary.</p>
                <p>The modes of agriculture are regulated by the character of the soil and the face
                    of the country. Tillage prevails in the lowland districts, and is carried on
                    with much spirit, and in general according to the most modern systems. The size
                    of the farms is generally small, averaging at about fifty acres, and in many
                    instances diminishing to eight or ten, in consequence of the subdivision of land
                    among the under tenants. The rotation adopted on the rich lands in the Golden
                    Vale, and in the almost equally fertile districts in the northern parts of the
                    county, is, potatoes, wheat, and oats; in the lighter soils, as on the
                    Slieveardagh Hills, and the mountain sides, on which the use of the plough is
                    yearly <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=335"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0335-0315"/>encroaching on the ancient pasturages, as far up
                    as the nature of the soil favours the exertion of agricultural industry, the
                    crops are potatoes, barley or bere, and oats. In too many instances the
                    repetition of the oat crop is continued until the land is completely exhausted,
                    when it is allowed to rest until the renovating powers of nature clothe it with
                    a new sward. Artificial grasses are much encouraged; clover of both kinds, rye
                    and other grass-seeds, are sown, as are rape, vetches, and turnips. Flax is
                    seldom to be seen but in detached patches, or along the head-lands of the
                    corn-fields. Lime, and limestone gravel, the latter taken from the escars in the
                    eastern parts of the county, are the principal manures. The fences are
                    stone-walls, or mounds of earth eight or ten feet broad at the base, and
                    tapering upwards to a considerable height, with a topping of furze or
                    whitethorn. The latter plant is also employed as a ground fence in the
                    best-regulated estates. Owing to the undulating character of the surface,
                    drainage is less necessary. Where it is adopted, and especially in the pasture
                    lands, a covered drain is used, which is so narrow, and sunk so low, as not to
                    be injured by the pressure of the feet of the cattle on the surface sod.
                    Agricultural instruments of the most approved construction are in use among the
                    better classes of farmers, and machines for the abridgement of human labour arc
                    employed in many places. The rich low lands along the banks of the river are
                    generally under meadow, and produce abundant crops of hay. The lands
                    appropriated to pasture are used both as grazing and dairy farms. Butter, which
                    is made to a great extent, finds a ready market at Clonmell, Waterford, and
                    Limerick. The manufacture of cheese is almost unknown. The breed of Irish cows
                    is still kept up, in consequence of the quantity of milk which they yield. They
                    are sometimes reared without any mixture of other breeds, sometimes with a cross
                    of the Holderness or Devon. The horses bred in the county are highly esteemed,
                    and bring good prices. For agricultural purposes, asses and mules are much used
                    by the small farmers, as being more hardy, and thriving on coarser food. The
                    former of these are of larger size than those in other parts of the country.
                    Swine are to be met with everywhere; they form an important part of the farming
                    stock of the landholders, from the highest to the lowest, and are exported in
                    great numbers to England. Sheep are less numerous, either because the quality of
                    the soil is not well suited to them, or because the subdivision of the lands
                    into small fields, and the want of substantial fences in the smaller farms,
                    prevent their being much encouraged. Though a great deal has been latterly
                    effected in the way of agricultural improvement in both its main branches of
                    tillage and pasturage, much more is still required in order to draw forth all
                    the capabilities with which the bountiful hand of nature has enriched this
                    tract.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of woollen cloth was formerly carried on to a great extent,
                    particularly in the neighbourhood of Clonmell and Carrick, which were the two
                    principal marts of the trade; but in consequence of the legislative arrangements
                    made after the revolution, for the suppression of that branch of national
                    industry in Ireland, it has declined so as now to be nearly extinct; a small
                    trade in blankets, flannels, and a mixed light cloth called ratteens, being the
                    only vestige of its existence. Many efforts have been made to introduce the
                    linen manufacture as a substitute. Grants of implements and premiums were
                    offered by the Irish linen board appointed to encourage and foster the
                    manufacture. Much of the funds sent into the country from England during periods
                    of famine were employed to turn the course of industry, particularly among the
                    females, into this channel, but to no purpose. The culture of flax, as already
                    stated, is but little attended to, the plant being raised in small quantities,
                    and manufactured merely for domestic use, in which it is also more and more
                    superseded every year by the increasing demand for cotton fabrics. There is a
                    cotton factory at Clonmell. The staple manufacture of the county is that of
                    flour, for which there are numerous mills. The abundant supply of the raw
                    material from the rich valleys and champaign lands, and the numerous sites, with
                    a great command of water-power on the many branch-streams that feed the main
                    rivers, afford facilities of which due advantage has been taken; and the export
                    of flour is consequently the main stimulus to industry, and a great source of
                    internal wealth. Many plans have been devised to increase this wealth by
                    increasing the facilities for transmitting agricultural produce throughout the
                    country, and to the great marts. The generally level yet undulating surface of
                    the land affords adequate scope for carrying on lines of inland navigation, and
                    extending railway communications. Both have been subjects of consideration. A
                    canal was projected to form a continuation of that already existing from Dublin
                    to Monastereven. It was to proceed by Roscrea and Cashel to Carrick, whence
                    there is a river-navigation to Waterford. Others of minor extent were projected
                    to pass through the northern and western parts of the Shannon, which is
                    navigable all along the verge of the county; but none has yet been undertaken.
                    Several lines of railroad have also been latterly proposed. Besides others laid
                    down by private engineers at the suggestion of individuals or intended
                    joint-stock companies, the commissioners for inquiring into the expediency of
                    introducing the system of railroads into Ireland, have suggested a line in
                    continuation of that proposed to be carried from Dublin to Kilkenny, which,
                    after passing Maryborough in Queen’s county, is to enter Tipperary near
                    Templemore, and to pass by Thurles. to Holycross, whence one branch is to tend
                    southwards by Cashel, Goldenbridge, Cahir, and Mitchelstown, to Cork, and the
                    other along the southern base of the Slieve-Phelim Mountains, by Pallasgreine,
                    to Limerick. These lines are laid down in the map lately published by the
                    conductors of the trigonometrical survey of Ireland, but no steps have as yet
                    been taken for their accomplishment. Several new lines of road have however been
                    executed, some of which, being cut through the mountainous districts on the
                    north-west of the country, have produced the double effect of facilitating the
                    transmission of goods, and, what is of much greater importance, the improvement
                    and welfare of the country, by throwing open a tract hitherto impassable for
                    carriages, and consequently the almost inaccessible place of refuge for
                    desperate characters of every description, who here set at defiance the laws,
                    and made the place a centre from which to make inroads, on favourable
                    opportunities, into the open country. One of the great lines of mail-coach roads
                    to Cork passes through the county; and the intercourse for travellers
                    unencumbered with much luggage hns been increased in a great degree by the
                    establishment of one-horse travelling cars, which ply between all the principal
                    market-towns and places of resort. For this great improvement the county is
                    indebted to the exertions of an intelligent foreigner, M. Bianconi, who devised
                    and has carried on the system as a private speculation on his own account. In
                    the county there are thirteen banking establishments, of which three are in
                    Clonmell, two each in Nenagh, Roscrea, Thurles, and Tipperary, and one each in
                    Carrick-on-Suir and Cashel.</p>
                <p>The remains of antiquity are numerous, but, with few exceptions, not of a very
                    remarkable character. There are two round towers, one at Cashel, the other at
                    Roscrea, both in good preservation. Among the remains of ancient monastic
                    buildings, many of which are still in existence, the most worthy of notice are
                    those on the Rock of Cashel, consisting of the ancient cathedral, a fine Gothic
                    structure, exhibiting a combination of the military with the ecclesiastical
                    style of architecture; and Cormac’s Chapel, a venerable building, with a fine
                    groined roof, and having in the interior <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=336" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0336-0316"
                    />some very ancient paintings in fresco, and a number of statues supposed to
                    represent the apostles. The remains of ancient castles are also numerous, as
                    might be expected in a part of the country so often the seat of intestine wars.
                    Several old fortresses are still kept in repair, and improved so as to form the
                    residences of the proprietors of the surrounding lands. There is also a number
                    of elegant mansions and villas belonging to the resident noblemen and gentry.
                    The dwellings of the peasantry differ little from those in other agricultural
                    districts, nor are there any very marked variations in their manners, dress, or
                    mode of living. The lower classes have long been notorious for their spirit of
                    lawless turbulence, which has been attributed, among other causes affecting the
                    country in general, to the neglect of absentee landlords, and to the almost
                    total want of communication through the mountainous districts. The latter of
                    these has been considerably diminished within the last few years; and the
                    projected commercial facilities designed by the railroads, if carried into
                    execution, will tend to complete this desirable change.</p>
                <p>The county town is Clonmell, on the Suir; a large and populous place, partly in
                    this county and partly in Waterford, with a population of 17,838 souls. It is a
                    parliamentary borough, returning one member, and one of the great marts for the
                    agricultural produce of the county. It was also the seat of the woollen
                    manufacture until its failure throughout Ireland, after which that of cotton has
                    been introduced, but with partial success. Its chief channel of export is by the
                    Suir to Waterford, by means of boats of fifty tons and under. One of its
                    principal articles of export is butter, for the sale of which a large building
                    has been erected. Brewing and distillation are extensively carried on here or in
                    the vicinity. The public buildings are those usual in county towns; the parish
                    church, a large old building; two Roman Catholic chapels, and other places of
                    worship; a court-house, prison, public school-house, infirmaries, and the county
                    lunatic asylum. Some vestiges of the ancient fortifications still remain. One of
                    the four gates, which is still kept in repair, forms an ornamental entrance to
                    the town on the western side. Since the division of the county into two ridings,
                    Nenagh, the place appointed for holding the assizes in the north riding, has
                    received some improvement. A prison is there in progress of erection. The
                    population of this town amounts to 8446. Cashel, a city with a population now
                    reduced to 6971 souls, was anciently the royal residence of the kings of
                    Munster, the most celebrated of whom, Brian Born, built its fortifications. It
                    was also the seat of the archiepiscopal residence, and so continued until the
                    see was reduced to a bishopric and united with those of Waterford and Lismore,
                    under the provisions of the church temporalities act of 1833. The archbishop’s
                    palace is in this city. It has a small library, chiefly of theological works,
                    attached to it. Cashel is also a parliamentary borough, returning one member.
                    The other larger towns are Carrick-on-Suir, a place of some trade by means of
                    its site on that navigable river. Population 9626. Thurles, the seat of the
                    Roman Catholic see of Cashel, having in it the cathedral and the archiepiscopal
                    residence, 7084; Tipperary, 6972; Roscrea. 5512; Cahir, 3408; Fethard, 3400; and
