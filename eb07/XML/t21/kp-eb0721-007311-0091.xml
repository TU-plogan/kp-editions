                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">TANJORE</label>, an extensive, populous, and well-cultivated
                    district of the south of India, in the Carnatic, situated in the Bay of Bengal,
                    between the 10th and 12th degrees of north latitude, and intersected by the
                    river Cauvery. It is bounded on the north by the Cauvery river, on the south and
                    east by the Indian Ocean, and on the west by Trichinopoly and the Polygars’
                    territory. It is ninety-five miles in length by fifty in breadth. The
                    inhabitants of this district are remarkably industrious and expert in husbandry,
                    and they have erected extensive works for the irrigation of the country. The
                    most prodigious mounds have been raised at Costady, to prevent the waters of the
                    Cauvery from rejoining those of the Coleroon, after they have been separated
                    near Trichinopoly; and by numerous canals they are diverted, by means of
                    embankments and reservoire, into every field, and fertilize a tract of country
                    from Devicota<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=92"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0092-0074"/> to Point Calymere, which without water would have
                    remained a barren sand. The principal exports from this country to Madras are
                    indigo, cocoa-nuts, rice, grain, paddy, lamp-oil, with some piece goods; also
                    betel-nut, tin, pepper, tortoise-shell, benjamin, arrack, &amp;c. The imports
                    from Madras are small in quantity and value, and chiefly consist of articles for
                    the European troops and residents. The seaports of chief resort are Tranquebar,
                    Nagore, Negapatam, Carical, and Devicota. This territory never having been
                    actually occupied by the Mahommedans, the Hindu religion in all its original
                    forms and ancient splendour, the ancient places of worship, with their vast
                    endowments, remain untouched. The Brahmins are the chief proprietors of the
                    land, and perform almost every office of husbandry except holding the plough.
                    They are all well affected to the British government, and grateful for the
                    protection which they receive, and also for an allowance granted by government
                    of 45,000 pagodas for the support of the poorer temples.</p>
                <p>It was in the province of Tanjore that the British were first engaged in warfare
                    with the native troops, and they did not succeed in their object, which was to
                    restore the deposed rajah of Tanjore, who had applied for assistance to the
                    governor of Fort St David. In 1799 the territory of Tanjore was subjected to the
                    British authority, a large pension being reserved for the maintenance of the
                    rajah, besides one fifth of the surplus revenues after payment of the civil and
                    military expenses; and, as a particular favour, he retains the possession of the
                    two forts of Tanjore, which he keeps in excellent repair, and which are
                    garrisoned with 1500 troops. The province now forms one of the districts under
                    the Madras presidency.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tanjore,</hi> a celebrated town and fortress, and capital of
                    the above-mentioned district. The city comprehends two fortresses, which are
                    given up to the rajah; but on the exigency of a war, the British have a right by
                    treaty to reoccupy them. The small fort is <hi rend="italic">a</hi> mile in
                    circumference, very strong and in good repair. It has lofty walls, and on the
                    corners of the ramparts are cavaliers. There is also a ditch, broad and deep,
                    cut out of the solid rock, with a well-formed glacis. The small is joined to the
                    large fort, where the rajah resides, which is fortified in a similar manner,
                    and, beside the palace, contains other public buildings. The smaller fort
                    contains the celebrated pagoda, the chief building of which is one of the finest
                    specimens of the pyramidical temple in Hindustan. Within is a bull carved from a
                    block of black granite, an excellent specimen of Hindu sculpture. It also
                    contains a college, formerly a celebrated place of Hindu learning. The fortress,
                    which may be considered as the citadel, is extremely strong, and successfully
                    resisted the arms of both the French and the British, but was taken by the
                    latter in the year 1773. Long. 79. 11. E. Lat. 10. 42. N.</p>
