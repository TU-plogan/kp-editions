                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable

                    the county of La Marc in Westphalia, an adventurer who obtained considerable
                    notoriety under the title of King of Corsica. He had his education in the French
                    service, and afterwards went to Spain, where he received some marks of regard
                    from the duke of Riperda and Cardinal Alberoni; but being of an unsettled
                    disposition, he quitted Spain, and travelled into Italy, England, and Holland,
                    in search of new adventures. He at last fixed his attention on Corsica, and
                    formed the scheme of rendering himself sovereign of that island. He was a man of
                    abilities and address; and having fully informed himself of every thing relating
                    to Corsica, went to Tunis, where he devised means to procure some money and
                    arms; and then went to Leghorn, from whence he wrote a letter to the Corsican
                    chiefs Giafferi and Paoli, offering considerable assistance to the nation if
                    they would elect him as their sovereign. This letter was consigned to <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0219-0201"/> Count DomenicoRivarola, who acted as Corsican
                    plenipotentiary in Tuscany, and he gave for answer, that if Theodore brought the
                    assistance which he promised to the Corsicans, they would very willingly make
                    him king. Without loss of time he set sail, and landed at Tavagna in the spring
                    of the year 1736. He was a man of a very stately appearance, and the Turkish
                    dress, which he wore, added to the dignity of his mien. He had a few attendants
                    with him; and his manners were so engaging, and his offers so plausible, that he
                    was proclaimed king of Corsica before Count Rivarola’s despatches arrived to
                    inform the chiefs of the terms upon which he had agreed. He brought with him
                    about 1000 zequins of Tunis, besides some arms and ammunition, and made
                    magnificent promises of foreign assistance; whence the Corsicans, who were glad
                    of any support, willingly gave in to his schemes. Theodore instantly assumed
                    every mark of royal dignity. He had his guards and his officers of state; he
                    conferred titles of honour, and struck money both of silver and copper. The
                    silver pieces were few in number, and can now hardly be met with; the copper
                    coins have on one side T. R., that is, “Theodoras Rex,” with a double branch
                    crossed, and round it this inscription, <hi rend="smallcaps">Pro bono publico
                    Re. Co.,</hi> that is, “For the public good of the kingdom of Corsica on the
                    other side is the value of the piece, <hi rend="italic">cinque solidi,</hi> or
                    five sous.</p>
                <p>The Genoese were not a little confounded with this unexpected adventure. They
                    published a violent manifesto against Theodore, treating him with great
                    contempt; but at the same time showing they were alarmed at his appearance.
                    Theodore replied in a manifesto, with all the calmness and dignity of a monarch;
                    but after being about eight months in Corsica, perceiving that the people began
                    to cool in their affections towards him, he assembled his chiefs, and declared
                    he would keep them no longer in a state of uncertainty, being determined to seek
                    in person the support which he had long expected. He settled an administration
                    during his absence, recommended unity in the strongest terms, and left the
                    island with reciprocal assurances of fidelity and affection. He proceeded to
                    Holland, where he was so successful as to obtain credit from several rich
                    merchants, particularly Jews, who trusted him with cannon and other warlike
                    stores to a great value, under the charge of a supercargo. With these he
                    returned to Corsica in 1739; but by this time the French, as auxiliaries to the
                    Genoese, had become so powerful in the island, that though Theodore threw in his
                    supply of warlike stores, he did not incline to venture his person, the Genoese
                    having set a high price on his head. He therefore again departed; and after many
                    unavailing attempts to recover his crown, at length chose for retirement a
                    country where he might enjoy the participation of that liberty which he had so
                    vainly endeavoured to give his Corsicans; but his situation in England by
                    degrees grew wretched, and he was reduced so low as to be several years before
                    his death a prisoner for debt in the King’s Bench. At length, to the honour of
                    some gentlemen of rank, a charitable contribution was set on foot for him in the
                    year 1753. Mr Boswell observes, that Horace Walpole generously exerted himself
                    for the unfortunate Theodore, and wrote a paper in <hi rend="italic">The
                    World</hi> with great elegance and humour, soliciting a contribution for the
                    unhappy monarch in distress, to be paid to Mr Robert Dodsley, bookseller, as
                    lord high treasurer. This brought him a very handsome sum, and he was set at
                    liberty. The same writer adds, that Mr Walpole had the original deed by which
                    Theodore made over the kingdom of Corsica in security to his creditors, and that
                    he also had the great seal of the kingdom. Theodore died on the 11th of December
                    1756, and was buried in St Anne’s churchyard, Westminster, where, in 1757, a
                    simple unadorned monument of marble was erected to his memory.</p>
