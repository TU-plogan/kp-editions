                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Telegraph,</hi> so named from two Greek words, <hi
                    rend="italic">τέλος, end or distance,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">γgάθω, I
                    write,</hi> is a machine so constructed as to enable two persons to converse
                    with each other at a distance, either by sentences, words, or letters, according
                    to a convention previously agreed upon by the parties. Such a mode of
                    communicating ideas beyond the reach of hearing is not, however, confined to any
                    particular machine; the fingers of the human hand are quite sufficient, as every
                    young boarding-school lady knows, for the purpose; and, when so applied, may be
                    called a <hi rend="italic">telegraph.</hi> Thus also the signal-flags used on
                    board ships to communicate with each other, by making them represent letters or
                    numbers, or both, constitute a <hi rend="italic">telegraph;</hi> as may also the
                    sending up of sky-rockets, blue lights, the suspension of lanterns, the making
                    of fires on beacons, high hills, &amp;c. be considered as telegraphic
                    communications.</p>
                <p>In imitation of the French, however, we have almost indiscriminately adopted the
                    use of the word <hi rend="italic">semaphore</hi> for the telegraph, which is
                    perhaps of more extensive application, being derived from <hi rend="italic"
                    >σημα</hi>, <hi rend="italic">a sign,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">θεgω</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">I hear;</hi> and may consequently be applied universally to
                    whatever means may be used to communicate intelligence by signs or signals. Thus
                    the firing of guns a certain number of times at certain intervals,—the notes of
                    a trumpet, bugle, French horn, or other wind instrument,—the strokes on a
                    drum,—may be used to convey information to a limited extent. The troops and
                    marines which landed on the coast of America in the last war, when scouring the
                    woods in detached parties, were regulated by the notes of the bugle, which were
                    so clearly understood that no false movements were ever made. The immense number
                    of barges and boats which crowd the Imperial (’anal of China are directed in
                    their movements, both by night and day, by the sound of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gong.</hi> The Indians of America convey intelligence from hill to hill by
                    throwing out their arms with or without staves in them; by spreading their
                    cloaks, holding up skins, &amp;c.; and even the savage Hottentots, called
                    Bosjeismans, the lowest probably in the scale of human beings, communicate with
                    each other by arranging fires on the side of the hills in certain positions.</p>
                <p>It is rather surprising that an art so simple as that of conveying ideas by means
                    of signals, so well understood in remote antiquity, and practised even by
                    savages, should have made so little progress in its improvement, that it may be
                    said to have remained in its original rude state nearly down to our own times,
                    when it has almost at once been brought to that state of perfection of which it
                    appears to be capable.</p>
                <p>One of the arguments usually adopted to prove that the art of conveying
                    intelligence by signals was known in the early ages of Greece, is deduced from
                    the opening of the <hi rend="italic">Agamemnon</hi> of Aeschylus, where the man
                    on the watch-tower at the top of the palace announces the fire-signals having
                    communicated the fall of Troy, long before any of the Greeks had returned from
                    the siege; and Clytemnestra afterwards relates the stations; but this event of
                    the burning of Troy, supposed thus to have been known in Greece soon after it
                    happened, proves nothing more than that the use of signals was known to the
                    poet, who wrote eight or nine hundred years after the event. Mention, however,
                    is made by Jeremiah (ch. vi. v. 1), who was at least 200 years before Aeschylus,
                    of “setting up a sign of fire in Beth-haccerem and such signals are often
                    alluded to by the prophets, as notices of the approach of an enemy.</p>
                <p>The earliest decisive proof of telegraphic communications, except those by fires
                    (<hi rend="italic">πυgσειαι</hi>), being in use among the Greeks, is found in
                    the methods described by Polybius. The Romans had their <hi rend="italic"
                    >vexillarii,</hi> and used flags and other contrivances for regulating the
                    movements of their armies; and they had hollow tubes constructed in the walls of
                    their cities, by which they could communicate with the several ports or works by
                    sound, as is done in our times in some manufactories by means of pipes or
                    trumpets. Wherever the Romans pitched their camp, an elevated spot was selected
                    for the signal station, to convey intelligence to the foraging parties or
                    detachments; but it is nowhere stated to what extent this was carried. Vegetius
                    alludes to something like a beam in the air, on the same principle perhaps as
                    our semaphore.</p>
                <p>In modern times, Kircher, who had more learning and less sense than any man of
                    his day, and has written on almost every subject, gives an idea of telegraphic
                    communication; and so does the ingenious Marquis of Worcester, in his Century of
                    Inventions; but so vague as to convey no notion of the means he was to employ,
                    except the use of colour; for the “discourse” to be held is stated to be “as far
                    as eye can discover black from white.” He also throws out a hint for a night
                    telegraph, by which the same may be done, “though as dark as pitch is black.”
                    But almost every modern invention is supposed to exist in the mysterious
                    “scantlings” of the Marquis of Worcester.</p>
                <p>The first telegraph on reoord in modern times, applicable to universal purposes,
                    is that of Dr Hooke, described in the Philosophical Transactions of the year
                    1684. He minutely details the mode in which the stations should be selected,
                    their height and intermediate ground, so that the refraction of the air may not
                    disturb the clear appearance of the object; the telescopes to be used; the
                    characters to represent the alphabet, which, he says, may be varied ten thousand
                    ways, and “none but the two extreme correspondents shall be able to discover the
                    information conveyed and so convinced is he of the practical efficiency of his
                    telegraph, as to leave no doubt on his mind, “that the same character may be
                    seen at Paris within a minute after it hath been exposed in London.” His method
                    consisted in exposing in succession as marry different shaped figures, or signs,
                    at least, as the alphabet consists of letters. If used in the day-time, they
                    might be squares, circles, triangles, &amp;c. made of deals; if at night,
                    torches or other lights disposed in a certain order. These characters or signs
                    were to be brought forth from behind a screen on rods, as they might be wanted,
                    and exposed to view.</p>
                <p>The accompanying figure, where A is the screen, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=156" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0156-0138"
                    />one of the signs exhibited, will convey an idea of Dr Hooke’s telegraph.</p>
                <p>Monsieur Amantona, of the Royal Academy of Paris, made an experiment to convey
                    intelligence, which was highly approved of by the other members, and several
                    persons of distinction belonging to the court. By the description given of the
                    machine, it seems to have differed very little from that of Hooke already
                    published in the Philosophical Transactions; the signals being either large
                    letters of the alphabet, or figures of various shapes to represent them; the
                    latter being the more valuable, as, by a change of key, the nature of the
                    communication might be kept a secret from those actually employed in making the
                    signals.</p>
                <p>It has been supposed that electricity might be the means of conveying
                    intelligence, by passing given numbers of sparks through an insulated wire in
                    given spaces of time. A gentleman of the name of Ronalds has written a small
                    treatise on the subject; and several persons on the Continent and in England
                    have made experiments on Galvanic or Voltaic telegraphs, by passing the stream
                    through wires in metal pipes to the two extremities or stations, into phials of
                    water; but there is reason to think that, ingenious as the experiments are, they
                    are not likely ever to become practically useful. Since this was written,
                    Professor Wheatstone has succeeded in contriving a Galvanic telegraph that works
                    admirably, and will no doubt be applied to all the great lines of rail-road in
                    the kingdom. It is simple in its construction, not liable to error, very
                    portable, and carries round the margin of a circle the letters of the whole
                    alphabet in rapid succession, so that each word is speedily conveyed to any
                    distance.</p>
                <p>Necessity is said to be the mother of invention; she is also frequently the
                    foster-mother, who calls forth into action, and displays the utility of,
                    inventions abandoned by their natural parent. Both Hooke’s invention and
                    Amantons’ modification were published all over Europe, the former as early as
                    1684; yet they were not practically applied to any useful purpose till the year
                    1794, when Citizen Barrere, in a report made to the Convention, ascribed the
                    invention then in use to Citizen Chappe.</p>
                <p>Chappe’s telegraph consists of a beam of wood, moveable on a pivot at the summit
                    of an upright post. At each of the extremities of this beam is a moveable arm,
                    as in the figure. The different positions in which both the beam and its two
                    arms may be placed at angles of 45° give to this telegraph considerable powers;
                    but it is too complicated a machine not to be liable to many mistakes, unless
                    worked by long-experienced operators.</p>
                <p>In the year 1784, Mr Lovell Edgeworth produced his plan of a numerical telegraph,
                    claiming, at the same time, the merit of having invented a mode of distant
                    communication as far back as 1767, by employing a common wind-mill, and
                    arranging the various positions of its arms and sails so as to represent a
                    certain number of signals arranged in numerical order.</p>
                <p>Mr Edgeworth’s telegraph consisted of four wedges or cones, moveable on four
                    upright posts, as under, which, by their different positions, might be used
                    either numerically or alphabetically.</p>
                <p>In the year 1795, when the advantages had been made evident which the French
                    derived from Μ. Chappe’s telegraph, the inventive faculties of our countrymen
                    were called into action. Among other proposals, the Rev. J. Gamble produced two
                    plans of a telegraph; the one consisting of five boards, one above the other,
                    which, by opening and shutting singly, or according to all the combinations of
                    which they were capable, gave a certain number of distinct signals, representing
                    either numbers or letters, as might be deemed most expedient. The arrangement of
                    the shutters was as in this figure. The other plan was that of five beams of
                    wood, turning on the summit of a post, so as to form five radii of a semicircle
                    at equal angles of 45° with each other, as in the annexed figure.</p>
                <p>Among other projects about this time, was that of dividing a large circle into
                    twenty-four parts, to represent the letters of the alphabet, round which a
                    moveable radius was to traverse; then, by placing corresponding divisions, by
                    means of wires, before the object-glass of the telescope, the coincidence of the
                    two radii would mark out the letter meant to be designated. Of this kind, a plan
                    by Mr Garnet approached nearest to efficiency; but, at best, could only be
                    applied to very short distances.</p>
                <p>In the same year (1795) Lord George Murray presented his plan of a six-shutter
                    telegraph to the Admiralty, which was the one adopted and made use of during the
                    whole war, and until the year 1816, when it was changed for a simplified
                    semaphore, which will be noticed hereafter. The annexed figure represents that
                    of Lord George Murray.</p>
                <p>On the same principle as the radiated telegraph of Mr Gamble, but differently
                    arranged, the French, on the commencement of the second war in 1803, erected
                    signal-posts along the coast, to which they gave the name of semaphores, being
                    two or three beams of wood on the same post, but turning on different
                    pivots.</p>
                <p>In 1807, Captain (now ColoneD Pasley published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polygrammatic Telegraph,</hi> which differed only from the French semaphore in
                    having two beams turning on one pivot on the same post, and multiplying the
                    number of posts; which he afterwards (in 1810) changed so far as to place three
                    sets of beams or arms, two in each set, on one post, and thus approaching still
                    nearer to the French semaphore.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=157"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0157-0139"/>
                <p>In the year 1816, Sir Home Popham, who had already introduced a new code of
                    signals into the navy, which was admitted on all hands as a great improvement on
                    the old system, both as regarding the number, the arrangement, and the shape of
                    the flags, now turned his attention to the land semaphore, and proposed one on a
                    construction of the same nature with those of M. Chappe and Colonel Pasley, but
                    much simplified. It was, in fact, nothing more than two moveable arms on
                    separate pivots on the same mast, as in the annexed figure.</p>
                <p>This machine, on account of its simplicity, had obviously the advantage over all
                    others that had been proposed; and being found of sufficient power and
                    efficiency for all required purposes, it was adopted by the Admiralty, instead
                    of the shutter-telegraph, which had been in use since the year 1795.</p>
                <p>Colonel Pasley, however, in 1822, still further simplified this useful machine,
                    at the expense of sacrificing a small portion of its powcrs, by making the two
                    arms revolve on the same pivot, as in this figure, to which he has given the
                    name of the “universal telegraph.”</p>
                <p>The last, but by far the most persevering and voluminous writer on telegraphs, is
                    Lieutenant-Colonel Macdonald, who, in 1808, published what he deems improvements
                    in the system of telegraphic communications, both as they regard the machine
                    itself, and the dictionary to be used with it. He not only gives the preference,
                    but is so much attached, to the shutter machine, that he is quite indignant at
                    its being supplanted by the semaphore; and so far from being satisfied with the
                    powers of which a six-shutter telegraph is capable, he has extended his to no
                    less than <hi rend="italic">thirteen</hi> different boards, as in the annexed
                    figure, by which he certainly gains power enough, but not without producing
                    confusion and perplexity.</p>
                <p>As the use of telegraphs is chiefly confined to public purposes, and more
                    especially to convey speedy information respecting naval and military armaments
                    and operations, the machine to be adopted, and the system of working it, ought
                    to possess <hi rend="italic">power, certainty, simplicity, celerity,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">secrecy.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">power</hi> of the machine,
                    or the number of distinct combinations of its moveable parts, should be equal to
                    the conveyance of every possible order or information, either by numbers
                    representing the letters of the alphabet, or words, or sentences. To insure <hi
                    rend="italic">certainty,</hi> the moveable parts or signs should be so well and
                    clearly defined, so wholly within the field of the telescope, and so completely
                    removed from all ambiguity, as not to be liable to the mistaking of one signal
                    for another; hence the advantage of the <hi rend="italic">simplicity</hi> of the
                    machine. And as one of the main usee of the telegraph is to convey instructions
                    or intelligence in a speedier way than the intermediate distance can be
                    travelled over, it is evident that <hi rend="italic">celerity</hi> is an
                    important quality of telegraphic communication. It is equally obvious, that if
                    such instructions or intelligence could not be conveyed in <hi rend="italic"
                    >secrecy</hi> from him who sent it to him who was to receive it, such a system
                    would be highly defective and objectionable.</p>
                <p>Bearing these observations in mind, we shall not have much difficulty in
                    determining on the merits of the several telegraphic machines above mentioned.
                    The choice, indeed, appears to lie between the six-shutter telegraph, so long
                    used at the Admiralty, to communicate with the several ports; the semaphore of
                    Sir Home Popham, which superseded it, and is now in use; and the universal
                    telegraph of Colonel Pasley. Colonel Macdonald, who conceives the shutter
                    telegraph as the perfection of the art, boldly asserts that “the semaphore arm
                    of proper dimensions is not to be seen in clear weather so well as the common
                    sized boards, and in cloudy weather by no means so well and consequently that,
                    “for this climate, the boarded telegraph is in all respects more advantageous.”
                    This would be important if correct; but it is evident that the colonel is not
                    aware of the discussion which took place on this very important part of the
                    subject, on the first adoption of the <hi rend="italic">boarded</hi> telegraph.
                    Had he read the clear and decisive observations of Mr Gamble, he would scarcely
                    have ventured upon such an assertion.</p>
                <p>“It is a theorem in optics,” says Mr Gamble, “that the apparent magnitude of an
                    object varies nearly in the inverse ratio of its distance. Hence it follows,
                    that the larger its dimensions, to the greater distance will it be visible. But
                    the nature of our atmosphere, even in its most transparent state, is such as to
                    render any calculation, grounded on this principle, extremely erroneous; and in
                    general its density so obstructs, and its refracting powers cause such confusion
                    in, the rays issuing from those surfaces which are not placed sufficiently
                    distant to be distinct, that their image falling upon the retina is frequently
                    so ill defined, as to render it difficult to determine either their figure or
                    position; for which reasons, that which I shall term <hi rend="italic"
                    >insulation</hi> is generally a quality more requisite to give <hi rend="italic"
                    >distinctness</hi> to an object, than magnitude of superficial dimensions.”</p>
                <p>This is unquestionably true; but Mr Gamble illustrates his position thus: “An
                    example of this distinctness arising from insulation cannot be more readily
                    obtained than by taking a page of printed paper, and fixing the eye on some
                    particular letter (as I); then retiring from it, the letter will be so confused
                    with the surrounding ones, as not to be easily distinguished. But if the same
                    letter (!) be printed on a plain sheet of paper, standing by itself (or <hi
                    rend="italic">insulated),</hi> the eye will then not only discern it at a much
                    greater distance, but the image falling single and unencumbered upon the retina,
                    we shall be able to determine whether it be inclined to the right or to the
                    left, or whether it be placed horizontally on the paper.”</p>
                <p>The shutter telegraph is the printed page, and the arm of the semaphore is the
                    letter (I) on a plain sheet of paper.</p>
                <p>But actual experiment has completely proved the fallacy of Colonel Macdonald’s
                    assertion, and the justice of Mr Gamble’s theory. Every officer serving on the
                    line of telegraphs has stated, that at all times, and more especially in cloudy
                    weather, the arms of the semaphore are seen much better than the boards of the
                    telegraph ever were. Lieutenant Pace, who for many years superintended the
                    Admiralty station, declared, that on the first day after the West Square
                    semaphore was erected, he could clearly distinguish the positions of the arms
                    <hi rend="italic">without a telescope,</hi> and accurately take down any signals
                    that could be made, which he had never been able to do, under any circumstance
                    whatever, with the shutter telegraph. He also stated that he had frequently an
                    open communication with the semaphore at West Square, while St Paul’s was capt
                    by a fog, which was at all times considered by him and his assistant as the
                    conclusive sign that the boarded telegraph could not be worked. But in order to
                    set the matter entirely at rest, the shutter telegraph on Nunhead, near
                    Newcross, was left standing on the same hill with the new semaphore, in order to
                    try their comparative distinctness, for a whole winter. The result was, that the
                    semaphore was frequently distinctly<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=158" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0158-0140"/>
                    visible when the boarded telegraph was so much enveloped in mist or fog, that
                    the particular boards, shut or thrown open, could not be distinguished; and it
                    appeared by a journal kept by this officer, that in the course of the winter,
                    the days on which the semaphore was visible exceeded those on which the shutters
                    could be seen by fully one third. If, then, this be the case with a six-boarded
                    telegraph, how much more objectionable must one of twelve shutters be, which
                    must necessarily be placed so near to each other as to make it at all times a
                    matter of difficulty to discern at once how many, and which of them, are closed,
                    and which open? Even in the six-shutter telegraph, one board has frequently been
                    mistaken for the other; for it may be remarked, that such a mass of timber as is
                    required for a shutter-telegraph is seldom free from haze.</p>
                <p>It will probably be urged, that the arms of the semaphore, having to describe a
                    larger circle, must be slower in their operations; but this increased slowness
                    is so amply compensated by the ease and certainty of reading off the signals as
                    to render any such objection of little or no weight: it may make the difference
                    of <hi rend="italic">one second</hi> in each signal, while the machinery by
                    which the semaphore is worked is as simple and as little liable to be out of
                    order as that of the boarded telegraph.</p>
                <p>The six-shutter telegraph, it is true, has greater powers than the two-armed
                    semaphore, and much greater than the universal semaphore of Colonel Pasley; that
                    is to say, the number of combinations which it is capable of making without
                    using the stop-signal (or signal which separates one word or one sentence from
                    another), is much greater than in either of the other two; but <hi rend="italic"
                    >all</hi> of them have sufficient powers, and a sufficient number of
                    combinations, to convey with facility and despatch any communication whatsoever,
                    and in any language, either by letters, words, or sentences. Their respective
                    powers may be seen by the following tables of their positions.</p>

                <p>In all, twenty-eight separate and distinct signals; containing a sufficient
                    number for expressing the letters of the alphabet, and, consequently, for
                    spelling any message; but not a sufficient number left to express the numeral
                    digits by single signs. The signal No. 4 is, besides, as Colonel Pasley is
                    aware, liable to be mistaken, it being a mere elongation of the mast, which, at
                    a great distance, and owing <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=159" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0159-0141"/>to
                    the refractive power of the atmosphere, will always be ambiguous when exhibited
                    as a single signal. But Colonel Pasley has added a short arm, which he calls an
                    <hi rend="italic">indicator,</hi> as below at A; and which, when made moveable,
                    more than compensates for this defect.</p>
                <p>It was with a different view, however, that he has added this indicator. It was
                    suggested to him by a captain in the navy, who had experienced the greatest
                    inconvenience, in using Sir Home Popham’s ship-semaphores, from the signal-men
                    confounding the positions of the arms when seen in <hi rend="italic"
                    >reverse.</hi> We apprehend no experienced signal-men could possibly make any
                    mistake in merely changing the right hand for the left.</p>
                <p>The respective powers of the three telegraphs, in making single, or what may be
                    called primary signals, are, as appears from the tables, 62, 42, and 28. In
                    making <hi rend="italic">two</hi> changes, with a stop between them (that is,
                    <hi rend="italic">three</hi> signals), to represent a word or sentence, their
                    powers will be as 3844, 1764, and 784; in making <hi rend="italic">three</hi>
                    changes (or, with the <hi rend="italic">stop, four</hi> signals), as
                    238,328-74,088-21,952. Now, as the telegraphic dictionary of Sir Home Popham,
                    which has been, and still is, used in the navy, does not exceed 13,000 words and
                    sentences, and has never been found deficient in any of its divisions of
                    subjects, it is evident that even the lowest power of the three is more than
                    sufficient for all useful purposes; and that those compilers who have swelled
                    out their telegraphic dictionaries to upwards of 100,000 (one mentioned by
                    Colonel Pasley has extended his labours to 140,000), have made them nearly
                    useless, by the difficulty and loss of time in finding the required phrase or
                    sentence. We have actually seen in one telegraphic dictionary 126 pages, of
                    three columns in each page, and sixty sentences in each column, containing
                    upwards of 20,000 sentences (about one third of the number of words in Johnson’s
                    Dictionary), and each of these sentences beginning with the personal pronoun HE,
                    twenty pages with IF, &amp;c. Compared with the use of such a dictionary,
                    spelling the sentences is infinitely preferable as to certainty, and in many
                    cases as to celerity. Indeed we should say that the abbreviated nature of
                    communications made by telegraph renders spelling by far the most eligible mode.
                    In clear weather, the rapidity of working single signals, the short compass
                    within which any message may be condensed, the impossibility of committing any
                    mistake that cannot be immediately rectified, more than compensates for the
                    difference of a few minutes which the use of sentences may probably save. In
                    cloudy or foggy weather, the latter method will always be liable to mistake. If
                    experience may be assumed as a guide, the practice at the Admiralty, of spelling
                    all sentences, for the last thirty years, must decide in favour of that
                    system.</p>
                <p>In making use of the alphabetical table, much time may be saved by condensing the
                    message into the briefest form possible, leaving out of the sentences such words
                    as may not alter the sense, and generally the vowels of words. For instance,
                    “<hi rend="italic">Order the Agamemnon out of harbour, and direct her to proceed
                    to Spithead.</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi> To convey this message
                    alphabetically, it would be quite enough to say, “Agmemn to Spthed.” If <hi
                    rend="italic">from Spithead into harbour,</hi> “Agmemn nto hrbr.” In spelling,
                    too, it is very desirable, especially in our foggy climate, that the
                    intelligence to be conveyed should be compressed as much as possible into the
                    early part of the message. By not observing this rule, a curious mistake is said
                    to have been made in the course of the Peninsular war. The admiral at Plymouth
                    endeavoured to send up a message, but a fog coming on, part of it only on that
                    day reached London. It began thus: “Wellington de feated”—and the rest was
                    stopped by the fog: the anxiety for the remainder may readily be conceived; it
                    came, however, complete towards the evening, and conveyed the intelligence, that
                    “Wellington defeated the French,” &amp;c. Had the message been thus framed,
                    “French defeated at,” &amp;c. (the word Wellington being quite superfluous), the
                    anxiety for the particulars would have been of a very different kind. Much
                    therefore depends, as far as celerity and certainty is concerned, on the
                    construction of the sentence containing the intelligence to be conveyed.</p>
                <p>The methods suggested for making use of telegraphic communications by night have
                    not been less numerous than those for the day, though on land there are very few
                    occasions on which they can be of the least possible use. A regiment might
                    perhaps be ordered to move, at a moment’s notice, in order to reach a particular
                    point at a given time; or, as an extreme case, the enemy’s fleet might be seen
                    towards the close of the day in a particular quarter, which would make it
                    desirable to have the intelligence conveyed in various directions; but no naval
                    movement could take place during the night at any of the ports. So little
                    useful, indeed, does a night telegraph for the navy appear to have been
                    considered, that, with all the facility of applying lamps to the
                    shutter-telegraph at the Admiralty, no attempt was ever made for carrying such a
                    purpose into execution. Colonel Pasley’s description of the application of his
                    Universal Telegraph to night-signals will suffice to show one method (as good as
                    any other, perhaps) of adapting the machine to this purpose.</p>
                <p>“For night-signals, one lantern, called the centre-light, is fixed to the top of
                    the post; and one lantern (I), as an indicator, is fixed to a light crane or
                    derrick attached to the post, by night only, as under.</p>
                <p>“These lanterns are stationary, and appear on the same level. Two other lanterns
                    are suspended to the ends of the arms, upon fixing which a couple of weights are
                    added to counterpoise them. Each of the two arms by day, and each of the two
                    moveable lights by night, is capable of exhibiting the seven positions, besides
                    position O pointing vertically downwards. The indicator serves to distinguish
                    the low numbers 1, 2, 3, from the high numbers 7, 6, 5, in whatever direction
                    the telegraph may be viewed.”</p>
                <p>The use of telegraphic communication, important as it may be on land, is far more
                    so in the management of a fleet at sea. On the unfortunate result of Admiral
                    Keppel’s engagement, Dr Beatson, in his Memoirs, thus expresses himself: “The
                    defects or impropriety of the signals having thus appeared clearly to be the
                    true and sole cause of the miscarriage which disappointed the reasonable hopes
                    of Britain on this critical and weighty occasion, we may be justified in
                    observing, that if an admiral cannot command all the necessary movements of his
                    ships by signal on the day of battle, he is not upon a footing with an enemy who
                    possesses that advantage; and even with better ships and better men, and more
                    experienced commanders, he may be foiled in his expectations of victory, if not
                    defeated, from his want of the means to direct and to perform the necessary
                    evolutions of his fleet.”</p>
                <p>In the Fighting and Sailing Instructions of the Duke of York (afterwards James
                    II.), a certain number of signals are established for certain movements and
                    manoeuvres of the fleet, each flag having its respective object. <hi
                    rend="italic">L'Art des Armées Navales</hi> of le P. l’Hoste, published at Lyon
                    in 1697, contains something like a system of signals, but so awkward and clumsy
                    as to be of a very limited use. Indeed the best signals made use of, down to the
                    American war, could only <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=160" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0160-0142"/>be
                    considered as expedients; the <hi rend="italic">numerical plan</hi> having never
                    once been attempted, though Dr Hooke, De la Bourdonnois, and some others, had
                    long before suggested it.</p>
                <p>In 1798 a new signal-book was issued by the Admiralty, containing about four
                    hundred sentences, for which flags were appropriated numerically, expressive of
                    certain operations of a fleet, which were sufficiently useful as far as these
                    sentences went; but when it became necessary to issue any order not to be found
                    among them, the communication was obliged to be made by boats, and “a boat from
                    each ship” was ordered. The state of the weather did not always render this
                    practicable; and when it was, men’s lives were frequently exposed to imminent
                    risk. To remedy this inconvenience, Sir Home Popham printed at Calcutta a
                    numerical code of naval signals, which was reprinted in England in 1803. He
                    afterwards extended the code very considerably, which, by a recommendation of a
                    committee of naval officers, has been adopted, and is now in general use in the
                    navy. The only objection to this code, which more or less applies to all that
                    have subsequently been proposed, is the great number of flags, &amp;c., required
                    for making numerical signals to the extent as laid down in the code in question;
                    and which consists of nine flags, five cornettes, five triangles, and five
                    pendants. With such a number it is next to impossible to make out, in calm
                    weather, the figure and the colour of the flags; and equally so when in
                    situations where, though expanded by the wind, they present only an edge to the
                    eye of the observer, when the distance is not too great, so as to sink the hull
                    of the ship behind the curvature of the earth. The semaphore or sea-telegraph of
                    Sir Home Popham comes in aid of, and indeed entirely removes, those
                    difficulties. It consists of two posts, with a moveable arm to each (see the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Navy),</hi> and may be removed to any part of the
                    deck; but we are not sure, simple as it is, that the Universal Telegraph of
                    Colonel Pasley, consisting of one post and two arms, might not be adopted with
                    advantage as a sea-telegraph. The former exhibits eight, the latter seven
                    positions. <hi rend="smallcaps">(μ.)</hi></p>
