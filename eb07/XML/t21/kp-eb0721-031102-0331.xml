                <p><label type="entry">TIMOTHEUS</label>, one of the most celebrated poet-musicians
                    of antiquity, was born at Miletus, an Ionian city of Caria, 446 years <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> He was contemporary with Philip of Macedon, and not
                    only excelled in lyric and dithyrambic poetry, but in his performance upon the
                    cithara. According to Pausanias, he perfected that instrument, by the addition
                    of four new strings to the seven which it had before; though Suidas avers that
                    it had nine before, and that Timotheus only added two, the tenth and eleventh.
                    the account of Pausanias is confirmed in the famous decree against him, still
                    extant, and preserved at full length in Boethius. Mr Stillingfleet has given an
                    extract from it, in proof of the simplicity of the ancient Spartan music. The
                    fact is mentioned in Athenaeus; and Casaubon, in his notes upon that author, has
                    inserted the whole original text from Boethius, with corrections. The following
                    is a faithful translation of this extraordinary Spartan decree. “Whereas
                    Timotheus the Milesian, coming to our city, has dishonoured our ancient music,
                    and, despising the lyre of seven strings, has, by the introduction of a greater
                    variety of notes, corrupted the ears of our youth; and by the number of his
                    strings, and the novelty of his melody, has given to our music an effeminate and
                    artificial dress, instead of the plain and orderly one in which it has hitherto
                    appeared; rendering melody infamous, by composing in the chromatic instead of
                    the enharmonic: the kings and the ephori have therefore resolved to pass a
                    censure upon Timotheus for these things; and further, to oblige him to cut all
                    the superfluous strings of his eleven, leaving only the seven tones, and to
                    banish him from our city, that men may be warned for the future not to introduce
                    into Sparta any unbecoming custom.” The same story, as related in Athenaeus, has
                    this additional circumstance, that when the public executioner was on the point
                    of fulfilling the sentence, by cutting off the new strings, Timotheus,
                    perceiving a little statue in the same place, with a lyre in his hand of as many
                    strings as that which had given the offence, and showing it to the judges, was
                    acquitted. It appears from Suidas, that the poetical and musical compositions of
                    Timotheus were very numerous, and of various kinds. He attributes to him
                    nineteen nomes, or canticles, in hexameters; thirty-six proems, or preludes;
                    eighteen dithyrambice; twenty-one hymns; the poem in praise of Diana; one
                    panegyric; three tragedies, the Persians, Phinidas, and Laertes; to which must
                    be added a fourth, mentioned by several ancient authors, called Niobe, without
                    forgetting the poem on the birth of Bacchus. Stephanus of Byzantium makes him
                    author of eighteen books of nomes, or airs, for the cithara, to 8000 verses; and
                    of 1000 <hi rend="italic">∏gooίμια</hi>, or preludes, for the nomes of the
                    flutes. Timotheus died in Macedonia, according to Suidas, at the age of
                    ninety-seven; though the marbles, much better authority, say at ninety; and
                    Stephanus of Byzantium fixes his death in the fourth year of the 105th Olympiad,
                    two years before the birth of Alexander the Great. Hence it appears that this
                    Timotheus was not the famous player on the flute so much esteemed by that
                    prince, who was animated to such a degree by his performance as to seize his
                    arms, and who employed him, as Athenaeus informs us, together with the other
                    great musicians of his time, at his nuptials. From an inattention to dates, and
                    from forgetting that of these two musicians of the same name the one was a
                    Milesian and the other a Theban, they have been hitherto often confounded.</p>
