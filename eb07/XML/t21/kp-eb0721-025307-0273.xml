                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">THUCYDIDES</label>, a celebrated Greek historian, was born at
                    Athens, 471 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> He was the son of Olorus, and
                    grandson of Miltiades, who is thought to have been descended from Miltiades the
                    famous Athenian general, and to have married the king of Thrace’s daughter. He
                    was educated in a manner suitable to his quality, that is, in the study of
                    philosophy and eloquence. His master in the former was Anaxagoras, in the latter
                    Antiphon; one, by his description in the eighth book of his history, for power
                    of speech almost a miracle, and feared by the people on that account. Suidas and
                    Photius relate, that when Herodotus recited his history in public, a fashion in
                    use then and many ages after, Thucydides felt so great a sting of emulation,
                    that it drew tears from him; insomuch that Herodotus himself took notice of it,
                    and congratulated his father on having a son who showed so wonderful an
                    affection to the Muses. Herodotus was then about twenty-nine years of age,
                    Thucydides about sixteen.</p>
                <p>When the Peloponnesian war was impending, he conjectured truly that it would
                    prove a subject worthy of his labour; and it no sooner commenced than he began
                    to keep a journal. This explains the reason why he has attended more to
                    chronological order than to unity of design. During the same war he was
                    commissioned by his countrymen to relieve Amphipolis; but the quick march of
                    Brasidas the Lacedaemonian general defeated his operations, and Thucydides,
                    unsuccessful in his expedition, was banished from Athens. He withdrew to
                    Scaptesula, a town of Thrace, from whence he had obtained a rich wife. His exile
                    commenced in the eighth year of this celebrated war; and in the place of his
                    banishment the general began to write an impartial history of the important
                    events which had happened during his administration, and which still continued
                    to agitate the several states of Greece. This famous history is continued only
                    to the twenty-first year of the war; and the remaining part of the time till the
                    demolition of the walls of Athens was described by the pen of Theopompus and
                    Xenophon. He spared neither time nor money to procure authentic materials; and
                    the Athenians, as well as their enemies, furnished him with many valuable
                    communications, which contributed to throw great light on the different
                    transactions of the war. His history has been divided into eight books, the last
                    of which is imperfect, and is supposed to have been written by his daughter.</p>
                <p>The historian of Halicarnassus has often been compared with the son of Olorus,
                    but each has his peculiar excellence. Sweetness of style, grace and elegance of
                    expression, may be called the characteristics of the former; while Thucydides
                    stands unequalled for the fire of his descriptions, the conciseness, and at the
                    same time the strong and energetic manner, of his narratives. His relations are
                    authentic, as he himself was interested in the events he mentions; his
                    impartiality is indubitable, as he nowhere betrays the least resentment against
                    his countrymen, and the factious partisans of Cleon, who had banished him from
                    Athens. The history of Thucydides was so admired by Demosthenes, that he
                    transcribed it eight different times, and read it with such attention, that he
                    could almost repeat it by heart. He had returned from exile in the year 403 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c.; but it is considered as doubtful whether he died at
                    Athens, or in Thrace, the country of his wife. The time of his death has not
                    been ascertained.</p>
                <p>The work of Thucydides was first printed by Aldus, Venet. 1502, fol. And the
                    Greek scholia issued from the same press in 1503. The next edition of the
                    history was printed by Junta, Florent. 1526, fol. An edition by Junta in 1506 is
                    commonly mentioned by bibliographers, but this date is supposed to be erroneous.
                    Other editions were published, by Camerarius at Basel in 1540, by Stephanus at
                    Paris in 1564 and 1588. The latter added the Latin version of Laurentius Valla,
                    which had been twice printed before the year 1500. His editions were followed by
                    that of Aemilius Portus, Francof. 1594, fol. After an interval of a century, a
                    valuable edition was published by Dr Hudson, Oxon. 1696, fol. Another edition
                    was undertaken by Joseph Wasse; but the task, which his death left imperfect,
                    was completed by Duker, Amst. 1731, 2 tom. fol. Some useful editions succeeded,
                    before the appearance of that revised by Bekker, and containing the scholia,
                    together with the annotations of Wasse and Duker, Oxon. 1821, 4 tom. 8vo. Nor
                    must we omit the edition of Goeller, Lipsiae, 1826, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=274" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0274-0254"/>2
                    tom. 8vo. A valuable edition, with English notes, chiefly historical and
                    geographical, has more recently been published by Dr Arnold, Oxford, 1830-5, 3
                    vols. 8vo. Pop-po’s very elaborate edition of Thucydides is now in the progress
                    of publication. The first volume was printed at Leipzig in 1821, and nine or ten
                    have successively appeared. Here we must not neglect to recommend another work
                    to the reader’s attention, Dodwell’s “Annales Thucydidei et Xenophontei,
                    praemisso adparatu, cum Vitae Thucydidis Synopsi chronologica.” Oxon. 1702,
                    4to.</p>
                <p>Thucydides has been translated into many of the modern languages. In 1550 an
                    English translation, not however from the Greek text, but from the French
                    version of Claude Seyssel, was published by Thomas Nicols, “citczeine and
                    goldsmyth of London.” A translation of the original was published by Hobbes in
                    1628, and another by Dr William Smith in 1753-4. A new version, illustrated with
                    copious annotations, has very recently been published by Dr Bloomfield, Lond.
                    1829, 3 vols. 8vo.</p>
