                <p><label type="entry">TOLERATION</label>, in matters of religion, is either civil
                    or ecclesiastical. Civil toleration is an impunity and safety granted by the
                    state to every sect that does not maintain doctrines inconsistent with the
                    public peace; and ecclesiastical toleration is the allowance which the church
                    grants to its members to differ in certain opinions not reputed fundamental.</p>
                <p>As the gods of paganism were almost all local and tutelary, and as it was a maxim
                    universally received that it was the duty of every man to worship, together with
                    his own deities, the tutelary gods of the country in which he might chance to
                    reside, there was no room for persecution in the heathen world, on account of
                    different sentiments in religion, or of the different rites with which the
                    various deities were worshipped. Had the primitive Christians joined their
                    fellow-citizens in the worship of Jupiter, Juno, and the rest of the rabble of
                    Roman divinities, they would have been suffered to worship, without molestation,
                    the Creator of the world and the Redeemer of mankind; for in that case the God
                    of the Christians would have been looked upon as a being of the same kind with
                    the gods of the empire, and the great principle of intercommunity would have
                    remained unviolated. But the true God had expressly prohibited both Jews and
                    Christians from worshipping any other god besides Himself; and it was their
                    refusal to break that precept of their religion which made their heathen masters
                    look upon them as atheists, and persecute them as a people inimical to the
                    state. Utility, and not truth, was the object for which the heathen legislatures
                    supported the national religion. They well knew that the stories told by their
                    poets, of their different divinities, of the rewards of Elysium, and of the
                    punishments of Tartarus, were a collection of senseless fables; but they had
                    nothing better to propose to the vulgar, and they were not such strangers to the
                    human heart as to suppose that mankind could live together in society without
                    being influenced in their conduct by some religion.</p>
                <p>Widely different from the genius of paganism was the spirit of the Jewish
                    dispensation. Truth, which is in fact always coincident with great utility, was
                    the great object of the Mosaic law. The children of Israel were separated from
                    the rest of the world, to preserve the know ledge and worship of the true God,
                    at a time when all the other nations on earth, forgetting the Lord that made
                    them, were falling prostrate to stocks and stones, and worshipping devils and
                    impure spirits. Such was the contagion of idolatry, and so strong the propensity
                    of the Israelites to the customs and manners of the Egyptians, and other
                    polytheistic nations around them, that the purpose of their separation could not
                    have been served, had not Jehovah condescended to become not only their tutelary
                    God, but even their supreme civil magistrate; so that under the Mosaic economy,
                    idolatry was the crime of high treason, and as such justly punished by the laws
                    of the state. Among the Jews, the church and state were not indeed different
                    societies. They were so thoroughly incorporated, that what was a sin in the one
                    was a crime in the other; and the forfeiture of ecclesiastical privileges was
                    the forfeiture of the rights of citizens.</p>
                <p>In many respects the Christian religion is directly opposite to the ritual law of
                    Moses. It is calculated for all, and intended to be propagated among all
                    nations. Instead of separating one people from another, one of its principal
                    objects is to disseminate universal benevolence, and to inculcate upon the whole
                    human race that mutual love which naturally springs from the knowledge that all
                    men are brethren. Its ultimate end being to train its votaries for heaven, it
                    concerns itself no further with the affairs of earth than to enforce by eternal
                    sanctions the laws of morality; and the kingdom of its Founder not being of this
                    world, it leaves every nation at liberty to fabricate its own municipal laws, so
                    as best to serve its own interest in the various circumstances in which it may
                    be placed; and denounces a <pb break="no"

                    />curse upon all who pay not to those laws the fullest obedience, when they are
                    not obviously inconsistent with the laws of piety and virtue, which are of prior
                    obligation. The Christian church therefore must always remain a society distinct
                    from the stale; and though, till the present age of hazardous innovations, it
                    has been deemed expedient in every country where the truth of the gospel is
                    admitted, to give to the religion of Christ a legal establishment, and to confer
                    immunities on its ministers, this measure has been adopted, not to secure the
                    purity of the faith, which appeals to the private judgment of each individual,
                    but merely to preserve the peace of society, and to impose a restraint upon
                    those actions of which human laws cannot take cognizance. With religion,
                    Christian governments have no further concern than as it tends to promote the
                    practice of virtue. The early Christians, however, not understanding the
                    principle upon which penal laws were employed to preserve the purity of the
                    Jewish religion, and, as our blessed Lord observed to two of his apostles, not
                    knowing what spirit they were of, hastily concluded that they had a right to
                    enforce the doctrines and worship of the New Testament, by the same means which
                    had been used to preserve the Israelites steady to the doctrines and worship of
                    the Old. Hence, though they had themselves suffered the most cruel persecutions,
                    they no sooner had the power of the state in their bands, than they persecuted
                    the pagans for their idolatry; and afterwards, when heresies arose in the
                    church, persecuted one another for expressing in different phrases metaphysical
                    propositions, of such a nature as no human mind can fully comprehend. The
                    apostle had forewarned them that there must be heresies in the church, that they
                    who are approved may be made manifest; but it did not occur to them that
                    persecution for opinion is the worst of all heresies, as it violates at once
                    truth and charity.</p>
                <p>Hitherto these unhallowed means of bringing Christians to uniformity of faith and
                    practice, had been only occasionally employed, from their not accurately
                    distinguishing between the spirit of the gospel and that of the law; but as soon
                    as the bishops of Rome had brought the inhabitants of Europe to recognise their
                    infallibility in explaining articles of faith and deciding points of
                    controversy, persecution became a regular and permanent instrument of
                    ecclesiastical discipline. To doubt or to deny any doctrine to which these
                    unerring instructors had given the sanction of their approbation, was held to be
                    not only a resisting of the truth, but an act of rebellion against their sacred
                    authority; and the secular power, of which by various arts, they hail acquired
                    the absolute direction, was instantly employed to avenge both.</p>
                <p>Thus Europe had been accustomed, during many centuries, to see speculative
                    opinions propagated or defended by force; the charity and mutual forbearance
                    which Christianity recommends with so much warmth were forgotten; the sacred
                    rights of conscience and of private judgment were unheard of; and not only the
                    idea of toleration, but even the word itself, in the sense now affixed to it,
                    was unknown. A right to extirpate error by force was universally allowed to be
                    the prerogative of those who possessed the knowledge of truth; and though the
                    first reformers did not arrogate to themselves in direct terms that
                    infallibility which they had refused to the church of Rome, they were not less
                    confident of the truth of their own doctrines, and required with equal ardour
                    the princes of their party to check such as presumed to impugn or to oppose
                    them. To this request too many of those princes lent a willing car. It flattered
                    at once their piety and their pride, to be considered as possessing all the
                    rights of Jewish princes; and Ηenry the Eighth of England, after labouring to
                    make his divines declare that all authority, ecclesiastical as well as civil,
                    flows from the crown, persecuted alternately the Papists and Protestants. Many
                    of his successors, whose characters were much better than his, thought
                    themselves duly authorized, by virtue of their acknowledged supremacy over all
                    states and conditions of men, to enforce by means of penal laws a uniformity of
                    faith and worship among their subjects; and it was not till the revolution that
                    any sect in England seems to have fully understood, that all men have an
                    unalienable right to worship God in the manner which to them may seem most
                    suitable to his nature, and the relation in which they stand to him; or that it
                    is impossible to pr&lt;κluce uniformity of opinion by any other means than
                    candid disquisition and sound reasoning. That the civil magistrate has a right
                    to check the propagation of opinions which tend only to sap the foundations of
                    virtue, and to disturb the peace of society, cannot, we think, be questioned;
                    but that he has no right to restrain mankind from publicly professing any system
                    of faith which comprehends the being and providence of God, the great laws of
                    morality, and a future state of rewards and punishments, is as evident as that
                    it is the object of religion to fit mankind for heaven, and the whole duty of
                    the magistrates to maintain peace, liberty, and property, upon earth. We have
                    elsewhere observed, that among a number of different sects of Christians, it is
                    not the superior purity of the system of faith professed by one of them, that
                    gives it a right to the immunities of an establishment in preference to all its
                    rivals; but though the legislature is authorized, in certain circumstances, to
                    make a less pure system the religion of the state, it would be the height of
                    absurdity to suppose that any man, or body of men, can have authority to prevent
                    a purer system from being acknowledged as the religion of individuals. For
                    propagating opinions and pursuing practices which necessarily create civil
                    disturbance, every man is answerable to the laws of his country; but for the
                    soundness of his faith, and the purity of his worship, he is answerable to no
                    tribunal but that which can search the heart.</p>
                <p>When churches are established, and creeds drawn up as guides to the preaching of
                    the national clergy, it is obvious that every clergyman who teaches any thing
                    directly contrary to the doctrine of such creeds, violates the condition on
                    which he holds his benefice, and may be justly deprived of that benefice,
                    whether his obnoxious opinion be in itself true or false, important or
                    unimportant; but his punishment should be extended no farther. To expel a
                    Christian from private communion for teaching any doctrine which is neither
                    injurious to the state nor contrary to the few simple articles which comprise
                    the sum of the Christian faith, is the grossest tyranny; and the governors of
                    that church which is guilty of it usurp the prerogative of the blessed Lord, who
                    commanded the apostles themselves not to be called masters in this sense; for
                    one, says he, is your master, even Christ. It is indeed a hardship to deprive a
                    man of' his living for conscientiously illustrating what he believes to be a
                    truth of the gospel, only because his illustration may be different from that
                    which had formerly been given by men fallible like himself; but if the
                    establishment of human compilations of faith be necessary, this hardship cannot
                    be removed but by making such compilations as simple as possible, and drawing
                    them up in scripture language. Such a reformation, could it be effected
                    peaceably, would serve other good purposes; for while it would sufficiently
                    guard the purity of the faith, it would withdraw that temptation which too many
                    establishments throw in the way of men to subscribe to the truth of what they do
                    not really believe; and it would effectually banish from the Christian church
                    every thing which can be called by the name of <hi rend="italic"
