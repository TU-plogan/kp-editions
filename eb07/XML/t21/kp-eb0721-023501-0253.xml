                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">THEOPHRASTUS</label>, a celebrated philosopher, was a native
                    of Eresium, a maritime town in the island of Lesbos, and is supposed to have
                    been born about the year 392 before the Christian era. His father was by trade a
                    fuller. The original name of the son, we are informed, was Tyrtamus; but on
                    account of his conspicuous eloquence, he was called Euphrastus, and afterwards
                    Theophrastus. At an early age he repaired to Athens, where he successively
                    became the disciple of Plato and of Aristotle. On the retirement of the latter,
                    he became the head of the Peripatetic school; and so high was his reputation as
                    a teacher of philosophy, that at one period the number of his scholars amounted
                    to two thousand. He appears to have reached a very advanced age. If the preface
                    to his Characters is genuine, and if one passage which it contains is correct in
                    the reading, he undertook that work at the age of ninety-nine. This statement
                    however cannot be received without the utmost suspicion. He succeeded Aristotle
                    in 322, and was himself succeeded by Strato in 287 <hi rend="smallcaps">b

                    Laertius, were very numerous; and several of them have been that period arrives,
                    the Saviour shall again, in person, revisit this world, summon from their grave
                    the bodies of all mankind who have died, change in a moment the bodies of those
                    who shall then be alive, and afterwards proceed to a solemn trial of the whole,
                    each one by himself, according to their deeds done in the body. At the close,
                    the eternal destiny of each will be announced, and the mediatorial reign of
                    Christ terminated by the introduction of the righteous into the fulness of that
                    celestial enjoyment to which our race was originally destined, and the
                    banishment of the wicked into that place which was prepared for the devil and
                    his angels. (Comp. 1 Cor. xv.; John xi. 23-26; Matt. xxv. 31—46; Rom. xiv. 9,
                    10; 2 Thess. i. 5-10, &amp;c.)</p>
                <p>Such are the leading principles of that great system of religious truth which the
                    Bible unfolds. In stating them, our object has uniformly been, with regard to
                    such as are generally adopted among pious inquirers, to present them clearly,
                    and with their Scripture evidence, to our readers; and in regard to those on
                    which differences of opinion have prevailed among such, to bring forward,
                    candidly and impartially, the views held, and the reasons urged, on both sides.
                    It is for the intelligent reader, with his Bible in his hand, to determine for
                    himself what is right; and, as one who must answer to the Judge of all for his
                    opinions as well as his conduct, to embrace and follow what he is satisfied the
                    inspired writers teach.</p>
                <p>annotations, various readings, and an index. Of the “Historia Plantarum" an
                    elaborate edition was published by Bodaeus, Amst. 1644, fol. A separate volume
                    had formerly appeared under the title of “Julii Caesaris Scaligeri
                    Animadversiones in Historias Theophrasti.” Lugduni, 1584, 8vo. The same learned
                    man had likewise published “Commentarii et Animadversiones in sex libros de
                    Causis Plantarum Theophrasti.” Lugd. 1566, fol. The octavo volume is a book of
                    rare occurrence. An English translation of the treatise on stones, accompanying
                    the original, was published by Sir John Hill, M.D. Lond. 1746, 8vo.</p>
                <p>Of the Characters of Theophrastus, the separate editions are very numerous. The
                    earliest, which only includes fifteen characters, is that of Pirckheymher,
                    Norembergae, 1527, 8vo. But for the most able and conspicuous edition we are
                    indebted to Casaubon, Lugd. 1592, 8vo. This edition, which has often been
                    reprinted, is accompanied with a most learned and elaborate commentary. Here we
                    ought not perhaps to overlook the edition of Needham, Cantab. 1712, 8vo. He has
                    published the prelections of Duport, professor of Greek at Cambridge, on
                    thirteen of the characters, and has reprinted the commentary of Casaubon. The
                    editions by Fischer in 1763, and Schneider in 1799&gt; likewise deserve to be
                    specified. The number of characters Casaubon had augmented to twenty-eight.
                    Other two were long afterwards brought to light by Ama-duzzi, who published them
                    in a splendid volume printed by Bodoni: “Characterum Ethicoum Theophrasti Eresii
                    Capita duo hactenus anecdota, quae ex cod. MS. Vaticano saeculi XL Graece
                    edidit, Latine vertit, praefatione et adnotationibus illustravit Johannes
                    Christophorus Amadu-tius.” Parmae, 1786, 4to. Here the Greek text occupies six
                    pages, but the volume extends to nearly one hundred and forty. The Characters of
                    Theophrastus have been translated into many languages. The version of La
                    Bruyere, with additional characters by the translator, ranks among the most
                    conspicuous books in the French language. His version was transferred into
                    English in 1699: Budgell’s translation of the original followed in 1713, and
                    Gally’s in 1725. A more recent version has appeared <pb break="no"

                    />under the subsequent title: “The Characters of Theophrastus, translated from
                    the Greek, and illustrated by physiognomical sketches. To which are subjoined
                    the Greek text, with notes, and hints on the individual varieties of human
                    nature. By Francis Howell.” Lond. 1824, 8vo.</p>
