                <p><label type="entry">TAYLOR, <hi rend="smallcaps">Jeremy</hi></label>, a
                    theologian of high reputation, was born at Cambridge, and was baptized on the
                    15th of August 1613. His father, a descendant of Dr Rowland Taylor who suffered
                    martyrdom in the reign of Mary, followed the humble calling of a barber. Jeremy
                    was educated at Perse’s free-school; and on the 18th of August 1626, being then
                    thirteen years of age, he was entered at Caius College as a sizar, or poor
                    scholar. He took the degree of A. B. in 1630-1, and that of A. M. in 1633.
                    According to the common account, he was elected a fellow of his college, but
                    this account seems to require confirmation. Before he attained the age of
                    twenty-one, he was admitted to holy orders; and having soon afterwards been
                    employed by a friend to supply his place at the lecture in St. Paul’s, his
                    graceful person and elocution, together with the varied richness of his style
                    and argument, speedily procured him friends and admirers. He was mentioned in
                    such favourable terms to Laud, that he was requested to preach before the
                    archbishop at Lambeth, and was highly commended for his performance. This
                    powerful patron recommended him to a vacant fellowship in All Souls College,
                    Oxford, and a great majority of the fellows voted for his admission; but as the
                    warden refused his concurrence, no election took place, and the nomination thus
                    devolved to the archbishop as visitor of the college. Taylor was appointed on
                    the 14th of January 1636. It appears <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=143" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0143-0125"
                    />from the college records that during the period of his continuing a fellow, he
                    was not a regular resident. He became chaplain to the primate, and afterwards to
                    the king; and, on the presentation of Juxon bishop of London, he was in March
                    1638 instituted to the rectory of Uppingham in Rutlandshire. Here he now fixed
                    his residence; and on the 27th of March 1639, being then in the twenty-sixth
                    year of his age, he married Phoebe Landisdale, or Langsdale, who bore him
                    several sons and daughters.</p>
                <p>The civil commotions speedily ensued; and in August 1642 he was called to Oxford
                    to attend the king in his capacity of chaplain. On the 1st of November he was
                    admit-ed by <hi rend="italic">mandamus</hi> to the degree of D.D. He now exerted
                    himself in sustaining the tottering cause of episcopacy, and published various
                    works on the controversies of those unhappy times. Whatever might be the state
                    of the argument between the contending parties, the enemies of episcopacy were
                    stronger than its friends; and for several years Dr Taylor was exposed to many
                    vicissitudes of fortune. He appears to have retired into Wales; and on the 4th
                    of February 1644 he fell into the hands of the parliamentary troops, when they
                    defeated Colonel Gerard before the castle of Cardigan. How long he was detained
                    a prisoner, it is difficult to ascertain. In conjunction with William Nicholson
                    afterwards bishop of Gloucester, and William Wyatt afterwards prebendary of
                    Lincoln, he opened a school at Newton Hall in Carmarthenshire. In 1647 was
                    published a little volume entitled “A new and easie Institution of Grammar,”
                    which contains a Latin epistle by Wyatt, and an English epistle by Taylor.</p>
                <p>Of the principles of toleration, the members of the church of England had a very
                    faint and inadequate conception, till in their turn they had begun to feel the
                    bitterness of persecution. Some of those who had been deprived of their
                    benefices, began to perceive a glimpse of purer light; and if Dr Taylor had not
                    been reduced to the condition of a wanderer, it is highly probable that he never
                    would have prepared “A Discourse of the Liberty of Prophesying; shewing the
                    Unreasonableness of prescribing to other Men’s Faith, and the Iniquity of
                    persecuting differing Opinions.” Lessons of Christian meekness were not easily
                    learned in the school of Laud; but the disposition of Taylor was naturally
                    humane, and he had derived wisdom from experience. The maxims of forbearance
                    which they were sufficiently disposed to inculcate in their season of adversity,
                    they were too generally disposed to forget on the first return of prosperity;
                    and the treatment of the non-conformists during the reign of Charles the Second,
                    has affixed an indelible stigma on the churchmen of that disgraceful era of
                    English as well as Scotish history. Let any man, whose heart is not hardened by
                    incurable bigotry, peruse the life of the eminently pious and distinguished
                    Richard Baxter, and he will very readily discover that the spirit of popish
                    intolcrance has not always been confined to the popedom.</p>
                <p>Dr Taylor’s Liberty of Prophesying, one of the most remarkable works which he
                    produced, was printed in quarto in the year 1647. In 1650 he published “The Rule
                    and Exercises of Holy Living,” and in the following year “The Rule and Exercises
                    of Holy Dying.” His first wife is supposed to have died before his retirement
                    into Wales; and his second was Joanna Bridges, who possessed a competent estate
                    at Mandinam. in the parish of Llanguedor and county of Carmarthen. Her mother’s
                    family, we are informed, was unknown; but she was generally believed to be a
                    natural daughter of Charles the First. She is said to have possessed a very fine
                    person; and, both in countenance and disposition, to have displayed a striking
                    resemblance to her unfortunate father. He must now have relinquished the
                    occupation of a schoolmaster. During his residence in Wales, he was much
                    indebted to the kindnessof Richard earl of Carbery, who resided at Golden Grove
                    in the same county, and who retained him as his chaplain. The next important
                    work which he published was “The Great Exemplar; or, the Life and Death of the
                    Holy Jesus.” Lond. 1653, fol. The work speedily obtained an extensive
                    popularity. His learned leisure was soon afterwards exposed to another
                    interruption; and, for some reason which has not been fully discovered, he was
                    imprisoned in Chepstow castle. He appears to have been in custody in the month
                    of May 1654; but, from some of his own letters, we ascertain that he was
                    released before the close of the ensuing year. According to the statement of
                    Wood, he soon afterwards settled in London, and officiated in a small and
                    private congregation. The accuracy of his statement has been called in question;
                    but it is at least certain that about this period he occasionally officiated in
                    the metropolis.</p>
                <p>In 1654 he had published a Treatise against Transubstantiation; and in 1655
                    appeared “<hi rend="italic">Unum necessarium;</hi> or, the Doctrine and Practice
                    of Repentance.” Here he found occasion to discuss the doctrine of original sin,
                    and in so Arminian a strain, that he incurred much censure, even from the
                    members of his own church. In this difficult doctrine, we consider Jonathan
                    Edwards a much safer guide than Jeremy Taylor. He endeavoured to defend his own
                    opinions in two different tracts. About this period of his life he produced
                    various other works, including a course of Sermons for the whole year. Several
                    of his smaller tracts were collected in a volume entitled “A Collection of
                    Polemical and Moral Discourses.” Lond. 1657, fol. About the beginning of the
                    ensuing year, we find him a prisoner in the Tower, to which he had been
                    committed in consequence of his bookseller having prefixed to his Collection of
                    Offices a print of Christ in the attitude of prayer; for a recent act had
                    declared such representations punishable by fine and imprisonment. His friend
                    Evelyn, to whom he had many obligations, was instrumental in procuring his
                    release, nor does he seem to have been long detained in custody. On the
                    invitation of the ear] of Conway, he afterwards emigrated to the north of
                    Ireland. He left London in June 1658, and proceeded to the county of Antrim,
                    where he appears to have divided his residence between Lisburne and Portmore,
                    about eight miles distant from that town. At Lisburne he is supposed to have had
                    a small lectureship; and he occupied a house in the immediate neighbourhood of
                    his patron’s mansion at Portmore. According to the tradition of his descendants,
                    he frequently preached to a small congregation in the half-ruined church of
                    Kilulta. His tranquillity suffered another interruption in 1659, when he was
                    represented to the Irish council as a person disaffected to the existing
                    government. A warrant was issued for bringing him to Dublin for examination, but
                    it does not appear that he was subjected to any additional annoyance.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, he devoted his learned leisure to the completion of a very
                    remarkable work, published immediately after the restoration, under the title of
                    “<hi rend="italic">Ductor Dubitantium;</hi> or, the Rule of Conscience in all
                    her general Measures.” Lond. 1660, fol. His great merit had now become too
                    conspicuous to be disregarded; and on the 6th of August he was nominated to the
                    bishopric of Down and Connor. He was soon afterwards elected vice-chancellor of
                    the university of Dublin, and this office he retained till his death. On the
                    30th of April 1661 he was appointed administrator of the bishopric of Dromore,
                    which he continued to hold with his other bishopric. In 1663 he published “A
                    Dissuasive from Popery and some answers to it having been produced, he prepared
                    a second part, which was not printed till after his death. He died at Lisburne
                    on the 13th of August 1667, having only completed the fifty-fourth year of his
                    age; and his remains were interred in the choir of the cathedral of Dromore. His
                    disease was a fever, which proved fatal in ten days. His funeral ser <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=144"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0144-0126"/> mon was preached by Dr Rust, his successor in
                    that diocese. No son, by either marriage, survived him. His eldest son, a
                    captain of horse, was killed in a duel with a brother-officer named Vane, who
                    also died of his wounds. Three of his daughters, Phoebe, Mary, and Joanna,
                    survived their father. The eldest died single; the second was married to Dr
                    Francis Marsh, who became archbishop of Dublin; and the third to Edward
                    Harrison, member of parliament for the borough of Lisburne. The bishop’s widow
                    survived him many years, but neither the time nor the place of her death has
                    been ascertained.</p>
                <p>In his numerous works, Taylor has displayed a vigorous and fervid mind, supplied
                    with ample stores of learning. His warm and excursive imagination has enabled
                    him to diffuse over his writings, even on the most abstruse subjects, a very
                    attractive and lively air. “The crowded, yet clear and luminous galaxies of
                    imagery diffused through the works of Bishop Taylor,” are mentioned in glowing
                    terms by Dr Parr. It must however be admitted that his warmth of imagination is
                    sometimes more conspicuous than his sobriety of judgment. His style is
                    distinguished by its vivacity, and is more fluent and unencumbered than that of
                    his most eminent predecessors in English literature. His popularity continues
                    unimpaired. An edition of his whole works, with a copious life of the author by
                    Bishop Heber, was published at London in the year 1822 in 15 vols. 8vo. Of some
                    of his practical treatises, the recent editions are very numerous; and this
                    complete collection has twice been reprinted. (x.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Taylor,</hi><hi rend="italic">Brook,</hi> was born at
                    Edmonton, on the 28th of August 1685. He was the son of John Taylor, Esq. of
                    Bifrons-house in Kent, by Olivia, daughter of Sir Nicholas Tempest, of Durham,
                    Baronet. His grandfather, Nathaniel Taylor, was one of those puritans whom
                    “Cromwell thought fit to elect by a letter, dated June 14th, 1653, to represent
                    the county of Bedford in parliament.” The character of his father partook in no
                    small degree of the austerity that had been transmitted to him in the line of
                    his ancestors, and by the spirit of the times in which they lived; and to this
                    cause may be ascribed the disaffection which sometimes subsisted between the
                    father and even such a son as is the subject of this article. The old
                    gentleman’s morose temper, however, yielded to the powers of music; and the most
                    eminent professors of the art in that period were hospitably welcomed in his
                    house. His son Brook was induced, by his natural genius, and by the disposition
                    of his father, which he wished by all the means in his power to conciliate, to
                    direct his particular attention to music; and he became in very early life a
                    distinguished proficient in it. To music he added another accomplishment, in
                    which he equally excelled, that of drawing and painting. His classical education
                    was conducted at home under a private tutor; and his proficiency in the ordinary
                    branches of the languages and the mathematics was so great, that he was deemed
                    qualified for the university at the early age of fifteen.</p>
                <p>In 1701 he was entered a fellow commoner of St John’s College, Cambridge. At that
                    period mathematics engaged more particularly the attention of the university;
                    and the examples of eminence in the learned world, derived from that branch of
                    science, attracted the notice and roused the emulation of every youth possessed
                    of talents and of application. In 1708 he wrote his treatise on the Centre of
                    Oscillation, which was not published in the Philosophical Transactions till some
                    years afterwards. In 1709, he took the degree of LL. B. In 1712, he was chosen a
                    Fellow of the Royal Society. During the interval between these two periods, he
                    corresponded with Dr Keill on several of the most abstruse subjects of
                    mathematical disquisition. Sir William Young informs us, that he had in his
                    possession a letter, dated in 1712, addressed to Mr Machin, which contains at
                    length a solution of Kepler’s problem, and explains the use to be derived from
                    that solution. In this year he presented to the Royal Society three different
                    papers: one on the Ascent of Water between two Glass Planes; a second, on the
                    Centre of Oscillation; and a third, on the Motion of a stretched String. It
                    appears from his correspondence with Keill, that in 1713 he presented a paper on
                    his favourite subject of Music; but this is not preserved in the
                    Transactions.</p>
                <p>His distinguished proficiency in those branches of science which engaged the
                    particular attention of the Royal Society at this period, and which embroiled
                    them in contests with foreign academies, recommended him to the notice of its
                    most illustrious members; and in 1714 he was elected to the office of secretary.
                    In this year he took the degree of LL. D.; and during the same year he
                    transmitted, in a letter to Sir Hans Sloane, an Account of some curious
                    Experiments relative to Magnetism; which, however, was not delivered to the
                    society till many years afterwards, when it was printed in the Transactions. His
                    application to those studies to which his genius inclined was indefatigable; for
                    we find that in 1715 he published in Latin his <hi rend="italic">Methodus
                    Incrementorum;</hi> a curious essay preserved in the Philosophical Transactions,

                    Attraction; and a treatise well known to mathematicians, and highly valued by
                    the best judges, his New Principles of Linear Perspective. In the same year
                    (such were his admirable talents, and so capable were they of being directed to
                    various subjects), he conducted a controversial correspondence with the Count
                    Raymond de Montmort, on the tenets of Malebranche; which occasioned his being
                    particularly noticed in the eulogium pronounced by the French academy on the
                    decease of that eminent metaphysician.</p>
                <p>The new philosophy of Newton, as it was then called, engaged the attention of
                    mathematicians and philosophers both at home and abroad. At Paris it was in high
                    estimation; and the men of science in that city were desirous of obtaining a
                    personal acquaintance with the learned secretary of the Royal Society, whose
                    reputation was so generally acknowledged, and who had particularly distinguished
                    himself in the Leibnitzian or German controversy, as we may denominate it, of
                    that period. In consequence of many urgent invitations, he determined to visit
                    his friends at Paris in the year 1716. He was received with every possible token
                    of affection and respect. Besides the mathematicians, to whom he had always free
                    access, he was here introduced to Lord Bolingbroke, the Count de Caylus, and
                    Bishop Bossuet.</p>
                <p>Early in 1717 he returned to London, and composed three treatises, which were
                    presented to the Royal Society, and published in the thirtieth volume of the
                    Transactions. About this time his intense application had to a considerable
                    degree impaired his health; and he was under the necessity of repairing, for
                    relaxation and relief to Aix-la-Chapelle. Having likewise a desire of directing
                    his attention to subjects of moral and religious speculation, he resigned his
                    office of secretary to the Royal Society in 1718. After his return to England in
                    1719, he applied to subjects of a very different kind from those that had
                    employed the thoughts and labours of his more early life. Among his papers of
                    this date, Sir William Young found detached parts of a Treatise on the Jewish
                    Sacrifices, and a dissertation of considerable length on the Lawfulness of
                    eating Blood.</p>
                <p>Toward the end of the year 1720, Dr Taylor accepted the invitation of Lord
                    Bolingbroke to spend some time at La Source, a country-seat near Orleans, which
                    he held in right of his wife, the widow of the Marquis de Vilette, nephew of
                    Madame de Maintenon. In the next year he returned to England, and published the
                    last paper which appears with his name in the Philosophical Transactions,
                    entitled an Experiment made to ascertain the Proportion of <pb break="no"

                    />Expansion of Liquor in the Thermometer, with regard to the degree of Heat.</p>
                <p>In 1721 he married Miss Bridges of Wallington, in the county of Surrey, a young
                    lady of good family, but of small fortune; and this marriage occasioned a
                    rupture with his father, whose consent he had never obtained. The death of his
                    wife in 1725, and that of an infant son, whom the parents regarded as the
                    presage and pledge of reconciliation with the father, and who actually proved
                    such, deeply affected his sensibility. During the two succeeding years he
                    resided with his father at Bifrons, where “the musical parties, so agreeable to
                    his taste and early proficiency, and the affectionate attentions of a numerous
                    family welcoming an amiable brother, so long estranged by paternal resentment,
                    not only soothed his sorrows, but ultimately engaged him to a scene of country
                    retirement, and domesticated and fixed his habits of life.” In 1725, with the
                    full approbation of his father and family, he married Sabetta, daughter of John
                    Sawbridge, Esq. of Olantigh, in Kent. In 1729, on the death of his father, he
                    succeeded to the family estate of Bifrons. In the following year he lost his
                    wife in childbed. The daughter whose birth occasioned this melancholy event
                    survived, and became the mother of Sir William Young, to whom we owe these
                    notices of his grandfather.</p>
                <p>In the interval that elapsed between the years 1721 and 1730, no production of
                    Taylor appears in the Philosophical Transactions; nor in the course of that time
                    did he publish any work. His biographer has found no traces of his learned
                    labour, excepting a Treatise of Logarithms, which was committed to his friend
                    Lord Paisley (afterward Aber-corne), in order to be prepared for the press, but
                    which probably was never printed. His health was now much impaired; relaxation
                    became necessary, and he was diverted by new connections from the habit of
                    severe study, which had distinguished the early period of his life, and which
                    had contributed to contract its duration. Happy in the social circle of domestic
                    enjoyment, and devoting his attention to business or amusement as they occurred,
                    his application and his literary emulation seem to have declined. He did not
                    long survive the loss of his second wife; and his remaining days were days of
                    increasing imbecility and sorrow. The essay entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >contemplatio Philosophica,</hi> published by Sir William Young in 1793, appears
                    to have been written about this time, and probably with a view to abstract his
                    mind from painful recollections and regret. It was the effort of a strong mind,
                    and is a most remarkable example of the close logic of the mathematician applied
                    to metaphysics. But the blow had sunk too deep for study to afford more than
                    temporary relief. The very resource was hurtful, and intense study but
                    accelerated the decline of his health. His friends offered every comfort; in
                    particular Lord Bolingbroke pressed his consolation, and sought to call his mind
                    from regret of domestic endearments to social friendship at Dawley. The
                    attention and kindness of his friends, however, could not ward off the
                    approaches of dissolution. Having survived his second wife little more than a
                    year, he died of a decline in the forty-sixth year of his age, December the
                    29th, 1731, and was buried in the churchyard of St Ann’s, Soho.</p>

                    of June 1704. His father followed the useful trade of a barber, and the son was
                    destined for the same occupation; but such was his early and unconquerable love
                    of books, that his father was in utter despair of ever making <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jack</hi> a cunning shaver, when his strong predilection for literature
                    recommended him to the patronage of a gentleman of fortune, Edward Owen, of
                    Condover, Esq., to whom he was chiefly indebted for the advantages of an
                    academical education. He was sent to St John’s College, Cambridge; and is
                    supposed to have been assisted by one of the exhibitions founded in that college
                    for the pupils of Shrewsbury school. He took the degree of A. B. in 1724, and
                    that of A. M. in 1728. At the university he speedily distinguished himself by
                    his classical attainments, and especially by his masterly knowledge of the Greek
                    language. He became a fellow and tutor of his college, and was thus placed in a
                    situation of easy competence, extremely favourable to his pursuits. His
                    academical establishment had been rendered more important by an irreconcilable
                    difference with Mr Owen, whose friendship he had forfeited by refusing to drink
                    a Jacobite toast on his bare knees. He was a Tory without being a Jacobite. The
                    Condover family then enjoyed great patronage in the church; and the dissolution
                    of this connection might perhaps occasion a change in Taylor’s views.</p>
                <p>On the 30th of January 1730 he was appointed to deliver the Latin oration then
                    annually pronounced in St Mary’s before the university; and at the ensuing
                    commencement, in the month of July, he was selected to recite the music speech.
                    He was a frequent writer of familiar verses; and several of his juvenile poems
                    have been printed by Mr Nichols.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    contributor to the “Miscellaneous Observations on Authors, ancient and modern.”
                    For this publication he wrote several articles, signed <hi rend="italic"
                    >cantabrigiensis,</hi> and one without a signature, entitled “Animadversiones in
                    Luciani Asinum.” In 1732 he was appointed librarian, and afterwards registrar,
                    of the university. The office of librarian he only retained for a short time. He
                    first distinguished himself among the scholars of the age by the publication of
                    “Lysiae Orationes et Fragmenta, Graece et Latine.” Lond. 1739, 4to. To his own
                    illustrations he added the conjectures of his friend Jeremiah Markland, an
                    excellent Grecian. This elegant publication was followed by an octavo edition,
                    printed at Cambridge in 1740, and the editor’s notes are there given in an
                    abridged form.</p>
                <p>Taylor had obtained one of the two law-fellowships in his college; and, according
                    to the academic phraseology, he proceeded in the law-line, and took the degree
                    of LL. D. in the year 1741. On this occasion he wrote an elaborate dissertation,
                    which was soon afterwards published under the title of“Commentarius ad L.
                    Decemviralem de inope Debitore in partis dissecando.” Cantab. 1742, 4to. In the
                    interpretation of this law, he has adopted the opinion of Bynkershoek, that the
                    creditors were entitled to divide, not the body, but the goods of the insolvent
                    debtor; but this opinion, which has likewise been maintained by other civilians,
                    can neither be reconciled with the obvious meaning of the words, nor with the
                    ancient mode of understanding them. On the 15th of February 1741-2, Dr Taylor
                    was admitted an advocate at Doctors Commons. It does not appear that he ever
                    engaged in the practice of the bar; but a design was about this time entertained
                    of initiating him in public business, as under-secretary of state to Lord
                    Carteret, afterwards Earl Granville. It was fortunate for the cause of learning
                    that he was not thus diverted from his more genial pursuits; and, after a short
                    interval, he exhibited a new proof of his profound knowledge of classical
                    antiquity, by the publication of his “Marmor Sandvicense, cum commentario et
                    notis.” Cantab. 1743, 4to. The very ancient marble, on which he supplies so

                    year 1739.</p>
                <p>About the beginning of the year 1744, Bishop Thomas appointed Dr Taylor
                    chancellor of the diocese of Lincoln. He was now occupied in preparing a most
                    elaborate edition of Demosthenes and other Attic orators. As a specimen, he had
                    already published the oration of Demosthenes against Midias, and that of
                    Lycurgus against Leocrates. Cantab. 1743, 8vo. After much laborious preparation,
                    he at length published, not the first, but the third volume of his projected
                    edition of Demosthenes, Aeschines, Dinarchus, and Demades: <hi rend="italic"
                    >“</hi> Δ <hi rend="italic">ημοσθένους,</hi> A <hi rend="italic">ἰσχίνου,
                    Δεινάgχου, xαὶ</hi> Δ <hi rend="italic">ημάδου τà</hi> σ <hi rend="italic"
                    >ωζομένα. Graece</hi> et Latine.” Cantab. 1748, 4to. The second volume made its
                    appearance in 1757. It contains the controversial orations of Demosthenes and
                    Aeschines, together with the epistles ascribed to the latter. The third volume
                    includes ten orations of Demosthenes. His plan extended to five volumes, but he
                    left it in this incomplete state. Two of his friends, Dr Jurin and Mr Markland,
                    supplied him with some annotations. This, like all his other works, is
                    splendidly printed. It was one defect of his edition, that he had not bestowed
                    sufficient care in purifying the text as it had been left by Wolfius. Reiske, a
                    critic not remarkable for his gentleness or candour, considers his illustrations
                    of Attic antiquities as too copious and too ostentatious; and he urges a further
                    objection, that he has not to the full extent availed himself of the assistance
                    to be derived from ancient grammarians, rhetoricians, and rhetorical
                    lexicoraphers. Of his Latinity he speaks in no favourable terms. “Dictio Taylori
                    Latina haud placet: obscura, affectata, putida est. Sed paucos novi Anglos, qui
                    Latine scribere didicissent. Latinae linguae neglectus illi genti communis est.
                    Et tamen Taylor, si ad alios Anglos spectetur, adhuc bene scribit. Melius si
                    scisset Latine, non vituperasset Wolflum.” After the death of Taylor, his papers
                    relating to the orators were by Dr Askew transmitted to Reiske, who was then
                    occupied with his edition of the <hi rend="italic">Oratores Graeci,</hi> and who
                    appears to have made a too indiscriminate use of the materials thus supplied.
                    The reputation of his predecessor he treats with little tenderness or delicacy.
                    It is however admitted by more impartial judges that Taylor possessed many
                    eminent qualifications for the difficult task which he had undertaken. To an
                    intimate knowledge of the Greek language he added a familiar acquaintance with
                    Greek antiquities; and his skill in ancient jurisprudence gave him a great
                    advantage over most of those who have laboured in the same department.<note

                <p>Dr Taylor having long continued a layman, was at length induced to take orders by
                    the prospect of a speedy vacancy in a valuable college-living. The rectory of
                    Lawford in Essex became vacant in April 1751; and being then in the
                    forty-seventh year of his age, he preferred his claim, which was not admitted
                    without considerable doubt and hesitation. As he held a lay fellowship, and had
                    thus been exempted from all ecclesiastical duties in the college and university,
                    such a claim appears to have been unprecedented, but he did not encounter any
                    effectual opposition. He became archdeacon of Buckingham in 1753, and canon
                    residentiary of St Paul’s in July 1757. During the latter year he was elected
                    prolocutor of the lower house of convocation. He was also appointed commissary
                    of Lincoln and of Stowe. Although he was so late in commencing his
                    ecclesiastical career, he is said to have been eminent as a preacher. He printed
                    two sermons; one preached at B⅛hop-Stortford School-Feast, 26th Aug. 1749, and
                    the other before the House of Commons on the fast-day, 11th Feb. 1757. In 1822
                    they were both reprinted at the suggestion of Dr Parr, who has added notes to
                    the first For his preferments he was chiefly indebted to Lord Granville, who was
                    a very competent judge of literary merit, and who had intrusted him with
                    superintending the education of his two grandsons, Thomas viscount Weymouth,
                    afterwards marquis of Bath, and Henry Frederick Thynne, afterwards Lord
                    Carteret. When the earl recommended him for the canonry, “the king said that he
                    had never heard of Dr Taylor; and that he understood it was a good piece of
                    preferment, and was usually given to a scholar of note. The artful statesman
                    took the hint, and said, the doctor’s fame was celebrated all over Germany.
                    There was no occasion to say more.” He resigned the office of registrar in 1758,
                    and quitted Cambridge to reside in London. When he entered into orders, he
                    necessarily ceased to be an advocate; but, by the unanimous consent of the
                    civilians, he usually dined four times every term at Doctors Commons.</p>
                <p>Although he ceased to be an advocate, he did not cease to be a lawyer; and the
                    next considerable work which he produced bears the title of “Elements of the
                    Civil Law.” Camb. 1755, 4to. This work, which originated from a suggestion of
                    his noble patron, exhibits great merits and no small defects. It contains very
                    ample stores of ancient literature, as well as ancient jurisprudence, and many
                    of the author’s speculations are ingenious and able. But his range of legal
                    topics is not sufficiently extensive; and his mode of discussion being very
                    desultory and digressive, his materials, often highly valuable, are not always
                    disposed to the best advantage. One of his speculations exposed him to the
                    animadversion of an outrageous controversialist. “It is not true,” he had taken
                    occasion to remark, “that the primitive Christians held their assemblies in the
                    night time, to avoid the interruptions of the civil power; but the converse of
                    that proposition is true in the utmost latitude, viz. that they met with
                    molestations from that quarter, because their assemblies were nocturnal.”<note

                <p>During the last ten years of his life, he seems to have experienced the usual
                    effects of a large participation in the emoluments of the church. His career was
                    no longer marked by a succession of elaborate publications, but he kept his
                    equipage, and lived like a prosperous gentleman. He was kind and liberal in his
                    disposition; and although he enjoyed a very ample income, he did not accumulate
                    much wealth. Having only attained the sixty-sixth year of his age, he died, very
                    generally beloved and lamented, at his residentiary house, on the 4th of April
                    1766. His remains were deposited in one of the vaults of St Paul’s, nearly under
                    the litany-desk. To the school where he had been educated he bequeathed his
                    large and valuable library, together with the residue of his fortune, for the
                    maintenance of an exhibitioner at St John’s College. He however reserved to his
                    friend Dr Askew all his MSS. and such of his <pb break="no"

                    book-collecting physician is said to have taken a very illiberal advantage, and
                    to have enforced it with the utmost rigour, so as to include a very large number
                    of books which the testator had intended to form a part of his legacy to
                    Shrewsbury school. (x.)</p>
