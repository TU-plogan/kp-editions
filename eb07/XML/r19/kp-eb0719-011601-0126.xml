                <p><label type="entry">REMBRANDT</label> Van Rhin, a Flemish painter and engraver of
                    great eminence, was born in 1606, in a mill upon the banks of the Rhine, whence
                    he derived his name of <hi rend="italic">Van Rhin.</hi> This master was born
                    with a creative genius, which never attained to perfection. It was said of him,
                    that he would have invented painting, if he had not found it already discovered.
                    Without study, without the assistance of any master, by his otvn instinct alone,
                    he formed rules, and a certain practical method for colouring; and the mixture
                    produced the designed effect. Nature is not set off to the greatest advantage in
                    his pictures; but there is such a striking truth and simplicity in them, that
                    his heads, particularly his portraits, seem animated, and rising from the
                    canvass. He was fond of strong contrasts of light and of shadow. The light
                    entered into his working-room only by a hole, in the manner of a camera obscura,
                    by which he judged with greater certainty of his productions. This artist
                    considered painting like the stage, where the characters do not strike unless
                    they are exaggerated. He did not pursue the method of the Flemish painters, that
                    of finishing his pieces. He sometimes gave his light such thick touches, that it
                    seemed more like modelling than painting. A head of his has been shown, the nose
                    of which was as thick of paint as that which he copied from nature. He was told
                    one day, that by his peculiar method of employing colours, his pieces appeared
                    rugged and uneven; but he replied that he was a painter, and not a dyer. He took
                    a pleasure in dressing his figures in an extraordinary manner; and with this
                    view he had collected a great number of eastern caps, with ancient armour and
                    drapery long since out of fashion. When he was advised to consult antiquity in
                    order to attain a better taste in drawing, in which he was usually heavy and
                    uneven, he took his counsellor to the closet where these old vestments were
                    deposited, saying, by way of derision, that these were his antiques.</p>
                <p>Rembrandt, like most men of genius, had many caprices. Being one day at work,
                    painting a whole family in a single picture, word was brought him that his
                    monkey had died; and he was so affected by the loss of this animal, that,
                    without paying any attention to the persons who were sitting for their pictures,
                    he painted the monkey upon the same canvass. This whim could not fail to
                    displease those for whom the piece was designed; but he would not efface it,
                    choosing rather to lose the sale of his picture than to act like a rational
                    being.</p>
                <p>This freak will appear the more extraordinary in Rembrandt, when it is considered
                    that he was extremely avaricious, a vice which daily grew upon him. He practised
                    various stratagems to sell his prints at a high price. The public were very
                    desirous of purchasing them, and not without reason. In his prints the same
                    taste prevails as in his pictures; they are rough and irregular, but
                    picturesque. To heighten the value of his prints, and increase their price, he
                    made his son sell them as if he had purloined them from his father; others he
                    exposed at public sales, and went thither in disguise in order to bid for them;
                    sometimes he even gave out that he was going to leave Holland and to settle in
                    another country. These stratagems were successful, and he got his own price for
                    his prints. At other times he would print his plates half finished, and expose
                    them to sale; after which he would finish them, and then they became fresh
                    plates. When any of them wanted retouching, he made some alterations; ¼ <hi
                    rend="superscript">r</hi> hich promoted the sale of his prints a third time,
                    though they differed but little from the first impressions.</p>
                <p>His pupils, who were not ignorant of his avarice, one day painted some pieces of
                    money upon cards; which Rembrandt no sooner saw than he was going to take them
                    up. He was not angry at the pleasantry; but it had no effect in checking his
                    avarice. He died in 1674-</p>
