                <p><label type="entry">ROCHESTER</label> an ancient city in the county of Kent,
                    thirty miles from London. It is commonly supposed to have been founded by the
                    ancient Britons. In the time of the Romans it was one of their military
                    stations, but did not attain any great celebrity until more than a century after
                    the arrival of the Saxons, who in the reign of King Ethelbert, constituted it
                    the seat of a bishop, and it was considered as a most important military
                    station. By the Britons it was known under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dourbrys;</hi> tile Romans called it <hi rend="italic">Durohrivoe,</hi> which
                    the Saxons changed to <hi rend="italic">Roflcaster,</hi> from which its present
                    name has been derived. It is situated on the river Medway, a stream which,
                    rising in the centre of Kent, becomes navigable at Maidstone, and increases,
                    till, near Rochester, it is affected by the tides, which reach it from the
                    Thames at the Nore. At Rochester is the first bridge over that fine stream. This
                    bridge, built in the reign of King John, with the exception of the bridges in
                    London, was long deemed superior to any other in the kingdom in height,
                    strength, and elegance. It consists of eleven arches, three of which have been
                    rebuilt, and the whole, by modern improvement, widened and beautified, and
                    ornamented with balustrades, panels, and bold copings.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=318"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0318-0308"/>
                <p>The largest arch is forty feet span, and the others thirty feet. The length is
                    560 feet, and the breadth twenty-four feet between the parapets. The river
                    Medway is capable of receiving the largest vessels up to Rochester, but few are
                    moored off the city, as Chatham, a mile lower down the river, is more convenient
                    from the vicinity to the naval arsenal and the docks.</p>
                <p>The ancient castle is an interesting object to all antiquaries. It stands on the
                    south-west side of the city, on such an elevated spot that it can be seen at
                    thirty miles distance. The streets of this city have no peculiar feature, except
                    the narrowness and length; for in fact it consists chiefly of a single street,
                    which is a continuation of Stroud towards the west and of Chatham towards the
                    east, forming two rows of moderate houses, more than two miles from one end to
                    the other, with a few short streets or lanes leading from them southward. With
                    the exception of the cathedral, hereafter to be noticed, the town-hall is the
                    most remarkable edifice: it was built in 1687. It is a handsome structure, with
                    a spacious entrance-hall and staircase, the ceilings of both which are very
                    curiously ornamented. Here the city business is transacted; and at the back part
                    is the city jail. There is a free school, several charitable institutions, a
                    customhouse, and a market-house. The diocese of Rochester is the smallest in the
                    kingdom. It had a cathedral as early as the year 600, which was destroyed by
                    Ethelbert, king of Mercia, in 676; and a few years after the city suffered much
                    by the incursions of the Danes, but appears to have recovered some degree of
                    respectability by the accession of King Athelstan, who appointed masters of the
                    mint to superintend the coinage of money. The cathedral had been dilapidated at
                    the Norman conquest; but Gundulph, who was removed from Normandy to fill the
                    see, acquired money sufficient to rebuild the sacred edifice, though he died in
                    1094, before it was finished. Like most of the more ancient ecclesiastical
                    erections, its plan is an improvement on the basilica of Rome, and it is built
                    in the form of the cross of Christ, with a massive square tower at the point of
                    intersection. The interior space to the west of the cross was the nave or body
                    of the church, which represented the ship of St Peter: this part is more ancient
                    than the nave of any other cathedral in the kingdom, and still retains most of
                    the peculiar features of the style in which it was originally built, and is
                    indeed one of the most interesting specimens of Norman architecture. The whole
                    length of this nave is a hundred and fifty feet, and its breadth between the
                    pillars thirty-three feet, and from one wall to the other seventy-five feet. The
                    choir has an ascent of ten steps, and is a hundred and fifty-six feet in length.
                    The western front of the cathedral, one of the most perfect specimens of
                    Anglo-Norman architecture, was constructed with consummate ability at a period
                    when the art had arrived at a high point of perfection. The centre door is
                    formed of a semicircular arch, composed of rich mouldings, and is supported by
                    four pillars, with capitals of wreathed foliage. Two of these pillars take the
                    form of Caryatides, and present statues of King Henry I. and his queen Matilda,
                    the daughter of Malcolm III. king of Scotland, being undoubtedly two of the most
                    ancient statues remaining in England. This building presents many other objects
                    of very high interest to the student and the admirer of ancient architecture.
                    The cathedral contains but few monuments, and none with any striking
                    peculiarity.</p>
                <p>Rochester is not a place of much trade, except what arises from the great number
                    of travellers passing through it in their way by Dover to and from the
                    continent. The chief occupation is a considerable oyster-fishery, from beds in
                    the river Medway, which river is under the concurrent jurisdiction of its own
                    corporate body, and that of the lord-mayor and aldermen of London. The latter
                    body make periodical visits of conservancy by water, and on such occasions the
                    two corporations indulge together in sumptuous festivity. For municipal
                    purposes, the city is divided into three wards, and is governed by a mayor, six
                    aldermen, and seventeen councillors. The recorder and justices of the peace are
                    appointed by the crown. The city returns two members to parliament. There is a
                    well-supplied market on Fridays, and several annual fairs. The population
                    amounted in 1821 to 8795, and in 1831 to 9811.</p>
