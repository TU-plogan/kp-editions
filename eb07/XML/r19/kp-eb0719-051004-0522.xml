                <p><label type="entry">ROXBURGHSHIRE</label> a county in Scotland, on its
                    south-eastern extremity, where it joins England, situated between 55. 6. and 55.
                    43. north latitude, and between 2. 12. and 3. 7. west longitude from Greenwich.
                    It is sometimes called Teviotdale, from its principal river the Teviot, but
                    improperly, as it also includes a tract called Liddesdale on the south-west,
                    which is unconnected with the Teviot. Its boundaries are Berwickshire, from
                    which it is separated in part by the river Tweed on the north, Selkirkshire and
                    Dumfriesshire on the west and south-west, and the English counties of Cumberland
                    and Northumberland on the south-east and east. Between Berwickshire and
                    Selkirkshire a small tract touches the county of Mid-Lothian; on the south,
                    between Dumfriesshire and Cumberland, the county terminates almost in a point;
                    on the west it in some places surrounds small portions of Selkirkshire, and in
                    others projects into that county; and it has the Cheviot Hills on the east, the
                    outline being exceedingly irregular on all sides. Its greatest length is nearly
                    forty-one miles, and its greatest breadth about thirty miles. According to the
                    latest authorities, its area is 715 square miles, or 457,600 English acres,
                    containing thirty-two entire parishes, and part of other four, which properly
                    belong to the counties adjoining. In an agricultural view, it may be considered
                    as divided into arable land and hilly pasture; the pasture land, estimated at
                    about three fifths of the whole, occupying the eastern, southern, and western
                    quarters, and surrounding, in a circular form, the arable, which lies on the
                    north and north-east sides of the county. The arable, pasture, and <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=523"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0523-0511"/>meadow lands, are estimated at 300,000 acres. The
                    wood planted may be calculated at 15,000 acres.</p>
                <p>Except upon the banks of the streams, which are commonly of no great width, there
                    is very little level or flat land in this district; and, compared with the high
                    grounds in other parts of Scotland, hardly any part of it can be said to be
                    mountainous. The cultivated districts are beautifully diversified with narrow
                    valleys, each traversed by its own rivulet, often fringed with wood, and bounded
                    by gentle acclivities; and the hills in pasture are, with few exceptions,
                    clothed in verdure to their very summits. On the confines of Northumberland, the
                    most elevated quarter, the hills seldom reach the height of 2000 feet, but there
                    are many from that height down to 1000 or 800 feet. The most considerable are
                    the Minto and the Eildon Hills, both in the arable division; and Dunion,
                    Ruberslaw, Wisp, Hownam Law, Millenwood-Fell, Carter-Fell, and Chillhill, in the
                    pastoral districts. Most of them having a conical form, insulated at their base
                    by streamlets, and not rising in a continuous range, present very conspicuous
                    objects, and at a distance seem higher than they are found to be when
                    approached. The beauties of the natural scenery have been heightened and
                    improved by the wealth and industry of its inhabitants; all this division
                    abounding in gentlemen’s seats, comfortable and even elegant farm-houses, the
                    fields enclosed with hedges of thorn, and belts of wood, and many spots covered
                    with young trees. On the skirts of the hills, too, cultivation has of late made
                    considerable progress, as much, perhaps, as could be expected in the natural
                    circumstances of the country; but the interior of the pastoral district is in
                    general naked, without trees or fences, and very thinly inhabited.</p>
                <p>The prevailing soil of the arable land, and over most of the hills, is what is
                    called a sandy loam, though of different qualities, excellently adapted to the
                    turnip culture. Tracts of a clayey or more heavy soil, however, occupy a
                    considerable space, especially on the north-west. Clay is also found on the
                    north, near the Tweed, where it is rich and fertile. Moss, marsh, and heath
                    occur in the south-west, and occasionally in other quarters; but altogether they
                    cover but a small proportion of the surface.</p>
                <p>No district in Britain is better supplied with streams, though it has only two
                    that deserve the name of rivers, the Tweed and the Teviot. The Tweed, which
                    crosses the northern part of the county, and for part of its course forms the
                    boundary with Berwickshire, enters it from Selkirkshire on the north-west, and
                    leaves it below Redden on the north-east, carrying with it nearly all the waters
                    that pass through or have their source in this district. Its banks, especially
                    near Kelso, where it is crossed by an elegant bridge, built by Rennie between
                    the years 1799 and 1803, are perhaps equal in richness and beauty to those of
                    any river of the same extent in Britain. The Teviot more properly belongs to
                    this county, rising and terminating witfiin its bounds. It has its source in the
                    south-west extremity, near the confines of Dumfriesshire, and flowing north-east
                    almost through the middle of the district, joins the Tweed, in which its name is
                    lost, a little above the town of Kelso. From Hawick downwards it is a
                    considerable stream, and, like the Tweed, flows through a very fertile and
                    well-cultivated country. The principal rivulets that fall into the Teviot from
                    the south are Allen, Slittrick, Rule, Jed, Oxnam, and Kale; and from the north
                    and west Borthwick and Ale. The Liddel and Hermitage, which run on the
                    south-west, and whose united streams retain the name of Liddel, from which this
                    tract is called Liddesdale, soon leave Roxburghshire, and after forming the
                    boundary between Dumfriesshire and Cumberland, fall into the Esk above Longtown.
                    The other streams are the Etterick, which joins the Tweed from the south-west as
                    it enters this county; the Allen and the Leader, which fall into the same river
                    from the north; and the Eden, which, after an easterly course, partly on the
                    boundary with Berwickshire, enters the Tweed on the north-east, a little before
                    it leaves the county. The Beaumont also rises here amongst the Cheviot Hills on
                    the east, but after a short course passes by Kirk-Yetholm, and enters
                    Northumberland. Of the smaller streams, the Ale, Jed, Rule, and Hermitage are
                    distinguished for their natural scenery, to which we may add the Liddel,
                    celebrated by the late Dr Armstrong, a native of Liddesdale. Tweed is the only
                    river frequented by salmon, except at the time of spawning, when they are found
                    in most of the other streams. Trout abounds in the Ale, Rule, Jed, and Kale; and
                    there are a few small lakes which contain perch and pike.</p>
                <p>Roxburghshire is by no means rich in minerals. The clay-slate or graywacke
                    formation extends all along the western part, round by the top of Liddesdale,
                    and then up through part of the parishes of Oxnam, Jedburgh, and Crailing. The
                    coal series of rocks occupies nearly the whole district of Liddesdale. Trap-rock
                    and porphyry constitute the formation of the eastern part, but they are also
                    protruded in large masses through the clay-slate, coal, and sandstone
                    formations, in all parts of the country. The old red sandstone extends along the
                    confines of Berwickshire, down between the clay-slate and the trap-rock, to
                    nearly the lower end of the parish of Hobkirk; a belt of it also intervenes
                    between the coal series and the clay-slate. Two dikes of mountain limestone
                    appear in Liddesdale; one a few miles above Castleton, and the other at Fanna
                    Hill, at the top of the dale. At Carter-Fell a larger portion is found.
                    Different kinds of agate, and sundry varieties of jasper, are also to be met
                    with. Coal has been found at the Carter-Fell, in the southern extremity of
                    Liddesdale, in the parishes of Bedrule and Linton, and in one or two other
                    places; but the workings have been so expensive in comparison with the value of
                    the coal, that they have been given up. Limestone, which abounds in various
                    parts, is not wrought to any extent, owing to the want of coal. There are
                    excellent sandstone quarries at Sprouston on the Tweed, and marl in several
                    parishes, particularly at Eckford on the Teviot, Linton Loch, and Ednam near the
                    Tweed. But the use of marl as a manure is confined to a narrow circle around the
                    places where it is found; lime, of which a much smaller quantity answers the
                    purpose, being most in request. The lime, like the coal, is procured from
                    Northumberland and Mid-Lothian, being a distance of from twenty to thirty miles
                    from many parts of the arable district. Coals could be procured nearer, at Tyne
                    Head, and at a much cheaper rate for the west of the shire, if the Duke of
                    Northumberland would allow a road to be made across the border, through his
                    estate.</p>
                <p>The valued rent of Roxburghshire is L.314,663. 6s. 4d. Scotch, being, next to
                    Fife and Perth, the highest in Scotland; and the real rent of the lands, in
                    1811, was L.230,663. 9s. 9d. sterling, and of the houses L.11,508. 6s. 3d. The
                    annual value of real property in 1815 amounted to L.254,180. It is one of the
                    few counties where the rent in sterling falls below the valuation in Scotch
                    money; a circumstance which is certainly not owing to the want of improvements
                    to sustain rent, nor to the present rents being too low, but to the mistaken
                    vanity of its land-owners, whose rent-rolls at the time of the valuation are
                    understood to have been stated too high. Of this valuation, which in 1811 was
                    divided amongst three hundred and forty-nine estates, but one third belongs to
                    lands under entail, and more than two thirds to families of the name of Kerr,
                    Scott, Elliot, and Douglas. The principal proprietors are the Dukes of Roxburghe
                    and Buccleuch, the Marquis of Lothian, the Earl of Minto, and Douglas of Cavers;
                    but there are thirty-three estates in all that have a valued rent of L.2000
                    each, and fifty-five more are from L.500 to L.2000. Yet moderate and small <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=524"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0524-0512"/>properties are very numerous, the remaining two
                    hundred and sixty-one estates being under L.500 Scotch. Several of these,
                    exceeding a valuation of L.400 Scotch, and held of the crown, have been acquired
                    by professional farmers. Among the seats in the county, which are too numerous
                    to be mentioned here, the most splendid is Fleurs, the mansion of the Duke of
                    Roxburghe, beautifully situated at the confluence of the Tweed and Teviot, near
                    Kelso. Abbotsford, the seat of the late Sir Walter Scott, is also situated in
                    this county. It is placed on a bank overhanging the south side of the Tweed, and
                    is about half-way between Melrose and Selkirk. The property attached to it is
                    judiciously laid out with thriving plantations; and in improving his land, Sir
                    Walter gave a stimulus that has had the happiest effects on the agriculture and
                    appearance of this beautiful district.</p>
                <p>Roxburghshire is divided, for the most part, into larger farms, if we except a
                    few sheep-farms in the Highlands, than any other county in Scotland; many of
                    them, consisting of land partly arable and partly pasture, being from 1000 to
                    3000 acres, and several of these, in some instances, being in the occupation of
                    one tenant. Farms altogether arable, containing from 500 to 1000 acres, are not
                    uncommon. The capital and knowledge required for conducting concerns so
                    extensive entitle such men to suitable accommodations in their houses and
                    farm-offices, many of which are accordingly laid out and constructed in a
                    superior style. The average rent of arable land varies from 15s. to L.2.10s. an
                    acre, according to the quality of the soil and the distance from market. The
                    rents of sheep-farms are calculated, not by the number of acres, but by the
                    number of sheep that can be supported thereon. The grazing of an ox or cow, in
                    various parts of the county, is from L.l. 10s. to L.7 a year; that of a sheep
                    from 5s. to L.l, one of the Cheviot breed being charged about one half less than
                    one of the Leicester breed. Farms are generally let on leases at fifteen and
                    nineteen years. On some of the Buccleuch estates it is nine years, but the
                    leases are usually renewed at the end of that period. On other estates the
                    leases vary from five to eleven years.</p>
                <p>Most of the farm-servants are married, and live in houses apart, set down
                    together in some convenient quarter of the farm, each having a small garden
                    attached. It is the practice here, as in other parts of the lowlands of
                    Scotland, to pay most of their wages in the produce of the farm, and not in
                    money, every married ploughman, or <hi rend="italic">hind,</hi> getting a
                    certain quantity of com, a cow kept, and some land allowed for potatoes, and
                    often also for flax; he is also commonly allowed to keep a pig and a few hens.
                    The value of his income may be calculated to be between L.25 and L.28 a year.
                    Whatever may be the fluctuation of the markets, these labourers are thus always
                    provided with the necessaries of life; and the sale of the butter made from
                    their cow, with its calf, and the eggs of their poultry, and, if the family be
                    not large, a part of their corn, supplies them with the other articles they
                    need; whilst they fatten their pigs, and work up the flax for the use of their
                    families. No class of men of their rank are to be compared with these hinds for
                    propriety of conduct and frugality; and few of the labouring classes any where
                    are so comfortable and contented with their condition.</p>
                <p>The wages of a shepherd are much higher than those of a hind. These, however,
                    fluctuate with the value of stock. Shepherds are allowed in many instances
                    thirty sheep, the right of keeping a cow, with one or two pigs, and have besides
                    a certain quantity of potato-ground. With these advantages, they realize
                    considerable property, so that not a few are able in the course of years to take
                    farms.</p>
                <p>The system of farming is generally what is called the four and five year shift
                    rotation of cropping. The five-year shift is that which is now most generally
                    adopted, and is as follows: First year, fallow or turnip; second year, wheat,
                    after plain fallow; third and fourth years, grass; fifth year, oats. There may
                    be a variation after turnip in the second year, when barley or oats can be sown
                    instead of the wheat, if the season is bad. Under a six years’ course, the most
                    profitable on rather weak soils, and in a district where there are no large
                    towns to furnish manure, the rotation from pasture is oats, turnips, barley or
                    wheat, clover and rye-grass, partly cut for hay the first year, but chiefly
                    pastured with sheep, and then continued in pasture two years longer. Under this
                    system the crops are almost always good, and the land, instead of being
                    exhausted, is kept in a state of progressive improvement. Though little of the
                    soil be naturally adapted to wheat, yet this grain is now raised to a great
                    extent on all the better descriptions of sandy loam; generally after turnips,
                    which are eaten on the ground by sheep, which, by their treading, give
                    consistency to the soil, as well as leave it greatly enriched by their manure.
                    Only a small part is under beans, and somewhat more under pease; barley has in
                    many instances been superseded by wheat, so that wheat and oats are the
                    principal crops of grain; whilst, whatever be the number of acres in corn,
                    nearly half the quantity is allotted to turnips, and the other half to clover
                    and ryegrass. Potatoes occupy but a very small part of every farm; and flax,
                    where raised at all, is only in small patches for the use of the farm-servants.
                    The turnip crop, however, has for a series of years been attacked with a disease
                    which is popularly known by the name of <hi rend="italic">fingers and toes.</hi>
                    It converts the bulb of the turnip, when one has been allowed to form, into a
                    shapeless and morbid mass, which no animal will eat; and becomes putrid, and
                    disappears altogether on the first approach of frost. It often prevails over
                    extensive fields, whilst others adjoining escape; and it seems to make no
                    difference whether the land be fresh from pasture or has been long in tillage.
                    Various conjectures have been formed as to the cause or causes of this evil; and
                    the general opinion is, that it is owing to the constant repetition, within a
                    given time, of a turnip crop. To abate the evil, lime, and a proper attention to
                    the change of rotation, are necessary.</p>
                <p>The pastoral district of this county is occupied with an excellent breed of sheep
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Cheviot,</hi> from the general name of the hills on
                    which they feed; for an account of which breed we must refer to the article
                    Agriculture. On the arable farms, the short-horned cattle and Leicester sheep,
                    neither of them, however, always in a pure state, form the principal stock; and
                    as so large a proportion of even the arable land is always in grass, the number
                    of both is very great. On farms partly arable and partly hill-pasture, the cross
                    between the Cheviot and the Leicester is found to answer very well. Many of the
                    farmers of late have purchased Highland stots or kyloes at the Falkirk trysts,
                    which have been wintered for a year and then sold to advantage. The greatest
                    improvement recently made is sheep or surface drains, which have not only had
                    the effect of drying the meadow and marshy land, and thereby adding to the
                    fineness and thickness of the grass, but also of curing to a great extent the
                    rot and several other disorders which afflicted the sheep. By means of turnips,
                    most of the disposable stock, whether of cattle or sheep, are carried forward
                    till they are ready for the butcher, when the far greater part is sent to the
                    weekly market of Morpeth in Northumberland, for the consumption of Newcastle and
                    other towns in the north of England.</p>
                <p>The progress which agriculture has made in this district has not been much
                    favoured by its situation in regard to markets, coal, and lime. Weckly markets
                    are held at Jedburgh, Hawick, and Kelso, where the corn is sold by sample upon
                    very short credit, what is bought being paid for next market-day. Kelso market
                    is the best attended,</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=525"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0525-0513"/>
                <p>and the grain bought there is sent to Berwick for exportation to London. A
                    considerable proportion is also sent to Dalkeith, and paid for by ready money.
                    The carts that attend the Dalkeith market, on their return bring back coals or
                    lime, which abound in that quarter. Bone manure, which is now getting into
                    general use, is principally procured from Berwick. If either of the railways
                    projected for connecting Newcastle and Edinburgh be carried into effect, it will
                    be of great advantage to the county.</p>
                <p>The towns are Kelso, Jedburgh, Hawick, and Melrose; and of the villages the most
                    considerable are Yetholm and Kirk-Yetholm, near its eastern boundary. For
                    notices of the towns, the reader is referred to them under their alphabetical
                    heads. The two Yetholms are worthy of notice for their fairs, at which a great
                    part of the cattle, sheep, and wool of the county are sold; and Kirk-Yetholm is
                    remarkable for being the principal colony of gipsies in Scotland. At Jedburgh,
                    Kelso, Melrose, and the village of Gatton-side, there are some valuable
                    orchards, particularly at Jedburgh and Melrose, where some very old trees which
                    belonged to their abbeys are still remarkably prolific.</p>
                <p>This county, placed on the borders of the two kingdoms, which were constantly at
                    war with each other, presents the ruins of a great many castles and towers, and
                    other remains, of an early age. Amongst these may be mentioned the Castles of
                    Hermitage in Liddesdale; Cessford in Eckford parish; Ferniehirst near Jedburgh;
                    Brankholm on the banks of the Teviot, several miles above Hawick; and Harden,
                    situated in Borthwick Vale, a mile from Hawick, formerly the seat of the Scotts
                    of Harden. The site where the important Castleof Jedburgh stood is now occupied
                    by a prison. The celebrated Catrail, erected by the Britons under the Roman
                    yoke, and also the Roman road, both cross this county. Their remains can be
                    distinctly traced. The county was also distinguished for its religious
                    buildings, for which we refer to the articles Jedburgh, Kelso, and Melrose. The
                    ancient burgh and town of Iloxburghe, which at one time was the fourth town in
                    Scotland in importance and population, was situated on the beautiful peninsula
                    formed by the junction of the Tweed and the Teviot rivers. It was regularly
                    fortified by walls and ditches; and although it cannot be traced to a remoter
                    period than the reign of Alexander I., it is believed to have been a royal burgh
                    before that time, and, as such, governed by an alderman and inferior
                    functionaries. It formed one of the court of four boroughs, which by the wisdom
                    of David I. was instituted as a higher court, for hearing and deciding upon the
                    appeals brought before them by the other royal burghs of the kingdom. Money was
                    also coined here, and coins are yet to be seen in the depositories of
                    antiquaries, of the date of William the Lion and James II. Situated as it was at
                    the foot of one of the strongest castles on the border, it underwent many
                    changes. It was several times burned by the English army, particularly in the
                    years 1369 and 1460. This was the more easily accomplished from the buildings
                    being almost entirely of wood; and its restoration in a short time may be
                    explained from the abundant supply of wood yielded by the forests which then
                    covered the country. Its site has been partly used for centuries, and is still
                    used, for holding the ancient fair of St James. During the summer of 1842, a
                    considerable portion of the ancient foundations was uncovered by the plough. The
                    castle of the same name was built on an eminence at the west end of the town.
                    This eminence rises to the height of nearly forty feet above the level of the
                    Teviot, which here runs at the south base of the castle. The waters of the river
                    were made subservient to fill the deep fosse which surrounded the fortress on
                    the west, north, and east sides, by means of a dam thrown obliquely across the
                    stream. Only a few remains of what appear to be the outward defences are now
                    standing, but by their thickness they attest its prodigious strength. The
                    interior of the building is now so overgrown with tall trees, that it is
                    impossible to give any idea of the formation of its defences within. What
                    remains is most probably the foundations of the fort erected by the Earl of
                    Somerset after his expedition into Scotland in the year 1547. But it is needless
                    to enter into historical (acts connected with this fortress, as these will be
                    given under the history of Scotland.</p>
                <p>There are various fairs held in the county. The most important are, St Boswell’s,
                    held on the 18th of July, for cattle, sheep, horses, linen and woollen cloth;
                    and St James’s, held on the 5th of August, for nearly the same articles as at St
                    Boswell’s. There are also fairs held at Melrose, Yetholm, Hawick, Jedburgh,
                    &amp;c.</p>
