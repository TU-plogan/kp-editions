                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">RICARDO</label> David, the most distinguished political
                    economist since Dr Smith, was the third of a numerous family, and was born in
                    the city of London on the 19th of April 1772. His father, a native of Holland,
                    and of the Jewish persuasion, settled in this country early in life. He is said
                    to have been a man of good talents and the strictest integrity; and having
                    become a member of the Stock Exchange, he acquired a respectable fortune, and
                    possessed <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=240"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0240-0230"/>considerable influence in his circle. David was
                    destined ' for the same line of business as his father; and received, partly in
                    England, and partly at a school in Holland, where he resided two years, such an
                    education as is usually given to young men intended for the mercantile
                    profession. Classical learning formed no part of his early instruction. He began
                    to be confidentially employed by his father, in the business of the Stock
                    Exchange, when he was only fourteen years of age. Neither then, however, nor at
                    any subsequent period, was he wholly engrossed by the combinations and details
                    of his arduous and difficult profession. From his earliest years he evinced a
                    taste for abstract and general reasoning; and manifested that determination to
                    probe every subject of interest to the bottom, and to form bis opinion upon it
                    according to the unbiassed conviction of his mind, which was always one of the
                    distinguishing features of his character.</p>
                <p>Mr Ricardo’s freedom and independence of mind did not accord with the prejudices
                    of his father, who had been accustomed to subscribe, without investigation, to
                    the opinions of his ancestors, on all questions connected with religion and
                    politics, and who was desirous that his children should do the same. But this
                    system of passive obedience, and blind submission to the dictates of authority,
                    was quite repugnant to the principles of young Ricardo, who, at the same time
                    that he never failed to testify the sincerest affection and respect for his
                    father, found reason to differ from him on many important points, and to become
                    a convert to the Christian faith.</p>
                <p>Not long after this event, and shortly after he attained the age of majority, Mr
                    Ricardo formed a union, productive of unalloyed domestic happiness, with Miss
                    Wilkinson. Having, in consequence of this conduct, been entirely separated from
                    his father, he was thrown wholly on his own resources, and commenced business
                    for himself. At this important epoch of his history, the oldest and most
                    respectable members of the Stock Exchange gave a striking proof of the esteem
                    entertained by them for his talents and the integrity of his character, by
                    voluntarily coming forward to support and assist him in his undertakings. His
                    success exceeded the most sanguine expectations of his friends, and in a few
                    years he realized an ample fortune.</p>
                <p>“The talent for obtaining wealth,” says a near relation of Mr Ricardo’s, from
                    whose interesting account of his life we have borrowed these particulars, “is
                    not held in much estimation; but perhaps in nothing did Mr Ricardo more evince
                    his extraordinary powers, than he did in his business. His complete knowledge of
                    all its intricacies; his surprising quickness at figures and calculation; his
                    capability of getting through, without any apparent exertion, the immense
                    transactions in which he was concerned; his coolness and judgment, combined
                    certainly with (for him) a fortunate tissue of public events, enabled him to
                    leave all his contemporaries at the Stock Exchange far behind, and to raise
                    himself infinitely higher, not only in fortune, but in general character and
                    estimation, than any man had ever done before in that house. Such was the
                    impression which these qualities had made on his competitors, that several of
                    the most discerning among them, long before he had emerged into public
                    notoriety, prognosticated, in their admiration, that he would live to fill some
                    of the highest stations in the state.” <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>According as his solicitude about his success in life declined, Mr Ricardo began
                    to devote a greater portion of his time to scientific and literary pursuits.
                    When about twenty-five years of age, he began to study some branches of
                    mathematical science, and made considerable progress in chemistry and
                    mineralogy. He fitted up a laboratory, formed a collection of minerals, and was
                    one of the original members of the Geological Society. It is known, however,
                    that he never entered warmly into the investigation of these sciences. Thcy were
                    not adapted to the peculiar cast of his mind; and he abandoned them entirely, as
                    soon as his attention was directed to the more congenial study of political
                    economy.</p>
                <p>Mr Ricardo is stated to have first become acquainted with the “Wealth of Nations”
                    in 1799, while on a visit to Bath, where he had accompanied Mrs Ricardo for the
                    benefit of her health. He was highly gratified by its perusal; and it is most
                    probable that the inquiries about which it is conversant continued henceforth to
                    occupy a considerable share of his attention, though it was not till a later
                    period that he became so exclusively occupied with their study.</p>
                <p>Mr Ricardo first came before the public as an author in 1809. The rise in the
                    market-price of bullion, and the fall of the exchange that had taken place that
                    year, had excited a good deal of attention. Mr Ricardo applied himself to the
                    consideration of the subject; and the studies in which he had been latterly
                    engaged, combined with the experience which he had derived from the vast extent
                    of his moneyed transactions, enabled him not only to perceive the true cause of
                    the phenomena in question, but to trace and exhibit its practical bearing and
                    real effect. When Mr Ricardo began this investigation, he had no intention of
                    laying the result of his researches before the public. But having shown his
                    manuscript to Mr Perry, then proprietor and editor of the Morning Chronicle, he
                    was prevailed upon by him, though not without considerable difficulty, to
                    consent to its publication, in the shape of letters, in that journal. The first
                    of these letters appeared on the 6th of September, 1809. They made a
                    considerable impression, and elicited various answers. This success, and the
                    increasing interest of the subject, induced Mr Ricardo to commit his opinions
                    upon it to the judgment of the public, in a more enlarged and systematic form,
                    in the celebrated tract entitled “The High Price of Bullion a Proof of the
                    Depreciation of Bank Notes.” This tract led the way in the far-famed bullion
                    controversy. It issued from the press several months previously to the
                    appointment of the bullion committee; and is believed to have had no
                    inconsiderable effect in forwarding that important measure. In this tract Mr
                    Ricardo showed that redundancy and deficiency of currency are only <hi
                    rend="italic">relative</hi> terms; and that so long as the currency of a
                    particular country consists exclusively of gold and silver coins, or of paper
                    convertible into them, it is impossible that its value should either rise above
                    or fall below the value of the currencies of other countries, by a greater sum
                    than will suffice to defray the expense of importing foreign coin or bullion if
                    the currency be deficient, or of exporting a portion of the existing supply if
                    it be redundant. But when a country issues an inconvertible paper-money, as was
                    then the case with England, it cannot be exported to other countries in the
                    event of its becoming relatively redundant at home; and whenever, therefore, the
                    exchange with foreign states is depressed below, or the price of bullion rises
                    above, its mint price, more than the expense of sending coins abroad, it is a
                    conclusive proof that too much paper has been issued, and that its value is <hi
                    rend="italic">depreciated from excess.</hi> The principles which pervade the
                    Report of the bullion committee are substantially the same with those which
                    pervade Mr Ricardo’s pamphlet; but the more comprehensive and popular manner in
                    which they are illustrated in the Report, and their being recommended by a
                    committee composed of some of the ablest members of the House of Commons, gave
                    them a weight and authority which they could not otherwise have obtained. And

                    have since been carried into full effect, and afford one of the most memorable
                    and encouraging examples in the history of the country, of the triumph of
                    principle over selfishness, sophistry, and error.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The fourth</hi> edition of this tract is the most valuable; for
                    an Appendix is added to it, in which there are some acute and ingenious
                    observations on some of the most difficult and delicate points involved in the
                    theory of exchange; and which also contains the first germ of the happy idea of
                    making bank-notes exchangeable for bars of gold bullion.</p>
                <p>Among those who entered the lists in opposition to the principles laid down, and
                    the practical measures suggested, in Mr Ricardo’s tract, and in the Report of
                    the bullion committee, a very prominent place is due to Mr Bosanquet. This
                    gentleman had great experience as a merchant; and as he professed that the
                    statements given in his “Practical Observations,” and which are completely at
                    variance with those in the Report, were the result of a careful examination of
                    the <hi rend="italic">theoretical</hi> opinions of the committee by the test of
                    fact and experiment, they were well calculated to make, and did make, a very
                    considerable impression. The triumph of Mr Bosanquet and his friends was,
                    however, of very short duration. Mr Ricardo did not hesitate to attack this
                    formidable adversary in his stronghold. His second tract, entitled “Reply to Mr
                    Bosanquet’s Practical Observations on the Report of the Bullion Committee,” was
                    published in 1811, and is perhaps the best controversial essay that has ever
                    appeared on any disputed question of political economy. In this pamphlet, Mr
                    Ricardo met Mr Bosanquet on his own ground, and overthrew him with his own
                    weapons. He examined all the proofs which Mr Bosanquet had brought forward, of
                    the pretended discordance between the principles advanced in his own pamphlet,
                    and in the Bullion</p>
                <p>Report, and experience; and showed that Mr Bosanquet had either mistaken the
                    cases by which he proposed to try the theory, or that the discrepancy was only
                    apparent, and was entirely a consequence of his inability to apply the
                    principle, and not of any deficiency in the principle itself. The victory of Mr
                    Ricardo was perfect and complete; and the elaborate errors and mis-statements of
                    Mr Bosanquet served only, in the language of Dr Copleston, “to illustrate the
                    abilities of the writer who stepped forward to vindicate the truth.” <note

                    affords a striking example of the ascendency which those who possess a knowledge
                    both of principle and practice, have over those familiar only with the latter;
                    and though the interest of the question which gave rise to it be now subsided,
                    it will always be read with delight by such as are not insensible of the high
                    gratification which all ingenuous minds must feel in observing the ease with
                    which a superior intellect clears away the irrelevant matter with which a
                    question has been designedly embarrassed, reduces false facts to their just
                    value, and traces and exhibits the constant and active operation of the same
                    general principle through all the mazy intricacies of practical detail.</p>
                <p>The merit of these pamphlets was duly appreciated; and Mr Ricardo’s society was,
                    in consequence, courted by men of the first eminence and consideration, who were
                    not less delighted with his modesty, and the mildness and amenity of his
                    manners, than with the reach and vigour of his understanding. It was at this
                    period that he formed that intimacy with Mr Malthus, and Mr Mill, the author of
                    the History of British India, which ended only with his life. To Mr Mill he was
                    particularly attached; and he always felt pleasure in acknowledging how much he
                    owed to the friendship, and to the clear, discriminating judgment of that
                    gentleman.</p>
                <p>Mr Ricardo’s next appearance as an author was in 1815, during the discussions on
                    the bill, afterwards passed into a law, for raising the limit at which the
                    importation of foreign corn should be permitted, to 80s. Mr Malthus, and a
                    “Fellow of University College, Oxford” (Mr West, afterwards Sir Edward West),
                    had, in two able pamphlets, published almost at the same moment, developed the
                    real nature, origin, and causes of rent. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>There was little that was new in either of these pamphlets;
                    the origin, nature, and causes of rent having been quite as well, or rather
                    better, explained in a pamphlet by Dr Anderson, the editor of the Bee, published
                    in 1777 (Inquiry into the Nature of the Com Laws), and in his Agricultural
                    Recreations, published in 1801. But the investigations and discoveries of
                    Anderson did not attract any attention, and were, indeed, totally forgotten; so
                    that it was necessary the theory of rent should be re-stated (it is believed to
                    Iiave been re-discovered), to make it be understood and appreciated by the
                    public. </p></note> But neither of them perceived the real value and importance
                    of the principles which they had established. This was reserved for Mr Ricardo,
                    who, in his “Essay on the Influence of a Low Price of Corn on the Profits of
                    Stock,” showed the real effect of the increase which must always take place in
                    the price of raw produce, in the progress of society, on wages and profits; and
                    founded an irresistible argument in favour of the freedom of the corn trade, on
                    the very principles from which Mr Malthus had vainly endeavoured to show the
                    propriety of subjecting it to fresh restrictions. This essay is particularly
                    worthy of attention, as it contains a brief statement of some of the fundamental
                    principles subsequently demonstrated in the “Principles of Political Economy and
                    Taxation.”</p>
                <p>In 1816, Mr Ricardo published his “Proposals for an Economical and Secure
                    Currency, with Observations on the Profits of the Bank of England.” In this
                    pamphlet Mr Ricardo examined the circumstances which determine the value of
                    money, both when every individual has the power to supply it, and when that
                    power is restricted and placed under a monopoly: he showed that, in the former
                    case, its value depends, like that of all freely produced commodities, wholly on
                    the cost of its production; while in the latter its value is quite unaffected by
                    that circumstance, and depends entirely on the extent to which it has been
                    issued compared with the demand. This is a principle of great importance; for it
                    shows that intrinsic worth is not necessary to a currency, and that, provided
                    the supply of paper-notes, declared to be legal tender, be sufficiently limited,
                    their value may be maintained on a par with that of gold, or raised to any
                    higher level. If, therefore, it were possible to devise a system for preserving
                    the value of paper on a level with gold, without making it convertible into coin
                    at the pleasure of the holder, the whole of the expenses attending the use of a
                    metallic currency would be saved. To effect this object, Mr Ricardo proposed
                    that bank-notes, instead of being made exchangeable for gold coins, should be
                    made exchangeable for <hi rend="italic">bars of gold bullion of the standard
                    weight and purity.</hi> This device was obviously calculated to check the
                    over-issue of paper quite as effectually as it could be checked by making it
                    convertible into coin; while, as the bars could not be used as currency, it
                    prevented any gold from getting into circulation. Mr Ricardo’s proposal was
                    recommended in the Reports of the Committees of the Houses of Lords and Commons,
                    appointed in 1819, to consider the expediency of the bank’s resuming
                    cash-payments, and was afterwards adopted in the celebrated bill introduced by
                    Mr (now Sir Robert) Peel, for the resumption of cash payments. But though the
                    plan secured all the advantages which Mr Ricardo had in view, these were not the
                    only considerations that had to be attended <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=242" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0242-0232"
                    />to. The discovery ofmeans for the prevention, or at least diminution, of the
                    extensive forgery to which the substitution of notes in the place of coins had
                    given rise, was indispensably necessary to the success of Mr Ricardo’s plan; and
                    notwithstanding all the efforts that have been made, this desideratum has not
                    yet been supplied. Forgery in the larger description of notes, or in those for
                    L.5 and upwards, may, with due precaution, be prevented from becoming
                    injuriously prevalent. But low notes, or those of the value of L. 1 or L.2,
                    having to circulate among the labouring classes, and in immense numbers, present
                    facilities for the issue of spurious paper which it has been found impossible
                    materially to diminish. Hence, in 1821, the plan of paying in bars of bullion
                    was abandoned, and the Bank of England recommenced paying in specie.</p>
                <p>At length, in 1817, Mr Ricardo published his great work on the “Principles of
                    Political Economy and Taxation.” This was a step which he did not take without
                    much hesitation. He was not, and did not affect to be, insensible of the value
                    of literary and philosophical reputation; but his modesty always led him to
                    undervalue his own powers; and having already obtained a very high degree of
                    celebrity as a writer on currency, he was unwilling to risk what he was already
                    in possession of, by attempting to gain more. Ultimately, however, he w <hi
                    rend="superscript">f</hi> as prevailed upon by the entreaties of his friends,
                    and chiefly by those of Mr Mill, to allow his work to be sent to press. Its
                    appearance forms a new era in the history of the science. With the exception of
                    the “Wealth of Nations,” it is the most important, as it certainly is the most
                    original and profound, work that has appeared on political economy. It must,
                    however, be admitted, that he has not been happy in the exposition of several of
                    his peculiar doctrines; and the mathematical cast of his reasonings, the
                    intimate dependence of his propositions on each other, and the new sense which
                    he sometimes gives to terms in common use, are apt to repel ordinary readers,
                    and give an appearance of obscurity to the work. But those who study it with the
                    care and attention which it deserves, will find that it is eminently logical;
                    and the powersof mind displayed in its investigations, the dexterity with which
                    the most abstruse and difficult questions are unravelled, the sagacity evinced
                    in tracing the operation of general principles, in disentangling them from such
                    as are of a secondary and accidental nature, and in perceiving and estimating
                    their remotest consequences, have rarely been surpassed, and will for ever
                    secure the name of Ricardo a conspicuous place in the list of profound thinkers,
                    and of the discoverers of useful truths.</p>
                <p>The reader will find in the article Political Economy a pretty full account of
                    the leading principles advanced by Mr Ricardo in this work, and of his most
                    material conclusions. It is to be regretted that he relied too much on
                    theoretical reasonings, without making sufficient allowance for the
                    circumstances natural to and inherent in society, which either counteract or
                    materially modify some of the principles on which he laid the greatest stress.
                    But despite the errors into which he thus necessarily fell, his work is of the
                    very highest value. It is the first in which we find an analysis and generally
                    just explanation of the circumstances which determine the distribution of wealth
                    among the various ranks and orders of society, and which govern their apparently
                    conflicting but really harmonious relations. Since the appearance of Mr
                    Ricardo’s work the whole face of the science has been changed, not merely by his
                    numerous discoveries, and the new lights which he struck out in every
                    department, but by the closer and more analytical method of reasoning which he
                    introduced. In this respect there is yet, no doubt, much room for improvement;
                    but any one who compares the economical writings of the last seven years, with
                    those current before Mr Ricardo’s work made its appearance, will be satisfied
                    that there is now much less of loose generalization, and more regard to science
                    and principle. The practical considerations which Mr Ricardo too much neglected
                    have had their proper influence ascertained by subsequent inquirers; and his
                    doctrines having been properly modified, and made applicable to the exigencies
                    of society, have acquired a very high practical as well as theoretical
                    value.</p>
                <p>Previously to the publication of his Principles, Mr Ricardo retired wholly from
                    business, with a very large fortune, acquired with the universal respect and
                    esteem of his competitors. He afterwards spent the greater part of the summer at
                    Gatcomb Park, an estate which he had purchased in Gloucestershire. But he did
                    not retire from the bustle of active life to the mere enjoyment of his acres—
                    <hi rend="italic">Non fuit consilium socordia atque desidia bonum otium
                    conterere</hi> —he had other objects in view; and while his leisure hours, when
                    in the country, were chiefly devoted to the prosecution of the interesting
                    science of which he was now confessedly at the head, he determined to extend the
                    sphere of his usefulness by entering the House of Commons. In 1819 he took his
                    seat as member for Portarlington. His diffidence of his own powers had, however,
                    nearly deprived the country of the important services which he rendered in this
                    situation. In a letter to one of his friends, dated the 7th of April 1819, he
                    says, “You will have seen that I have taken my seat in the House of Commons. I
                    fear that I shall be of little use there. I have twice attempted to speak; but I
                    proceeded in the most embarrassed manner; and I have no hope of conquering the
                    alarm with which I am assailed the moment I hear the sound of my own voice.” And
                    in a letter to the same gentleman, dated the 22d of June 1819, he says, “I thank
                    you for your endeavours to inspire me with confidence on the occasion of my
                    addressing the house. Their indulgent reception of me has, in some degree, made
                    the task of speaking more easy to me; but there are yet so many formidable
                    obstacles to my success, and some, I fear, of a nature nearly insurmountable,
                    that I apprehend it will be wisdom and sound discretion in me to content myself
                    with giving silent votes.” Fortunately he did not adopt this resolution. The
                    difficulties with which he had at first to struggle, and his diffidence in
                    himself, gradually subsided; while the integrity of his character, the mildness
                    of his manners, and the perfect mastery which he possessed over the subjects on
                    which he spoke, and the unquestionable purity and disinterestedness of his
                    intentions, speedily secured him a very extensive and powerful influence both in
                    the house and the country, and gave the greatest weight and authority to his
                    opinions.</p>
                <p>Mr Ricardo was not one of those who make speeches to suit the temporary and
                    ephemeral circumstances and politics of the day; he spoke only from principle,
                    and with a fixed resolution never to diverge in the smallest degree from the
                    path which it pointed out; he neither concealed nor modified an opinion for the
                    purpose of conciliating the favour, or of disarming the prejudices or hostility,
                    of any man or set of men; nor did he ever make a speech or give a vote which he
                    was not thoroughly convinced was founded on just principles, and calculated to
                    promote the true and lasting interests of the public. Trained to habits of
                    profound thinking, independent in his fortune, and inflexible in his principles,
                    Mr Ricardo had nothing in common with the vulgar tribe of party politicians. His
                    country’s good was the single and only object of his parliamentary exertions;
                    and he laboured to promote it, not by engaging in party cabals, which he
                    detested, but by supporting the rights and liberties of all classes, and by
                    explaining and unfolding tile true sources of national wealth and public
                    prosperity.</p>
                <p>The change which has taken place in the public opinion respecting the financial
                    and commercial policy of the country, since the period when Mr Ricardo obtained
                    a seat in the House of Commons, is as complete as it is gratifying.</p>

                <p>That monopoly has still many defenders, must be allowed; but they defend it only
                    because they are interested in its support. The most enlarged principles are now
                    supported by all the leading members of both houses. All are now ready to admit
                    that the exclusive system is founded on vicious principles; that it is not
                    calculated to accelerate, but to retard, the progress of those nations by whom
                    it is adopted; and that it is sound policy to admit the freest competition in
                    every branch of industry, and to deal with all the world on fair and liberal
                    principles. The writings and the speeches of Mr Ricardo contributed more than
                    those of any other individual to accomplish this salutary and desirable change.
                    As he was known to be a master in “the master science of civil life,” his
                    opinion, from the moment he entered the House of Commons, was referred to on all
                    important occasions; <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr
                    Ricardo made tile first of his prominent appearances on the 24th of May 1819, in
                    the debate on the resolutions proposed by Mr Peel respecting the resumption of
                    cash payments. He did not rise until he was loudly called upon from all sides of
                    the House. </p></note> and he acquired a constant accession of influence and
                    consideration, according as experience served to render the house and the
                    country better acquainted with the rare and excellent qualities of his mind, and
                    the singleness of his heart.</p>
                <p>In 1820 Mr Ricardo was prevailed on to furnish an article on the “Funding System”
                    for the Supplement to the Encyclopaedia Britannica. This tract, though somewhat
                    confused and perplexed in its arrangement, embraces many admirable discussions.
                    Mr Ricardo was a decided friend to the plan for raising the supplies for a war
                    within the year, by an equivalent increase of taxation; and he was also of
                    opinion that it would be both expedient and practicable to pay off the public
                    debt by an assessment on capital. In this article he has endeavoured, if not
                    with perfect success, at least with great ingenuity, to defend both projects
                    from the objections commonly urged against them.</p>
                <p>In 1822, during the parliamentary discussions on the subject of the corn laws, Mr
                    Ricardo published his pamphlet on “Protection to Agriculture.” This is the best
                    of all his pamphlets, and is, indeed, a <hi rend="italic">chef-d’oeuvre.</hi>
                    The various and important questions respecting remunerating price, the influence
                    of a low and high value of corn on wages and profits, the effects of taxation on
                    agriculture and manufactures, and many other topics of equal difficulty and
                    interest, are all discussed in the short compass of eighty or ninety pages, with
                    a precision and clearness that leaves nothing to be desired. Even if Mr Ricardo
                    had never written anything else, this pamphlet would have placed him in the very
                    first rank of political economists.</p>
                <p>Though not robust, Mr Ricardo’s constitution was apparently good, and his health
                    such as to promise a long life of usefulness. He had indeed been subject for
                    several years to an affection in one of his ears; but as it had never given him
                    any serious inconvenience, he paid little attention to it. When he retired to
                    his seat in Gloucestershire, subsequently to the close of the session of 1823,
                    he was in excellent health and spirits; and besides completing a tract,
                    containing a plan for the establishment of a national bank, he had engaged, with
                    his usual ardour, in profound and elaborate inquiries in relation to the theory
                    of value. But he was not destined to bring this investigation to a close. In the
                    beginning of September he was suddenly seized with a violent pain in the
                    diseased ear: the symptoms were not, however, considered as unfavourable; and
                    the breaking of an impos-thrume that had formed within it contributed greatly to
                    his relief. But the amendment was only transitory; within two days inflammation
                    recommenced; and after a period of indescribable agony, pressure on the brain
                    ensued, which produced a stupor that continued until death terminated his
                    sufferings on the 11 th of September.</p>
                <p>In private life Mr Ricardo was most amiable. He was a kind and indulgent father
                    and husband, and a warm, affectionate, and zealous friend. No man was ever more
                    thoroughly free from every species of artifice and pretension. He was sincere,
                    plain, and unassuming, at once the firmest and the gentlest of human beings. He
                    was particularly fond of assembling intelligent men around him, and of
                    conversing in the freest and most unrestrained manner on all topics of interest,
                    but more especially on those connected with his favourite science. He was always
                    ready to give way to others, and never discovered the least impatience to speak;
                    but when he did speak, the extent and accuracy of his knowledge, the solidity of
                    his judgment, his perfect candour, and his peculiar and extraordinary talent for
                    resolving a question into its elements, and for setting the most difficult and
                    complicated subject in the clearest and most striking point of view, arrested
                    the attention of every one, and made him the delight and idol of all who had the
                    happiness to hear him. Mr Ricardo never entered into an argument, whether in
                    public or private, for the sake of displaying ingenuity, of baffling an
                    opponent, or of gaining a victory; he was an entire stranger to such motives.
                    The discovery of truth was his exclusive object. He was ever open to conviction;
                    and if he was satisfied that he had either advanced or supported an erroneous
                    opinion, he was the first to acknowledge his error, and to caution others
                    against it.</p>
                <p>Few men ever possessed in a higher degree than Mr Ricardo the talent of speaking
                    and conversing with clearness and facility on the most abstruse and difficult
                    subjects. In this respect his speeches were greatly superior to his
                    publications. The latter cannot be readily understood and followed without
                    considerable attention; but nothing could exceed the ease and felicity with
                    which he illustrated and explained the most refined and delicate questions of
                    political economy, both in private conversation and in his speeches. Without
                    being forcible, his style of speaking was easy, fluent, and agreeable. It was
                    impossible to take him off his guard. To those who were not familiar with his
                    speculations, some of his positions were apt to appear paradoxical; but the
                    paradox was only in appearance. He never advanced an opinion on which he had not
                    deeply reflected, and without examining it in every point of view; and the
                    readiness with which he met and overthrew the most specious objections that the
                    ablest men in the house could state to his doctrines, is the best proof of their
                    correctness, and of the superiority and acuteness of his understanding. That
                    there were greater orators, and men of more varied and general acquirements, in
                    parliament than Mr Ricardo, we readily allow; but we are bold to say, that in
                    point of deep, clear, and comprehensive intellect, he had no superiors, and very
                    few, if any, equals, either in parliament or the country.</p>
                <p>Mr Ricardo was not less generous than intelligent; he was never slow to come
                    forward to the relief of the poor and the distressed; and while he contributed
                    to almost every charitable institution in the metropolis, he supported at his
                    own expense an alms-house for the poor, and two schools for the instruction of
                    the young in the vicinity of his seat in the country.</p>
                <p>Besides the publications previously enumerated, Mr Ricardo left several
                    manuscripts. Among others, a “Plan for the Establishment of a National Bank” was
                    found in a finished state, and has since been published. In this pamphlet he has
                    endeavoured to show that the power of issuing paper-money might be safely placed
                    in the hands of commissioners appointed by government; and that, while such a
                    plan would be productive of no inconvenience, it would most probably save the
                    public a considerable sum annually.</p>
                <p>Mr Ricardo also left very full Notes on Mr Malthus’s <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=244" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0244-0234"
                    />Principles of Political Economy. They contain a vindication of his own
                    doctrines from the objections of Mr Malthus, and an exposition of the mistakes
                    into which he conceives the latter had fallen.</p>
                <p>Though not properly belonging to the Whig party, Mr Ricardo voted almost
                    uniformly with them. He was fully impressed with a conviction of the many
                    advantages that would result from giving the people a greater influence over the
                    choice of their representatives in the House of Commons; and was so far a friend
                    to the system of the radical reformers, as to give his cordial support to the
                    plan of voting by ballot, which he considered as the best if not the only means
                    for securing the mass of the electors against improper solicitations, and
                    enabling them to vote in favour of the candidates whom they really approved. He
                    did not, however, agree with the radical reformers in their plan of universal
                    suffrage: he thought the elective franchise should be given to all who possessed
                    a certain amount of property; but he was of opinion, that while it would be a
                    very hazardous experiment, no practical good would result from giving the
                    franchise indiscriminately to all.</p>
                <p>When the circumstances under which the greater part of the life of Mr Ricardo was
                    spent are brought under view, and when it is also recollected that he died at
                    the early age of fifty· one, it may be truly said that very few men have ever
                    achieved so much. His industry was quite unrivalled; or if rivalled, it was only
                    by his sagacity, his integrity, and his candour.</p>
                <p>“The history of Mr Ricardo,” to use the words of his friend Mr Mill, “holds out a
                    bright and inspiring example. Mr Ricardo had everything to do for himself, and
                    he did everything. Let not the generous youth, whose aspirations are higher than
                    his circumstances, despair of attaining either the highest intellectual
                    excellence, or the highest influence on the welfare of his species, when he
                    recollects in what circumstances Mr Ricardo opened, and in what he closed his
                    memorable life. He had his fortune to make, his mind to form; he had even his
                    education to commence and conduct. In a field of the most intense competition he
                    realized a large fortune, with the universal esteem and affection of those who
                    could best judge of the honour and purity of his acts. Amid this scene of active
                    exertion and practical detail, he cultivated and he acquired habits of intense
                    and patient and comprehensive thinking, such as have been rarely equalled and
                    never excelled.”</p>
                <p>Mr Ricardo left a widow, three sons, and four daughters. One of his daughters
                    died a few years before him, shortly after her marriage. (c. c.)</p>
