                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> treating of the construction and mode of working
                    railways, we shall confine ourselves principally to those which are intended for
                    the transit of passengers and goods, and which are now opening so vast a field
                    for the improvement of the human race; an improvement, in fact, entering into
                    all the relations between man and man, and which no one, be he ever so sanguine,
                    can venture to fix a limit to.</p>
                <p>From the middle of the seventeenth century various contrivances have been in use
                    for decreasing friction on roads, particularly near the collieries in the north,
                    such as laying down tracks of wood and stone for the wheels of waggons; it
                    having been found that the much greater quantity of work performed by horses on
                    these tracks, or, in other words, the less number of horses required to do a
                    given portion of labour, more than repaid the expenses attendant on forming the
                    tracks. These, in general, gave way to the flat or tram rail, made of iron; but
                    the improvements were very slow, and at last were only applicable to certain
                    circumscribed localities and materials for carriage.</p>
                <p>Possessing little general interest, and chiefly benefiting individuals, the
                    attention they attracted was principally confined to the parties immediately
                    connected with them. But how different is the prospect now before us, since we
                    have seen the magnificent creations of George Stephenson? Pack-horses are still
                    the only mode of transit for traffic in many parts of the world; and within
                    seventy years this was the general mode of conveyance for the carrying trade to
                    Yorkshire and Lancashire from the west of England and Birmingham. In the year
                    1830, when the London and Birmingham railway was projected, the expense of
                    constructing it was stated at L.6000 per mile with one line of rails, which were
                    to be worked by horses, and warranted to go eight miles an hour; now the public
                    are complaining of going <hi rend="italic">only</hi> twenty miles an hour, and
                    we have a right to expect that, at no very distant period, this velocity will at
                    least be doubled; in fact, at the rate improvements have been advancing for the
                    last few years, we know not where to place a limit of increase in speed.</p>
                <p>It is of these splendid creations that we have here to speak. We shall shew the
                    method of conducting a modern railway, from its earliest commencement, through
                    all its various stages in each department, both in and out of doors, up to the
                    period of its final completion; and shall end by explaining the method of
                    setting it in full operation, pointing out, in each division of the labour,
                    those modes of proceeding which will most conduce to a satisfactory result, and
                    marking those things which practice has shewn should be avoided; collecting the
                    contrivances and appliances which have been found useful, from whatever source
                    they may be derived, and setting a beacon upon shipwrecks, that they may become
                    other men’s landmarks.</p>
                <p>When a railway is proposed between any two places, the public want to know how to
                    distinguish between a bubble speculation, got up by a few interested
                    individuals, a crudely-formed and hastily-adopted, but really good project, and
                    a line got up with care and attention through all its parts, shewing it to be
                    the result of patient research and of matured judgment; and according as
                    inquirers find the following directions more or less attended to, they may place
                    confidence in the scheme which is laid before them.</p>
                <p>These undertakings generally begin with a few individuals interested in the line
                    of railway proposed, when the project is honestly intended; but the great mass
                    of original proprietors are men of a speculative and adventurous turn of mind,
                    who enter into these concerns for the mere purpose of making money’. If the
                    thing succeeds, and the shares rise to a large premium, as they often do, the
                    original holders realize the profits at once, by selling out, and then apply
                    their surplus capital in other projects, with the same hope of gain. These
                    people, by going out, make way for another class of proprietors, namely, those
                    who look to their shares as a permanent investment, and hope to make by them a
                    greater annual receipt than they can get in the public funds, or by any other
                    means.</p>
                <p>In the earlier stages the directors are generally self-elected. They should be
                    men of local interest, rather than the lions who are too often found in these
                    situations; men who can influence members of Parliament in either house,
                    conciliate landholders, get off the shares, &amp;c., and, above all, they should
                    be of regular and businesslike habits. After a few meetings, they will find out
                    what are their respective qualifications, and can allot themselves into
                    sub-committees accordingly; some to look after the traffic, others the
                    surveying, others the share list, others to attend to the canvassing along the
                    line, &amp;c. Almost their first duty will be to choose the secretary, the
                    engineer, the solicitor, and the banker.</p>
                <p>On the appointment of the first three much of the future success of the company
                    will depend. The secretary should be a man of firmness and nerve, with
                    conciliatory and gentlemanly manners; of a strong habit of body, able to rough
                    it out in travelling, and possessing a stock of scientific and mechanical
                    knowledge. If he is a draughtsman so much the better, and he should have been
                    habituated to command large bodies of men, and be able to make a public speech
                    at a short notice. With these qualifications, habits of order, and plain common
                    sense, he will be a most valuable man.</p>
                <p>The engineer must be judged of by the works he has executed, either by himself or
                    under the direction of a superior; the first, of course, being the most
                    conclusive, but the second by no means to be neglected. Skill and genius may
                    Often be very prominent in subordinate situations. Of course, all other things
                    being equal, one who has been employed on railways should be preferred to one
                    who has not. The solicitor should, if possible, have been connected with a
                    railway bill before, and should have not only ability, but zeal. The advantage
                    of having one who bad been connected with a previous undertaking is obvious, and
                    if he has had much experience in parliamentary business, so much the better; a
                    local acquaintance amongst the landowners and residents along the line is also
                    of much use.</p>
                <p>We suppose that, prior to advancing even thus far, the promoters of the
                    undertaking have travelled between the termini of the intended railroad, and
                    have ascertained that there are no engineering difficulties of a marked
                    character; and from our present stage, if the share list be found to fill, we
                    have next to ascertain the nature and quantity of the traffic, first, as to
                    whether it will pay for a railroad at all, and secondly, for what kind of a
                    railroad. These questions should be met openly and honestly, or the consequences
                    will be most disastrous.</p>
                <p>The proper way to gain a correct knowledge of the traffic along any given line of
                    country is, first of all, to station a man by day and another by night for two
                    or three weeks, to count all vehicles passing a given number of spots along the
                    intended line, (these spots should be near the principal towns), leaving out the
                    largest terminus, as, for instance, London, and keeping the men on that side of
                    all the respee<pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=24"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0024-0014"/>tive towns which is nearest the largest terminus.
                    For this purpose memorandum-books should be famished them to note down all that
                    passes. These should, at the end of their twelve hours’ beat, be digested into
                    printed forms, where each class is to be placed in its proper column, and any
                    remarks made, if necessary. The forms are then to be daily transmitted by post
                    to the secretary, who should make it his business to ascertain that, by fairs,
                    races, elections, or any other causes of local excitement, the traffic is not in
                    an unusual state. He is then to consider attentively the returns he has
                    received, discriminating that which would be available for the railway in
                    question, from that which would not, and bring the whole series into one general
                    total, under the head of “direct traffic.” The men are also to make a return, as
                    nearly as they can, of the number of persons travelling in each vehicle, the
                    quantity of goods in each waggon, van, cart, &amp;c., distinguishing the nature
                    of it, when practicable; also the number of all kinds of cattle passing the
                    road, and where all the various passengers and goods are being conveyed to, as
                    far as can be ascertained.</p>
                <p>A similar series of observations must be carried on along the canals, if any,
                    which lead from those parts of the line likely to become available for the
                    intended railway, distinguishing the nature and quantity of the traffic. Most
                    canal-boats are marked at the head and stern with the draught of water; and by
                    finding out what they sink for every half-ton, a sufficiently near estimate may
                    be found of the weight they carry. In certain situations the entries at the
                    custom-house will be useful auxiliaries; the returns from clerks of markets will
                    often materially assist as checks, as will also the rental of the various
                    turnpikes; and no means are to be neglected to obtain a fair and honest
                    statement of the general traffic in actual existence along the proposed
                    line.</p>
                <p>The next object is to find out what will be the probable increase on this
                    existing traffic, when it shall be carried so much quicker and cheaper by a
                    railway. The usual method of doing this has been to assume some ratio of
                    increase, deduced from other undertakings of a similar nature, and two to one
                    have been considered rather under than over the truth; but when it is remembered
                    that the increase of passengers, these being the main contributors to a railway,
                    has been, in all proportions, up to eighty to one, it is obvious that this is a
                    very uncertain mode of ascertaining such an essential element.</p>
                <p>A much better method of arriving at this point will be to take, with the help of
                    a map, all those stage-coaches which run from places where travellers can go
                    cheaper and quicker by the proposed railway. The numbers of these, their daily
                    journeys and their mileage, can be readily got from the stamp-office returns,
                    printed in Robson’s <hi rend="italic">Directory.</hi> When these various returns
                    and data of every possible kind have been collected, and information has been
                    brought to bear from every quarter whence it can, by any means, be obtained, the
                    whole must be drawn up ready for calculation, so as at last to exhibit, in the
                    simplest manner in which it can be shewn, a tabular result not only of the
                    existing traffic, but also of that which can be affected by the proposed railway
                    under any circumstances, which latter may be called “contingent traffic.”</p>
                <p>The best mode of computing the data, as above described, is to multiply the
                    distance between the stations by the number of coaches; then by the number of
                    daily or weekly journeys made by each; and then by the number of passengers they
                    may fairly be presumed to carry. By proceeding in this manner, the last results,
                    in this case, can be added in a column, which will give the number of passengers
                    carried one mile, daily or weekly, as the case may be. This, divided by the
                    number of miles there will be on the intended railway, and augmented so as to
                    exhibit the yearly quantity, will give the first step in the inquiry. The same
                    method exactly is to be made use of for the canal traffic, if any, substituting
                    tons for passengers, which is also to be done with the waggons, vans, and other
                    public conveyances.</p>
                <p>The contingent traffic, or that which is obtained from the stamp-office returns,
                    is to be handled in a similar manner, only taking care that the various coaches
                    and other vehicles are only taken for that distance which, in all probability,
                    they will go upon the railway. When the whole is reduced, it must be put into
                    money, and will then contrast with the amount of the same quantity of traffic at
                    existing prices.</p>
                <p>It is very easy to determine a limit beyond which none of this contingent traffic
                    will, by any possibility, be available for a railway. We shall shew how this is
                    done, as it may serve thus far as a guide, so that no place beyond the limit
                    need, of course, be paid any attention to.</p>
                <p>In any triangle <hi rend="italic">a, c, d,</hi> (fig. 1), let <hi rend="italic">
                    (ad)</hi> represent any increment uniformly generated with any given velocity (
                    <hi rend="italic">h</hi> ), and let <hi rend="italic">(ac)</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">(cd)</hi> represent any other increment uniformly generated with
                    any other given velocities ( <hi rend="italic">b</hi> ) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >(p).</hi> Now all these velocities being in this case comparable with each
                    other, if we represent the different increments by the times in which they are
                    generated, we may shew by the respective portions <hi rend="italic"> (ad)
                    (ac)</hi> and <hi rend="italic">(cd),</hi> the progress of any object whose
                    motion is uniform.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">(ad)</hi> represent a part of the road now used between any
                    two towns (a) and <hi rend="italic">(d),</hi> let ( <hi rend="italic">ac</hi> )
                    be a portion of a railroad, and let <hi rend="italic">(cd)</hi> be a cross-road
                    joining the railroad <hi rend="italic">(ac)</hi> with the turnpike road <hi
                    rend="italic">(ad).</hi> Then if the velocity <hi rend="italic">(b) (p)</hi> and

                    (t'')</hi> ( <hi rend="italic">t</hi> ') and ( <hi rend="italic"> t</hi> ) are
                    such, that.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">t"+t' &lt; or=t</hi> the point <hi rend="italic">d</hi> would
                    be at the limit, and no person beyond it could travel along <hi rend="italic"
                    >(dc)</hi> and <hi rend="italic">(cd)</hi> in order to get from <hi
                    rend="italic">(d)</hi> to <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> with advantage.</p>
                <p>As a railway may, in general, be taken in comparison with a coach-road, both as
                    to time and price, in the ratio of 1: 2, price may at once be excluded from the
                    investigation, and time only taken into account; because those to whom time is
                    an object in travelling, by attending to that alone, will evidently reap, along
                    with it, the benefit of cheapness also; and those to whom price is an object,
                    will, in attending to time only, gain that advantage, and in conjunction with
                    it, the minimum of price likewise. Particular circumstances may, in a few cases,
                    modify this; but the general features of the comparison will be as above.</p>
                <p>Taking, then, the ratio of <hi rend="italic">p: b=h</hi>: <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> =2 :1, and considering <hi rend="italic">p: h</hi> to be a ratio of
                    equality, and that for one <hi rend="italic">hour h=p=10</hi> miles, and
                    consequently, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> =20 miles, or, in other words, that on
                    the railroad ( <hi rend="italic">b</hi> ), the rate of travelling will be 20
                    miles an hour, while on the direct road <hi rend="italic">(h),</hi> and the
                    cross road <hi rend="italic">(p),</hi> the rate will be at 10 miles an hour; we
                    have then only to add the whole of the perpendicular <hi rend="italic">(p)</hi>
                    to half the base <hi rend="italic">(b),</hi> and subtract the same from the
                    hypothenuse <hi rend="italic">(h),</hi> which is got from the stamp-office
                    returns for each town, and the remainder, if any, will be the miles gained by
                    travelling over the two sides of the triangle instead of over the third, and if
                    there is no remainder, that particular town is beyond the limits, and will not
                    be benefited by the railway, consequently, it must be rejected from the traffic
                    returns.</p>
                <p>It is well there were no railroads in Euclid’s days. We do not know what he would
                    have said to our thus making the perpendicular and half the base equal to the
                    hypothenuse; but such is the practical fact in the question we are considering,
                    and this fact has been exemplified on every railway where the traffic can partly
                    be derived from towns right and left of the line, which is the case almost
                    invariably. We shall give a few instances, taken from the traffic returns of the
                    London and Birmingham railway.</p>
                <p>It is required to know whether the coaches running from Bedford to London ought
                    to be included in the returns of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=25" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0025-0015"
                    />traffic for the London and Birmingham railway, or, in other 'words, whether
                    the inhabitants of Bedford would go cheaper and quicker to London, by first
                    getting to the London and Birmingham railway, and then proceeding by that route
                    to London, or whether they had better go by the old direct coach road, and <hi
                    rend="italic"> vice versa,</hi> on their return from London, whether it would be
                    cheaper and quicker for them to go along that railroad, and then by a cross
                    country coach to Bedford, or continue to use the old road?</p>
                <p>The nearest station for the people of Bedford on the London and Birmingham
                    railway, is at a place called Wolverton; from Bedford to Wolverton <hi
                    rend="italic">(p</hi>) is 15 miles, to which add (½ <hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                    half the distance from London to Wolverton, which is 25½ miles, and the total
                    40½ miles, (½<hi rend="italic">b</hi>+<hi rend="italic">p</hi>) is the
                    equivalent distance from London to Bedford, <hi rend="italic">via</hi> the
                    railway; that is to say, by travelling along the two sides of the triangle. Now,
                    in the stamp-office returns, it will be found that the direct road (<hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi>) is 52 miles, consequently, either in going to London, or
                    coming from it, the people of Bedford would in each case save 11½ miles in
                    equivalent distance, or 1 hour and 9 minutes in time, besides money. It is
                    clear, then, that Bedford ought to be included in the traffic returns of that
                    railway company.</p>
                <p>The same question is proposed as to the town of Hatfield. The nearest station on
                    the railway to this place is at Two-waters, and the distance between them (p) is
                    10 miles; adding to this (½<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), half the distance from
                    London to Two-waters, which is 10½ miles, we have (½<hi rend="italic">b</hi>+<hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi>), the equivalent distance <hi rend="italic">via</hi> the
                    railroad between London and Hatfield, equal to 20½ miles. Turning now to the
                    stamp-office returns, we find (<hi rend="italic">h</hi>) the distance from
                    London to Hatfield by the direct road, is also 20½ miles, and consequently, the
                    two routes being equal, that town ought not to be included in the estimate of
                    traffic.</p>
                <p>It is required to know the same thing with respect to the town of Hitchen? Here
                    the inhabitants would join the railway in question at Leighton Buzzard, and we
                    find (<hi rend="italic">p</hi>)=16½ miles, (½<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) = 19
                    miles, total or (½<hi rend="italic">b</hi>+<hi rend="italic">p</hi>) 35½ miles,
                    whilst (<hi rend="italic">h</hi>)=36 miles; and there would be a consequent gain
                    of half a mile in distance, or 3 minutes in time.</p>
                <p>In the case of Oundle and London, the station where the inhabitants of that town
                    would join the railway, is near Northampton, and we have (<hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi>)=26 miles, (½<hi rend="italic">p</hi>)=32 miles, total or (½<hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi>+<hi rend="italic">p</hi>)=58, whilst, by the stamp-office
                    returns, we have (<hi rend="italic">h</hi>)=8l miles; consequently, there is a
                    gain of 23 miles, or of 2 hours and 18 minutes, by thus travelling over two
                    sides of the triangle instead of the third.</p>
                <p>It is desired to know, whether the inhabitants of Leicester, in their
                    communication to and fro with Birmingham, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>
                    those of Birmingham in the communication with Leicester, will be benefited by
                    the London and Birmingham railway. Here the point where each party would either
                    join or leave the railway would be Coventry, and we have (<hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi>)=25 miles, (½<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)=9 miles, total or(½<hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi>+<hi rend="italic">p</hi>)=34 miles, whilst (<hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi>)=36 miles, shewing a gain of 2 miles, or 12 minutes in
                    time.</p>
                <p>We will throw a few more examples into a tabular form, as this part of our
                    subject is a very important one, and cannot be too well understood. Care will,
                    of course, be taken, that all the distances are those really existing on the
                    respective roads in question; and it will also be advisable to reject all minute
                    savings from the traffic returns, in order to be under, rather than over, in the
                    estimate.</p>
                <p>The best way of commencing to make out the following table, will be to take a map
                    of the railway for which it is to be formed; and this Should embrace a
                    considerable portion of the adjoining country. Draw on the map a straight line
                    from the one terminus to the other; this will represent (<hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi>) in fig. 1, and from this, lay off at right angles from each of the
                    termini, other straight lines; these will represent <hi rend="italic">(p)</hi>
                    in fig. 1. We shall now shew how to ascertain the point in <hi rend="italic">

                <p>On the map then, calling (c) (c) the termini, we set off on (p) in four
                    directions three-fourths the length of the straight line (A), and then draw the
                    four lines (A), (see fig. 2,) and we are sure that the four triangles (A, <hi
                    rend="italic"> p, h,)</hi> include every town that can by any means come to our
                    termini to use our whole line, and if the line A was in reality a straight one
                    on the ground, as it is in the figure, the triangles would include <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=26"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0026-0016"/>every other town throughout the whole tract of
                    country, the inhabitants of which could avail themselves of the benefits of the
                    railway, therefore, in using our figure, we must make the outer boundary lines
                    (A), respectively curve right or left as the line of railway departs in either
                    of those directions from the straight line (A). The values of (|i) may then be
                    found and marked ready for use, as nearly as can be judged, by seeing where the
                    stations would, it is presumed,be ultimately placed; then having ascertained the
                    values of ( <hi rend="italic"> p</hi> ) and (/() from the stamp-oflice returns,
                    or any other equally authentic document, they may in each case be marked against
                    the roads for all the towns which we may see fit to calculate upon for putting
                    or not into the traffic returns, according as their inhabitants would gain or
                    not by using the railway.</p>
                <p>It will, on a very slight inspection, be self-evident, that for perhaps
                    three-fourths of the whole space included within the lines (/&gt;) and (A),
                    there will be no need of any calculation, except to shew the quantity of saving.
                    In the earlier stages, therefore, if it is merely required to know the amount of
                    traffic; but only the doubtful places need be computed, and the rest may be
                    deferred till it is desirable to complete the whole table. It must also be
                    noted, that although a place may be actually without the boundary lines, yet
                    there may not be a conveyance from it to either of the termini, as the case may
                    be, and that the inhabitants, in order to be enabled to travel thither, may have
                    to come to a place within the lines. They are then to be tried for as if they
                    were themselves situated within the lines, and, of course, all towns beyond the
                    termini must benefit, when travelling towards the opposite end of the line.</p>
                <p>The effect of railways will be this: They can only be made upon main lines,
                    because such lines will alone pay; the stage coaches will go off these lines
                    when the railway has been a short time in operation, but the same coaches will
                    be employed on cross country roads to feed the railway; and it is a curious
                    fact, that through this operation one more coach was licensed at Liverpool and
                    Manchester the year after the railway opened than there was the year before.</p>
                <p>If the above rules be attended to, a tolerably correct knowledge of the traffic
                    to be expected may be obtained, and it is sure not to be an exaggerated one.
                    Whilst this has been going on, the engineer will have been employed in looking
                    at the general features of the country preparatory to surveying and levelling
                    it; and in most cases a man of a practised eye at this kind of work will be able
                    at once to decide on all the principal points along which the line should go.
                    During the same time the solicitor will have been feeling his way amongst the
                    landowners and the occupiers, so that where much dissent is manifested, that
                    property may if possible be avoided. Landholders have been proverbially hostile
                    to railways, and enormous in their demands for compensation, yet they have
                    invariably found that their property has been benefited instead of being
                    injured; and when more land has been required from them, they have asked a
                    higher price on account of that very railway running through their property,
                    whose existence they had in the first instance declared to be a nuisance. This
                    state of things cannot last much longer; but whilst it does, it must be met as
                    far as possible in the above manner.</p>
                <p>There are many things to be taken into consideration before definitely fixing on
                    the precise line in which a railroad is to run. Borings should be largely taken
                    to obtain a correct geological knowledge of the various strata. A considerable
                    subsequent expenditure may often be saved in this way. It is of no use to put a
                    penny on our eyes to hinder us from seeing a guinea. Borings may be carried to
                    any depth by sinking a well part of the way, and without this they have been
                    worked to a depth of760 feet. The nature of the traffic must also be taken into
                    consideration, so that when all other things are equal, the line may be run so
                    as to include particular towns. The population of all the adjacent places should
                    be ascertained and marked on a map; the nature of the various markets and fairs
                    should be examined' into and the state of trade; the wants of persons connected
                    with it ought also to be taken into account; the quantity and quality of the
                    existing goods traffic, its nature, and the demands on it with reference to any
                    probable increase; and the capabilities of harbours, if any are within reach of
                    the line, their draught of water, the nature of the protection they afford,
                    their present trade, and the effect of the railroad on that trade. In this, as
                    well as in all other cases, the results of a transition from peace to war, and
                    <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi> , should be well considered, together with the
                    effect of any future line of railway which may become a partially competing
                    one.</p>
                <p>The more effectually these inquiries are made, and the more fully their results
                    are honestly put before the proprietors, together with separate estimates for
                    the engineering department and the managing department, so will their confidence
                    in the undertaking increase; and it is a most essential point to place this
                    confidence on a sure basis, so that if any little mishap, which none can avoid,
                    take place, the shares may not be suddenly thrown on the market at a ruinous
                    sacrifice, and the undertaking abandoned, through the projectors not having had
                    the necessary information, to enable them to see that the result of their
                    labours would be a profitable speculation, notwithstanding any trifling losses
                    arising from causes against which perhaps no human foresight could provide.</p>
                <p>Railways with two lines of rails in very favourable situations have been
                    completed for L.10,000 per mile in Eng-i land. This however must be taken as the
                    exception, and not the rule. Under very unfavourable circumstances they have
                    cost L.50,000 per mile; and of course there will be found an expense per mile at
                    all differences between these two, which may fairly be taken as the extreme
                    limits. Now it is certain, that with a line 80 miles in length, a traffic of 75
                    tons of goods per day from each end, or 120 passengers per day each way, or with
                    35 tons of goods and 60 passengers per day each way, the railway, if even
                    constructed for L.12,000 per mile, which will rarely happen, would not afford a
                    dividend of more than a quarter per cent, and (outnumbers throughout meaning
                    daily each way) it would require 100 tons of goods, or 160 passengers, or 50
                    tons of goods and 80 passengers, to pay 1 per cent.; 125 tons of goods, or 200
                    passengers, or 62 tons of goods and 100 passengers, would but little exceed If
                    percent.; and it would take 200 tons of goods, or 320 passengers, or 100 tons of
                    goods with 160 passengers, to pay 4j- per cent.</p>
                <p>The Americans have such facilities for these constructions, that 1600 miles of
                    railroad have been made in that country (a good deal of it, however, being only
                    single line) at an average cost of only L.5081 per mile; whereas in England the
                    mere permanent way alone would amount to L.4400 per mile, if the rails were 45
                    lbs. to the yard, and laid upon longitudinal timbers; L.4900 per mile, with
                    rails 42 lbs. per yard, having chairs and cast-iron supports between them, on
                    longitudinal timbers; L.5300 per mile, with rails 42 lbs. per yard, on blocks 3
                    feet apart; L.4800 per mile, with the same sized rails on wooden sleepers;
                    L.5600 per mile for 62 lb. rails, on blocks 4 feet apart, and L.5100 for the
                    same rails on wooden sleepers; L.6000 per mile for rails of 75 lb. per yard on
                    blocks 5 feet apart, and L.5500 per mile for the same on sleepers. These prices
                    do not include laying the way, ballasting, and draining. Thus we see that the
                    mere cost of the permanent way in the country, averaging L.5200 per mile,
                    exceeds that of the whole expense of a complete railway in America; and 75 pound
                    rails on blocksand sleepers, including laying, ballasting, sidings, turn-plates,
                    and every expense, has exceeded L.8000 per mile.</p>
                <p>The mean receipts forfive years on theLiverpool amlMan-chester line give the
                    following proportions: Revenue 100,expenses 55, profits 45; and the expenses
                    have been as high,</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=27"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0027-0017"/>
                <p>or higher than 60. The average, however, gives the ratio of revenue to profit at
                    1 to .45. On the Dublin and Kingston railway the same ratio for 26½ months gives
                    1 to .4344. On the Brussels and Mechlin railway the ratio for 1 year is 1 to
                    .488. On the Grand Junction railway, for 6 months, it is 1:.48. On the London
                    and Birmingham, no data exist to form a judgment. There is a very singular
                    coincidence in these ratios on lines so very differently circumstanced, and of
                    lengths varying from six miles to more than 100; but we have not yet acquired
                    any sufficient experience in railway statistics to enable us to speak with
                    confidence on the subject. If every railway would publish yearly its experience,
                    as was so handsomely done in the Liverpool and Manchester for several years,
                    analyzing every source of expense, and reducing them to the ratio per passenger
                    and per ton per mile, we should then soon acquire such a stock of knowledge as
                    would enable all these points to be decided; indeed, of so much consequence are
                    railways now becoming, that the legislature should take up the question, making
                    it a law that returns should be sent yearly, according to a form arranged by
                    some person thoroughly conversant with the subject.</p>
                <p>When matters are so far advanced that the engineer can be directed to make out
                    his plans and sections, he will commence by consulting the ordnance map, and by
                    the help of that and his geological knowledge, obtained from the borings and
                    trial shafts, together with his inspection of the wells, mines, quarries, and
                    other excavations in the immediate vicinity of the intended work, he will
                    proceed to lay down at least three or four lines, if some local circumstances do
                    not absolutely limit him to one particular tract of country; endeavouring to
                    cross all streams and rivers as near their source as possible, that being the
                    lowest point; and where hills intersect his progress, aiming at some position
                    where streams run down on either side in the direction as near as possible to
                    his intended line. He should avoid going along the sides of hills, particularly
                    if they are composed of clay or shale, in order to be clear of the unpleasant
                    consequences which slips would give rise to in these strata. He should run
                    through no more seats or ornamental pleasure grounds than possible, and avoid
                    towns and villages where the land would be expensive. He should, as far as
                    practicable, be furnished with lists of the population, the state of trade, and
                    the numbers of the assenting and dissenting owners and occupiers of land,
                    together with the quantity and value of their property. He should have the water
                    analyzed with reference to its fitness for locomotive engines, inquiring into
                    the state of the existing roads and canals, as to the facilities they afford for
                    getting coke, building materials, &amp;c. on to the line; also whether lodgings
                    can conveniently be had for large bodies of men, and whether the necessary
                    labourers and mechanics can be procured at reasonable rates in the immediate
                    vicinity of the line; and generally he should enter into all inquiries necessary
                    to enable him to choose the best line, and construct it at the least cost.</p>
                <p>In order to save time and expense, it will be quite sufficient if what are called
                    rough or flying levels are taken of these preparatory lines, for which purpose
                    the mountain barometer will be amply sufficient, if proper care be taken to
                    apply the necessary corrections, and strict attention be paid to comparing it as
                    often as possible, and at stated regular times, with a stationary standard
                    barometer. Cross stations between the lines should likewise be taken, in order
                    to ascertain the lowest point. The rates at which streams run will also assist
                    in giving indications, and the ordnance map may be sufficient authority for
                    distances. He should particularly attend to curves and gradients; a curve of
                    three-quarters of a mile radius, in conjunction with a rise of 16 feet in a
                    mile, reducing the speed of a locomotive to nearly one-half. Where the gradient
                    is good, curves are not of so much consequence. A curve of a quarter of a mile
                    radius on the Bolton and Leigh railway is constantly passed with safety at a
                    speed of thirty miles an hour, but the wear 1 of engines and carriages must be
                    increased. '</p>
                <p>The whole question of gradients is only beginning to be understood; and we have
                    no doubt that at some future time railways will be made much more level than
                    they now are. There is no reason why in many cases hydraulic locks should not be
                    used to carry the trains up and down different levels, and to do away with the
                    inclined planes. The practical effect of gravity is not well known. We have long
                    had the angle of repose given as 1 in 280. This is correct with some carriages
                    and waggons, but others differ extremely. Care must be taken where two planes
                    meet that they are eased into each other if their difference is much. This is
                    best done by laying a short piece of the line level. We have known an instance
                    in which, at an inclination of 1 in 330, a waggon ran down 4 miles, and acquired
                    a velocity of 8 miles an hour. The question is not at what angle a carriage will
                    just become quiescent, but at what angle will a velocity be acquired which can
                    have a useful practical effect. The Irish railway commissioners have taken this
                    at 1 in 140; whilst on the London and Birmingham railway the Euston extension
                    plane is for a considerable part of its length 1 in 75, the trains on it
                    attaining a velocity of 30 miles an hour, and working remarkably well. It is
                    unfortunate, too, that their classification of engines does not contain at all,
                    those in use on that line. The third class is the nearest, but will give much
                    too little as the power of those engines, which go 60 miles an hour up
                    considerable inclined planes. The third class has 11-inch cylinders, 18-inch
                    stroke and 5-feet wheels, the weight being, engine, 8½ tons, tender, 5½.</p>
                <p>The principal difference between this class and the engines on the London and
                    Birmingham railway is, that the latter have 5½-feet wheels and 12-inch
                    cylinders. Taking, however, the above third-class engine, and allowing the
                    friction of the engine gear to be 51 lbs., the friction of the engine on the
                    railway 68 lbs., the friction of the tender 49½ lbs., and the atmospherical
                    pressure upon the piston 190.06 inches, reduced in the inverse proportion of
                    twice the stroke of the piston to the circumference of the working wheel, or
                    533½ lbs., we have a total absorbed power of 702 lbs. before the engine can
                    move, or, which is the same thing, a steam pressure of 702 lbs. is requisite for
                    that purpose. Now the whole power being the area of the piston multiplied by the
                    pressure, say 64.7 lbs., when the steam is at 50 lbs., we get for the whole
                    power of the engine 2337 lbs., or the power to propel the load 1639 lbs., which,
                    even with 9 lbs. per ton friction caused by the load, gives a fraction of 182
                    tons on a level.</p>
                <p>Supposing a load of 88 tons, including the tender, on a level, to be drawn at the
                    rate of 20 miles an hour, and that it has to ascend afterwards a plane of 1 in
                    140, we have then the absorbed power =702 lbs.; 88 tons at 9 lbs. per ton =792
                    lbs. or 1494 lbs. power of steam pressure required for this load on a horizontal
                    plane. But when the train comes to the inclined plane, the weight of the engine
                    has first to be added, making the load 100 tons, or 224000 lbs., and <hi
                    rend="superscript">1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">140</hi> of this, or 1600 lb.,
                    is the additional traction required, and taking every 8 lb. traction to cause 1
                    lb. additional friction on the engine gear, gives 200 lbs., therefore the whole
                    pow er or steam pressure required is, up the plane, 3294 lbs., and the velocity
                    being inversely as the pressure, we have 3294: 1494=20: 9, or the velocity will
                    be reduced to 9 miles an hour; in other words, the time expended in ascending
                    the inclined plane will be more than double that which would be required on an
                    horizontal plane, but as the descending will be performed in the same time as if
                    it was a horizontal plane, and as 1494: 3294=1: 2∙2, the equivalent length of
                    the horizontal plane, the length of the ascending plane being unity, will be
                    2∙2, and the average of the two will be l∙6.</p>

                    principally on the safe side, we give here the most useful one for the

                    engine and tender, being 80 tons, and the length of the inclined plane being
                    taken as unity.</p>

                <p>The great disadvantages arising from bad gradients, are capable of being
                    tolerably well estimated by these tables; but the principal evil is the expense
                    which they occasion, since the load to be carried along the whole line must not
                    be heavier than can be drawn by the engines up the inclined planes, or else
                    additional engines must be employed to assist at those places. On some of the
                    American railways, there are planes so steep that sails are made use of in
                    descending them to check the velocity. The Irish railway commission have
                    computed the cost of working locomotive engines with different loads, as in the
                    following table, in which, as in the preceding one extracted from them, the
                    engine may be expected to do more than is stated.</p>
                <p>This table, as far as expense goes, can only be considered as an approximation;
                    the steam pressure too, which is taken at 9 lb. per ton, is higher than what is
                    now found to be the case; but it will, nevertheless, shew the relative expense;
                    for instance, if the engine can draw 191 tons on a level, and there are
                    gradients of <hi rend="subscript">5</hi> J <hi rend="subscript">δ</hi> on the
                    line of railway, the load, to enable the engine to ascend these, must be only 75
                    tons, and the ratio of expense will be 1∙04—∙72= •32, or the increased cost of
                    the engine will be 32 per cent, on its journey, besides, there being three
                    journeys to carry the 191 tons, so that the expense and locomotive power will be
                    quadruple what it would amount to if the line was level, and double what it
                    would be with no incline beyond ι⅛o∙</p>

                <p>When, therefore, the flying levels are complete for the three or four lines, as
                    we have before directed, the engineer and manager, or secretary, should bring
                    all their information together, and throwing it into one common stock, select
                    that line out of the whole, which, on the fullest deliberation, appears to be
                    the best with reference to its gradients, geology, commercial importance, and
                    the facilities it affords for soundly and cheaply constructing the necessary
                    works. This subject will of course require deep attention, and the reasons for
                    the selection should be written out in the fullest and clearest manner, for the
                    inspection of any proprietor who may desire to see them, publicity always
                    insuring confidence; and in most cases, it would be best to submit vital points
                    of this kind to a general meeting of the whole body, before proceeding to
                    parliament to obtain an act of incorporation. This would entirely prevent any
                    mistrust.</p>
                <p>That these matters require the greatest consideration, will be apparent from the
                    difficulty, delay, and expense of obtaining acts of parliament for railways. The
                    cost of that for the Liverpool and Manchester line, for instance, thirty miles,
                    was about L∙900 per mile. That for the London and Birmingham, 112 miles, was
                    L.72,869, or L.650, 12s. per mile; and it is well known that the expense has
                    reached L.1000 per mile on long lines, and that latterly, in every new session
                    of parliament, there have been fresh difficulties thrown in the way of obtaining
                    the necessary acts, till it is now nearly impossible to succeed at all.</p>
                <p>• There are many very great hardships connected with 'obtaining an act of
                    incorporation for a railway. Parlia-'ment requires that a plan and section of
                    every part of the ground through which the intended line is to pass, shall be
                    lodged with their clerk, and with the clerks of the peace in every county
                    through which the railway goes. This is a very proper regulation, in order that
                    every landholder may be able, by travelling a convenient distance, to have a
                    personal inspection of a duly authorised document, so as to examine the nature
                    and extent of the benefit, or tile inconvenience which it may occasion to his
                    particular property; but parliament should at the same time have given the
                    railway companies the power of complying with this wholesome regulation, in the
                    same way as road surveys are made in Ireland, by an order from two magistrates
                    to enter any requisite grounds. This, however, is not done, and therefore it
                    follows, as a necessary consequence, that the projectors of these undertakings,
                    no matter how beneficial or important soever to the community at large, are left
                    entirely at the mercy of the landholders, whether they can make their survey or
                    not. We have ourselves known, that when decided opposition has been evinced to
                    the undertaking, the engineers and surveyors have been put to all possible
                    shifts to obtain the necessary data for their plans and sections. M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> orking by night with lanthoms has even been
                    unavoidably resorted to; and in one case, where the proprietor was a clergyman,
                    he was watched on Sunday until he went into his church, and a strong party
                    immediately setting to work, just succeeded in finishing the business as he
                    concluded his sermon.</p>
                <p>The facilities of opposing a bill in parliament are so great, that every
                    temptation is held out to do so, especially when the rich harvest to counsel,
                    solicitors, and witnesses, is considered; and as has been well observed by the
                    Irish railway commissioners, discussions are mooted of the most discursive and
                    discordant kinds, relating to all the abstract professional matter in the most
                    distant manner connected with a railway. The principies of curves and gradients
                    are entered into with mathematical precision, and the laws of friction and
                    gravity are investigated; questions about which the counsel and the court are
                    often equally ignorant, the one side seeking to swell the estimates and lower
                    the profits, and the other pulling in the opposite direction, like the bulls and
                    bears on the stock exchange, till at last, probably after the expenditure of
                    thousands, the bill is thrown out, not on its own merits or demerits, but
                    because, perhaps, a notice to the proprietor of five or six yards of a cabbage
                    garden, was left next door by mistake.</p>
                <p>The parliamentary rules are now as much too strict, as they were at first too
                    loose. The time when the required plans and sections are to be deposited, is
                    very inconvenient; two years at least being required between the deposits being
                    paid and the act obtained. Thus, at the present time, if any line is wished to
                    be procured, the surveys must be made in the autumn of 1838, the plans must be
                    lodged and the notices given in March 1839, the petition for the bill presented
                    to the Commons in February 1840, and supposing the act obtained the same
                    session, little if any real work can be done until the spring of 1841. The
                    subscription of ten per cent, required on the capital, merely leads to delusion;
                    bankers in general advance the money, and whether the bill succeeds or fails,
                    they get it back with interest and commission, for by the very terms of the
                    order of the House of Commons, it may be paid back to the person advancing it.
                    The public obtain no security against a bad project by this regulation, whilst a
                    good one may be crushed for want of a speculating capitalist. Nobody is
                    benefited in fact, except the banker and the broker; and that this is the
                    process largely employed all are perfectly aware.</p>
                <p>If a bill be lost in one session, it cannot be proceeded with in the next without
                    a new contract deed being signed. This is a considerable hardship. The deviation
                    in section is too limited, and should only apply to raising embankments and
                    lowering cuttings; the reverse should be allowed to any extent, and the
                    deviation should be reckoned from the surface of the ground, and not the lateral
                    line. If the same line is kept, the effect would be the same, but by removing to
                    a different level, what may be cutting in one respect may be embanking in
                    another. The limitations in all respects as to deviations may be considered as
                    too strict, and they always have the effect of cramping the company and their
                    engineer; palpable improvements in many cases, have been abandoned on account of
                    the heavy cost of going to parliament for new acts; and others in all
                    probability would never have been made, except that the companies in question
                    were forced to apply for a new act, in order to enable them to borrow more
                    money, and then the improvement is put in along with the rest as a rider.</p>
                <p>When the intended line is once decided on, the surveyors should be sent out as
                    speedily as possible; and these are followed by the levellers, who are the
                    engineers. It will be best to survey wide, when you are not quite certain of the
                    exact position of the line; the surveyors give in their plans to the engineers,
                    who proceed to lay down upon them the line as their levelling goes on, taking
                    care as nearly as possible to balance the cuttings and embankments. It will <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=30"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0030-0020"/>save the engineers a deal of trouble, if, where
                    curves are to be run, a man is sent a-head to put in marks at short distances,
                    giving him the measure from the nearest hedge on the plan, which measure he
                    takes on the ground, and sticks in his mark.</p>
                <p>It will be best to take ground enough to make the embankments sufficiently wide;
                    if this is not attended to, when they come to shrink, as they undoubtedly will,
                    they become toonarrow, and an addition has to be made to their width, which will
                    be found a very troublesome operation, such additions being peculiarly liable to
                    slip.</p>
                <p>The survey, with complete plans and book of reference, containing the land for at
                    least three times the width required for the railway, shewing every field
                    numbered for each parish, with its owner and occupier, ought not to cost more
                    than L.15 per mile. The best plan will be to survey as wide as is intended to
                    apply for a power of deviation in the act of parliament.</p>
                <p>The next thing is for the engineer to make out his detailed estimates, and get
                    ready his plans and sections to be deposited in parliament, and with the clerks
                    of the peace for the several counties through which the line will pass; he
                    should consult the standing orders of both houses, or be supplied with such
                    extracts as relate to his department. In his estimates there are unfortunately
                    many difficulties; and most people forget the distinction between a railway
                    being completed and opened, and opened and completed. Besides this, let an
                    engineer be ever so much inclined to make a full and clear exposition of the
                    cost of a line of railway, he may plainly see that if he does so the line will
                    never be made, although it would be a profitable speculation. We should
                    recommend, nevertheless, that no other but a correct and fair estimate should in
                    all cases be furnished, in order to compare it with the traffic. For this
                    purpose, every known bridge and viaduct should be separately computed, and ample
                    allowance made for occupation bridges; the land, together with all the
                    earthwork, tunnels, fencing, and permanent way should then be calculated, the
                    secretary furnishing an estimate of the office expenses, printing, stationery,
                    travelling expenses, law, advertising, conveyancing, and all other items of this
                    kind. At least ten per cent, should be added to the engineering estimate for
                    stations, and the machinery connected with them, and a full allowance for
                    engines and carriages. When every thing that can be thought of is thus collected
                    together, allow not less that twenty-five per cent, for contingencies; and note
                    that by a mean of nearly 100 railways, the whole number of bridges average 2f
                    per mile.</p>
                <p>In estimating for rock, as this is seldom found except in deep cuttings, it may
                    generally be taken as earth-work, with the necessary slopes. For instance, in a
                    cutting forty-five Qeep, with slopes two to one, and a base of thirty feet, the
                    sectional area of the opening, and of course the cubic contents of any given
                    length, is four times the area of the cut of the same length with vertical
                    sides, and a price on a rock cutting thus taken out, may be put at four times as
                    much as the earth cutting with slopes, without any increase of estimate. In
                    shallow cuttings this does not hold good; but the excess may safely be thrown on
                    the contingencies, the amount not being great, and the occurrence seldom. In a
                    thirty-feet cutting, the difference is only three times, which may be sufficient
                    when the rock is not very hard, with the saving in land to assist the price; but
                    in a sixty-feet cutting, with slopes of two to one, the quantity is five times
                    that of vertical cutting, and with the saving in the land occupied by the
                    slopes, would make the rock cutting much the cheapest, unless of extraordinary
                    hardness. It will take more time to cut through the rock, length for length, but
                    would not if it could be entered at several places at once. Where land is
                    extremely valuable, it will in many cases be cheapest in a cutting to support
                    the sides with re taining walls, purchasing little more than the absolute width
                    • of the railway. ^</p>
                <p>The width of the land required, will of course vary with the depth of the
                    cuttings and length of the embankments, together with the slopes necessary to be
                    given; rock, for instance, stands generally vertical, chalk varies from £ to 1,
                    to 1 to 1; gravel 1 { <hi rend="subscript">r</hi> to 1; the coal measures 1^ to
                    1. The London clay has been made to stand at 1 to 1, and has slipped at 3 to 1,
                    depending greatly upon the dryness of it when tipped into the embankment. Blue
                    soapy shale has slipped at.4 to 1, for instance, on Bugbrook Downs, in
                    Northamptonshire; and in every stratum there are great variations, much
                    depending on the weather. Bad material in wet weather will often stand at no
                    slope whatever. A double line will have ample width in fifteen yards, allowing
                    two yards on each side for the drainage and fencing. The land required for this
                    amounts to 5,455 acres per mile forward, and if 1-454545 is multiplied by the
                    number of yards in perpendicular height, in any embankment or cutting, at slopes
                    of 2 to 1, it will give the additional number of acres per mile forward, and by
                    a geometrical average, the whole line may be very closely estimated in this way.
                    For example,takea line of 112 miles in length,and 15yardsinbreadth, for railway,
                    ditching, and fencing, and averaging in height of embankments and depth of
                    cutting 24 feet or 8 yards, then 5-455x112=610-96 acres for railway, ditching,
                    and fencing, and 8 x 1-454545 X 112=1303-27 acres, required for the slopes at 2
                    to 1, this giving a total of 1914 acres, and this mode of estimating may be
                    considered to include the land required for stations and approaches to
                    bridges.</p>
                <p>It will be necessary to compute, in many cases, whether a viaduct will not be
                    cheaper than an embankment. The method of doing this will be found in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Viaduct.</hi> Where expense is a great object,
                    timber may be made use of; beams of which, trussed with iron, have lately been
                    introduced instead of arches, and to a great extent in some cases, for instance
                    the Midland Counties railway. On the North Union railway, a timber viaduct is
                    constructed of great height; several similar works are in course of execution in
                    the north of England; and in some of the Scotch railways the system of trussed
                    beams of timber has been applied to very large spans. In many instances, a
                    considerable reduction in the cost of bridges and viaducts may thus be made,
                    especially where the crossings are very oblique, or where the additional height
                    of arches would involve great expense in embanked approaches.</p>
                <p>Should money be short and time so valuable as to make the expeditious opening of
                    the line a subject of the first importance, great part of the excavations may be
                    removed at night after the line is open, where they are not required for the
                    embankments. This plan is not, however, to be recommended, and still less so
                    making the embankments less than their full width at first; the additional patch
                    of embankments hardly ever uniting equally with the part first made, but sliding
                    off, and leaving the side of the embankment as smooth as glass.</p>
                <p>Expense again may be saved where land is valuable, by iron colonnade viaducts, by
                    which means towns may be entered much farther than is now possible to do without
                    an enormous outlay. The cost of such a viaduct will in general not exceed
                    two-thirds of a brick one of the same height and width; in fact, there are many
                    ways in which expenses may be lowered, and the railway got into work in a speedy
                    and safe manner at a moderate outlay; after which, if the project turns out a
                    successful one, ornament may be attended to, to any extent which may be thought
                    advisable.</p>
                <p>In the same manner it should be calculated whether a tunnel or an open cutting
                    will be the cheapest mode of getting through hills of importance. The method of
                    doing this will be shewn in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Tunned.</hi> Where
                    rock <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=31"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0031-0021"/>is found at the bottom of the cutting, of course
                    the sides may be nearly vertical, and the upper strata may have any required
                    slope given to them. In such a case it will be advisable to have a tolerably
                    wide bench where the change of slope takes place; this should be done in every
                    case where there is a variation in the slopes, and the drainage well attended
                    to. By attention to Riese points, a greater saving will be made in the quantity
                    of land required.</p>
                <p>There are so many ways of computing earth work, all of them equally accurate,
                    that the choice consists mainly in using the one which occupies the least time.
                    Tables have also been published for taking out the cubic contents by inspection.
                    The following formula, however, which we have arranged for this purpose, is so
                    very quick in bringing out the results, that we have always given it the
                    preference over any other method.</p>

                <p>And as 30 feet is a very general width, if we adapt our formula to that, we have

                <p>And for any other widths and slopes the results will be brought out very quickly,
                    byan adaptation of the general formula. By the particular ones given above, the
                    tables on the precedingpage were computed, giving the cubic contents per chain
                    in length, at one view, for every foot in height, up to 50. In the column for
                    the area, the decimals are given to three places of figures, but four places
                    were used in calculating the cubical content. Where a dot is placed after the
                    last figure in the column for the area, it denotes that the same figure goes on
                    <hi rend="italic">in infinitum.</hi> In using the column of cubic contents,
                    increase the last decimal figure by I when it is above 5.</p>
                <p>The columns of “half-widths,” in the preceding tables, will enable the engineer
                    to set out his work from the centre pegs as he proceeds. This is done at once,
                    where the country is level, on the cross section; but in sidelong ground a
                    correction will be required, to obtain which, after the halfwidth has been
                    staked out, the level should be planted over the centre peg, and the height
                    above and below the cross level taken at the points which mark the half-width.
                    It is evident, that for each foot which these points may be above and below the
                    level of the centre peg, one foot must be added to the half-width on the side
                    which is above the centre, and subtracted from it on the side which is below,
                    where the slopes are 1 to 1, and a corresponding alteration at all other slopes;
                    or if we put</p>
                <p>A'= the height above the centre, or depth below it, “i: 1 = the base to the
                    perpendicular, c= the correction, c= <hi rend="underline">~ <hi
                    rend="superscript">t</hi> ~</hi><hi rend="italic">mh',</hi> where c is + on the
                    high side, and — on the low one. This will give a first approximation, and may
                    be repeated if necessary, by levelling to the half-width thus corrected, and
                    proceeding as before, and the cubic contents must receive a similar correction
                    when necessary, our tables presuming the cross section to be on a level. The
                    average height, however, can in almost every case be taken perfectly near enough
                    for every practical purpose.</p>
                <p>It is a great pity that the custom has not been generally introduced of taking
                    all the measures in yards and decimals, surveying staffs being marked to j¼ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> fj</hi> ths of a yard. This would reduce the calculations
                    considerably; and the reduction of any of them to feet, for plans and sections
                    required in Parliament, or any other isolated purpose, would be infinitely less
                    troublesome than using feet throughout, and having to divide by 9 or 27 for the
                    area and cubic content.</p>
                <p>The column of half-widths, when required for any other slopes or widths than
                    those we have given, may be readily computed by the formula tc, x=- <hi
                    rend="subscript">+</hi> mA</p>
                <p>where <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is the half-width at the top, and tc, <hi
                    rend="italic"> m,</hi> and A as before.</p>
                <p>The column of cubic contents, when required for any other width than 30 feet, may
                    be readily found, by using a correction c' to the cubic contents at 30 feet,
                    which correction is + when the width is above 30 feet, and — when below,

                    correction is the same for all slopes, taking care to add or subtract it from
                    the cubic contents for 30 feet at the given slope.</p>
                <p>With reference to apportioning the work, so that the cuttings and embankments may
                    be equal, regard must be had to the nature of the soil to be moved. For
                    instance, in the London clay it will be found that any quantity of cutting will
                    not make the same quantity of embankment by about ten per cent., whereas in
                    common earth just the reverse takes place, and the cutting will make an
                    embankment nearly ten per cent, greater.</p>
                <p>There is a point, which, in the early stage of laying out a railway is too often
                    lost sight of, that ought to be a subject of the deepest consideration; in fact,
                    it is of vital importance to the whole interest of the line in question, and no
                    pains ought to be spared in most fully and rigidly investigating it; and this
                    is, to what extent cutting and embanking can be advantageously carried, that is
                    to say, a line perfectly level, allowing for the curvature of the earth, from
                    one end to the other, being the point of perfection, how near ought this to be
                    approached, looking on the one hand at the first outlay, and on the other at the
                    future gain, in the cost of locomotive power, and repairs of engines, carriages,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>We can calculate the cost, for instance, of making a line having no inclinations
                    in any case greater than 1 in 300. With this line we should have a determinate
                    outlay in locomotive power and repairs. The question to be considered then is
                    simply this: If we make the line, instead of having no inclination, greater than
                    1 in 300, to have none greater than 1 in 500, or 1 in 1000, do we lay a
                    foundation for a yearly saving, when the railway comes into work, sufficiently
                    great to pay us for the consequent first cost of these reductlons in the
                    inclinations?</p>
                <p>In order to enter properly into this question, experiments must be made for the
                    purpose of determining the cost of locomotive power on the various inclinations,
                    selecting some railway where different engines can be employed on inclines
                    suitable for the case in hand, there being no data in existence, in this country
                    at least, which can with certainty decide this point. The following table, by
                    the engineer of the New York and Erie railroad, may help us a little:—</p>

                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=33"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0033-0023"/>
                <p>This table, giving principally impracticable gradients, will only serve to shew
                    us that the ratio of expense is an increasing one, the first differences being
                    respectively Ov: 0-7: 1-05: 1-33 :0-91: 1-47: 1-75.</p>
                <p>If we admit, till we can obtain better data, that altering our gradients from 1
                    in 250 to 1 in 500, saves two-tenths of the expense of locomotive power, and
                    that reducing it to a level instead of leaving it at 1 in 500, saves two more
                    tenths, we can easily see what the effect of that would be.</p>
                <p>The number of tons carried, as given in the table, is not decreased according to
                    the law of gravity alone, but contains another element, most probably the result
                    of experience on the road in question. Suppose then that on the road we are
                    about to construct we may expect to work seven trains per day each way, with
                    passengers, there being ten carriages in each train, averaging four tons each,
                    and travelling at the rate of twenty miles an hour, and two trains each way with
                    goods, in ten waggons per train, averaging goods and waggons five tons each, and
                    going at the rate of ten miles an hour; also let the railway in question be one
                    hundred miles in length; then at a cost of L.304 per day, the passengers being
                    taken at eighteen in each carriage at £d. each per mile, and the goods at ^d.
                    per ton per mile, at which price it is known they can be carried, we may
                    presume, that if, instead of having an inclination of 1 in 250, our road was
                    level, we should decrease these expenses four-tenths, or bring them to about
                    L.182 per day, or L.66,430 per annum. Thus presuming the above to be correct, we
                    should be saving money, if our road could be made level at an additional expense
                    of one million.</p>
                <p>Each particular railroad must of course form a separate case, but we are
                    persuaded it will generally be found that a large outlay will be justified in
                    approximating to a level as near as possible; and where the line is entirely so,
                    the cuttings can always be cleared of water, by sloping the side draining down
                    each way, from the centre till they arrive at the nearest water course, where as
                    usual they will deliver their contents. Our practical knowledge of this subject
                    of reducing railways to a level is founded on such slight data, that a careful
                    set of experiments in order to shew the way more fully into such a question is
                    very much wanted; and we question whether hydraulic locks will not be found to
                    save a considerable expense in difficult situations, bringing the trains from
                    one level to another, by which means railways may be made through tracts of
                    country which would otherwise never pay for the necessary outlay.</p>
                <p>When the contracts along the line are fairly at work, one of the first knotty
                    points which the directors will have to decide on, is, the width of the rails,
                    their shape, the length of their bearing, and the form of their chair. The width
                    between the rails has only lately become a subject of dispute; nearly all the
                    railways prior to the Great Western, having been laid down 4 feet 8£ inches
                    apart. Mr. Brunei has extended it to seven feet; the Irish railway commission
                    recommend six feet two inches; several of the Scottish railways are laid down at
                    five feet six inches; in fact, the variations run from four and a-half to seven
                    feet.</p>
                <p>The question of the stability of the carriages on the railway may be left out of
                    consideration in looking at this matter, because the machinery will always
                    require sufficient space between the wheels to insure this. Now, as four feet
                    eight inches and-a-half are found to be enough for the good performance of an
                    engine, which, with five and a-half feet wheels, will go on a level upwards of
                    60 miles an hour; as with five-feet wheels, Marshal Soult, on his visit to
                    Liverpool just after the Queen’s coronation, was taken over lOf miles of
                    favourable ground on the Grand Junction Railway within 10 minutes; and as an
                    engine has gone 60 miles an hour on the London and Birmingham Railway up an
                    inclined plane, is it wise or prudent to make any change at all, and will any
                    additional speed, which may be gained by increasing the width of the rails and
                    the diameter of the wheels, compensate for the greater expense and the outlay
                    which will constantly be required to keep the road in order on account of the
                    increased weight? This will receive light from the experiments on the Great
                    Western, but will not be fully decided until it be tried on the Irish or some
                    other railways, as Mr. Brunei’s rails are altogether different from most others
                    in use. The plan recommended by the Irish railway commissioners, of putting the
                    rails farther apart but not widening the carriages, merely making the wheels run
                    outside the bodies, is a good one in some respects; but it would add to the
                    expense of the works considerably, and the result would be exceedingly
                    questionable.</p>
                <p>It must not be forgotten, that, where a different width from that in common use
                    is adopted, the railway on which it is used becomes isolated. None but its own
                    carriages can travel on it, and they can travel on no other line. This alone
                    will, in most cases, be a serious objection. For our own parts we should say,
                    let well alone; wait for more experience; we are yet infants amongst railways,
                    and we ought not to innovate on that which has been proved to do well, until we
                    become giants. The majority of opinions, however, are beginning to lean towards
                    some increase in the width, although there is every diversity in the quantity
                    which practical men think necessary. Certainly the machinery under the boiler is
                    compressed into its minimum space, and more room for it would be a great
                    advantage, if it does not induce an incommensurate loss in other ways.</p>
                <p>With respect to the form of the rail, it can be proved that a fish belly has
                    greater strength, weight for weight, than any other. A 601b. fish belly at
                    three-feet bearings, rolled with a lower web, would be the best form of all; and
                    this has been effected, as the original Liverpool and Manchester rails had
                    partially this shape. The question, however, must be looked at in conjunction
                    with the length between the supports. We have given below those forms most
                    approved of in practice, and have added that in use on the Great Western
                    Railway, which is however light, and does not stand well, three feet having been
                    the original distance of the bearings.</p>
                <p>Fig. 3 is the old Liverpool and Manchester rail, laid down at three-feet
                    bearings; weight thirty-three lbs. per yard, with square joints. This rail was
                    rolled with a lateral swell at the bottom, which on one side was continued the
                    whole length, but on the other did not quite reach the chair. One side of the
                    chair was cast with a cavity, into which the lateral swell fitted, and the
                    opposite side had a nearly similar opening, in which was driven an iron key,
                    shaped like a wedge, which, entering in a longitudinal direction, not only
                    forced the swell into the cavity which was formed to receive it, but by this
                    means, at the same time, kept the rail down in the chair.</p>
                <p>Fig. 4. Losh’s patent rail, in which he sought to gain a still more powerful mode
                    of keeping the rail down in the chair, by having his key tapered vertically as
                    well as longitudinally, so as to act as a wedge downwards, as well as in the
                    direction of its length; whilst, at the same time, the necessary expansion and
                    contraction is allowed to take place.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0034-0024"/>
                <p>A key on each side has also been used with this form of rail, still, however, the
                    keys were always found to work loose. Losh had also a projection rolled on the
                    bottom of his rail; at the part which lies in the chair, where a corresponding
                    cavity was cast to receive it, so that the effect of expansion or contraction
                    would have a tendency to raise the rail in the chair, and thus wedge it tighter.
                    The upper part of the notch for receiving the key in the chair was also formed
                    with a slight curve, to allow of a small motion in the block, and the rails were
                    made with a half-lap joint, formed not by cutting the middle rib of the rail,
                    but by setting it back, so as to preserve its whole strength. They were laid
                    down at three feet bearings, and weighed forty-four lbs. per yard, but of course
                    were not restricted to that, or to any other weight.</p>
                <p>Fig.5. The London and Birmingham fifty pound fish-bellied rail. This was laid
                    down at three-feet bearings, and the half-lap joint formed by setting back the
                    middle rib instead of cutting it, in the same way as Losh’s rail. It was keyed
                    down by a pin going through the side of the chair in a direction sloping
                    downwards. The end of this pin went into a notch in the side of the rail, at its
                    lower parts; the pin was forced tightly in by an iron key acting through the
                    chair, and also through a hole in the pin, by which it was driven both in and
                    downwards; and the end of the key being split, was then opened, to prevent it
                    being shaken loose. Mr. Stephenson has a patent for this chair. The rails did
                    not rest on the bottom of the chair, but on a loose piece of iron, the lower
                    part of which was the segment of a circle, and the upper part flat, and of the
                    same width as the middle rib of the rail; and this worked in a circular cavity
                    in the chair, so as to allow a motion when deflection took place in the rail.
                    These rails had no bottom webs.</p>
                <p>Fig. 6 is the St. Helen’s and Runcorn rail, with a bottom web, having a
                    semicircular base. These rails are forty-two lbs. per yard, and were laid down
                    at three-feet bearings. A</p>
                <p>wedge on both sides is used, which acts downwards as well as sideways, from the
                    opening in the chair to receive it being narrower at the top than at the
                    bottom.</p>
                <p>Fig. 7 shews the parallel rails laid down on the Grand Junction, and London and
                    Birmingham railways. The left hand one is sixty-four lbs. per yard on the London
                    and Birmingham, and sixty-two lbs. per yard on the Grand Junction.</p>
                <p>The right hand one is the London and Birmingham seventy-five pound rail. Rails of
                    this kind are laid on seventy-five miles of that railway, and were intended to
                    be at five feet bearings, but proved a complete failure at that distance, which
                    had to be reduced to three feet nine inches. The left hand one was intended to
                    be at four feet bearings. These rails were both laid down contrary to the
                    opinion of the engineer, Mr. Stephenson, and have entailed a vast expense on
                    that company. They have wooden wedges.</p>
                <p>Fig. 8 is the Great Western rail, laid on longitudinal timbers, and forty-four
                    lbs. per yard. Felt is laid between the rail and the timber, and the former is
                    fastened down with screws. It has been found deficient in strength for the heavy
                    engines used upon that railway.</p>
                <p>Fig. 9 has been frequently adopted on railways formed with longitudinal bearings.
                    It is spiked down to the timbers, and requires no chair. The weights have varied
                    from thirty five to sixty lbs. per yard. Sometimes the spikes have not gone
                    through holes in the rail as in the figure, but have been driven in just outside
                    each edge of the rail; in which case they are made with large heads, which come
                    down and clip the rail firmly to the timbers.</p>
                <p>The London and Birmingham Railway Company, after a long discussion, decided to
                    try four and five feet with a parallel form instead of a fish-belly, which,
                    requiring one-third more height in the chair, had, in addition to other
                    disadvantages, that of being more liable to wring the chair from the block,
                    which is found in practice to take place directly as the height of the chair.
                    The block is also more loosened in the ground by a high chair, and the continual
                    repairs arising from this loosening, amount to one-half the wages expended in
                    repairing the way in general; hence every means of diminishing such a heavy
                    item, which can possibly be devised, should be put in practice. As usual, where
                    all was theory, there were considerable diversities of opinion. Those who wish
                    to enter more at large on this subject, may consult Professor Barlow in favour
                    of lengthening the bearings, and Lieutenant Lecount against it. As the matter
                    has had a fair trial, it is only necessary here to slate the results.</p>
                <p>On the Primrose Hill contract, which was laid with four<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=35" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0035-0025"
                    />feet bearings, it was found much more troublesome to keep the permanent way in
                    order, than with bearings of three feet. With the four-feet bearings, it was
                    found, that, in a very short time, the rails were put out of gauge, the width
                    continually increasing, until it became absolutely necessary to readjust the
                    whole. This was observed in a very marked manner with a part of the line near
                    Kilburn, which had been recently laid down.</p>
                <p>On the Harrow contract, from the crossing of the Harrow road to No. 12 cutting,
                    the permanent road was used for conveying away the material from a side cutting.
                    The traffic was of course considerable, but not by any means such as to account
                    for the absolute difficulty which the contractors had in keeping the railway in
                    guage. They were obliged to put sleepers at the joints in addition to the
                    regular number of blocks, which of course kept the rails in guage at those
                    points; but notwithstanding this, the intermediate blocks moved outwards. When
                    the engineer’s attention was first called to this position of the permanent way,
                    he was inclined to think that something might be attributed to the blocks being
                    placed anglewise; but after giving this part of the subject his careful
                    consideration, he felt satisfied that the position of the blocks was at least as
                    firm as the square position; and he felt confirmed in this opinion, by the fact,
                    that, in another portion of the line near Kensal Green, where the road was laid
                    in the ordinary manner with blocks three feet apart, and placed anglewise, and
                    where locomotive engincs had been constantly running for eighteen months, there
                    was not found any greater tendency to amotion outwards, than when they were laid
                    square to the direction of the rail, in the old manner. If, therefore, the
                    diagonal position of the blocks had been defective, this was the place to try
                    it; for the quantity of material conveyed over this part of the permanent road
                    in waggons without springs, and with heavy locomotive engines, was very great
                    indeed, and under circumstances well calculated to detect any marked difference
                    in the construction.</p>
                <p>On the Berkhampstead contract, where five-feet bearings were in use, and where a
                    locomotive engine was at work, the contractors made heavy complaints of the
                    greater difficulty they had experienced in keeping the rails in gauge than there
                    was with the shorter bearings. In fact, in the eighteen months prior to June
                    1837, the three-feet rails in some parts of the line, had more work than they
                    now have, where the line is open; yet they stood it well, whilst the five feet
                    have been so put out of gauge by one day’s work, that the waggons had to be
                    stopped till one and two additional sleepers for each five feet could be laid
                    down, and even thentheywere but indifferent; and similar complaintshaving come
                    in from other quarters, together with the fact that the five-feet bearings on
                    the Liverpool and Manchester railway were found to cost double the sum for
                    keeping the way in repair that was required with three feet nine-inches
                    bearings, the whole question had to be opened again, and the directors resolved
                    to shorten the bearings from five feet to three feet nine inches.</p>
                <p>This lateral deflection is of most serious importance, when we recollect that the
                    rails being out of guage will throw the trains off the line. The lateral blow s
                    which an engine may give are such, that several chairs in succession have been
                    broken or knocked off’ the blocks and sleepers; and the absolute weight passing
                    over any one rail may be fairly taken as three times the nominal weight, for the
                    effect from lurching has been experimentally found with engines having three
                    tons’ weight on each of the driving wheels to increase that weight to seven
                    tons; besides which, we know that four-wheeled engines, for instance, will, in
                    practice, be frequently running on three wheels, no railroad being a perfect
                    plane; and when these three points are in the act of shifting, the engine during
                    that time is only supported on two wheels.</p>
                <p>VOL. xix.</p>
                <p>The flexure produced by this weight perpendicularly has also this bad effect,
                    that the engine and train are constantly ascending an inclined plane in
                    practice, although the railway is considered as level, and of course where the
                    railway has an inclination, that inclination will be proportionally increased.
                    This was first pointed out by Professor Barlow, and is an important fact; for on
                    the short planes between each block or sleeper caused by the deflection of the
                    rail, the gain in descent is so insignificant, that it may be entirely
                    neglected; consequently the engines and carriages are constantly going up an
                    inclined plane between each support of the rails equivalent to the central
                    deflection divided by twice the distance between the supports. This is, from
                    calculation, ascertained to be as follows, viz. :—</p>

                <p>Although the deflection of rails will generally be different from the above, and
                    the increase of power required to surmount the consequent planes will also
                    require considerable modification to suit the action of locomotive engines,
                    which depend upon so many other circumstances besides the action of gravity; yet
                    the fact remains the same, namely, that with deflection there is a consequent
                    loss, and the subject deserves much more consideration than it has received,
                    especially as we know that fish-bellied rails do not fail in the
                    middle,butabouteight inches from the supports. Arail ought not to act as a
                    spring; but as this to a certain extent must be the case, it should be made to
                    do so as little as possible. A spring should only be used to get over an
                    obstacle where one must be met, but if the rail acts as a spring it creates an
                    obstacle where none existed before. We must also remember that when deflection
                    becomes permanent, fracture begins, as we break a thing we are not strong enough
                    to pull asunder, by bending it backwards and forwards. In fact, the experiments
                    on deflection have hitherto been such that they have merely served to unsettle
                    all opinion, and to place one set of deductions in opposition to another. The
                    mode of estimating this element by two wheels on an axle, loaded at their
                    peripheries, and oscillated on the rails, is one which well deserves attention.
                    In all cases, the firmer the rail is fixed to the chair, as respects rising in
                    it, the less will be the deflection. Of course it must always have a motion in
                    the direction of its length to allow for expansion and contraction, the force of
                    which will vary in good or tolerable iron from nine to six tons per square inch
                    of section. The expansion of a fifteen-feet rail may betaken at∙00l26 inches for
                    each degree of Fahrenheit, and as it will not be safe to take less than 90° for
                    the range of our climate, this gives •1134 inches for the total, or ∙0567 at
                    each end of such a rail.</p>
                <p>In order to understand the action which takes place in the case of a deflected
                    rail when a heavy weight passes over it, we must know the effect of gravity at
                    the velocities used on railways. For this purpose, if we take three, four, and
                    five-feet bearings as those which seem at present likely to be the limits, the
                    following table will give us the time occupied in going over half the rail in
                    each case; and from this we shall be able to ascertain the effect of gravity
                    during that time.</p>

                <p>And denoting by <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and 5 the time and space as above, we
                    have conversely, knowing the space an engine would have to fall, for instance,
                    through a bad joint, the distance the engine would pass over without touching
                    the lower rail, by the formula</p>
                <p>_ /Z * 193·</p>
                <p>Thus when s=∙225, we have</p>
                <p>.=√S=√β∏δS=∙0341=⅛, of a second, in which, at 30 miles an hour, we find by the
                    table the engine would pass over 18 inches of the lower rail without touching
                    it, describing in its fall a parabola modified by the effect of the springs on
                    the engine.</p>
                <p>This has been put to the test of experience by bending a rail nearly half an
                    inch, and then painting it. An engine and train of carriages were then run over
                    it, none of the wheels of which touched the paint for 22 inches. This affects a
                    railway in three ways. First, when the engine has to fall, through a bad joint,
                    the rail which it leaves being higher than the rail it is coming upon, the
                    increased momentum from the fall will here occasion a larger deflection than
                    ordinary, and a consequent inclined plane against the engine, from the time it
                    comes on the rail till it passes the next chair. Secondly, when a rail is
                    permanently bent, where the resistance on the second or rising part of the rail
                    will be less than in the first case. And thirdly, when the rail is simply
                    deflected by the weight of the engine, and restores itself to its original level
                    when that weight has passed; here the effect will be least of all, the rail
                    taking the form of a receding wave before the wheel, and a following wave after
                    it.</p>
                <p>In the second case, where the rail is permanently bent, the formula for the space
                    the engine would fall will be i=Zl93∙&lt; <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , where
                    H is the height of the plane, and L its length, <hi rend="italic">s</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> being as before. For instance, if the bend is ∙1 of an inch
                    in a 3-foot rail, we have ∙r≈-l-∙193 ° =∙00l25 of an</p>
                <p>180 808 <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> 4y inch, at 30 miles an hour, and
                    s=r±193∙-Z=∙00278</p>
                <p>IoO do4 <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> lb of an inch at 20 miles an hour, or <hi
                    rend="subscript">5</hi> ¼ <hi rend="subscript">0</hi> of an inch at 20, and -
                    <hi rend="subscript">s</hi> ⅙ <hi rend="subscript">0</hi> of an inch, at 30
                    miles an hour, would be descended by the engine by the effect of gravity, in the
                    same time that steam and gravity together take it along 18 inches of the
                    rail.</p>
                <p>Let us next suppose we have steam enough to carry the engine along at a velocity
                    so great, that gravity will not bring it down the -1 of an inch perpendicular,
                    whilst steam carries it along the 18 inches horizontal, we shall find this
                    velocity to be at and above 44 miles an hour, for it takes ⅛ of a second for a
                    body to fall one-tenth of an inch by the effect of gravity, and <hi
                    rend="subscript">5</hi><hi rend="superscript">1</hi><hi rend="subscript">3</hi>
                    ": 18 in. =3600": 44 miles; hence at 44 miles an hour, and at all velocities
                    above it, the engine, after arriving on the rail, bent one-tenth of an inch in
                    the middle, and forming two planes, will no longer touch the rail till after it
                    has passed the middle of it, and velocities of 60 miles an hour have been
                    attained.</p>
                <p>In the third case, the engine does not go down a plane, as above, but has to make
                    its own curve through its weight, deflecting the rail. The necessity then of
                    knowing the laws of deflection is such, that no idea can be formed of the
                    effects these <sic>importants</sic> matters will have on the economy of
                    railroads; yet we have up to the present day positively no data to go upon,
                    which will lead us at all near the truth; and railways are constructing, at a
                    cost very little short of seven millions, without the means having been taken to
                    put such essential points as these out of the pale of doubt and uncertainty,
                    which could be done by a few well conducted experiments. We know, for example,
                    that in an iron bar, if Z= the half length, ,r= any variable distance,y= the
                    corresponding depth, and Δ = the sine of the elementary deflection, the</p>
                <p>∕⅛ <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> sum of the deflections when <hi rend="italic"
                    >x=l</hi> iy *' <hi rend="superscript">or a</hi> P <hi rend="superscript"

                    rend="subscript">τ</hi> - for a fish-bellied rail, in which latter <hi

                    =</hi> the difference of the depths divided by the half length.</p>
                <p>In some cases, where we have good experiments, the mode by which they have been
                    calculated, in order to generalize and render available their results, is
                    inaccurate, and the effect may be shewn by the following table, giving the

                    computed, and varying to an enormous degree.</p>
                <p>Column <hi rend="italic">a</hi> gives the deflections at 3 tons, deduced from the
                    experiments by the experimenter, except for the sixty-inch, which is derived
                    from the fifty-seven inch bearing. Column b gives the deflections derived from
                    the formula givenby the experimenter as the results of the same experiments.
                    Column c gives the deflections from this formula, recomputed by another person.
                    Column <hi rend="italic">d</hi> gives the deflections computed from another
                    formula given by the experimenter. Column <hi rend="italic">e</hi> gives the
                    deflections in column &lt;Z, computed by another person. Column <hi
                    rend="italic"> f</hi> gives the mean of columns c and e, which appears to be the
                    best approximation we have. Column <hi rend="italic">g</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic"> h</hi> give the deflections for 9 tons’ weight, the first being
                    derived from column α, and the second from column <hi rend="italic">f</hi> the
                    difference in the longest bearing 69 inches, being nearly 3 to 1.</p>
                <p>With this lamentable uncertainty in the data for a deduction of such importance
                    as that of a deflection in the rails causing an engine to be constantly
                    ascending an inclined plane, there is no hope of arriving at any commonly
                    accurate results. For instance, if we take the bearing of 5 feet, which Mr.
                    Barlow gives, as occasioning the ascent of a plane of 1 in 1875, the deflection,
                    with 3 tons’ weight, being ∙064, and substitute for ∙064 the deflections in
                    columns <hi rend="italic">a to f</hi> successively, we have as follows :—</p>
                <p>In which there is more than two and a-half to one difference in the results, all
                    of which are drawn from one set of experiments, whilst at the same time the
                    probability is, that the planes ought to turn out less steep instead of being
                    more so.</p>
                <p>From the effects which arise in consequence of deflection, it will be well worth
                    considering what advantages are derived from the use of felt under the chair. If
                    the rail was perfectly stiff, then, when the engine came over a chair, and
                    compressed the felt, it would afterwards have to go up an inclined plane,
                    through the rail being depressed at the block it had just passed over; and this
                    would continueto take place till the engine arrived towards the next block, when
                    it would depress the rail again in a similar way, and thus its course would be
                    continually up a partially rising plane, the assistance downwards being almost
                    insensible.</p>
                <p>But as every rail deflects more or less, the inclination produced by this cause
                    acts just exactly in the opposite manner to that which takes place through the
                    depression and spring of the felt; for whilst the wheel, from the effect of
                    deflection in the rail, descends during its passage over the first hah of the
                    rail, and ascends while going over the se cond half, the effect which the
                    compression and springing of the felt has upon it, is to make it ascend a plane
                    during its passage of the first half, and to descend during the time it is going
                    over the second half. The felt acting as a spring, however, is exceedingly
                    questionable, although maintained by some persons. Its use· will be found to
                    consist more in giving a steady seat for the chair when the block is composed of
                    hard stone, and offering a defence against the grating of the chair on the
                    block, which will otherwise take place, producing a grinding, a loss of surface,
                    and consequently a looseness, which, when once arrived at, rapidly
                    increases.</p>
                <p>From the above observations on the effects of inclined planes, we may see how
                    desirable it is to have the blocks and sleepers placed in the most accurate
                    manner, as respects uniformity of height. For we must recollect, that in a
                    three-feet rail, a difference of one quarter of an inch in the height of two
                    adjacent blocks, or, more properly speaking, in the height of the basis of two
                    adjacent chairs, converts that three feet of rail into an inclined plane, rising
                    1 in 144.</p>
                <p>With respect to placing the blocks diagonally, this is a less stable position in
                    the line of rails than when they are placed square, for the resistance of the
                    ground to the sinking of the block, whether conceived to be similar to a
                    collection of springs acting under the block, or a collection of weights acting
                    above it, must in either case be referred to the centre of gravity of each half
                    of the block, considering it as moved by the passing weights about a line drawn
                    through its middle at right angles to the line <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    rails; that is to say, in a block two feet square, and one foot thick, there are
                    12 inches in the direction of the rails, 24 inches across them, and 12 inches in
                    depth, acting on each side the axis of motion when the block is laid square, the
                    surface of each half being 288 inches. Now, any uniform effect on these 288
                    square inches drawn into the distance of their centre of gravity from the axis
                    of motion, gives for the stability of each half 1728. Any uniform effect on the
                    288 inches of a diagonal half block will give a less number; for the distance of
                    the centre of gravity from the axis of motion was 6 inches in the square block,
                    but it will be only 5∙65682 in the diagonal, being l-3d the altitude of the
                    triangle, and hence we have only 1629*16416 for the stability in the direction
                    of the rails. The diagonal block will consequently have its maximum resistance
                    to sinking at 45° from the line of the rails, or in the position where stability
                    is least required. Circular blocks have been proposed in order to get equal
                    resistance in all directions, but the gain would not be equal to the extra
                    expense, and the stability, although a trifle more than that of the diagonal
                    block in the line of the rails, is less than that of the square one; for the
                    area, as before, being 567 square inches, =∙785398d <hi rend="superscript"
                    >2</hi> , and (/being the diameter, we have d=^733∙386=27∙0811, and the radius
                    =13∙5405, and as the arc is to the chord, so is f radius to the distance of the
                    centre of gravity from the centre, or 3∙14159× 13-5405: 27∙08ll=9O2703: 5∙74678
                    inches, and 5∙74678 × 288=1655∙=07264 for the resistance.</p>
                <p>We have experimented on the two positions of the blocks, and found that when
                    placed diagonally, there was rather more resistance to lateral motion than when
                    placed square, and they are more conveniently got at to repack in the former
                    position than they are in the latter; but when placed as close as they ought to
                    be, in order to form an economical road, the diagonal position is
                    inadmissible.</p>
                <p>It will be seen from the following tables which we have computed, that instead
                    Ofincreasing the bearings from three feet, if we study economy, we should reduce
                    it; and as we have in these tables taken into account all ordinary variations in
                    the elements of expenditure, we must consider it proved that except under very
                    extraordinary circumstances, the nearer the supports are brought together up to
                    the limits here given, the cheaper will the railway be made,</p>

                <p>From these tables, it will be evident that the prices of the materials comprising
                    the permanent way, will very rarely be greater or less than the rates at which
                    they are given; and that consequently it is no longer a question, as far as
                    expense is concerned, which is the best mode of laying a railway.</p>
                <p>In these tables we have exhibited each item separately, in order that the
                    component parts of the expense may be seen, as well as the gross sum. The
                    right-hand column in each table shews the price of one yard of single rail, or
                    one-fourth the price of two lines of rails. In Table I. the rails are taken at
                    L.14 per ton, to include freight and carriage, and lOs. as the price of a block,
                    containing five square feet of stone, with its chair, &amp;c., complete,
                    including carriage; but in each table the cost of laying the way is excluded.
                    This price for the block will give 8s. for a two-feet rail, which may be thus

                <p>In calculating for any intermediate lengths not in the table, for every tenth of
                    a foot increase in the length of bearing, add 2 lbs. to the weight per yard, and
                    2∙4d. to the price per block, in each case to the tabular number, in a line with
                    that length to which the addition is made. Thus, for 2∙2 feet say 44 lbs. per
                    yard, and 8s. 4-8d. for the block; and when a different price is taken for the
                    block, increase it <hi rend="subscript">5</hi> ⅛th for each 3 inches of increase
                    in the length of the rail, and proportionally for all other lengths.</p>
                <p>The minimum price in Table I. is when the length of bearing is 2∙2 feet, being
                    then I6s. ll*45d. per yard single rail.</p>
                <p>Table II. is computed to shew that if we take the same proportion for the blocks
                    as in Table I., and at the same time keep the total expense per yard the same at
                    all lengths, we shall have too little money left to get an efficient rail; it is
                    calculated, by turning the price of the blocks in Table I. into the price per
                    yard, and subtracting this from 17s., the remainder will be the price of the
                    rail per yard, which, at l½d. per lb., will shew how heavy <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> rail can be got for that price. Thus, we see that we can only have8lbs.
                    more in a five-feet rail than we ought to have in athree-feet; besides which, we
                    cannot get up to our standard, namely, 60 lb. at three-feet bearings.</p>
                <p>Table III. shews the comparative cost with the rails at l¼d. per lb., or L.ll,
                    13s. 4d. per ton, and the minimum laying between 2¼ and 2¾ feet of bearing, we
                    shall shew how to ascertain where it exactly is, which method answers for the
                    other similar tables. Let us first take 2-6 feet for the length of bearing, and
                    adding, as before directed, 2 lbs. for this additional tenth of a foot, to the
                    weight for 2-5 feet, we get 52 lbs. per yard, as the weight at 2∙6 feet, and</p>
                <p>3 feet: 52 lbs. = 2∙6 feet: 45Ό66 lbs. for the weight per rail, which at 1 ¾d.
                    per lb. is 56∙332d. The price of a block for a 2∙5 feet length is 108d., and
                    adding 2∙4, we get 110∙4d. for the block at 2∙6 feet; and this added to the
                    price per rail, gives 166∙732d. for the total price per rail, or nearly 13s.
                    10¾d. Thus, as 2∙6 feet: 166∙732d. = 3 feet: 16s. 0∙38d. for the price per yard
                    complete of single rail, whereas at 2∙5 feet it is 16s. 0∙ld.; hence the minimum
                    lies between 2∙25 and 2∙5 feet, and not between 2∙5 and 2∙75 feet.</p>
                <p>Resuming our trial with 2∙4 feet, we have 45 + 3 = 48 lbs. for the weight per
                    yard at 2∙4 feet, and 3 feet: 48 lbs. = 2∙4 feet: 38∙4 lbs. per rail, which at
                    l¼d. per yard, costs 4s. The price of the block at 2∙25 feet is 102d., and
                    adding 3∙6d. we get 105∙6d. for the block at 2∙4 feet; that added to the price
                    of the rail, gives a total of 12s. 9∙6d., and as 2∙4 feet: 153∙6d. = 3 feet:
                    192d. or 16s. 0d., whereas the price at 2∙5 feet is lfis. 0∙ld. In the same way
                    we may repeat the calculation till we arrive at what extent of accuracy we
                    choose.</p>
                <p>Having seen the effect which lowering the price of iron has, we know that by
                    raising it, we should find it cheaper to put the blocks close together than our
                    first table indicated; thus, if iron is l¾d. per lb., we have for 2-feet rails
                    3s. 10∙666d. as the price of the rail, and Ils. 10∙666d. as the price of the
                    rail and block complete, which gives us 17s. 10d. as the price per yard, whereas
                    with 2∙25 feet rails it would be 4s. ll∙0625d. the rail, and 13s. 5∙0625d. for
                    the rail and block, or 17s. 10¾d. per yard.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=40"

                <p>Table IV. shews the effect of cheaper blocks on the total cost at each length of
                    bearing; it begins at 7s. per block, and increases 5¼d.or <hi rend="subscript"
                    >5</hi> ⅛th, for each 3 inch esof increase in the length of the rail. The price
                    of rails will never materially differ in any part of England, the freight being
                    the principal variable quantity, but the price of blocks will alter in a very
                    great degree, and the effect of this may be shewn; take, for example, 2s. 8d. as
                    the price of one for a two-feet bearing, and we know they have been procured
                    cheaper; adding to this, as we have done before, 2s. for the other items
                    connected with the block, we get 4s. 8d. as the price of a block complete, and
                    the price of the rail being 3s. 4d., the total price is 8s. per rail, or 12s.
                    per yard. In the same way we have 12s. 6d. per yard at 2¼-feet bearings; 13s.
                    ld. at 2½ feet; 13s. 7d. at 2¾ feet; 14s. 2d. at 3 feet; and 18s. lld. at 5
                    feet; hence in a railway 31 miles long, we shall find the saving, by having the
                    blocks at two feet apart, L.75,293, viz.</p>
                <p>31 miles at 5 feet,..............L.206,237</p>
                <p>„ „ 2 feet,................130,944</p>
                <p>L.75,293</p>
                <p>And as an useful approximation to this calculation, we may take each farthing per
                    yard increase of cost in the total price per yard of single rail, to give
                    L.7∙3333 per mile of double line, or in the above instance, there being 332
                    farthings between 12s. and 18s. lld., we have 7∙3333 × 332 × 3l = L.75,474.</p>
                <p>As we are obliged to place our supports close together, to get a minimum cost
                    when the blocks are less in price than the cost we first assumed, so we shall
                    find that when greater, we must increase their distance. For instance, if a
                    block for a two-feet bearing costs 9s., the cost per yard of block and rail
                    complete will be 18s. 6d.; at 2¼ feet, 18s.4½d. and at 2½ feet, 18s. 4¾d., the
                    minimum being between 2¼ and 2½ feet.</p>
                <p>We have next to see what will be the effect when the rail and block are both
                    either greater or less than in Table I. This divides itself into three branches;
                    first, when they decrease or increase in an equal ratio; secondly, when the rail
                    decreases or increases in a greater ratio than the block; and, thirdly, when the
                    block decreases and increases in a greater ratio than the rail.</p>
                <p>In the first case, the ratio of the price per yard will remain evidently the same
                    as in Table I. Thus, if both rail and block are reduced in price ⅙th, we shall
                    have at 2 feet, the price per yard, 14s. l∙875d.; at 2¼ feet, 14s. l∙66d. per
                    yard; and at 2½ feet, 14s. 2∙4d.; hence the minimum is as before at about 2 feet
                    2 inches, and the same will hold under any other increase or decrease, the ratio
                    in rail and block being equal.</p>
                <p>For the second case, when the rail decreases in price in a greater ratio than the
                    block, Table V. shews the corresponding effect, and the minimum will be found
                    again at about 2 feet 2 inches, for at that distance we have 44 lbs. for the
                    weight of the rail per yard, or <hi rend="italic">32∙S67</hi> lbs. for the
                    weight per rail, which at l¼d. per lb. is 40∙334d.; for the block, if <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 25 of a foot, increases the price 5¼d., then ∙2 of a
                    foot will increase it 4∙2d., which added to 84d., the price at 2 feet, gives
                    88∙2d. for 2∙2 feet. Hence the total price of rail and block is 10s. 8½d., or
                    14s. 7 <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> 27d. per yard, which is rather less than at
                    2¼ feet.</p>
                <p>It will be found, in like manner, that the effect of an increase of price in the
                    same ratio will not affect the minimum; for example, with an increase of ⅙th in
                    the price of the rail, and ⅙th in the price of the block, we have at 2 feet the
                    rail 3s. 10∙666d., the block 9s.; total, 12s. 10∙666d., or 19s. 4d. per yard.
                    With 2¼ feet, the rail will be 59'065d., the block ll4∙75d.; total, 14s.
                    5'815d., or per yard, 19s∙ 3¾d. With 2½ feet the rail will be 72 9l5d., the
                    block 121∙5d.; total, 16s. 2½d., or per yard 19s. 5∙299d.; and with 2∙2 feet, we
                    have the rail 56∙466d., the block H3∙376d.; total 14s. l∙842d., or per yard,
                    19s. 3∙6d., or rather less than at 2¼ feet.</p>
                <p>For the case where the rail increases or decreases in a less ratio than the
                    block, Table VI. shews the comparative effect on the minimum, which is here at
                    about 2 feet, with a decrease in the prices; for trying 2∙2 feet, we get for the
                    rail 40∙334d., the block 75∙6d.; total, 115.934d., or per yard, 13s. 2∙09d.; and
                    at 2∙1 feet, we have for the rail 36 <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> 75d., the
                    block, 73∙8d.; total, 1 10∙55d., or per yard 13s. l∙93d.</p>
                <p>When there is an increase of ⅙th in the price of the rail, and ¼th in the price
                    of the block, we have for 2-feet bearings, the rail,46∙66d.,theblock, 120d.;
                    total, 166∙66d.,or per yard, 20s. 10d.; for 2¼ feet, we have, rail, 59'0625d.,
                    block, 127.5d.; total, 186∙5625d., or per yard 20s. 8.75d.; for 2½ feet, the
                    rail is 72∙915d., the block, 135d.; total, 207 <hi rend="superscript">,</hi>
                    9l5d., or per yard, 20s. 9 <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> 498d. Hence the minimum
                    is at 2¼ feet, for at 2∙3 feet the rail is 61∙7165d., the block 129d.; total,
                    !90∙7l68d., and the price per yard, 20s. 8∙76d.; and at 2.2 feet, the rail is
                    56∙4665d∙, the block, 126d.; total, 182∙4665d., and the price per yard, 20s.
                    8∙8ld.</p>
                <p>We have now only left the cases where the price of the rail increases, while that
                    of the block decreases; the effect of this is shewn in Table VII.; and when the
                    price of the rail decreases, while that of the block increases, this is given in
                    Table VIII. In Table VII. the minimum expense is at the distance of 2 feet, and
                    in Table VIII. at 2¾ feet, this being the greatest distance yet obtained; hence
                    cheap rails and very dear blocks are the only conditions which will warrant a
                    distance at all approaching to those now in use; 2¾ feet appearing to be the
                    limits under any ordinary prices, and in general only 2¼, while in some
                    instances 2 feet only should be taken, in order to lay down a railroad at the
                    minimum expense, as far as the cost of the permanent way is concerned.</p>
                <p>In Table VIII. we do not know on which side of 2½ feet the minimum expense will
                    be; we shall therefore, in order to complete the inquiry, investigate this as we
                    have done in the other cases. Taking, then, 2∙6 feet, we get 52 lbs. per yard
                    for the weight, or 45∙065 lbs. per rail, costing at l¼d. per lb. 56∙332d.; for
                    the block we have as ∙25 feet: 7d. =∙1 foot: 2∙8d., or 10s. 8∙8d.; total,
                    185∙132d., or per yard, 17s. 9"ld., being rather more than the price at 2∙5
                    feet. Trying now 2∙4 feet, we have 48 lbs. per yard, or 38∙4 lbs. per rail,
                    costing 48d., and for the block 119d., the price at 2¼ feet plus 4'2d., the
                    proportion for ∙15 feet, or 123∙2d.; total, 171∙2d., or per yard, 17s. 10d.
                    which is more again than at 2∙5 feet; the minimum price will therefore be very
                    near 2∙5 feet, but rather more if any thing.</p>
                <p>It now remains for us to shew, why the particular rate of increase and decrease
                    in the size of the rail and block, which we have given in the tables, has here
                    been assumed. And, first, of the blocks. Every person, «’hen calculating this
                    effect of prices for any particular railway, will of course take into
                    consideration the cost of rails, blocks, and sleepers for the railway in
                    question; and as the rate of increase we have given, viz. one-fourth in the
                    price of the block chair, and all appurtenances complete for each foot increase
                    in the length of the rail, is more than whatis necessary rather than less, and
                    as a decrease in the price of the blocks will lead to shortening the rails still
                    more, it wall be seen that any error will be on the safe side. It will most
                    probably be found in practice, that whatever the distance between the supports
                    may be, the same absolute surface should be preserved in every case; for
                    although it has been said that each block, be its distance what it may, has but
                    to support a certain weight passing over it, yet this is not a correct mode of
                    reasoning, because it has to support that weight for a longer time, when the
                    distance between each <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=41" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0041-0031"
                    />is increased, which is the same thing as having to support <hi
                    rend="superscript">l</hi> Sgreaterweight. Forinstance, with blocks five feet
                    apart, if κe only took them at four square feet each for the intermediate ones,
                    and five square feet for the joints, we should have 183040 square feet,
                    supporting the train for one hour, at a velocity of twenty miles per hour,
                    whilst the same sized blocks at three-feet bearings would afford 281600 square
                    feet to support the train for the same time at the same speed, being a
                    difference in favour of the short bearings of 98560 square feet, or more than
                    one-third. Our increase in the tables is rather less than would be required to
                    preserve the same absolute surface.</p>
                <p>With respect to the increase in the weight of the rails which we have taken, viz.
                    sixty lbs. per yard at three-feet bearings, as a standard, and adding or
                    subtracti ng five lbs. for every three inches of increase or decrease, we can
                    only state that we have taken this from an attentive consideration for some
                    years of the practical effects exhibited by the rails now in use on various
                    lines. A mathematician will say, this is following no known law. It is not, and
                    we firmly believe that to attempt to lay down mathematical laws for the
                    dimensions of rails would be perfectly premature, in the present state of our
                    ignorance on this subject. Before this can be done, a complete and satisfactory
                    set of experiments must be made, to settle the many points now in dispute; and
                    so much depends on the form of the rail, and the quality of the iron, that file
                    weight and dimensions must be left to the judgment of the engineers of the
                    respective lines, who, having their characters for ability at stake, will be
                    influenced in every possible way to take all the necessary steps for coming to a
                    right conclusion, and when in doubt, they will of course resort to experiment,
                    every penny spent in which will in all probability save many pounds.</p>
                <p>To assist in computing similar cases to those which we have above given, we may
                    observe, that each farthing per lb. in the price of iron gives L.2, 6s. 8d. per
                    ton, and each pound per ton gives -428571, &amp;c. of a farthing for the price
                    per lb.; hence, multiplying the number of pounds and de-cimals of a pound in the
                    price per ton by -428571, will give the price per lb. in farthings and
                    decimals.</p>
                <p>In computing the relative strength, &amp;c. of the various rails, the following
                    table will be useful :—∙</p>

                <p>experience is yet so small, that various opinions ex-ist even amongst those best
                    informed, as to the proper form and weight of the rail and chair, and the size
                    of the blocks and sleepers; and there is no doubt that in a few years a material
                    alteration will take place in all these things. Un-til the present time,
                    however, there has been nothing but change both in rails, chairs, and keys, and
                    in the distance between the supports. Every rail should be tested before
                    received from the contractor, and it should be always remembered that too much
                    care cannot be taken with the permanent way materials. All the expense incurred
                    in earth-work and masonry is only a means to an end, viz. the per-manent road.
                    We recommend the fish-bellied rail as possessing, weight for weight, the most
                    strength; and this would be increased by rolling them with a lower w eb. How
                    much depends on the manufacture will be apparent, when it is stated that no less
                    than thirty rails broke on the Liverpool and Manchester railway, in the
                    fortnight ending on the 21st January 1837.</p>
                <p>The question of expense, as far as the present mode is concerned, is a simple
                    problem of maximum and minimum; and it has been so treated in the preceding
                    tables, algebraic formulae having been omitted, to make them more generally
                    useful. But there seems to belittle doubt that with a 60-pound rail on
                    three-feet bearings, and a block one foot thick, containing five cubic feet of
                    stone, the increase we have given for longer bearings will not be considered as
                    too much, when we recollect that the block has not only to support the rail, but
                    has to Sustain it against lateral deflection. When the blocks merely sink, the
                    unusual motion of the engine and the carriages will at once detect it, and the
                    proper remedy must be resorted to; but it might easily happen that the rails
                    would be laterally deflected without its being observed until the train was
                    throw n off altogether, particularly when it is taken into consideration that
                    the caιτiages are still matter of experiment, and that the play of the w heels
                    between the rails and upon the axles is not by any means a fixed quantity, and
                    also that the whole weight of the engine acts laterally, whereas vertically that
                    weight is divided.</p>
                <p>A breadth of from 2 to 2½ inches for the top of the rail, seems admitted by
                    nearly all parties to be sufficient; less would induce considerable wear on the
                    engine and carriage wheels. The wear of rails on the top surface may be taken at
                    one-thirtieth of a pound per yard per annum, and the total loss of weight at
                    one-ninth of a pound per yard per annum; but more accurate experiments are yet
                    required on this head, particularly as to the top surface w ear; and the curious
                    fact is yet unaccounted for, that rails laid on the ground, or keyed into chairs
                    on blocks, but not run over by engines or carriages, oxidize considerably more
                    than those which are used.</p>
                <p>Six feet between each line of rails, seems also generally adopted as a convenient
                    width; but this, of course, depends in some measure on the width between the
                    rails, and the construction of the carriages. Should the plan of placing the
                    wheels outside the carriages be generally adopted, a less width between the
                    lines may suffice, but the distance would not bear to be much decreased. The
                    width of embankments outside the rails should at least equal the width between
                    the rails, so that, when the engines or carriages get off the line, their wheels
                    will be so confined between the rails, that the outer one will not get off the
                    embankment. The mode of action when an accident of this kind happens, appears
                    not to be well understood. We frequently hear of engines being expected to drag
                    their trains off the embankments; but this is a thing unlikely to occur often;
                    for when an engine gets off the rails, it will generally strike so hard against
                    the blocks and sleepers, that its velocity, independently of the shutting off
                    the steam, or reversing the motion, will very quickly be lessened. When this
                    takes place, the train, by its momentum, either forces the engine farther along,
                    or, if it strike it at an angle, which is generally the case, throws it over on
                    its side; and it is from this momentum of the train that the damage proceeds.
                    Intermediate carriages getting off are the cause of much less danger. From the
                    weakness of the present axle-guards, however, these generally break when the
                    wheels strike the blocks or sleepers; and there is a great want of strength in
                    the second and third-class carriages. We have known four of these, fortunately
                    empty, crushed into toothpicks when a collision took place.</p>

                    any required rail given, the size of the rolls may be determined; for their

                    the above equation, which is general for all sizes, by merely noting, that when

                <p>A fish-bellied rail, 50 lbs. to the yard, and with depths of 5 inches maximum and
                    3∙8 inches minimum, compared with a parallel rail of the same weight, and the
                    depth due to that weight, namely, 4∙4 inches, each laid at three feet bearings,
                    and having the thickness of their ribs and the form of their heads exactly
                    similar, will be deflected, as the numbers 1881 for the fish-belly, and 2282 for
                    the equivalent parallel; that is to say, a thickness of iron of about 3-10ths of
                    an inch, must be added to the parallel rail in order to make it equal to the
                    fish-belly. This proposition will nearly shew the gain obtained by the use of
                    fish-bellies for all the usual lengths of bearing, and may be taken at 11 to 9,
                    since, in all cases, it is stiffness which is so essentially required. Mere
                    strength will always be had with the sizes now generally adopted; and it is
                    consequently against deflection which we have to guard, at the same time looking
                    to economy, and not expending immense sums of money unnecessarily, as has been
                    done in purchasing rails much heavier than are required. So much, however,
                    depends on the quality of the iron, that we would strongly recommend every rail
                    to be thoroughly tested when received from the manufacturer, and the results in
                    each case registered. This would soon enable such a valuable collection of facts
                    to be made, as that all hypothesis would cease; whereas, hitherto, there have
                    been such discrepancies between experiments made by persons of the first
                    eminence, that, practically, the subject is involved in as much uncertainty as
                    ever.</p>
                <p>Wooden sleepers, which should be laid on all embankments till they are thoroughly
                    consolidated, ought to be wide and long, and it will not be found too much to
                    give them ten feet in length and one foot in width for a three-feet bearing,
                    having a proportional increase and decrease at any other bearing. The cheapest
                    way will be to buy the sleepers in the round, and have them ripped in two by
                    circular saws of about three feet in diameter, or even more, and withall the
                    teeth broken off except every third or fourth. This will prevent the saw from
                    choaking, and, in a great measure, from heating, which occasions the instrument
                    to buckle, as it is termed. The boring of the blocks should also be done by
                    machinery before they are delivered to the contractor, and a proportional
                    decrease be made in his charge for laying the permanent way; and if the company
                    do not perform this part of the work, the contractor will find it much to his
                    interest to set up a machine for himself, if his contract exceed half a mile in
                    length.</p>
                <p>Various have been the opinions respecting the kind of joint by which the rails
                    are connected, or, more properly speaking, respecting the shape of their ends;
                    but this diversity of opinion ought not to have existed, and has only been a
                    consequence of our want of experience on the subject. It stands to reason, and
                    has been found to be a fact,that butt joints, that is to say, when the ends of
                    the rails are at right angles to their length, will always occasion a shock in
                    passing over them, even if ever so well fitted; and if, as is too generally the
                    case, no regard is had to the temperature in laying the way, wide gaps will be
                    found at each joining, particularly in winter. Half-lap joints are much
                    preferable to butts, and greatly diminish the shock, but are still liable to
                    objection; in the first place, through their weakening the rail; and, in the
                    second, for still giving a very unpleasant jar to the carriages, although in a
                    less degree than the butts. If they are laid right and left, as shewn below, it
                    will improve them for diagonal joints. The form of joint we should recommend is
                    given in fig. 11, in which the arrow shews the direction of the train. The slope
                    of the joint must be placed exactly contrary upon the other line of rails, so
                    that the wheels never meet the pointed end of the rail, but always run off It
                    then needs no other care, than that the point should of the two be the most
                    prominent towards the wheel, and, if it is not so, the joining rail should be
                    taken down a little with a file.</p>
                <p>Treenails should be made of good heart of oak, well seasoned, until thoroughly
                    dry, or of African teak, straightgrained; and each treenail should be
                    cylindrical, one inch and a half in diameter, and six inches in length, having a
                    circular hole, half an inch in diameter, and six inches in length, bored through
                    the centre for the insertion of the iron spike to fix the chair. They are
                    sometimes made by being turned <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=43" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0043-0033"
                    />in a lathe, and are also done by being passed through a cutting knife; but by
                    whatever process they are brought to the required shape, regard should in all
                    cases be had to the grain of the wood, which should in every instance be
                    completely followed. The most usual way of contracting for these is, at so much
                    per thousand, stating the place of delivery; but if a steam-engine be used to
                    make wooden keys, it can also work lathes for the treenails, which, in that
                    case, will be no cost, except for labour, as, in cutting up planks for the
                    wedges, plenty of waste pieces will be found to make the treenails A plan has
                    grown into use on some rai lways, of dropping the treenails loose into the hole
                    of the block, and then driving the spike in and splitting them; but this is not
                    so good as driving them in tight. Oak spikes have formerly been much used, and
                    have been known to last twenty years; we should not, however, recommend them,
                    with the rate of speed that has now been attained.</p>
                <p>The best form of chair is a subject requiring deep consideration, and on which
                    engineers of eminence are by no means decided; we have, therefore, given several
                    drawings of those which are most approved. The leading distinctions are, whether
                    the rails have been keyed in by iron or by wood. The latter method, indeed, is
                    almost indispensable when the rails have lower webs; for, as it would by no
                    means do to have the chair following the shape of the rail, as in that case it
                    must always be detached from the block whenever it is required to take the rail
                    out of it, this consequence ensues, namely, that the opening in the chair must
                    be as large as the lower web of the rail. A chair of this kind, with its wooden
                    key, is shewn in fig. 12.</p>
                <p>In every mode of keying it must always be remembered, that the intention is
                    merely to keep the rail down in the chair, and not to attempt to confine it from
                    longitudinal motion. The right way of making these wedges is an essential thing,
                    and should be done by the company. The original mode was to purchase oak plank,
                    thoroughly seasoned, and of the thickness required. If it be not seasoned in the
                    most complete manner, it will not answer; but this process may be hastened by
                    steaming it in a tank, with a pressure of about 12 lbs. on the square inch. When
                    it is thoroughly seasoned it should be removed into a drying-house, having hot
                    air flues under the floor, made of iron pipes, where all moisture must be
                    extracted; and when thoroughly dry, it is cut into the proper scantling, and
                    into thirteen-inch lengths, each of which when complete is cut into two for
                    joint chairs, or three for intermediate chairs. They are first prepared by
                    joiners to the right shape for going through the cutters; a joiner will prepare
                    about 100 in a day. The cutters are composed of four blocks of iron, fixed one
                    over the other, with openings between each of about one inch, sloping downwards.
                    In the centre of the three lower blocks are steel cutters, the lower one being
                    exactly the shape of the key, and the others above gradually larger. The key is
                    put in at the top, and forced through by a lever about • seventeen feet in
                    length, brought down by a chain and crab winch, with eighty teeth in the wheel
                    and ten in the pinion. Three men will work this, and in ten hours will cut 500
                    pieces, thirteen inches long, to the required shape. The shavings come through
                    the spaces between the iron blocks, and by the gradual cutting, each one taking
                    off a part, the knots in the wood go through without breaking, and the key comes
                    out perfectly smooth.</p>
                <p>The next process is compressing them, which is done by</p>
                <p>VOL. XIX.</p>
                <p>forcing them through an iron block, ten inches thick, with twelve holes in it,
                    3-16ths of an inch smaller than the key at the lower part, and tapering to the
                    top to admit the key. They are forced through by the ram of an hydraulic press,
                    worked by two pumps, one of an inch and-a-half in diameter, the other of one
                    inch, the diameter of the ram being nine inches, and the safety valve loaded to
                    about nine hundred tons. Four men work the large pump, and two the small. They
                    will get through 900 per day. A little rough grease is first rubbed over them.
                    They are then cut into two or three, or more, in the proper proportion,
                    according to the relative number of joints to intermediate chairs, and packed up
                    in bags, care being taken to keep them in a dry place.</p>
                <p>This method of manufacture has been much improved by the erection of an engine on
                    the London and Birmingham railway, by which circular saws, running from 900 to
                    1100 revolutions per minute, rip the plank into scantling, and afterwards
                    cross-cut the thirteen-inch lengths. Two more cutters were adapted on the top of
                    the other four, but gradually larger. These took in the thirteen-inch lengths
                    without their going into the hands of the joiner; and the key was forced through
                    by a plunger working up and down, by a guide and parallel motion on the end of
                    an iron beam. A similar plunger force them through the compressing box; and 1100
                    were completed in ten hours. A part of the power may also be applied to drill
                    the stone blocks for the permanent way. The cost of the whole, with the
                    necessary shops, amounted to aboutL.1500; but the keys may be made for L.8 per
                    thousand, if a cheap pattern be adopted. The circular saws also cut up the waste
                    wood into treenails, which were bored by a lathe adapted to that purpose, the
                    whole being worked by steam. It is found to save the labour of fifteen men. When
                    this sort of chair is used, it will occasion a great saving of time and trouble,
                    if all the chairs are either made by one contractor, or every one gaged before
                    it is received; for if there be the least difference in the size, it requires a
                    different set of cutters, and a different compresssing block for each sort,
                    besides giving a great deal of trouble to the men employed in laying the way.
                    The same remark applies to the rails. The best way is to take plenty of time, by
                    beginning early. Find a respectable man, and let him have the whole job, at a
                    sum varying with the price of iron.</p>
                <p>In iron keys there are many more ways of shaping them. The accompanying drawing
                    (fig. 13.) shews a very good one, where the rail has a web on one side of the
                    bottom only, and the other side of the chair is notched to receive an iron pin.
                    The only objection ever urged against iron pins is, that they are apt to get
                    loose. This might be obviated by splitting the end which enters first, and
                    opening it when driven home. If this be done, the other end should have a head,
                    so that a clawed crowbar could be applied in order to draw it out.</p>
                <p>The annexed drawing (fig. 14.) shews another good form, invented by Mr. Robert
                    Stephenson, where the rail is confined by two bolts having angular ends, which
                    enter a small score in the rail, and are keyed home by iron keys with split
                    ends; the key hole in the chair, and that in the bolts, being so proportioned,
                    that the effect of keying up is to press the end of the bolt against the rail.
                    In these chairs there is a moveable piece of iron, the bottom of which is
                    circular, and the top flat, laid in a properly-formed receptacle in the bottom
                    of the chair; and on this the rails rest, so as to give perfect ease to any
                    motion produced by flexure.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=44"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0044-0034"/>
                <p>Mr. Buck’s chairs (fig. 15.) are well spoken of. The wedge is driven against the
                    rail by a vertical key. The accompanying drawing (fig. 16.) shews another good
                    form, in which an iron ball takes against the rail, and is keyed close up to it
                    by a longitudinal key. The joint chair is laid down, not at right angles with
                    the rails, but diagonally, and is cast with a split end, rather smaller than the
                    rail. It has therefore to be chipped to get the rail in.</p>
                <p>There is however a great loss on all these chairs, through their being made of
                    cast iron. This occasions numbers to be broken in fixing and keying. To prevent
                    this, wrought iron chairs may be made, by rolling the iron into the required
                    form in lengths, and then cutting up the lengths into chairs by shears; after
                    which they may be drilled and completed.</p>
                <p>A chair upon a universal joint has been patented, so as to allow the rail to
                    accommodate itself to the sinking of the block; but it has not been adopted on
                    any railway that we are aware of. The inquiries necessary under these and other
                    heads, as the works increase in their number and magnitude, will be best met by
                    the directors dividing themselves into sub-committees under the various
                    necessary branches, which is always advantageous, as long as there is one
                    managing head to bring all the parts to bear upon a common focus.</p>
                <p>Points and crossings are things which require considerable attention; and great
                    care should be taken that they are laid down on a plan which combines simplicity
                    with safety. Where one line intersects another, and the crossing is a fixture,
                    or as it is called, a through-crossing, no more will be necessary than to bolt
                    the sleepers well together, and pay rigid attention to the adjustment of the
                    rails; but where it is requisite to have the power of going either on one line
                    or the other, as at a siding, the matter becomes more difficult, and the mode of
                    doing so may be considered as far from settled, opinions being still very
                    various.</p>
                <p>The oldest form is the common switch, where, upon one side of the line of rails,
                    is a bar, moveable on a hinge, capable of being laid into either the main line,
                    or the line of sidings. (Fig. 17.) Abreast of this is a fixed check rail, the
                    main rail being bent, and having a nick in it (a) for allowing the flange to
                    pass when the carriage is not to shift its line. The left hand half of the
                    figure exhibits the same thing for the opposite line of rails. A check rail must
                    also be placed at each point, so as to ensure the train going upon the required
                    line when the switch is placed in the proper position. The switch is generally
                    moved by a horizontal bar or rod of iron connected with it, which is drawn in
                    and out the required distance by an eccentric, at the opposite end to that which
                    is connected with the switch. This eccentric is attached to a vertical rod,
                    coming up about three feet inside an iron standard, and it is turned at the top
                    by means of a lever key which can be taken off at pleasure, and which no person
                    should be allowed to touch except the switchman. This form, although the oldest,
                    is a very good one, and is very easily understood and managed. There is,
                    however, a very cheap and good plan of moving them, instead of an eccentric.
                    This is a vertical lever, which draws them backwards and forwards, the handle
                    springing against an arc with notches to receive it in each position. This might
                    be placed inside the switchman’s sentry-box, where it could be locked up if he
                    was unavoidably absent, and no one could touch it.</p>
                <p>Another form, also much approved of, is what is called the check-rail, to
                    distinguish it from the former, which is called the switch-rail. In the
                    check-rail there is a move-able bar to both sides of the line of rails. These
                    are moved simultaneously, by the eccentric being connected to each of them by a
                    cross bolt. The action of the check-rail and the switch-rail has this
                    difference, that it takes place on different sides of the flange, the check-rail
                    acting on the outside of the flange, and the switch-rail on the inside. The
                    check-rail is not so good as the switch, nor is it so easily understood.

                    fig. 2 the elevation, fig. 3 the elevation of the eccentric, fig. 4 the point,
                    and fig. 5 the general arrangement.</p>
                <p>Another form which has been much adopted, is Curtis’s slide rail. This has a
                    double bar upon each side of the line of rails, is moved by an eccentric like
                    the others, and is very effective, but expensive. In fact, they all answer the
                    purpose, but the slide rails require signals, which we shall hereafter describe.
                    But this is not the case with the others. Opinion seems now coming back to the
                    old switch rail, modified by making the switch part of it considerably longer,
                    and having it kept in the right position for the main line, by a weight or
                    spring, so that when the train is to go on the siding, the switchman has to hold
                    the switch all the time the train is passing. This is objectionable. But the
                    construction has an advantage which overbalances any thing which can be said
                    against it; namely, that it will be opened by the wheel of the engine, if
                    purposely put wrong, so that the train can by no possibility get off the line of
                    rails, unless it is actually wedged immoveably in the improper position. This is
                    susceptible of further improvement. As it stands, it is the subject of a patent,
                    but we question whether it could be sustained.</p>
                <p>We have seen a very cheap, simple, and effective switch on the Great Western
                    Railway, adapted for peculiar situations, where fixed crossings would be
                    disadvantageous. This consists of a switch moveable at the middle by a pivot,
                    instead of at the end. This connects two lines in either direction, but is not
                    to transfer trains from one to the other. Whichever plan may be adopted, we
                    should recommend one set to be made rigidly accurate, and then that templates
                    should be formed from these as a guide for all the others. No method but this
                    will ensure the correctness of the whole; and crossings being always dangerous,
                    they should never be used if it can be helped, except on a station.</p>

                <p>There is still a difference of opinion amongst engineers whether the rail should
                    be inclined or not. The gain and loss may be thus stated. The advantages consist
                    principally in preventing so much wear both on the tire of the wheel and the
                    rail, but chiefly the former, for when the rail is upright, the wheel,
                    theoretically speaking, is only in contact with it on a line having hardly any
                    breadth This is found to wear away the wheel very fast, and the rail likewise
                    suffers a loss on the side where the contact takes place; besides which, the
                    wear approximates the tire of tile wheel more and more to the shape of a
                    cylinder instead of a cone; and the rail also partially adapts itself to this
                    action, in each case, through the abrasion of tile working lines. In addition to
                    the increase in repairs, through these causes, the wear is to a certain extent
                    unequal, and an irregularity is produced which consequently leads to an
                    unsatisfactory performance between the engine and the rails. But this is avoided
                    by inclining the rail so that it receives the wheel on nearly the whole of its
                    bearing surface; and 3-8ths of an inch in 11 inches is the inclination of the
                    blocks on the London and Birmingham railway.</p>
                <p>The disadvantage consists mainly in this, that if the wheels do bear on the whole
                    of the surface, say two inches, there must be a constant rubbing action going
                    on, arising from tile unequal velocities with which the outer and inner tire of
                    coned wheels revolve, and this will of course be equivalent to dragging the
                    whole train for a certain distance with every one of the wheels locked. Let us
                    see what this dragging will amount to.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the greater diameter of the coned wheel, and <hi
                    rend="italic">d'</hi> its lesser, each in inches; taking the bearing surface at
                    two inches, and supposing that in this breadth the two diameters differ half an
                    inch, both which suppositions are in excess, we then have</p>
                <p>3,141593, or (&lt;/_ <hi rend="italic">&lt;f <hi rend="superscript">,</hi>
                    ).</hi> 1,570796</p>
                <p>4M</p>
                <p>for the rubbing at a mean in each revolution of the wheel, and the length of this
                    revolution will be</p>
                <p>⅛≤. 3,141593, or (d+tf). 1,570796.</p>
                <p>If we take rf=60¼ inches, and &lt;Z=59¾ inches we get <hi rend="italic">(d—d')
                    .</hi> 1∙570796=,5 . 1∙570796=∙785398 inches, which is the quantity of dragging
                    for each revolution, the length of which will be (rf+d <hi rend="superscript">
                    ,</hi> ). 1∙570796 = 120.1∙570796 = 188∙49552 inches, we then have this
                    proportion,</p>
                <p>Yards. Inches. YaMs. Inches.</p>
                <p>5,235986: 785398 = 1760: 264 Hence, the dragging of the whole train will be 264
                    inches per mile, or 733 yards in 100 miles for each wheel. This, at first
                    sight,appears considerable, but in practice it will be much less. The data have
                    been taken large to shew the limit of this action, and the whole bearing surface
                    is not practically in contact with the tire of the wheel, arising from the
                    various imperfections inseparable from the manufacture of both wheels and rails,
                    particularly the latter, although it must be allowed that the better they are
                    made, the more dragging will take place; and likewise the more the surfaces come
                    into contact, the greater will be the effect of shocks from bad joints and other
                    imperfections. Still our opinion tends to inclining the rail.</p>
                <p>It appears absolutely necessary in railroad engines and carriages, that the
                    wheels should be keyed to the axles, the wheel and axles both turning round
                    together; several attempts have been tried to introduce fixed axles, but
                    although the greatest care has been taken in the manufacture, both in boring the
                    hole in the nave, and turning the axle, yet a lateral shaking has always been
                    found to take place, throwing the carriages off the rail on very moderate
                    curves.</p>
                <p>The quantity of inclination which the cone of the wheels should have, will,
                    strictly speaking, depend on the radius of the curve. But, as half an inch on 3½
                    in width, or l-7th of the width is found to be practically advantageous, in
                    keeping the flanges of the wheels from rubbing against the rails in straight
                    lines; and, as by raising the outer rail, the effect of gravity may at any given
                    velocity be made to neutralize the centrifugal force, that inclination of the
                    tire of the wheel may be adopted, except in very extraordinary cases. With this
                    slope, and a wheel of three feet in diameter running on a line of rails 4 feet
                    8½ inches in width, with a play of one inch, Mr. Pambour gives the following

                <p>To enable this calculation to be made for any other inclination, or suitable
                    curves to be made where the inclination is determined, we shall explain the
                    method of investigating the subject.</p>
                <p>The resistance on curves is of two kinds, one from the carriage having to turn on
                    the rail without any corresponding play on the axle, thus producing a dragging
                    of the wheel, which takes place on that which is going over the inner part of
                    the curve; and, secondly, that which arises from the centrifugal force, and
                    which causes a friction to take place between the flange of the wheel and the
                    rail. To correct these, the inclination of the coned wheel, the radius of the
                    curve, the velocity and the elevation of one side of the line of rails, must
                    have definite relations, and the wheels must have sufficient play between the
                    two rails to admit the centrifugal force without being able to induce the second
                    resistance, yet under given conditions to correct the first.</p>
                <p>To arrive at this result, whilst the outside wheel of the carriage describes the
                    arc <hi rend="italic">mm,</hi> (fig. 22.) the inside one must describe the arc
                    <hi rend="italic">nn’</hi> terminating at the same radius; the working
                    circumference of the wheels must therefore be represented by these arcs, and
                    putting</p>
                <p>D=diameter of the outside wheel,</p>
                <p>D'=diameter of the inside wheel, w=the ratio of the circumference to the

                    />We have here supposed <hi rend="italic">a —1,</hi> or the inclination of the
                    tire of the wheel to = y; but it is evident this must be such, that no rubbing
                    of the flange will be produced on any curve on the line. We obtain this from the
                    equation</p>
                <p>βeD</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript">μ</hi> ~ 2(r—e)'</p>
                <p>We first establish the play between the rails. Allow this to be two inches, or
                    that the flanges of the wheels in their regular position are 1 inch from the
                    rails; then <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> must never be quite equal to 1 inch, and if
                    we give to <hi rend="italic">r</hi> in the last equation above, its numerical
                    value for the worst curve on the line, and to <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> its
                    limit, a small quantity less than half the play of the wheels, we obtain the
                    value of <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> which we must use on that line, as
                    follows:</p>
                <p>_2 <hi rend="subscript">M</hi> (r + e) <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="superscript">
                    α</hi> ~ eO '</hi></p>
                <p>For instance, with half the play = 1 inch, or ∙0833 feet and μ=0∙9 inches, or,
                    075 feet, we havea=; <hi rend="superscript">=</hi> 10 <hi rend="superscript"

                <p>or the inclination of the cone = =, of a foot; observ-</p>
                <p>10∙67</p>
                <p>ing that if we have only one or two bad curves, we must examine whether we may
                    not admit a little rubbing on them for a corresponding gain on the good ones.
                    This investigation will shew how necessary it is that the play of the axles on
                    the carriages should be as small ns can possibly be, or the effect of the coned
                    wheels will be completely deranged. This is a matter which is much too little
                    attended to in practice.</p>
                <p>There is nothing in a railway which demands such serious attention as the
                    stations, both as to their numbers, position, and the mode of constructing them.
                    The number and situation will of course be mainly determined by the nature and
                    extentof the surrounding population; and the first step should be to get a good
                    map of all the places within the sphere of the railway, and to mark upon it the
                    population of each place from the last parliamentary census; bearing in mind,
                    that taking, for the present, railway-travelling to be twice as fast at half the
                    cost of coach travelling, that a very wide portion of country will receive the
                    benefit of a long line. We have explained this before; but that it may be
                    perfectly understood, we shall shortly advert to it in a different shape.</p>
                <p>For instance, suppose a line 100 miles long, and a person 50 miles at right
                    angles to one end of it, who wants to go to the other end. If he travelled in a
                    stage-coach along the hypothenuse of the triangle, he would go about 112 miles,
                    say at 4d. per mile, his total cost would be L.l, 17s. 4d., and his time
                    expended about 11¼ hours. On the contrary, if he came first to the terminus of
                    the railway nearest him, and then went along the railway to the other terminus,
                    he would have first 50 miles in a stage-coach at 4d., or 16s. 8d., with an
                    expenditure of time equal to 5 hours, and then 100 miles by the railway at 2d.,
                    or 16s. 8d. more in 5 hours, the total time being 10 hours, and the total
                    expense L.l, 13s. 4d., consequently he would save 4s. in money, and l¼ hours in
                    time, by taking the longest road.</p>
                <p>There is no doubt but that the greater the number of stations, the more the
                    travelling will increase; for it has always been hitherto found that the quick
                    and cheap transit by a railway has not only increased the already existing
                    traffic, but has actually created it where no traces could be found of it
                    before. The nature of the produce, and the state of trade should also be taken
                    into account in determining both the number and the situation of the
                    stations.</p>
                <p>The minor stations along the line may be divided into two classes. The first
                    might consist of merely one room, serving for office and waiting-room, where
                    nothingbutpassengersand small parcels are sent either upor down. Such stations
                    would do for small villages or points where only a limited traffic is' expected.
                    We do not, however, recommend these, although they are used on several railways.
                    All passengers pay alike, and they are therefore entitled to the same
                    accommodation. The other class should be a house containing an office,
                    waiting-room in common, or which is better, one for each class of passengers,
                    ladies’ waiting-room, and two rooms for the inspector of police to reside in, a
                    small office for the police, and a porter’s room. To this would have to be
                    added, if water was required to be pumped, a steam-engine, and the requisite
                    room for the engineer, a locomotive engine-house when necessary, and a covered
                    space for holding spare carriages, trucks, horse-boxes, &amp;c., together with
                    the requisite sheds, and an office for the goods department.</p>
                <p>The entrance to the station should be protected from the weather, so that when
                    carriages drive up, the passengers can alight under shelter, and there should be
                    a platform next the railway, about the same height as the carriage floors, so
                    that the passengers can walk into the railway-carriages without having to climb
                    up the steps. Arrangements should be made, for the passengers who are going into
                    the carriages to go all in upon one side, and those going out should get out
                    from the other side; for which purpose the entrance should be on one side of the
                    railway, and the exit on the other side. A light roof should be thrown over both
                    lines of rails and their stages; in fact, the passengers should be entirely
                    under cover from the time of leaving the vehicles which bring them to the
                    station, till the time the train takes them away. This occasions very little
                    expense, and is a great addition both to health and to comfort.</p>
                <p>For such a station two clerks would be required, one for passengers, parcels, and
                    private carriages, the other for goods. The mode of conducting the business we
                    shall advert to in its proper place. An inspector, and about four policemen,
                    with porters, according to the extent of the traffic, would probably be
                    sufficient; the whole should be well lighted up with gas, if it can be
                    conveniently got; and it would much conduce to the comfort of the passengers,
                    particularly ladies, if a decent female attended in the waiting-room, and had
                    for sale pastry, biscuits, or sandwiches, with lemonade and ginger beer.</p>
                <p>Great care should be taken at each out-station, that the following things can all
                    be simultaneously performed, viz. First, that the train can be setting down
                    passengers on the one side who are going to remain; secondly, taking up
                    passengers on the other side who are going on, and this on both lines; thirdly,
                    that the engine can be taking in coke and water, and also raking her fire, for
                    which purpose, a small coke store should be built close to the water crane, and
                    an ash pit properly excavated in the requisite position; and, lastly, that
                    horses and private carriages can be in a situation to enable them to be attached
                    to and detached from the train, at the same time as the other things enumerated
                    above are being done. It will also be requisite, that the same care be taken at
                    the goods’ station, but goods’ waggons should also be able to be attached to and
                    detached from passengers’ trains, as they will often be useful, when the traffic
                    in passengers runs a good deal one way, in completing the load of the engine,
                    and economising the outlay in locomotive power.</p>
                <p>To explain how this is to be done, let us suppose a line of railway running north
                    and south, and that the east line of rails is that by which the trains arrive
                    when going from north to south, and the west line of rails is that by which they
                    arrive when going from south to north. For the east line of rails, the water
                    crane should be so far to the south of the station, that with an average number
                    of carriages in the train, when the tender is under the crane, the middle of the
                    train is opposite the station house. The position of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=48" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0048-0038"
                    />the crane fixes that of the ash pit and coke store. The ’passengers alighting
                    get down from the west side of the carriages, and go out from the west side of
                    the railway. The passengers who are getting up, do so on the east side of the
                    carriages, and come to the carriages from the east side of the railway.</p>
                <p>The horses and carriages which are to leave the train, must, of course, be at the
                    end of it. These, when detached, are to be run back, or to the northward, where
                    a tumplate should be fixed to take them up by the cross line, to the spot where
                    they are to be landed. This spot, which should be a third line of rails farther
                    east, should be so far to the northward of the station house, that a siding can
                    be run from the third or extra line of rails into the main east line, so as to
                    be clear of the end of the train; and on this Siding should be the embarked
                    carriages which are to join the train. On the west side of the railway, there
                    should be another additional line of rails, with a cross line from it to the
                    place where the carriages are embarked. Along this line the goods may be
                    brought. It will be readily seen that all the required objects will be effected
                    by this arrangement.</p>
                <p>For the western line, the water crane should be sufficiently to the north of the
                    station, to allow the centre of an average train to be opposite the
                    station-house, when the tender is under the crane. The ash-pit and coke-store
                    are, as in the previous case, regulated by the position of the crane. The
                    passengers who are leaving the train, get out on the eastern side of the
                    carriages, and leave the railway also on the eastern side. The passengers who
                    are to join the train are waiting on the western side, and get into the
                    carriages on that side. The horses and carriages which are to leave the train,
                    are run back to the southward, past the siding from the west additional line by
                    which those come on which are joining it, and are brought back to that siding,
                    when clear of the carriages joining the train. By the siding they get on to the
                    west additional line, and going to the northward, are taken across as soon as
                    the train has left, and are disembarked at the proper spot.</p>
                <p>Goods joining or leaving the train arc managed exactly in the same way. Those
                    which are to leave it being run back on the main line, till past the Siding by
                    which those come into the main line which are to join the train; and when these
                    are clear, those which left the train are to be brought to the siding, and run
                    into the goods’ station. Proper waiting rooms for the passengers should, of
                    course, be provided on each side of the railway, and their exit and entrance
                    will be by stairs, either up or down, as the station is situated on an
                    embarkment or in a cutting. A foot-bridge may sometimes be thrown across with
                    advantage.</p>
                <p>There is such a decided convenience in having all stations on a level, that we
                    should strongly recommend them to be placed so wherever it is at all
                    practicable, even if there is some little sacrificed in another point of view;
                    but this is a matter which will, in general, be so completely governed by the
                    localities, that it may not be possible, in many cases, to attain it. When this
                    happens, however, great care must be taken to make the approaches wide, and of a
                    gentle slope.</p>
                <p>As the works proceed towards completion, so many causes will arise to engage the
                    engineers and directors, even without the occurrence of any particularly great
                    accidents, that on all the leading questions time should be taken by the
                    forelock. Springs of water, rock, and quicksands, will be met with where least
                    expected perhaps, and the constant exertion of every talent will be required
                    towards the close of the works. Good drainage will be most wanted when least at
                    command; and work done with wet materials will be always slipping. Many times
                    have embankments made of wet clayey earth slipped at all kinds of slopes; and
                    although hundreds of cubic yards of dry material have been tipped on to them,
                    they have been swallowed up and totally dis appeared, whilst, at last, the only
                    remedy to be found was weighting the slip itself with a sufficient quantity of
                    earth to enable it to bear the embankment above.</p>
                <p>When rock occurs at any height up the sides of an excavation, advantage may
                    sometimes be taken of it to decrease the expense, by cutting only a sufficient
                    width for the railway, and having no slope to the earth below the rock, but
                    building up retaining walls from the railway below when bottomed out to the rock
                    above, or what is called undersetting, an example of which may be seen at the
                    great Blisworth cutting on the London and Birmingham railway. (See Plate
                    CCCCXXVI. figs. 2, 3, 4.)</p>
                <p>It will often happen that many parts of the permanent way are laid prior to its
                    being possible to open either end of the line for traffic. These had better be
                    kept in repair by the contractor; but when the line is once opened, or any part
                    of it, for the purpose of travelling, it will be much the best way for the
                    company themselves to keep it in order, taking especial care that the contractor
                    repays them a proper price for so doing. The consequences of any accident by the
                    engine or carriages getting thrown off the rails are so frightful, that no
                    attention and expense can be thought too great which can prevent such an
                    occurrence. We have seen instances in which carriages have undergone so complete
                    a smash, that not a square foot of plank could be picked up anywhere.</p>
                <p>A set of plate-layers consists of nine men for tumplates; twelve for laying
                    rails; five for repairing the way; and six for laying in points and
                    crossings.</p>
                <p>To each set, the following tools will be required :—</p>
                <p>2 chissel-ended crowbars for drawing spikes.</p>
                <p>1 point-ended crowbar for moving rails, the point being put in the ground.</p>
                <p>1 claw-ended crowbar.</p>
                <p>1 cuddy or three-legged stand for the levers, so called from the name of the
                    inventor. (Fig. 19·)</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=49"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0049-0039"/>
                <p>2 swivel or cramp crowbars, similar to a tooth-drawer, for drawing spikes without
                    heads, 4 pick axes, 2 files to file the joints, 2 shifting wrenches for screwing
                    up seats, 1 turn-plate to trim the sleepers to, 12 block drills, 4 hammers to
                    ditto, 4 keying hammers, 2 chipping hammers, 1 sledge hammer, 4 cast-steel
                    chisels for cutting joints, 12 f-inch augurs,</p>
                <p>1 handsaw, 1 axe, 1 hand-drill for drilling turnplates, 4 sets of chisels with
                    wood-rods for handles, similar to blacksmiths’.</p>
                <p>The foregoing tools will enable them to fit in points and crossings, switches or
                    turnplates, as well as to lay the line. Of course when there are sets of
                    plate-layers wholly working at blocks, and other sets wholly working at
                    sleepers, the tools which do not relate to the work they are engaged in, may be
                    kept back. The above list has reference to chairs having wooden keys; for any
                    other kind of chair, if necessary, an adequate alteration must be made. One
                    standard guage should be kept in the engineer’s office for the width of the
                    rails, and another for the width between the lines, and all others constructed
                    from it; and they ought to be made of iron.</p>
                <p>The engine-man should always stand by his hand-gear whilst the engine is running,
                    and keep a most vigilant look out before him, passing all out-stations or
                    stopping places slowly, and upon discovering any train at a stand still, he
                    should approach and pass it at no greater speed than three miles an hour. Should
                    any train require the assistance of a ballast-engine, it should be immediately
                    given on an application to that effect from the upper guard, the engine-man
                    first placing his waggons on a siding; but the ballast-engine should not draw
                    the train any farther than is necessary to place it under the charge of a
                    regular passenger or goods’ engine; and it should then return to its waggons in
                    such a manner as not to interfere with the next train coming along the line.
                    Every ballast-engine should be provided with proper spanners, and other
                    requisite tools, for the safe custody of which the engine-man should be
                    responsible. During a fog the engine should be moved slowly, and the whistle be
                    blown at not greater intervals than a quarter of a mile. Fogs, however, will
                    always be dangerous on railways till two whistles totally different in sound are
                    used, one for each line, blowing by machinery at every eighth part of a mile.
                    When the ballast-engines stop in a fog on the line, the fireman should be sent
                    at least 400 yards a-head to look out.</p>
                <p>It is the duty of the engine-men to take care that the engines are in a proper
                    state of cleanliness and efficiency before they quit the engine-house, that
                    every part is in proper and complete working order, and that the regular supply
                    of coke and water is in both the engine and the tender, together with the
                    requisite quantity of oil and waste; and he should personally inspect his
                    tool-box, and ascertain that every thing is in it which by rights should be so,
                    and that his shovels, rakes, &amp;c. are in readiness. He should carefully
                    examine all his oil cups and syphon wicks, his water guage, and every other part
                    of the engine, and when he sets her a-going, try his pumps on both sides, and
                    also his hand-gear. According to the distance the engine-house is from the point
                    where he hooks on the train, time must be allowed him before the minute of
                    departure sufficient to let him arrive at the required spot about one minute
                    before he is wanted, and no more.</p>
                <p>He should be very careful in bringing his engine down to the head of the train,
                    where the connection should be made by a man specially appointed for the
                    purpose. He should leave his condensed steam cock open as long as he can, being
                    very cautious that it is shut just before the time of departure. During the
                    journey he, in conjunction with his fireman, should keep a vigilant look-out for
                    all signals of danger, watching each policeman as he approaches him till he has
                    made his notification that all is in security along his part of the line. He
                    must be attentive to stopping the train at the places ordered, and that he does
                    not exceed the regulated speed, considering correctness of arrival his greatest
                    aim, and consequently making up as far as he can in one part of his journey for
                    any unavoidable detentions which may have arisen in other parts.</p>
                <p>He should be very attentive to his water-guage, and test it, whenever he thinks
                    it necessary, by his guage-cock. This, however, should be done as little as
                    possible if he have confidence in the water-gauge. He should never use his pumps
                    without turning his pet-cocks, and ascertaining by them that every thing is
                    working properly for the injection of the water; particularly when one pump has
                    got out of order, that if any thing should happen to the other he may instantly
                    stop the engine and examine both of them, the necessary tools for which should
                    be in his tool-box. He should always when practicable take the opportunity of
                    pumping in water when going down inclinations, or at other favourable times. He
                    should attend well to his rakings, and should be careful not to put on too much
                    coke at once, unless he is very strong in steam; he should be constantly alert
                    to the signals from the guard of the train, and ready to stop it in the shortest
                    possible time when ordered to do so. The guard should have a check-string to the
                    arm of the engine-man, and a flexible hollow tube should be fixed from the
                    guard’s carriage to the engine, through which the men can converse, which the
                    noise of the engine and train will otherwise render difficult.</p>
                <p>After completing his journey, and placing his engine near the engine house over
                    the ash pit, he should see the fire carefully raked out, and if his engine
                    requires blowing off, he should take it to the projιer place for doing so, and
                    then apply for the necessary assistance toplace it afterwards in the
                    engine-house. But if it should not require to be blown off, he must of course
                    proceed to the engine-house as soon as his fire is out, and having placed his
                    engine in security, he should make his report to the foreman of all
                    circumstances relative to the journey, and of any defects in the line, or in the
                    engine, that he may have noticed, and the correct cause of all detentions which
                    may have taken place. The engine should be examined and cleaned by proper
                    persons appointed for that purpose; but this should not supersede the necessity
                    of the engine-man personally investigating, before he starts on a journey, that
                    every thing is in correct order. A great deal of expense in cleaning engines, as
                    well as in their wear, would be saved by using a tarpaulin covering down each
                    side from the boiler, to protect the machinery from rain. The engine-man should
                    also have a fencing from the wet over the place where he stands.</p>
                <p>The resident engineer who takes charge of the line when opened, should draw every
                    thing by requisition from the storekeeper. The overseer should, in the first
                    place, make out his weekly pay-bill, which should be checked by the time-book of
                    the respective timekeepers; and when signed by the engineer, it should be
                    forwarded to the audit-office, and the pay sent down to the booking-clerks of
                    the adjacent stations, who should pay the men in the presence of the overseer,
                    each man signing his name to attest the reception of the money. The necessary
                    clerks and draftsmen for this part of the engineering department should also be
                    paid weekly in the same way.</p>
                <p>We have never yet seen a good mile mark on a railway, Mile marks.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=50"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0050-0040"/>
                <p>the object apparently being merely to comply with the act of Parliament,
                    certainly not to let the passengers see the miles, for the marks are generally
                    so short, that all persons in the middle seats of the carriages have no chance
                    whatever of seeing them. What we should recommend would be light iron posts
                    having a box on the top. The box may be made triangular in its ground-plan,
                    (Plate CCCCXXV. fig. 5,) and be about one foot in height, the apex of the most
                    obtuse angle facing the railway. This angle should be so obtuse as merely to
                    allow room in the box to hang a small lamp, and the two sides which form this
                    angle being made of glass, should be painted or ground, except the figures,
                    which are left clear. These shew the miles by day, and the nearest policeman
                    lighting the lamp, they are also shewn at night. Or the planes forming the sides
                    of the triangle next the railway may be of sheet iron, with the figures cut out
                    of it, and merely that portion covered with glass; in either case the head must
                    have a lid moving on a hinge. The height of these should be just half way up the
                    carriage windows. In the cuttings, the post should be very short, and the mile
                    mark set back on the slope. On the embankments it will be proportionally longer.
                    It may have holes, or other ornaments, cast in its base, serving for steps to
                    get up to light the lamp; or this may be done with projecting rings, and a slide
                    may be made to receive coloured glass as a signal of any accident.</p>
                <p>When such mile marks as these are not adopted, and it is desired to know the
                    velocity of a train at night, this may be readily done whenever the blast pipe
                    of the engine sounds sufficiently loud to be heard, which is generally the case
                    in most engines. The way to ascertain the speed at which the train is going,
                    will be to count every fourth puff from the blast pipe in ten seconds, this
                    giving one revolution of the driving wheels, and the speed will be had by the
                    following table:</p>

                <p>The rapidity with which the cylinders of steam are expelled through the blast
                    pipe, would at any common velocity prevent every puff being counted; but a very
                    little practice will render the counting of every’ fourth one exceedingly easy,
                    and the rate of going may always be found to the nearest half mile, by those who
                    have only tried this method three or four times. A still easier method, although
                    it will not generally be quite so accurate, is as follows: For five-feet wheels,
                    count the number of fourth puffs in ten seconds and three quarters, and these
                    will be the number of miles per hour the engine is going; and for five feet six
                    wheels, count the number of fourth puffs in eleven seconds and three quarters.
                    The exact number of seconds is 10∙7 and 11∙78. The method by the tables however
                    is the best.</p>
                <p>Paved crossings on a level with the railway are things to be avoided by all means
                    whenever it is practicable to do so; but as some cases will arise where they
                    cannot be done away with, we must render them as little liable to danger as
                    possible. We have given drawings of these, (figs. 29, 30, and 31,) and an
                    approved form of chair (fig. 28), which holds the rail, and also the two
                    protecting irons, which should be laid next to the rails, in order that the
                    wheels of those vehicles which cross the railway may not impinge upon the rails
                    and injure them any more than can be helped. The whole crossing should be well
                    paved with the usual road stones, and there must be strong gates on each side.
                    These gates must be constructed so that when shut they may close up the road on
                    either hand, and when open, may form a barrier across the railway.</p>
                <p>The subject of lamps forms one to which attention is required, and we should
                    recommend all railways to make a red light at night and a red flag by day, the
                    symbols of danger. A green light should be placed at each station at the spot
                    where the engine-man should slacken his speed, and a red light at the point
                    where he is to stop. The police should have hand lanthoms, with a white glass
                    and a red one, which latter can be turned round in an instant, whenever any
                    thing obstructs the passage of the railway; and the light held up at any train
                    approaching, on seeing which the train is immediately to stop. A green glass may
                    also be added, the signification of which would be, proceed with caution; the
                    train should then come slowly on and ascertain the reason for the signal.</p>
                <p>For lighting the insides of the carriages, the roof lamps, contrived by the
                    writer of this article, and patented, are the best. The frame is circular, about
                    six inches in diameter, and about nine inches in height; the bottom is formed of
                    a ground glass saucer, which is let through the roof of the coach, the top being
                    protected by a box; on the inside is a small fountain lamp, on an improved
                    principle, which is very nearly shadowless; the whole of the lamp body being
                    above the frame, and the connection between them consisting of a tube¼ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> l</hi><hi rend="subscript">δ</hi> ths of an inch in
                    thickness, which tube should always be turned towards the carriage door. These
                    give a soft mellow light, by which the passengers may easily read.</p>
                <p>Point signals should be made in the following manner.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=51"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0051-0041"/>
                <p>The sliding rail, which forms the communication from one line of rails to the
                    other, and which is moved by an eccentric, turned by a lever handle, should
                    have, on the other side of the line, an iron rod from the rail, going into a box
                    at its end with a pinion on it. This pinioned end of the rod turns a rack when
                    the sliding rail is moved, which rack is contained in the box, and is fixed to a
                    vertical rod, moveable in an upright post, similar to a lamp post, through the
                    top of which, about four feet in height, the upper end of the rod comes out for
                    about six inches, and is in this part made square. On this square part there is
                    put a lamp by night, to shew a white light when the points are right, and a red
                    one when they are wrong; so that whenever the sliding rail is moved, it of
                    necessity turns the light round, and cannot fail to place the different colours
                    in front of the line of rails to which the signal is meant to apply.</p>
                <p>In the day time the lamp is removed from the square, which, however, is not
                    necessary, and the same signal is made visible by two circular hoops covered
                    with canvass, one being painted red and the other white, and one being fixed on
                    the top of the other at right angles to it; or the hoops may be one inside the
                    other, at the same height and at right angles, nothing more being necessary than
                    that the signal should be such that when combined in this way, the sliding rail
                    can never move without the signal also moving, which should shew white when the
                    points are right, and red when they are wrong. These things, however, will never
                    be properly correct till the engine itself is made to turn the points, which has
                    often been tried, and is considered as having tailed, but may certainly be done
                    with ease and effect.</p>
                <p>Self-acting alarms, with gong-shaped bells standing upright and fixed about
                    twelve feet high to a wall, should be supplied to each station, and they should
                    be wound up by men stationed at them, who may also act as policemen. These
                    alarms are for the purpose of giving notice to the station-people of the arrival
                    of a train. Two minutes are sufficient time in ordinary cases, and, with active
                    men, one would suffice, and proper regulations must be established to ensure
                    this space of time. On the train arriving at the proper spot, the man stationed
                    at the alarm pulls a trigger, which allows a weight to descend. This turns a
                    wheel, and this wheel works a pinion, to which is attached an eccentric, which
                    gives motion to the clapper from side to side, and the alarm is struck by the
                    hammer in the usual way, the man stationed at it being at liberty to attend to
                    any other business the instant he has pulled the string. A large station-bell is
                    also useful to summon all the persons to their posts at unusual times, in order
                    to receive any unexpected trains, and for many other reasons. A bell should also
                    run from the station office at the out-stations, to summon one or more porters
                    inside the office.</p>
                <p>A good means of preventing accidents would be, to have the engine-man in the
                    front of the engine. If any thingcould ensure care, this would, the generality
                    of engine-men being quite foolhardy; a defect which will never be remedied till
                    we have a distinct class of men educated and brought up for engine-men from
                    their youth, to whom should be given such a salary as would bring in young men
                    Ofrespectability.</p>
                <p>In Plate CCCCXXV, fig. 3, we have given a plan of an invalid carriage, capable of
                    containing four invalids and their four attendants, (α, <hi rend="italic"
                    >a)</hi> are the seats for the passengers, one on each side of the firεt and
                    second bodies of the carriage being for the invalid, and the opposite one,
                    lengthways of the carriage, being for the attendants When the invalid wishes for
                    the use of the closet, he comes out by the door (Z&gt;) into the middle part of
                    the coach (&lt;∕), which is a gallery with a raised roof, as in fig. 2. There
                    are three portable water-closets <hi rend="italic">(c)</hi> in this carriage, or
                    the middle one, if thought more desirable, may be merely an urinal; the centre
                    one, to whatever purpose it may be converted, is arrived at from the gallery by
                    the door (c), and the right and left-hand clo-</p>
                <p>VOL. XIX.</p>
                <p>sets by the doors <hi rend="italic">(Jg) (fg)</hi> respectively. The ventilation
                    here would be very perfect, and no inconvenience whatever' could arise to any
                    one of the passengers. An attendant belonging to the railway company could
                    attend on all the passengers remaining in the gallery <hi rend="italic">
                    (d)</hi> till his assistance was required, for which purpose a bell might be
                    hung with pulls in each compartment. By this arrangement double the number of
                    invalids could in each case be accommodated with a passage.</p>
                <p>The following are the engines in use on the London and; Birmingham railway, and
                    which were made by Mr. Bury oft Liverpool. The description here given applies to
                    both thef passenger and goods’ engines, except when otherwise stated.</p>
                <p>The two cylinders are to have an 18-inch stroke, those of the passenger engines
                    being 12 inches, and the goods’ engines 13 inches in diameter, with single slide
                    valves, brass spring pistons, and cast iron packing; the cover of each cylinder
                    having one oil cup., The boilers are made of the best
                    YorkshireplatesjeitherBowlingorLowmoor. The fire-boxes are of the same material,
                    and are welded so as not to have the rivets or lap exposed immediately to the
                    action of the fire. They are 3-8ths of an inch thick, the back plates half an
                    inch, the outside of the fire-box and the backplate 3-8ths of an inch, and the
                    rest of the boiler <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> ⅞ths of an inch. Full-sized
                    drawings are furnished to shew how the plates are to be worked; the plate for
                    the tubes at the smoke-box end is half an inch thick, and a lead plug, 5-8ths of
                    an inch in diameter, is riveted in the crown of the fire-box.</p>
                <p>The tubes are two inches indiameterinside,andare secured with steel hoops at the
                    fire-box end, and iron hoops at the chimney end. These hoops are made to a given
                    guage; and the tubes are of the best rolled brass, No. 14 wire guage thick; the
                    arrangement as well as the exact size of the tubes being regulated by a
                    template.</p>
                <p>The engines have four wheels; those for the passengers are 5½ and 4 feet in
                    diameter, and those for the goods are each pair 5 feet in diameter. Each wheel
                    has a cast iron centre; and the spokes are of wrought iron, accurately fitted
                    into the nave. Thetireconsists of two thicknesses, the inner being 3-4 ths of an
                    inch when finished, of the best Staffordshire iron, well secured to the end of
                    the spokes by riveting, the ends of the spokes having been previously turned in
                    their exact position. The outside tire is made of the very best Bowling or
                    Lowmoor iron Igths inches thick when finished. When the outside of the inner
                    tire has been well riveted to the spokes it is turned; and the inside of the
                    outer tire having been accurately bored, so as to secure a perfect fit, it is
                    then shrunk on, and the outside turned and finished. The naves are bored out,
                    and the axles turned to fit; they are secured on by two steel keys, one inch
                    square, at right angles with each other. The goods’ engine wheels are connected
                    on the outside by a rod, with a ball pin at one end, and a parallel pin at the
                    other. These engines have also a damper to their blast pipe.</p>
                <p>The crank axles are made from Backbarrow iron, cut out of solid blocks, and
                    finished according to full-sized drawings. The straight axles are made of the
                    very best scrap iron. The framing of the engine is of wrought iron accurately
                    fitted. There is one pump attached to each cross-head, and made of good tough
                    brass, the suction pieces being connected by Macintosh hose pipes, with screw
                    coupling joints next the engine. The eccentrics are fixed on the crank axles in
                    the mode shewn by drawings. The steam and exhausting pipes are of copper, No. 12
                    wire guage in thickness. When these engines are made by other persons, templates
                    and full-sized working drawings are given out, from which no deviation whatever
                    is allowed without Mr. Bury’s approbation, so as to secure all parts of the
                    engines matching each other.</p>
                <p>The top of the fire-box has a copper cover, No. 16 wire guage thick, secured to
                    the wooden covering on the lower <pb break="no"

                    />part of the fire-box and body of the boiler, by screws two inches apart. The
                    wooden covering on the fire-box is finished to ⅞ -⅛ thick, and is made fast to
                    the boiler by two hoops; and round the fire door it is lined with thin sheet
                    iron under the hoops; the sheets being 6 feet long, and 2 feet 3 inches broad,
                    with a hole cut out for the furnace, and secured at the ends by screw nails 2
                    inches apart, to prevent the fire from burning the wood casing on the boiler.
                    The casing on the barrel of the boiler is secured by four hoops, with a strip of
                    brass under the fore-end hoop, about 2½ inches in breadth, to cover the ends of
                    the lining and the rivet heads at the junction of the barrel of the boiler, and
                    the smoke-box. The boiler is wrapped in at least three thicknesses of flannel
                    all over.</p>
                <p>The lagging on the boiler is put together with iron feathers I by ⅛; the boiler
                    is covered over the lagging with thin sheet lead, about 3½ feet broad along the
                    top of the barrel. The smoke-box is No. 7 wire guage thick, and the chimney is
                    No. 13 wire guage. The cover on the lockup safety valve is of brass, secured to
                    the boiler; there is a brass frame round the door of the smoke-box, and a brass
                    handle to the small door in the middle of the large one.</p>
                <p>All the pins of the joints are of steel, and hardened when practicable, but if
                    not, they are steeled and hardened, and the working parts of the engine, which
                    are of iron, are case-hardened. In making the boilers, the sharp edges of the
                    rivet holes are taken off on both sides, and the rivets and rivet heads made to
                    correspond. The engines are furnished with a wooden guard, and two leather
                    buffers stuffed with cotton flock; and there are a draw-bar, draw-pin, and loop
                    in the centre of the wooden guard, to connect them to the tender. They have
                    three water guage cocks, and a glass water guage, with a lamp stand; also a
                    whistle, and a number plate on each side of the boiler; and they are furnished
                    with a complete set of screw-keys.</p>
                <p>All the screws in all the engines correspond, for which purpose, either master
                    taps, or sets of stocks and dies, at the option of other makers, are furnished
                    them by Mr. Bury. They receive two coats of paint, and are finished with two
                    coats of the best varnish. They are guaranteed for one month, or 1000 miles,
                    during which trial, no other work is allowed but the tightening of cotters, and
                    the very best workmanship and materials that can be produced, are in all cases
                    rigidly insisted on.</p>
                <p>The framing of the tenders is of well-seasoned oak, or ash timber, thoroughly
                    secured with iron knees and bolts, having an iron box, No. 7 wire guage thick,
                    underneath, to carry the coke, which box is secured to the wooden frame. The
                    tank contains 700 gallons of water. The wheels are of cast-iron, turned to
                    receive a tire of either Bowling or Lowmoor iron, bored out to secure a perfect
                    fit, and finished to l¼ inches thick. The axles are 3¼ inches in thickness, of
                    the best hammered scrap iron; and the journals are 2¼ inches in diameter,
                    case-hardened, with brass bushes and oil box.</p>
                <p>The Steadiment for the axles consists of two plates, one outside, and the other
                    inside the framing; both of them being bolted through the framing, and secured
                    together below, by a piece of iron between the plates for steadying the axle
                    bushes. These are made completely parallel, and the bushes fitted into these so
                    as to move up and down, but in no other direction. The tenders have buffers, a
                    spring to which the load is attached, and also four springs by which they are
                    supported, one over each oil box.</p>
                <p>The tank is No. 10 wire guage thick, having two brass cocks or valves, and rod
                    handles with bushes for the top of the rods; also two copper pipes, 1¾ inches in
                    diameter, for carrying water from the tender to the engine. The tender frame and
                    tank have two coats of paint inside and out, and two coats of varnish. They are
                    fitted up with a brake, and furnished with a complete tool box; a wire sieve in
                    the main hole of the tank to prevent dirt or water from getting into the tank;
                    and two Macintosh hose pipes, one to each suction piece, with the necessary
                    connexion to attach them to the engine.</p>
                <p>When water requires to be pumped from the tender into the boiler of the engine,
                    previous to the starting of the train, it is the usual practice to run the
                    engine backwards and forwards for a short distance, in order to work the force
                    pumps. This increases the wear and tear both of the engine and the road, besides
                    inducing a liability in a crowded station of running foul of something, if great
                    care be not taken. The following contrivance will obviate the necessity of this
                    inconvenient method of filling the boiler. A square pit should be sunk in some
                    convenient part of the line, selected with reference to its intended use. This
                    pit should be large enough to admit a pair of three-feet wheels fixed on an axle
                    similar to the carriage wheels. There should be no flanges, and a part of the
                    circumference of these wheels should come up through the rails, which must be
                    cut so as to admit them, additional chairs being put in to support the ends of
                    the rails. This part of the circumference of the wheels thus becomes a part of
                    the railway, the wheels being made to lock at pleasure; but when the engine
                    requires to pump water into the boiler, it must be brought with its driving
                    wheels directly on those in the pit, and these latter being then unlocked, the
                    steam is let gradually on, and the pumps worked as long as is found necessary to
                    fill the boiler, without the engine advancing from the exact spot in which it
                    was first placed, the only effect produced by the driving wheels of the engine,
                    being to turn round the wheels fixed in the pit. When the boiler is filled, the
                    pit wheels are locked, and the engine proceeds to the performance of her
                    assigned duty. How much more advantageous this mode of filling the boiler is,
                    will be readily seen, particularly when it is remembered that if engine-men are
                    not looked well after, they will oil the driving wheels and the rails when in
                    the engine-house, and then letting on the steam, fill their boiler by means of
                    the wheels slipping round on the rails. We have often seen this carried to such
                    an extent, that streams of sparks have been struck out by the attrition. When no
                    better plan can be obtained, the engine should have one end lifted by
                    screw-jacks, till the driving wheels are off the rails, and the steam may then
                    be let on without any damage being done.</p>

                    of 50 lbs. per square inch, and with a consumption of coke of 480 lbs. The
                    average of 14 trips of three quarters of a mile each, up 1 in 90, from Euston
                    Square to Camden Town, on the London and Birmingham railway, with the great
                    engine made by Robert Stephenson and Company to work the trains up the
                    inclination till the fixed engine was ready, amounted to 15 miles an hour, with
                    70 tons, viz. 14 carriages and 148 passengers, at a steam pressure of 50 lbs.
                    per square inch. The average of 12 trips of 24¾ miles, up 1 in 440, on the Grand
                    Junction Railway, with six engines, three made by Robert Stephenson and Company,
                    and three by Sharp, Roberts, and Company, was 23¾ miles per hour, with a weight
                    of 58 tons. The coke consumed was 864 lbs., and the steam power 48 lbs. per
                    square inch; this coke, however, was very bad. The average of 14 trips of 23
                    miles, up 1 in 440, on the London and Birmingham line, with No. 16 engine, built
                    by Mr. Hawthorn of Newcastle, was 22 miles an hour, with a gross weight,
                    including the tender, of 70 tons. The coke consumed was 486 lbs., and the steam
                    pressure 48. The engine No. 7, on the London and Birmingham line, built by Mr.
                    Bury of Liverpool, went 10 miles in ten minutes, 3d October 1838, with only one
                    cylinder working, namely, from Hampton to Birmingham, being for 4½ miles, up 1
                    in 660, 3⅙ miles, up1 in 1370; the rest of the way was level, and the time
                    included the getting up and slacking down the speed.</p>

                <p>Whilst such machines as these can be turned out of hand, we may rest satisfied,
                    although considerable improvements will doubtless be yet made, great difference
                    of opinion still existing respecting the proper size of the driving wheels,
                    which may either be made larger to give an increased speed, or keeping the speed
                    the same, the piston may move with less velocity, either of which is a
                    desideratum. The crank axle may also be done away with, as Dr. Church has
                    exemplified in his engine, or by other means, or it may be cut out of solid
                    iron. At present, too, the steam whistle, which can be heard several miles in a
                    still day, is only made use of to warn persons of the time when the engine is
                    approaching them. How much better would it be to have two of these with totally
                    distinct sounds, one to be used on the arrival line, and the other on the
                    departure line? Each would then not only perform its present office as an alarm,
                    but would form the most complete fog and night signal that could be desired, and
                    would at all times, in the densest fog or the darkest night, give perfect notice
                    whenever two engines approached each other, on which line each was travelling,
                    and thus prevent almost the possibility of a collision.</p>
                <p>There has so seldom been an instance of a locomotive engine boiler bursting, that
                    it is perhaps hardly necessary to advert to such an accident. We know only of
                    two amongst the tubular boilers. One happened lately on the Liverpool and
                    Manchester Railway, apparently from the boiler being used till the rivets got so
                    worn, that they were weaker than the tubes. The fire-box end of the boiler was
                    blown out, and the above is the only way of accounting for it, as tubes must
                    always bear a steam of 50 lbs. on the square inch. Of course when new, they bear
                    considerably more, and their form gives every advantage to their strength, the
                    pressure on them being inwards, whilst on the boiler it is outwards. It is also
                    known that the safety valve was held down. The second instance occurred on the
                    Brussels railroad. In this case, the lock-up safety valve was found to be loaded
                    to 105 lbs. upon the square inch; and it had also been screwed down more on one
                    side than on the other. These valves are held down by a series of elliptical
                    springs, which move on a guide rod passing through their centres. When they are
                    not screwed down equally on both sides, their position becomes diagonal, and
                    they jamb on the guide road instead of working easily, as they do when rightly
                    managed. Safety, in all the usual cases, is insured by having a fusible plug on
                    the top of the fire-box, composed of four parts lead and one part tin. This will
                    melt before any danger can arise, and the steam will rush into the furnace. The
                    late American experiments on this head may be consulted with advantage; but the
                    mystery has not yet been unravelled. We have had an open vat burst in Meux’s
                    brewery; and in two instances boilers have been suffered to get quite cold. The
                    man-hole has then been opened, and a person has gone inside, but soon
                    afterwards, in each instance, upon their introducing a lighted candle,
                    explosions took place, and they were in both cases killed. Gas generated by
                    boilers getting red hot, and absorbing the oxygen, has been supposed to be a
                    leading cause; this, however, is exceedingly doubtful. If such be the case, it
                    might be well to try protecting them by means of another metal. It would also be
                    a good thing to rotate the safety valve, which is locked up from the engine-man,
                    by machinery, to prevent any improper adhesion, and by using a mercurial steam
                    guage, nearly all blowing-off at the safety valve might be avoided, which now
                    often amounts to one-fourth of the generated steam. The boiler tubes, as now
                    made, are capable of running 30,000 miles. The want of adhesion so much talked
                    of, is found to be nonsense, and if there had been any, it would only be
                    necessary, as the writer of this article suggested several years ago, to connect
                    a galvanic magnet with one or more of the axles, to act on the rails, by which
                    means, with the addition of only a few pounds, an adhesion equivalent to the
                    weight of two tons could be produced at each axle, being capable also of acting
                    or not at a moment’s notice. But there is always found to be sufficient
                    adhesion, except sometimes in foggy weather, at first starting; when once in
                    motion, the train acts as a fly-wheel. We have no hesitation in saying, that
                    electro-magnetism will at no distant day compete with steam as a motive power,
                    and successfully.</p>
                <p>We are yet, however, very ignorant not only of the powers but even of the nature
                    of steam. No one can satisfactorily prove whether it is a mechanical division of
                    water, or a chemical decomposition. The currents which take place in water
                    whilst it is heating, and which are reversed when it cools, are not yet taken
                    sufficient advantage of, and there are many other facts which require
                    examination. It is well known, that if we put on our bare hand, an iron kettle
                    of water boiling rapidly we feel no sensation of heat, but the moment the
                    ebulition ceases, we feel a gradually increasing warmth, which is greatest at
                    the edge of the bottom. When the bottom, well cleaned, is placed almost in
                    contact with the bulb of a thermometer, it will only raise it 8° or 10° in
                    thirty seconds, or about 40° in five or six minutes, although the water, at the
                    expiration of that time, will be at 90° higher. With an earthenware pot, the
                    difference is very great, the thermometer rising 100° in thirty seconds, instead
                    of 8° or 10°. A drop of water placed in a metal vessel, at a white heat, is very
                    slowly converted into steam, whilst at a lower temperature its conversion is so
                    rapid, as almost to resemble an explosion. At the high temperature, it will spin
                    round, and will take nearly a minute to evaporate, during which time, if it be
                    turned into the hand, it will barely feel warm.</p>
                <p>The experiments made by the committee of the Franklin Institute of Pennsylvannia,
                    are well worth consulting on these subjects. It is there shown, that a drop of
                    water on polished copper, at the temperature of 445°, took 210 seconds before it
                    was converted into vapour. It was evaporated in the smallest time, at a
                    temperature of 292°, at which it took three seconds. But when the copper,
                    instead of being highly polished, was highly oxidated, the temperature of
                    maximum evaporation was at 348°, and the time required to convert the drop into
                    steam only one-fourth of a second, or as 12 to 1; whilst in iron the temperature
                    suffered but little variation, whatever was the condition of the metal, except
                    it was very highly oxidated, the iron having its highest evaporating points in
                    this case about 35° above copper in the same condition. The time varied nearly
                    in the ratio of the conducting power of the metals, or about 2½ to 1, the copper
                    requiring the least.</p>
                <p>At 20° to 40° above the point of maximum vaporisation there is a perfect
                    repulsion between the drop of water and the heated metal, the former rotating in
                    all directions, without wetting the metal. When larger quantities of water were
                    used, the point of maximum vaporisation was much higher; which renders it
                    evident that locomotive engines have yet to be considerably altered, before they
                    can work at the greatest advantage. The same experiments shew, that water
                    injected, either hot or cold, into an engine boiler, heated to bright redness,
                    produced no hydrogen, but that the resulting gas was nothing more than
                    atmospherical air, deprived by the heated metal of more or less of its oxygen;
                    that is to say, nitrogen more or less pure, according to the quantity of oxygen
                    which has been absorbed.</p>
                <p>The nature of the most advantageous alloys for the fusible plugs of locomotive or
                    other high-pressure boilers, has been carefully examined by the same committee,
                    and the following table is deduced from their observations, the stationary point
                    being that of congelation.</p>
                <p>The proportions are by weight throughout. The stationary points are not given for
                    the ten latter alloys, but the decrease in temperature by which they became
                    “hard solid,” on the surface we presume, was as follows, viz. 25°, 24°,
                    20½°,</p>

                <p>22½° , 30½° , 32½° , 48½° , 50½°, 49⅛° , 46°. The arrangement of the table is in
                    the order in which the alloy begins to solidify. A correct knowledge of the
                    nature and properties of steam is of such importance at the present day, that
                    the matter ought to be taken up by government. Private individuals are not able
                    to incur the expense necessary in conducting a complete course of the
                    experiments which are required to fully develope such an intricate and
                    voluminous subject.</p>

                <p>The practice of putting two engines to a train is not considered so good as
                    dividing the train into two, and putting one engine to each. Whatever may be the
                    objections to the latter plan, those who argue in this way assert that no two
                    engines will have their w heels mathematically accurate as to size, and if they
                    had, still their rate of working, depending as it does on so many elements,
                    would always prevent their velocity being precisely the same, except for a short
                    time, by mere chance; and when this is not the case, a most destructive rubbing
                    immediately takes place. When two are working together, for instance, with
                    driving wheels 5 feet 6 inches in diameter, the circumference will be 17∙2787
                    feet, and at a speed of 40 miles an hour, which is 211200 feet, or 3520 feet per
                    minute, equal to 58∙66 feet per second, these wheels must revolve 12223 times in
                    an hour, or 203 <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> 71 times per minute, equal to
                    3∙395 times per second.</p>
                <p>Now, if we only take half this velocity, or 20 miles an hour, or 105600 feet for
                    the one engine, and 19 or 21 miles, or 100320 and 110880 feet respectively for
                    the other, we have at once a rubbing motion of no less than 5280 feet per
                    hour,or one mile in twenty, with a rubbing instead of a rolling motion. In fact,
                    the rubbing will always be equivalent to the difference between the velocities
                    of the two engines, and the loss of power, the wear and tear; and the injury to
                    the machinery by the extra steam which must be brought on all the working parts,
                    if the above be true, may readily be imagined. A self-registering counter, fixed
                    to ascertain the number of strokes, would easily settle this point; to do which,
                    it must trace the work of each engine on paper, similarly to the self-acting
                    anemometer of Mr. Osler of Birmingham. But for our own parts no proof is
                    required. We are certain it is not the case, and that the speed of both engine3
                    becomes equalized almost immediately after they start; that engine which would
                    travel the fastest, doing the largest proportion of the work, and thus relieving
                    the pistons of the other, by drawing her along at her own rate, as she would, in
                    fact, if the steam were shut oft' altogether. A strong man and <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> weak man working at a winch is an exactly similar case.</p>
                <p>Before long there is no doubt that signals will be established along all
                    considerable lines of railway. The use of them is sufficiently obvious, and they
                    might be turned to profit also, by conveying messages of all kinds, at the rate
                    of so much per word; they would thus, instead of being a cost to the railway
                    company, become a source of emolument. Communications throughout a length of
                    100miles, when they can be made at one signal from each station, would be
                    transmitted in about a minute and a quarter, and any ordinary message out of the
                    usual course in about half an hour; a telegraph would be prevented from working
                    by the weather, about two months a-year in the aggregate.</p>
                <p>There is nothing so easy as to make a telegraph book; in fact, it is only
                    numbering a dictionary, and the thing is done. In fact, hundreds of messages may
                    be sent on the usual address of a newspaper, without the possibility of the
                    post-office being at all aware of anything of the kind being carried on. In the
                    case of a railway, each head of the different departments should send in lists
                    of the various messages most likely to he wanted, and these could be added to,
                    as time developes what is required.</p>
                <p>The original expense of such a thing would probably be about L.260 each station,
                    and the annual expense about L.77 per station; to which would have to be added
                    the salary of the superintendent, clerks, and a few supernumerary men. Their
                    great use renders them most desirable things. For instance, an accident happens
                    to an engine ten miles from an engine station. The telegraph would send out
                    another engine in a minute, with any commonly good look-out; whereas, to send on
                    foot would require two hours, thus deranging the time of all the succeeding
                    trains. As another instance, a train starting from one end to the other of the
                    line, perhaps leaves 50 passengers at some intermediate town; the telegraph
                    might immediately make this known to the clerk of that station, who, if he had
                    few passengers ready for the train, could prepare goods’ waggons to put on, so
                    that the engine should not go with half a load; a matter of great importance,
                    for the power absorbed by an engine before it can put itself in motion, being
                    one-third of its whole power, it follows that the relative expenditure of power
                    per ton per mile, is nearly six times greater with a load of 10 tons than it
                    would be with a load of 100 tons.</p>
                <p>When accidents do happen upon railways, they may generally be expected to be
                    extremely serious, and no means should be left unprovided, for immediate
                    assistance being dispatched; even an advice carriage, which might be worked at
                    20 miles an hour, would be but a slow method, compared with a telegraph, for
                    instance, if medical assistance, or what is more likely, surgical assistance,
                    was wanted. In many cases, it will be highly advantageous, particularly in a
                    pecuniary point of view, to run trains at different velocities, passing each
                    other by means of sidings, the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=55" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0055-0045"
                    />expense of locomotive transport increasing so much with an increased velocity.
                    This desirable method will no doubt eventually be much practised. It would be
                    almost impossible without a telegraph.</p>
                <p>The effects of high wind upon a train, especially a sidewind, which binds the
                    flanges of the wheels against the rails, and very much impedes the velocity, as
                    well as increasing the wear and tear, renders it a desirable thing to have its
                    force measured at all the principal stations, so that whenever it exceeds a
                    certain standard, to be determined by experiment, a second engine may be sent
                    out to assist the train. The most complete instrument for this purpose is the
                    anemometer, invented by Mr. Osier of Birmingham, now used at the Philosophical
                    institution of that town, at Plymouth, and in other places. This also combines
                    so many other arrangements, as well as that for measuring the force of the wind,
                    each of which it transfers by machinery to paper, that it is in fact the heavens
                    registering themselves, and for a cost of about L.50 leaves nothing to
                    desire.</p>
                <p>For railway purposes merely, a more simple contrivance will be sufficient,
                    although the cost will not be very materially decreased, if it be fitted up with
                    the requisite attention to convenience as well as accuracy. For instance, if a
                    vane with a long tail, high above the top of the engine-house,and having at its
                    pointing end a board one foot square, be fitted up in the following manner, it
                    will be sufficient for all the wants of the locomotive department. The vane
                    should be fixed on a hollow pole, which should turn with it and descend thruogh
                    a tube down to about five feet of the floor of the engine-house, where there
                    should be a horizontal dial-plate, on which should traverse a pointer fixed to
                    the vane-pole. This pointer would always indicate the direction of the wind; and
                    in order to ascertain its force, the board, one foot square, on the pointing end
                    of the vane, should act on a spiral spring, and work a drum by a wheel and
                    pinion, communicating by a cord, with a similar drum at the bottom of the
                    vane-pole, where a vertical dial-plate should be fixed, on the outside, and
                    opposite to the lower drum, on which a hand traversing round the vertical
                    dial-plate would shew the force of the wind.</p>
                <p>According to the power of the engine, and the nature of the usual traffic,
                    experience will soon point out when a second engine ought to be dispatched; and
                    a table being formed for each point of the compass for this, should then be
                    invariably acted on at all times, unless other local circumstances occasioned
                    any alterations in the general average of the loads.</p>
                <p>To estimate the force of the wind, we have, by the experiments of Dr. Hutton, a
                    plane surface of one square foot, at a velocity of 20 feet per second, suffering
                    a resistance of 12 ounces; and as it varies very nearly as the square of the
                    velocity, we have in pounds, calling <hi rend="italic">f</hi> any other force,
                    and <hi rend="italic">V</hi> the velocity,</p>
                <p>/3 . <hi rend="italic">sjf</hi> = 20 feet: <hi rend="italic">v</hi> feet, <hi
                    rend="superscript">s7</hi> 4 '</p>
                <p>and as the number of feet per second, multiplied by ∙6818, produces the number of
                    miles per hour, the above becomes, for miles, <hi rend="italic"><hi

                <p>So much has been said about the inconvenience and danger of tunnels, that it is
                    necessary, whilst there are yet so many railways to be called into existence, to
                    state that there is positively no inconvenience whatever in them, except the
                    change from day-light to lamp-light. This matter was clearly investigated and
                    proved upon the London and Birmingham railway, a special inspection having been
                    there made in the Primrose-hill tunnel by Dr. Paris and Dr. Watson, Messrs.
                    Lawrence and Lucas, surgeons, and Mr. Phillips, lecturer on chemistry, who
                    reported as follows :—</p>
                <p>“We, the undersigned, visited together, on the 20th of February 1837, the tunnel
                    now in progress under Primrose-hill, with the view of ascertaining the probable
                    effect of such tunnels upon the health and feelings of those who may traverse
                    them. The tunnel is carried through clay, and is laid with brick-work. Its
                    dimensions, as described to us, are as follows: height, 22 feet; length, 3750
                    feet; width, 22 feet. It is ventilated by five shafts, from'6 to 8 feet in
                    diameter, their depth being 35 to 55 feet.</p>
                <p>“The experiment was made under unfavourable circumstances; the western extremity
                    being only partially open, the ventilation is less perfect than it will be when
                    the work is completed; the steam of the locomotive engine was also suffered to
                    escape for twenty minutes, while the carriages were stationary, near the end of
                    the tunnel; even during our stay near the unfinished end of the tunnel, where
                    the engine remained stationary, although the cloud caused by the steam was
                    visible near the roof, the air for many feet above our heads remained clear, and
                    apparently unaffected by steam or effluvia of any kind; neither was there any
                    damp or cold perceptible.</p>
                <p>“We found the atmosphere of the tunnel dry, and of an agreeable temperature, and
                    free from smell; the lamps of the carriages were lighted; and in our transit
                    inwards and back again to the mouth of the tunnel, the sensation experienced was
                    precisely that of travelling in a coach by night between the walls of a narrow
                    street; the noise did not prevent easy conversation, nor appear to be much
                    greater in the tunnel than in the open air.</p>
                <p>“Judging from this experiment, and knowing the ease and certainty with which
                    thorough ventilation may be effected, we are decidedly of opinion' that the
                    dangers incurred in passing through well-constructed tunnels are no greater than
                    those incurred in ordinary travelling upon an open railway, or upon a turnpike
                    road, and that the apprehensions which have been expressed, that such tunnels
                    are likely to prove detrimental to the health, or inconvenient to the feelings
                    of those who may go through them, are perfectly futile and groundless.”</p>
                <p>The above will, of course, set the question at rest, especially as the Leeds and
                    Selby tunnel, only 17 feet in height, and 700 feet in length, is found to
                    produce no inconvenience; and as any persons may now try the experiment
                    themselves <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=56"

                    We may 'instance tile tunnel near Kilsby, on the London and Birmingham railway,
                    which is 2425 yards long, and traversed without the slightest inconvenience or
                    sensation of cold or damp; the change experienced being merely that from
                    sunshine to shade, and from daylight to lamplight, and this latter only in those
                    seasons of the year when the days are considerably longer than the nights.</p>
                <p>The quantity of friction in well-formed carriages we consider as certainly not
                    more than 8 lbs. per ton; but as about 9∙3 lbs., or j¼ <hi rend="subscript"

                <p>To use the table, look along the upper column for the hundreds, and down the
                    left-hand column for the tens of the rate of inclination; and at the point of
                    intersection will be found a number which is to be multiplied by the total
                    weight of the carriage and its load in lbs. for the total resistance. Thus for a
                    carriage weighing 8000 lbs., at an inclination of 1 in 560, we have 8000.

                <p>being due to the rubbing of axles on their bearings. A great deal depends upon
                    the unguent used, both as it respects quantity and quality. A wheel loaded with
                    from 1 to 4000 lbs., and turned on its axle on a half bearing by a weight and
                    rope, which detached itself after falling 30 feet, leaving the wheel to revolve
                    till its own friction brought it to rest, made 36 revolutions, when nearly
                    deprived of oil, and 278 revolutions when the oil was heaped on that side of the
                    bearing which the circumference of the axle approached as it turned round. The
                    ratio of bearing surface of the axles has also a considerable effect. This
                    should not exceed 90 lbs. per square inch, and the length of bearing should not
                    be much less than twice the diameter of the axles. Under these circumstances,
                    friction on railways will be uniform at all velocities with well made carriages,
                    and will be in the ratio of the weight.</p>
                <p>The friction of engines, without any load, and exclusive of the tenders, will be
                    in the average ratio of the diameter of the wheels, and nearly as their weight;
                    8½ tons, with five·</p>
                <p>neral average, we here give a table for the total resistance arising from gravity
                    and friction, calculated from the following formula.</p>

                <p>where G is the effect of gravity, the weight being taken as unity, I the

                <p>The friction of edge-rails to that of plate rails, is as 17∙5 to 27∙8. The wear
                    and tear of ropes on inclined planes is about ¼d. per ton per mile; and their
                    friction, either selfacting or with fixed engines, will vary from j'. <hi

                    sheave and its pin, and an allowance must be made for any curves in the line of
                    direction.</p>
                <p>The adhesion of engines may be taken as at least equal to y⅛th part of the weight
                    on the driving wheels. This will enable them to draw in the following
                    proportions for each ton of the weight under the most unfavourable
                    circumstances, and may be much increased when the weather and all other
                    circumstances are in the most advantageous state.</p>

                <p>In the common steam engine, the power is as the area of the piston, and the
                    pressure of the steam on it. But in the locomotive engines this is not the case;
                    for the power of raising steam in any quantity, which may always be had in a
                    stationary engine by increasing either the size or tile number of the boilers,
                    has a limit in the locomotive, determined by the weight to which the engine must
                    be restricted. The power in this case resides in the capability of the en<pb

                    steam in a certain time, and not in the diameter of the piston.</p>
                <p>The evaporation is produced partly by radiant heat communicated to the water
                    surrounding the fire-box, and partly from that which is transmitted by the hot
                    air passing through the tubes, the effect of the former being to the latter as 3
                    to L At a velocity of 18∙88 miles per hour, M. Pambour found that 55∙82 cubic
                    feet of water were evaporated per hour, with a heating surface exposed to
                    radiation of 43∙ 1 <hi rend="italic">2</hi> square feet, and a surface exposed
                    to the heated air of 288∙35 feet, equal together to 139∙24 square feet of
                    radiating surface; and calling <hi rend="italic">a</hi> the former surface, and
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> the latter, we shall have the evaporating power of
                    different engines at the above velocity, <hi rend="italic">e=≈a</hi> +ηρ <hi
                    rend="superscript">ar,</hi> d reducing the communicative to the equivalent
                    radiant heat as above, we get 0∙4 cubic feet evaporated per hour for each square
                    foot of radiating surface, of which, from blowing off, loss from the steam
                    ports, and half an inch at each end of the cylinders, the effective steam is
                    only 0∙3 cubic feet for each square foot of radiating surface. The piston must
                    move about 300 feet per minute to work the blast properly, which generally
                    requires 6 lb. per square inch, at 25 miles per hour, and at the highest
                    velocities, will take one-third the power of the engine.</p>
                <p>The coke consumed in the best kind of engines, will be about one-fourth of a
                    pound per ton per mile, gross load, and one-fourth of a gallon of water,
                    provided the load is proportioned to the capability of the engine. A great deal
                    also depends on the quality of the coke; and as the power of an engine consists
                    so much in the quantity of water it can evaporate, we subjoin a Table giving the
                    load to the nearest ton and velocity on different inclinations, when sixty cubic
                    feet of water per hour can be converted into steam, that being the capability of
                    the best modern engines.</p>

                <p>The expenses of railroads are not yet well understood, and are very variable. For
                    instance, in America, the Boston and Worcestercosts L.157 per mile, and the
                    Uticaand Shenectady, L.363 per mile; whilst in England the Liverpool and
                    Manchester costs L.1000. Again, the latter costs L.444 per mile, for maintenance
                    of the way, whilst the Leicester and Swannington, a coal line, was let for four
                    or five years, at L.70 per mile, and is now let for less, the company finding
                    engines and ballast, at which price the contractor is supposed to have made
                    L.500 a-year, besides interest upon the cost of his waggons. About 180,000 tons
                    yearly pass on this line. The engines weigh from three to twelve tons, and the
                    waggons thirty-eight cwt. carrying four tons nett. The locomotive power is
                    rather more than one-fourth of a penny per ton per mile.</p>
                <p>The maintenance of the way upon the Grand Junction railway, for eighty-two mdes
                    to Newton, has been let at L.244 per mile, including rails, chairs, bridges, and
                    every thing. We have no doubt this is amply sufficient. They pay L.20,000 a-year
                    to the Liverpool and Manchester company for the use of their line and offices.
                    The Great Western railway, under unfavourable circumstances, has been let at
                    L.4l6 per mile; and the repairs to the London and Southampton line are divided,
                    the company finding all materials, and contracting for their labour only, for
                    which they pay L.140 per mile, including the use of tools. But the best data to
                    found any calculation on this varying expenditure, are those contained in the
                    reports published by the Directors of the Liverpool and Manchester railway, for
                    the five half year sending the 30th of June 1834. We shall endeavour to set this
                    calculation in its true light, which has not yet been done. The following are
                    the various items of expenditure, exclusive of interest, with which we have
                    nothing to do.</p>
                <p>Liverpool and Manchester Railway expenditure for five half years ending June
                    1834, exclusive of interest:—</p>
                <p>Locomotive power, including new engines......... L.67552</p>

                    compensation......................................... 63279</p>

                <p>Total, exclusive of interest..............L.237,704</p>
                <p>We have included the cost of new engines in the locomotive power expenditure, as
                    otherwise we should have had to allow an uncertain amount for depreciation. For
                    the same reason we have included tile cost of new rails in the disbursements for
                    the maintenance of way; whereas former computers have only included the cost of
                    new blocks and sleepers. In the coaching and carrying departments are included
                    the following items, which we shall afterwards use.</p>

                <p>Let us now see what duty has been performed for these several amounts of
                    expenditure :—</p>

                <p>The distinction shewn here between the power and the way arises from a small
                    portion of the coals and the Bolton tonnage not being drawn by the company’s
                    engines; and hence these have to be omitted in any calculations on the cost of
                    locomotive power, but are retained in the expenses <pb break="no"

                    />of keeping in repair the permanent way. The number of trips has also to be
                    augmented by an average allowance for the above tonnage. For computing the
                    expense of the way, we must likewise include the weight of the engines and
                    tenders, say 15 tons each. We then have</p>

                <p>Total load passing on the way 1518413</p>
                <p>In the above, we have allowed coach room for 64 passengers per trip, and have
                    taken the weight of a first-class train at 21 tons, and a second class at 12∙6
                    tons; the relative numbers of each being at the time we speak of, 13 to</p>

                <p>= 16∙3655 tons, and more on longer lines from the luggage being heavier.</p>
                <p>We have now to deduce the drawn and the passing weight over 1 mile upon a level,
                    calling the Liverpool and Manchester railway equal to 34½ miles on a level, when
                    due allowance is made for the gradients.</p>

                <p>We now require the ratio of expenditure for passengers and goods, for locomotive
                    power and maintenance of the way. This has generally been taken in proportion to
                    the number of trips with each, which is clearly wrong. Both the weight and the
                    velocity are evidently functions of the expenditure, taking the drawn weight in
                    estimating the cost of the power and the passing weight for that of the way; and
                    as the cost of passengers and that of goods is not separated, which indeed could
                    hardly be done for the way, we have no guide, and can only make an
                    approximation, by taking the cost directly as the weight and velocity. We have
                    then</p>

                <p>This gives us in money,</p>
                <p>Goods..........'................L.37054.5</p>
                <p>Passengers..................... 30497.5</p>
                <p>ToUl..................L.67552</p>
                <p>A similar result drawn from the number of trips only, would give for the goods,
                    L.28710, and the passengers L.38842, which is clearly inadmissible; unless we
                    are prepared to say that the locomotive power is used in a most disadvantageous
                    manner, of which we have no evidence. Hence, if we multiply the number of
                    passengers by 0∙353585, or, which will be sufficiently accurate, by O-3536, it
                    will give us the total weight drawn in trains, averaging as those did on the
                    Liverpool and Manchester line at the time in question; or, in other words, there
                    are 2∙8282 passengers to a ton gross weight.</p>
                <p>In order to apportion the expense of mainuining the way between the goods and
                    passengers, we have,</p>
                <p>For maintenance of the way,</p>
                <p>3267577815: 19709470-25 or 490136670:492736750, or as 1: 1∙005.</p>
                <p>This gives us in money such a small difference from equal proportions, that we
                    may safely venture to place halt the expense on each; always premising, as we
                    have before explained, that the workmanship in the waggon springs, wheels, and
                    axles, is to be considered as of the best description, without which the expense
                    may be almost anything.</p>
                <p>The result deduced from the number of trips would have given us the goods’
                    expense to the passengers, nearly as 16 :22, an additional proof that this
                    method is very erroneous. We are aware of the difficulties which envelope the
                    whole question, especially in first working a railway, when the embankments
                    settle down and render very expensive repairs necessary, without a single
                    vehicle passing over the road, whilst the more it is used, the sooner it will
                    get in perfect order. Nor are there any data to guide us correctly, as respects
                    the effect of velocity; but from an attentive consideration of the subject,
                    combined with a comparison on many lines, we believe the foregoing method to be
                    that which agrees best with practical results, and with this we must rest
                    satisfied till more experimental knowledge is acquired.</p>
                <p>For the locomotive power, the cost of new engines and repairs must now be
                    separated from that of the working expenditure in coke, oil, grease, waste,
                    wages, &amp;c. We shall find this to stand as follows:</p>

                <p>The police expenses are about L.75 per mile, including gatekeepers and switchmen;
                    and this would of course be doubled for a night and day line. The porterage of
                    the goods at the termini, costs 8¼d. per ton, and has been for some time paid at
                    that rate by contract.</p>

                    traffic on this line consists of coals carried on an average 20 miles per trip,
                    with 63 tons 12 cwt. nett. Goods averaging 12 miles, and passengers the same
                    distance, are conveyed indiscriminately in the same train.</p>

                <p>a four-horse coach. This gives Is. 9d. expenses per single mile, while the
                    returns will be 2s. 6d. per mile. From this calculation we have excluded the
                    charge for parcels, &amp;c., leaving it to go, with the allowance for
                    incidentals, to the support of the office establishments. The coaches which ran
                    between Birmingham and London, prior to the opening of the railway, charged L.2,
                    10s. inside, and L.l, 10s. outside, the distance being 108 miles, and after the
                    opening, L.l, 10s. inside, and 17s. out. Our computation of coach profits we
                    know is under the mark. The cost of this mode of travelling is about 3d. per
                    passenger per mile, or 3s. per ton, taking 12 passengers and their luggage to a
                    ton. In canal carriage, the cost varies from 3d. to 5d. per ton per mile, in the
                    fly boats going at the rate of 4 miles an hour; and by slow boats, from l¼d. to
                    2d. per ton per mile, at the rate of 2½ miles an hour. The passenger boats,
                    going 10 miles an hour, charge from Id. to l¼d. per passenger, per</p>

                <p>Per engine, per annum, 737330 344665</p>
                <p>The comparative cost of the different modes of transit is, under all
                    circumstances, strongly in favour of railways. For instance, in waggons
                    travelling 2½ miles an hour, the cost of each ton, per mile, for goods, is about
                    7¾d., of which nearly 3d. is the cost of horsing. In vans travelling at 4 miles
                    an hour with lighter goods, the expense is nearly Is. per ton, per mile, the
                    horsing costing rather above 4d. of this sum. The expenses of four-horse stage
                    coaches, vary from L.4 to L.5 per lunar month, per double mile, according as
                    their rate of travelling varies from 8 to 10 miles an hour; their hire and
                    repairs cost 2½d. per double mile; the duty is 3d. per double mile; and the
                    horsing is 2s. The coachman and guard are seldom paid except by the passengers,
                    say 10s. 6d. per week for them at the outside; and for tolls and incidental
                    charges 6d. per mile; being a large allowance. The tolls on the Holyhead road,
                    one of the best in England, are not quite 4d. per mile, for mile, or from Is. to
                    Is. 3d. per ton of passengers, per mile.</p>
                <p>The cost of carriage by railways worked with horses, is from l½d. to 2d. per ton,
                    per mile, for heavy, and 3d. to 3½d. for light goods, and from Id. to l½d. per
                    passenger, per mile, or from Is. to Is. 6d. per ton of passengers, per mile.
                    Those worked by locomotives charge about the same for goods, and rather more for
                    passengers, or from l½d. to 2½d. per mile on an average. These latter charges
                    however are too high. The resistance by the several modes of transit, is for
                    railways, 8lbs. per ton; canals, 2¾lbs. per ton, at 2½ miles velocity, 7 lbs. at
                    4 miles, 40 lbs. at 9 miles, and 60 lbs. at</p>
                <p>11 miles, which is the greatest hitherto attained. Turnpike roads’ waggons,
                    76lbs.; vans, 71 lbs. at the before mentioned velocities; and coaches, 80 to 88
                    lbs. at from 8 to 10 miles an hour.</p>
                <p>In whatever light we view the question, no other mode of transit can be put in
                    competition with railroads, except <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=61" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0061-0051"
                    />the very slow carriage of heavy goods on canals. But this is not a fair
                    comparison, as speed must be taken into account as well as price; and we have no
                    hesitation in saying that upon well managed and economically-conducted
                    railroads, goods of every kind can be carried, with proper precautions, quite as
                    cheap as by any canal, and with three times the speed at least. A great deal
                    remains yet to be done in this department of locomotive transit, and the
                    question cannot be decided on any railway with certainty, till it has been some
                    time in operation, and the mode of working and maintaining it, and of
                    economising the locomotive power expenses, are reduced to a well regulated
                    system.</p>
                <p>Many doubts were entertained, at an early period of the railway system, as to the
                    performance of engines when snow lay on the rails to a depth which on the common
                    roads interrupted the ordinary communications of the country; they have however
                    completely triumphed over this difficulty; a striking proof of which took place
                    on the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway; where the possibility of working the
                    engines, under the above unfavourable circumstances, was put to the test on
                    December 20,1836, in the deep cutting through the Cowran hills, where the snow
                    had accumulated to the depth of four or five feet, when the Hercules engine came
                    down on the morning of the above day. Numbers of the country people assembled to
                    see how it would act in such an emergency, and to render any assistance which
                    might be necessary. On arriving at the spot, however, the engine dashed right
                    into the drift, clearing its way through, apparently without any difficulty; the
                    snow at the same time flying over the top of the engine chimney, like foam from
                    the broken waves of a violent sea; and notwithstanding this and other similar
                    obstructions, the train came down from Greenhead, twenty miles, in one hour and
                    a quarter, and their times of arrival were properly kept up, whilst all the
                    communications by the ordinary roads were more or less seriously obstructed, if
                    not entirely cut off.</p>
                <p>Hence any of the so often proposed plans for sweeping or scraping the rails will
                    rarely be found necessary, much less the plan seriously proposed and patented so
                    late as 1831, of making the rails hollow and filling them with hot water in
                    winter. In the extreme case of rain succeeded by frost, thus forming a coat of
                    ice upon the rails, it will generally be found sufficient to place a waggon, or
                    any other empty light vehicle in front of the engine, which will break up the
                    ice sufficiently to allow of the necessary adhesion. The effect of severe frosts
                    on the road itself will be found of infinitely more consequence, and is an
                    additional reason why drainage should be scrupulously attended to in countries
                    where much cold is experienced. The manner in which frosts acts on common roads,
                    is sufficient evidence of what may be expected on a railroad, if the water is
                    not most carefully carried off from the ballasting.</p>
                <p>In America, for instance, where railways were first laid down on blocks, similar
                    to the way they are constructed in England, it was found that their severe
                    winters completely disorganised them; splitting the blocks, throwing the rails
                    out of guage, and even twisting them so as to render them unfit for the passage
                    of the engines, and obliging the trains to travel at a reduced speed. From these
                    causes, and as it was found necessary to relay the road after each winter,
                    blocks have in a great measure been abandoned, longitudinal and cross sleepers
                    being generally substituted, and laid on broken stones filled into trenches; but
                    the evil is yet only partially remedied. It may, however, in all cases, be set
                    down as a general rule, that where timber can be obtained cheap, it should be
                    used in preference to blocks.</p>
                <p>The difference, however, is necessarily so great between Ihe railroads in that
                    country and this, as very much to preclude comparison. Some of theirs are
                    constructed of plate rails 2½ inches wide, by half an inch thick, and weighing
                    from 10 to 17 lbs. per yard; their curves and inclinations are such, from the
                    nature of the country, as to render cross ties more frequently required than
                    they are in English railroads. ' Continuous stone bearings have also been tried
                    in America; also piles at three feet distance, as supports to the rails, which
                    are spiked down to them without the intervention of any chairs.</p>
                <p>Several of their railroads are carried across valleys by means of wooden
                    trestles, well braced together, and assisted by piles; the lower ends of which
                    in soft ground are often left square instead of being pointed, as a means of
                    affording additional stability. These sort of roads are in several cases carried
                    over valleys of such a depth, as to occasion no small surprise to those only
                    acquainted with the substantial embankments of England and most other parts of
                    Europe. It must be confessed, however, that the Americans, in the expense of
                    their railways, beat the old country hollow; and there are many things which we
                    should be glad to see copied from them; we may instance their guards in the
                    front of the engine to remove obstacles from the road, and their long and high
                    carriages.</p>
                <p>Some of their lines are worked by horses at the rate of 15 miles per hour; and on
                    the locomotive lines, where the curves are bad, the driving wheels are placed
                    next the fire box, and the front part of the engine is supported on a
                    four-wheeled truck, to which it is attached by a vertical pivot, while the
                    weight rests on friction rollers; this management admits of a motion by which
                    the wheels are in a great measure assisted in their passage round the curves,
                    which in some cases have not more than 300 feet radius, whilst in others they
                    have gradients of 1 in 110, and inclined planes rising 1 in 10.</p>
                <p>Another striking departure from the method of constructing these works commonly
                    adopted in England, has been introduced by Mr. J. K. Brunel on the Great Western
                    Railway, with a view to an increase in speed, and also to obtain a more solid
                    road, on embankments particularly. Instead ofresting the supports of the rails,
                    that is to say, the stone or wood bearings, whether longitudinal or transverse,
                    on the ballasting, where the repairs to the railroad consist in continually
                    packing more ballast under the bearings, as they subside through the weights
                    passing over them, or from the various other causes which affect them, Mr.
                    Brunel has fixed his bearings at certain points, so that they cannot rise up nor
                    go down, whereas in the usual mode of construction, it has only been attempted
                    to prevent them from going down.</p>
                <p>The guage of the Great Western Railway is 7 feet 2½ inches from centre to centre
                    of the rails, and the width be-1 tween the two lines is 6 feet. The mode of
                    construction' is as follows. (See Plate CCCCXX.) At every 15 feet in length
                    along the railway, beech piles are driven into the ground, at 15 feet distance
                    apart, transversely; they are driven from 8 to 10 feet in cuttings, and in
                    embankments, they are in general sufficiently long to go about the same depth
                    into the original ground on which the embankment stands. These piles are formed
                    to the proper length, and driven in, without any being cut off their heads,
                    which are nearly level with the top of the ballasting, and when this cannot be
                    effected, they are drawn and redriven. They do not stand in the middle of each
                    line of rails, as will be seen by referring to the above measures and the plate,
                    but are nearer each outside rail of the two lines.</p>
                <p>To these piles double and single transverse ties, or sleepers, sometimes called
                    transoms, are attached as follows: A square shoulder is cut, 1½ inches into the
                    pile, on one side for the single ties, and on both sides for the double ones;
                    the single ties are 6 inches broad, and 9 inches deep; the double ties are 6
                    inches broad, and 7 inches deep. They are made of American pine, and when let
                    into the shoulders of the piles, they are securely bolted to them; the double
                    ties are 13 inches, and the single ones 9 inches below the line of rails. On
                    these are laid longitudinal timbers, 15 inches broad, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=62" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0062-0052"/>7
                    inches thick; these are also of American pine, and are bolted to the cross ties
                    with screw bolts and washers, the heads of which are countersunk into the
                    longitudinal timbers.</p>
                <p>The entire transverse section is horizontal where the railway is straight, and
                    inclined according to the radius in curves; and when the whole is bolted
                    together, it forms what is in fact a road at fifteen-feet bearings. The line is
                    then ballasted, and the longitudinal bearings are packed in the usual manner
                    with fine sand or gravel, till they are raised in the middle from a half to
                    one-third of an inch; they are then planed to a uniform surface, and a plank of
                    elm, oak, or ash, 1 ½ inches thick, and 8 inches broad, is laid on them, with a
                    copious intervening bed of tar, and nailed down; the heads of the nails being
                    punched in, to allow the plank to be planed; the upper surface of the plank
                    slopes inwards 1 in 20.</p>
                <p>The rails are screwed down to the plank and longitudinal bearer,after the former
                    has been planed; with felt underneath them. The whole of the timber is kyanized,
                    and the joints, butts, bolts, washers, keys, spikes, and nails, also the whole
                    of the longitudinal bearers, are tarred. In fixing the rails, square· headed
                    screws are used outside the rails, and countersunk ones inside, to be clear of
                    the flange of the wheels; the outside screw is first completely tightened and
                    then the inner one, a roller weighing about 10 tons being previously drawn
                    several times along the rail, and followed up closely by the screwing.</p>
                <p>The principle on which the railway is intended to be constructed chiefly consists
                    in the piles being a constant retaining power, holding the road down against the
                    packing, which would otherwise force it up; so that this latter can be driven
                    much harder in than by the ordinary mode. Mr. Brunel is said to calculate that
                    he throws an upward pressure against the base of each longitundinal timber,
                    equal to one ton per foot forward, or about one ton per square foot. He thus
                    obtains 3 tons for every 3 feet length of rail, while a Stoneblock containing
                    4cubiefeet, only weighsaboutaquarter of a ton, which is therefore the pressure
                    with each 3 feet of rail laid in the usual way; neglecting the impact with which
                    the stone block is forced into its seat by the cuddy and lever, a very uncertain
                    quantity, but which perhaps never amounts to, on the whole, less than as 3: 2 in
                    favour of the longitudinal bearings. The timber used in a mile of this railway,
                    is about 420 loads of pine, and 40 loads of hard-wood; these require 6 tons of
                    iron bolts, and 30,000 wood screws. The rails are about 44 lbs. per yard, and
                    the cost of the first portion, laid from London to Maidenhead, including laying,
                    ballasting, sidings, draining, and all other work, is stated at L∙9200 per
                    mile.</p>
                <p>Such is the mode of construction on this railroad, which has so much agitated the
                    minds, not only of the shareholders, but of the whole railway public. This,
                    however, ought not to have been the case, for the matter lies in a very small
                    compass, and a short experiment should have determined it; it is merely a
                    question of expense. The first outlay must, of course, be great, and it is only
                    necessary to know whether the future saving will be commensurate with it. A
                    desire for a greater width of guage seems now gradually gainingground among
                    those best entitled to judge on the subject, and the public will not long rest
                    satisfied with a velocity of twenty miles an hour. Whether Mr. Brunel has taken
                    the right measures to compass these desirable objects, will require much more
                    room to discuss than we have here; but this we know, that the Great Western, for
                    the twenty-three miles now open to the public, is by far the smoothest and
                    easiest line we have ever travelled on.</p>
                <p>F The relative ratio between the motion of the wheels and that of the piston will
                    be much more advantageous at a given velocity as the wheels are large, within
                    certain limits; the greater degree of stability acquired, from the increased
                    width of guage is also desirable, if not carried too far; but we must confess we
                    should ourselves be afraid of jumping from 4 feet 8½ inches, to 7 feet, without
                    more experience. Another company jumped from 2 feet 9 inches to 5 feet in their
                    length of bearing, and the result was sufficiently inauspicious.</p>
                <p>The effect of the diameter of the wheels on the velocity of the piston, may be
                    thus computed:</p>
                <p>Let »= the velocity of the wheels, 4</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">p=</hi> the velocity of the piston, &gt; in feet,</p>
                <p>Z= twice the length of the stroke,; m= the number of miles per hour the engine
                    travels.</p>

                    left the main question as undecided as ever, and present little else but
                    irrelevant matter, or that which contradicts itself. Our inquiry will naturally
                    embrace, first, the reports themselves, and, secondly, the experiments on which
                    they rest.</p>
                <p>The first is Mr. Hawkshaw;s, and this is so completely set at rest in the reply
                    of Mr. Brunel, that no one would require any discussion respecting it. Mr
                    Hawkshaw states that at the risk of being tedious, he has endeavoured to
                    develope the process by which he has arrived at his “opinions,” because he
                    thinks it better that his report should “partake more of the nature of
                    demonstration, than of mere assertion ;” and he then informs us that the Great
                    Western Railway, “has been applauded to the skies as wonderful; it has been
                    derided and run down as little less than nonsensical. Now it is neither one nor
                    the other of these.” He has not furnished any “demonstration” of this fact, and
                    is much less fortunate in another assertion, namely, that on coming first on the
                    Great Western line of railway, that which immediately strikes the attention is
                    the “enlarged capacity of all things.” We have travelled on that line now four
                    times, but are not aware, from our own observation, that all the things which
                    were on it possessed a larger “capacity” than those which we have met on other
                    railways.</p>
                <p>Coming next to the report of Mr. Wood, we find it stated that nearly all the
                    experiments upon which it rests for its foundation, were made both by and under
                    the Superintend-</p>
                <p>, ence of other persons, and the mere dressing them up, a purely arithmetical
                    operation, has alone been performed by Mr. Wood. To those who are at all
                    acquainted with that gentleman’s knowledge of formulae and figures, this would
                    be quite a sufficient intimation of what might be expected; but, in addition to
                    this, hardly any of the experiments are given in the report, and no formulae;
                    and thus the only essential things, from which a right conclusion can be drawn,
                    have been withheld from the shareholders. In the meantime the farce has been
                    played out, and the curtain has fallen.</p>
                <p>We shall not stop to notice such mistakes as, that one ton and a half is to one
                    ton and a quarter as four to three; but proceed to the tabular matter in the
                    report, selected from all the records which have been taken of the various
                    experiments, we presume, as that which was most worthy of being laid before the
                    directors and the public, as a fair statement of the capabilities of the Great
                    Western Railway as compared with others; and it should be remembered that Mr.
                    Wood sets out by laying down a rule that, unless his inquiries were conducted in
                    such a way, as to “elicit by incontrovertible and practical experiments, the
                    relative capabilities of the two systems of forming and constructing railways,”
                    it would “not only be a waste of time, but would be attended with perhaps still
                    worse consequences.”</p>
                <p>The advantages which have been aimed at in the extension of the guage, from 4
                    feet 8 inches, to 7 feet, and in Mr. Brunel’s other alterations, are principally
                    as follows. A greater speed; a decrease of friction, by enlarging the diameter
                    of the wheels; greater stability, by keeping down the centre of gravity, through
                    the body of the carriages being inside the wheels, and not over them, as in
                    other railways. The main objections made to his system, are the increased cost
                    of forming the railway; the greater weight and size of the engines and
                    carriages; the additional friction on curves; the extra cost of construction
                    both in carriages and engines, and the impossibility of a junction with other
                    railways. It is to strike a balance between these that Mr. Wood has produced
                    what he states as “correct and indisputable results.”</p>
                <p>On the question of speed, Mr. Wood decides that the less powerful engines on the
                    ordinary railways go within three miles an hour of the most powerful ones on the
                    Great Western, and he presumes from this, that the more powerful ones would
                    exceed the best of the Great Western engines; the effective power yielded by the
                    former being apparently much greater than that which is obtained from the
                    latter. This very extraordinary statement is attributed to the resistance of the
                    air, which Mr. Wood seems to think a new discovery
                    inrailwaymatters,althoughNewton, Robins, Sroeaton, Hutton, Dalton, Pambour, and
                    others, have given it in print from nearly two hundred years ago up to the
                    present day, and practical men have all along considered its effects on
                    railways, whilst theorists alone have stated it to be of no consequence. It is
                    twelve months since anemometers were planned, and estimates obtained for their
                    erection at the stations along the London and Birmingham railway, by the writer
                    of this article, at the desire of Mr. Bury, who has contracted for the
                    locomotive power on that line. With respect to the speed of the Great Western
                    engines, in consequence of those improvements to be expected in all mere
                    mechanical contrivances, and which the usual engines have been ten years
                    benefittingby, whilst thqse on the Great Western line are yet insufficiently
                    tried, Mr. Brunel states, that since Mr. Wood’s experiments, he has so improved
                    the very engine with which the highest velocity was then attained on those
                    trials, that, all other things being the same, her performance was, and is as

                <p>Mr. Wood, Sept. 1838, 15-9</p>
                <p>Mr. Brunel, Dec. 1838,</p>
                <p>The decrease of friction in large wheels is admitted as well as other
                    conveniences, although it is stated these can be arrived at with a less guage
                    than 7 feet, and 6 inches is given as the maximum increase on the old width
                    requisite for improving the engines. The weight per passenger appears to be the
                    same with the Great Western and the ordinaryrailway carriages, although Mr-Wood
                    states they have l j tons on each wheel, while the ordinary ones have only 1¼.
                    That there is a greater stability and steadiness of motion in the carriages, Mr.
                    Wood denies.</p>
                <p>We have now to examine the tables given in this report, containing the
                    incontrovertible experiments which are presented as affording a foundation for
                    the opinions delivered, and it will be quite sufficient for every purpose of
                    testing their value, if we take those on the deflection of the rails and
                    supports on the Great Western and other railways. These experiments, it appears,
                    were made almost exclusively on the short space of about two miles in the clay
                    cuttings near Paddington, undoubtedly the worst part of the road.</p>
                <p>Mr. Wood states that stone blocks afford decidedly the firmest and most
                    unyielding base, and that between longitudinal bearings, the usual sleepers, and
                    the Great Western plan, not much difference of deflection exists. The weight of
                    the engines not being given, we must chiefly confine our observations to the
                    quantity of deflection produced by the coaches, the weight of which, on one
                    wheel, is as 6 to 5 on the Great Western, compared with other railways.</p>

                <p>the above means, we find that a 60 lb. parallel rail at 45 inches bearing,
                    deflects only ∙026i, while a 62 lb. parallel at 36 inches bearings, deflects
                    ∙03853, and a fish-belly at 36 inches bearing, and 50 lbs. in weight, only
                    deflects ∙03277.</p>
                <p>In the 50 lb. rail upon blocks, at the joint chair, there is more deflection than
                    in the middle of the rail, and about three times as much as at a single chair
                    with the weight of a coach; whereas, in the 60 lb. rail, the deflection is more
                    at the single chair than at the joint, but, in this case also, it is least in
                    the middle of the rail with a coach. In the 62 lb. rail it is also greater at
                    the single than the joint chair, and less in the middle of the rail than at the
                    single chair.</p>
                <p>In the Manchester and Bolton experiments, the rail deflects more than the timbers
                    at the transoms and joints, but in the middle, the timber deflects more than the
                    rail. With the 65 lb. rails, either on sleepers or blocks, the deflection is
                    considerably more, either with an engine or a coach, at the chairs than mid-way
                    between them; and whilst the rail only deflects ∙030l, and the chair which
                    supports it less than half this, namely, 0149; the block which supports the
                    chair deflects five times as much as the chair itself, namely, ∙07l4. These are
                    called incontrovertible experiments.</p>
                <p>In addition to this, Mr. Babbage, no mean authority, who has seen the original
                    records of the experiments, which the report made to the directors does not
                    contain, states in his speech at the meeting of Great Western proprietors, held
                    on the 9th Januaryl839, that with respect to the increased power required
                    through the resistance of the air, that instead of 15 per cent, being necessary
                    to gain an increase of speed of 3 per cent., it turned out that from the use of
                    the same formula, and the same experiment whence Mr. Wood had deduced the above
                    results, that the increased power required was only as 2 to 1, instead of 5 to
                    1, as stated by Mr. Wood.</p>
                <p>It is astonishing to see what mistaken ideas many persons have entertained
                    amongst the proprietors of this railway. One stated that although the resistance
                    of the air might have been known, yet, it was never taken into consideration at
                    such speed as had now been attained in railway travelling. What, then, becomes
                    of the experiments of Robins and Hutton, which upset the ancient parabolic
                    theory of projectiles, and established the present practical system of gunnery;
                    the deduction of these writers were carried up to velocities considerably
                    greater than that in which air can rush into a vacuum, that circumstance forming
                    one great guide in establishing their results.</p>
                <p>Another person wished to know, when such a very great advance had been made by
                    Mr. Brunel in so short a time, by .which, with fully one-third less fuel the
                    load drawn by the North Star engine, was increased from 16 tons to 40, at an
                    increase in velocity also; why the same could not be done with all other engines
                    upon narrower railways, and thus an equal effect produced with a much less
                    costly mode of construction. The simple answer to which is, that on the railways
                    with the original guage, the engines have been made gradually more and more
                    perfect up to their present state; whereas on the Great Western, this has yet to
                    be done. Mr. Brunel, in the above improvement on the North Star, has not made
                    any new discovery in the organization of a locomotive; he has <sic>has</sic>
                    only brought its mode of operation nearer to that which is in action on other
                    lines of railway.</p>
                <p>Other persons have said, that granting Mr. Brunel does obtain the speed and power
                    he has anticipated, his engines will then do too much, that passengers will
                    never be <sic>fouud</sic> to assemble in sufficient numbers to fill such heavy
                    trains, and that consequently all the extra cost of the new system will in the
                    end be thrown away. This argument is no more tenable than the others, and
                    throughout the whole inquiry there appears a lamentable want of nearly every
                    requisite for coming to a right conclusion; even the instruments used in the
                    experiments are inadequate for that which they were intended to shew; of those
                    used to ascertain the motion of the carriages, Mr. Babbage states, that having
                    tried three similar ones of different lengths merely, he could make each of them
                    tell different stories, and whichever he pleased give the greatest result; also
                    that when he tried the very same instrument used in the experiments of Mr. Wood,
                    instead of finding any thing like corresponding measures of the oscillations,
                    his so grossly exceeded those which formed the basis of the report, that they
                    were beyond all magnitude; and after travelling 120 miles in those trials, he
                    came to the conviction that every thing in the shape of an experiment connected
                    with that instrument, must be thrown overboard.</p>
                <p>No inquiry, in fact, could have ended more unsatisfactorily than have these
                    experiments on the Great Western railway; and their records, which should, above
                    all things, together with any formulae used, have accompanied the report, were
                    not published with it. This is the most unfortunate error of all; for as they
                    were chiefly made by other persons, and not by Mr. Wood, they require to be
                    examined, first, as to their correctness as experiments, and secondly, as to how
                    they have been dressed up to produce to the proprietors. In the first case,
                    there might be some little difficulty, but in the second, every proprietor could
                    have judged for himself, and he ought to have had the means put in his hands to
                    do so. Strange to say, too, Mr. Wood has quarrelled with his own report, and
                    declares he made the North Star engine do just the same as Mr. Brunel has done.
                    Why then did he not publish this himself, instead of giving a very different
                    experiment, after placing which in his own report, he blames the directors for
                    sending it forth to the public?</p>
                <p>The whole of the proceedings in this discussion serve to shew, as we have before
                    stated, that it is high time some government measure was brought forward to
                    regulate, at least, the general principles of railways; many persons are afraid
                    of this interference with what is justly considered private rights, but to these
                    we would say, that on several of the leading lines in England, a far worse
                    oligarchy now exists than can be called into operation by any measure of
                    government, thoroughly gifted as it would be in parliament by the numerous
                    members of both houses who are interested so many ways in the right management
                    of these important concerns.</p>
                <p>The result of the Great Western discussion is as follows: The unanimous
                    abandonment of the piles; the substitution of a larger scantling of timber and a
                    heavier rail; and the retention of the w ide guage and continuous bearings. As
                    far as the railway public are concerned, they will be but <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=65" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0065-0055"
                    />little affected by this. The rails are much too light and want <hi
                    rend="superscript">,</hi> depth, and their shape should be the subject of
                    properly conducted experiments. The guage being retained, all the necessary
                    information relative to its efficiency and economy, will, no doubt, in time be
                    made known. The question of longitudinal or transverse bearings is of much less
                    import than is generally imagined. The part of the line on piles between London
                    and Maidenhead, twenty-three miles, if it be retained and kept in good order,
                    will soon set at rest the question of expense in maintaining the way. Thus,
                    then, so far as the public are concerned, all is well; but the effect of this
                    decision on the interests of the proprietors has received no light whatever;
                    there is nothing even to shew that in adopting a heavier rail, there is the
                    slightest necessity also to adopt a greater scantling of timber; and it is
                    extraordinary that a point so easily submitted to experiment and calculation,
                    should have been en tirely passed by in the final report to the proprietors.</p>
                <p>We have hitherto looked principally to the construction of a railway; there is,
                    however, an equally important point to be considered, and that is, the working
                    of it after it has been constructed. On this will mainly hinge the degree of
                    profit which may be expected; for, let all our previous instructions be duly
                    considered and properly followed out, with such deviations only as may be
                    rendered necessary by local circumstances; or let a railway be constructed in
                    the best and most advantageous manner, yet it will soon be discovered that, if
                    it is not worked on a sound and effective system, it will turn out a vastly
                    different speculation to what it would be under proper management-</p>
                <p>For this purpose every thing should centre in one committee of directors; these
                    may with advantage subdivide themselves into smaller bodies, for particular
                    purposes; all business transacted by these subdivisions being merely
                    preparatory, and nothing being finally concluded till brought before the general
                    body. There should be no boards of direction at each end of a line, but that
                    terminus which is best situated to effectually overlook the whole of the various
                    business, should be made choice of for the seat of government. There should be
                    ample inspection into every department, but it should be inspection only; all
                    orders should come from one committee, and through one general head. It may
                    often happen, and always with advantage, that both ends of a railway may be
                    opened before the middle is finished; still every thing should centre at the
                    governing end of the line, at one point; and the mode by which this government
                    should be carried on, must now be considered a little more at large.</p>
                <p>The first question which arises is, by what system can a joint stock company be
                    so managed as to obtain the same amount of alacrity, vigilance, and industry in
                    its service, as characterises the conduct of individuals when acting for
                    themselves, and to combine with these qualities an honest and economical
                    administration. The system of management by boards of directors has stood the
                    test of considerable experience, and, where the proper men are found for
                    directors, this system is admiraoly adapted to answer the primary object of a
                    board, viz. to deliberate and decide on principles. More information and greater
                    variety of view is brought to bear upon a subject when it is discussed by
                    several men, than almost any individual intellect could furnish; and, as
                    joint-stock companies consist of persons in almost all classes of society, a
                    board composed, as it should be, of individuals holding a large amount of stock,
                    and giving their services gratuitously, for that reason, as well as from a sense
                    of public duty, by embodying various interests, claims and secures the
                    confidence of all.</p>
                <p>It is well known, however, that a body consisting of many individuals is utterly
                    unfitted for executive functions. It is admitted as a principle, that executive
                    administration is best and most efficiently exercised by one and one only, and,
                    accordingly, every board, whether of government commissioners, or of joint-stock
                    companies, or of charitable institutions, has some one to whom is entrusted the
                    executive superintendence, and control of that, whatever it be, on which the
                    board exercises its legislative and judicial functions. Connected with this
                    executive are other officers, many or few, exercising a separate jurisdiction
                    over their several departments, and in all details independent, yet held
                    together, for the purposes of combination, by the executive officer.</p>
                <p>In the management of railways, such an officer is more especially required where
                    the heads of departments are necessarily numerous, in consequence of the several
                    branches of business into which the working of a railway is divided; where each
                    department employs a considerable number of men, two alone, those of the police
                    and porters, amounting almost to a regiment, and where all are to be brought to
                    act with the precision and regularity of a steam engine. It would be impossible
                    to produce unity of action amidst such conflicting elements, without a close,
                    active, and unremitting personal superintendence, such as may be accomplished by
                    an individual, but can never be effected by a board.</p>
                <p>Several attempts at a different system of management have been made by railway
                    companies, but they have not been found to answer. A favourite project has been
                    much talked of lately, viz. that a committee of three should be chosen from the
                    body of the directors, in which triumvirate should reside all administrative and
                    executive functions, and so much of the deliberative and judicial as relates to
                    the ordinary affairs of the company, and that each triumvir should receive a
                    salary sufficient to command his whole time for the company’s service, the
                    chairman receiving a higher remuneration than his colleagues. The advocates of
                    this plan contend, that it would first secure unity of action in the principles
                    of management, with prompt execution in the details, a ready redress of
                    grievances, and remedy, or rather prevention of abuses. Secondly, that it would
                    give the personal responsibility of a few to the proprietors, in place of the
                    collective responsibility of many; and, thirdly, that it would keep in check the
                    undue power and influence which, under a different system, the executive
                    officers would be likely to acquire.</p>
                <p>This view appears more plausible than sound, more specious than solid. In the
                    first place, the triumvirate would monopolize the whole power of the company,
                    and the board would go to sleep. The board of which the triumvirate form a part,
                    would meet too seldom and know too little, to be a match for three men, who
                    would act together every day and know every thing, and who, above all, would
                    enter into debate with the larger body, and vote as directors upon questions
                    affecting their own conduct. It has always proved a thoroughly vicious system to
                    have an executive officer a member (as in many boards he is) of that body, whose
                    orders he is to execute, and to whom he ought to be responsible; and this
                    applies to the triumvirate.</p>
                <p>In the second place, the responsibility of each triumvir would merge in the
                    collective responsibility of the whole board, and men would be exercising a
                    power for which, practically, they could not be called to an account; for, when
                    the board had confirmed an act of the triumvirate, what chance would the
                    proprietors have to make them accountable? The results of irresponsible
                    authority, it is well known, are jobbing and every sort of peculation.</p>
                <p>In the third place, it is not likely that three men chosen out of a body of
                    directors, would be the men best fitted for the situations contemplated. Not
                    only is the number out of which they would be chosen too few to present
                    sufficient of the peculiar ability required, but the selection of the
                    individuals would be rather determined by personal predilections than by their
                    fitness. It would be an appointment to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=66" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0066-0056"
                    />be canvassed for, and the men who would take the most pains to get it, would
                    be just those least suitable for it.</p>
                <p>It will be readily seen, also, that under such a triumvirate no really good
                    officer could act. The perpetual meddling with matters they know little about,
                    the jealousy of their authority, and the necessity to be busy in order to give a
                    colour to the notion that they do work, which would inevitably belong to such a
                    body, would disgust an officer who knew his duty and wished to do it, and they
                    would be left to perform the business with none but subordinates. So far, then,
                    from attaining the advantage contended for, a triumvirate committee of
                    management constituted on the above plan, would tend to greater evils than those
                    sought to be remedied by it. The old Navy board, abolished by Sir James Graham,
                    is a case in point: this board was an executive one, and yet subordinate to the
                    admiralty, and the natural consequence followed ;; they were continually working
                    against the orders they received from the superior board, in order to carry out
                    their own plans, not openly, but covertly; there was, in fact, a constant under
                    current of opposition, from which the business of the country notoriously
                    suffered.</p>
                <p>If, indeed, the proprietors of any railway would agree to invest the whole power
                    of management in three commissioners, chosen from the country at large, as the
                    fittest men to be found, making them responsible to the proprietors assembled in
                    general meeting, and assimilating this triumvirate as nearly as possible to a
                    government board, more favourable results might be anticipated than from any
                    other plan; but how should any company get three paid commissioners, who are not
                    proprietors, to look sufficiently closely to the economy, out of which a good
                    dividend should arise?</p>
                <p>The conclusion, then, is, that the present system of direction is, on the whole,
                    the most suitable for managing a concern, whose nature is commercial, and the
                    end of which is the realising of a profit to the proprietors, upon a money
                    investment. A very important principle, however, is too much lost sight of in
                    the composition of boards of directors. The practice is, for the same persons to
                    be selected year after year, till all sense of responsibility to the constituent
                    body is lost, and the board becomes an oligarchy, of a spirit akin to the old
                    self-elected municipal corporations, the members losing year by year their
                    interest and sympathy in the views and feelings of their constituents, and yet
                    prone to consider them as identical with their own.</p>
                <p>For this the appropriate remedy is, periodically a new infusion into the
                    direction from the body of the proprietors, and for w+ich parliament has in most
                    cases provided, by requiring a certain portion of directors to retire every
                    year. If the proprietors give common attention at their general meetings, and
                    are careful to select for directors the fittest men, not allowing the
                    re-election of retiring directors to take place, as a matter of course, they
                    will find their interests as well secured under the system recommended, as they
                    are likely to be under any other, namely, one general board and an efficient
                    executive officer. We should always recommend one thing, which is, that the
                    half-yearly reports should be printed and sent to the proprietors, at least a
                    fortnight before the general meeting.</p>
                <p>If we look back at the rapid progress which we have made <hi rend="superscript"
                    >,</hi> in the science of locomotion during the last half-dozen years, and at
                    the degree of comfort and accommodation ' which, in conjunction with rapidity of
                    transport, have been afforded to the public, at in most cases so very moderate a
                    cost, the strides by which we have attained our present advanced position, are
                    certainly sufficiently gigantic; but if we look forward, it requires but little
                    of the gift of divination to perceive, that in a very few' years more, a still
                    greater change will take place, more particularly in the essential article of
                    comfort. In conducting a mode of transit so essentially new, and in which all
                    our previous machines and appliances had to be completely reorganized, and
                    numerous inventions of almost every kind were to be produced at a moment’s call,
                    to meet the various difficulties and wants which were continually arising out of
                    such a novel mode of conducting the business of travelling in what may be called
                    the wholesale way, it has been singularly fortunate, that in almost every
                    instance, the various railway companies have kept on the safe side, that is to
                    say, they have not done too much. They have erred on the best side they could
                    commit an error on; they have been too cautious. It seems as if it required a
                    certain time merely to travel at twenty miles an hour, and let the mind sober
                    down a little before much else could be attempted. This feeling may now be
                    rapidly expected to give way, and we shall find that as confidence is acquired,
                    all the requisite arrangements will become consolidated in much more perfect and
                    improved forms.</p>
                <p>There is nothing now which ought to be more attended to by railway companies,
                    than keeping their fares down; and this has in most instances been very much
                    neglected. When parties Jlossesssuch a complete monojκ&gt;ly as a railway, they
                    should be particularly careful not to shew it. The expenses in many instances
                    are certainly very great, and the companies have much to suffer in their
                    progress through Parliament, and the rough grinding they have generally received
                    from the rapaciousness of landowners. Accidents, too, must happen, estimates
                    will be exceeded, and these sources of expenditure must be met by a
                    corresponding rate of price; but when the railways are made, the feeling seems
                    to be too general amongst some of these proprietors, that this is the moment for
                    making reprisals ujion the public for all losses, vexations, mishaps and
                    mistakes.</p>
                <p>In some cases railways have charged more for the carriage of passengers than the
                    stages or mails did, trusting to beat them on the question of time only. In part
                    the receipts are great; a certain sum must be set aside for a good dividend, and
                    the rest is to be spent somehow or other. The same thing is observable in the
                    statistics of the road trusts, many of them largely in debt, yet Sjiending their
                    money on fancied improvements, instead of getting out of debt, and then lowering
                    the tolls.</p>
                <p>The effect of this on travelling is fully shewn in the report of the Irish
                    Railway Commission. For instance, the travellers from Brussels to Antwerji by
                    railway in the year 1836 were 872,893, whereas those on the Liverjiool and
                    Manchester Railway for the same year were only 522,991, being the largest number
                    for any year since the opening. Now, the populationofBrussels, Antwerp, and
                    Mechlin was 209,200, whilst that of Liverpool, Manchester, and Warrington was
                    486,812, considerably more than double, or the ratio of population was as 2∙327
                    to 1, whilst that of the travelling was only as ∙599 to 1. We must seek for the
                    solution of this problem in the respective fares of the two companies. In the
                    Liverpool and Manchester Railway, Mr. Pambour states, that there are 13
                    first-class trains to 16 second-class; and as the last class hold most
                    Jiassengers, suppose we omit the <hi rend="smallcaps">. <hi rend="subscript"

                <p>mails, and say---=—^-=4∙6724 shil lings, the average fare. We have no means of
                    ascertaining the numbers on the Brussels railway, but if we take the dearest and
                    cheapest, and compare them in the same ratio as we did the others, we shall have
                    --</p>

                <p>= -θ^Jθ-=2 francs 23 cents per passenger on the average, or about 1∙784
                    shillings, or 4s. 8d. in the one case, and Is. 9¼d. in the other, or, allowing
                    for the value of money in the two countries, about double the price; and this
                    double <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=67"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0067-0057"/>price is accompanied with only one-fourth of the
                    travelling, the ratio of population to that of travelling being very nearly 4 to
                    1. A still stronger case is that of the Paisley canal, where the fly-boat fare
                    is Id. per mile. Here, with a population of 262,725, the passengers in 1835 were
                    373,290, whilst in the same year, with a population of 486,812, the Liverpool
                    and Manchester railway had only 473,849 passengers. The railway company from
                    Paris to St. Germain’s has tried the experiment of low prices with complete
                    success; their greatest reduction of fares was at the station of Nanterre, where
                    they were lowered from 7½d. to 5d., and the result was, that twelve days, ending
                    the 4th December 1838, at the low fares, compared with twelve days ending
                    November 22, at the high ones, shewed an increase of 839 passengers; and
                    although the diminution in price was 34 per cent., the increase in the amount
                    received was 16½ per cent. We therefore strongly recommend that fares should be
                    moderate, or it will form the best plea in the world for the establishment of
                    competing lines; and it should be remembered that railways will to a certain
                    extent drive vans and waggons off the road, which were the ordinary vehicles for
                    the travelling poor, and they ought to have a substitute, if it were merely an
                    open box without seats. Soldiers are generally conveyed at Id. each per mile,
                    and their baggage at 3d. per ton per mile; this is less than half what is
                    charged on some railways in second-class carriages.</p>
                <p>The general system of working a line, which we have here <hi rend="superscript"
                    >l</hi> laid down, is that which is adapted for a first-rate railway. On
                    secondary lines it will perhaps be necessary to place several of the departments
                    under one person’s superintendence, instead of having a head to each; but as
                    this would be merely on the score of lessening expenditure, it should not be
                    resorted to without there is a rigid necessity for it. On short lines this
                    necessity will exist. When this is the case, one person might take the coaching
                    department, goods’ department, and the police, porters, and guards; the
                    disbursement clerk might be dispensed with; one engineer might take the
                    locomotive department, the construction and repairing department, and also the
                    maintenance of the way, having good foremen in each case. But it is so much
                    better to have a responsible head in every department, that we should always
                    recommend that course to be adopted whenever it is practicable, that is to say,
                    whenever the income of the company will allow it. It may, however, well deserve
                    consideration, in every railway establishment, whether, at each of the stations
                    of every kind, it would not save a considerable expense to have the porters, or
                    a part of them, sworn in as police, so that they might on occasion act in either
                    capacity. Attention to the number of entrance and exit gates, in planning out
                    the stations, will also conduce to economy, as each of these will in general
                    require an attendant policeman. There are numerous other means by which, in the
                    middling and smaller class of railways, a moderate expenditure as well as a good
                    arrangement, may be combined; but so much depends on the localities, together
                    with the nature and extent of the traffic, that nothing definitive can be
                    pointed out, except from a careful consideration of these; and the best step
                    which the directors of all railways can take previous to forming any system
                    whatever, is to consult a properly qualified and experienced person, both as to
                    general principles and as to details.</p>
                <p>EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES.</p>
                <p>Plate CCCCXX. fig. I, is a plan of a sliding rail and eccentric for a crossing or
                    siding place. The eccentric being attached by rods to the sliding rails (which
                    move on a joint at the opposite end) draws them to either line, as required.</p>
                <p>Fig. 2 is a longitudinal, and fig. 3 a transverse section of the same.</p>
                <p>Fig. 4 shews a plan and section of a fixed point.</p>
                <p>Fig. 5 shews the general arrangement of the whole of the preceding figures, to
                    form a complete crossing.</p>
                <p>Fig. 6 is a plan, fig. 7 a longitudinal, and fig. 8 a transverse section of the
                    mode of laying the blocks, sleepers, and rails in an excavation, together with
                    the ballasting, and an approved method of drainage. The blocks are shewn as laid
                    diagonally in the manner they have been on the London and Birmingham Railway.
                    The drains are of brick.</p>
                <p>Plate CCCCXXI. fig. 1, is a mail carriage, as at present used, with its

                <p>Plate CCCCXXΠ. fig. 1, shews a close second-class carriage, with brakes which are
                    worked by the handle at the top of the right hand end.</p>
                <p>Fig. 2 is α plan of the buffer and drawing apparatus for the first and
                    second-class carriages, and the mails.</p>
                <p>Fig. 3 is a third-class carriage, and fig. 4 a plan of the drawing apparatus. In
                    these carriages there are no buffer springs, but merely blocks at each end of
                    the body. On some railways, the second-class carriages shewn here are not used,
                    but the third-class, with the addition of a roof, is called the second-class.
                    When this is the case, the ends are generally closed, but the sides are left
                    open.</p>
                <p>Fig. 5 shews a different form of buffing apparatus used on the Dublin and
                    Kingston Railway; the buffer rod goes the whole length of the carriage, having a
                    similar head and spring at the other end.</p>
                <p>Plate CCCCXXIII. figs. I and 2, are an end and side view of an approved earth
                    waggon; and figs. 3 and 4 shew another which has been very generally adopted.
                    The brakes are shewn in both.</p>

                <p>The lower part of the boiler has a number of brass tubes running along its whole
                    length, through which the flame and hot air rush in their passage to the
                    chimney, up which the steam, after it has performed its office in the cylinders,
                    is thrown through an iron pipe called the blast pipe. This is one of the most
                    essential of all the improvements of the locomotive. The boiler is cased with
                    wood, to preserve the heat as much as possible; its tubes last about two years,
                    and cost about L.l each.</p>
                <p>The steam pipe, by which the steam is conveyed to the cylinders, is divided into
                    two after it enters the smoke-box, and one goes to each cylinder; these are all
                    made of copper, and the entrance and exit of the steam into the cylinder is
                    regulated by slide valves worked by eccentrics on the cranked axle, which move
                    levers fixed to the weigh bars. The pistons are formed of metal rings in several
                    divisions, so placed as to break joint. The piston rod is fixed with a joint to
                    the connecting rod; and this last gives motion to the cranked axle, having its
                    end next the piston rod fixed to the cross heads, each end of which work in
                    guide blocks, thus causing a parallel motion in the piston rod.</p>
                <p>The cranks are placed at right angles to each other, to enable the engine to get
                    over her centres; one piston thus works at the greatest advantage, when the
                    other is at the least. By the eccentrics on the crank axle, and a series of
                    levers, the slide valves are continually worked backwards and forwards with the
                    engine, and this motion can be reversed instantly, so as to cause the engine to
                    go in the opposite direction when required; this is done by means of the long
                    handle near the fire box, which moves against an arc having three notches in it;
                    when the handle is placed in the upper or lower notch, the engine goes either
                    forward or backward, and when in the middle, the slide valves no longer work.
                    There are many modes by which this is arrived at by different makers, and there
                    is generally two starting handles, by pulling which the slides can be worked by
                    hand; these are constantly in motion while the engine is going.</p>
                <p>Proper cups containing oil are placed over each of the working parts, so as to
                    ensure a steady and constant supply of oil to every moving portion of the
                    engine. These cups have a tube inside them, which leads through to the part
                    which is intended to be supplied with oil. and a cotton wick is put through the
                    tube, one end of which hangs over the top into the oil cup, “and thus acts as a
                    syphon. The axle boxes are filled with grease, and have a cover on the top to
                    ensure a proper lubrication of the axles.</p>
                <p>Inside bearings are often used to strengthen the engine, and ensure its correct
                    action; they also steady the cranked axle against the horizontal force of the
                    piston rods. The whistle is formed by a pipe through which the steam is allowed
                    to pass at pleasure, by turning a cock; it then rushes against the thin edge of
                    the upper domed part, which is hollow like a bell, and gives out a clear sound
                    when the cock is properly turned, which may be heard at a very great

                <p>The buffers consist of leather cushions stuffed with horse hair, and their use is
                    to break the shock arising from any concussion which the engine may receive.
                    Each of the wheels has a cover, called a splasher, I∣laced over them, to prevent
                    their throwing the dirt from the rails into the machinery. Sometimes two pair of
                    wheels are coupled together; this gives more adhesion, and is generally done to
                    goods’ engines only, which also have usually their wheels of less diameter than
                    those used <hi rend="italic">for</hi> passenger trains, velocity being not so
                    much an object as power of draught. JVIr. Stephenson does not now make his
                    engines with any flanges on the middle pair of wheels. (n. H.)</p>
