                <p><label type="entry">RUDDIMAN</label> Thomas, one of the most eminent grammarians
                    which Scotland has produced, was born in October 1674, at Raggel, in the parish
                    of Boyndie and county of Banff’. His father, James Ruddiman, was a farmer, and
                    strongly attached to the house of Stuart.</p>
                <p>Mr Ruddiman was instructed in the principles of Latin grammar at the parish
                    school of Boyndie, where his application was so vigorous, and his progress so
                    rapid, that he quickly surpassed all his class-fellows. His master, George
                    Morrison, who was a skilful and attentive teacher, being unwilling to check his
                    ardour for learning, permitted him to follow the impulse of his genius, and to
                    advance without waiting the slow progress of the other boys.</p>
                <p>The pleasure which the youthful mind receives from vivid description, though wild
                    and romantic, approaches to ecstasy, and often makes an impression which remains
                    indelible. Whilst at school, the first book which charmed the opening mind of
                    Ruddiman was Ovid’s Metamorphoses; nor did he cease to relish the beauties of
                    this author when his judgment was mature, for during the rest of his life Ovid
                    was his favourite poet.</p>
                <p>At the age of sixteen he became anxious to pursue his studies at the university;
                    but his father thinking him too young, opposed his inclination. Hearing of the
                    competition trial which was annually held at King’s College, Aberdeen, for a
                    certain number of bursaries on the foundation of that university, Ruddiman’s
                    ambition was kindled. Without the knowledge of his father, and with only a
                    single guinea in his pocket, which his sister had privately given him, he set
                    out for that place. On the road he was met by a company of gipsies, who robbed
                    him of his coat, his shoes, his stockings, and his guinea. But this misfortune
                    did not damp his enterprising spirit. He continued his journey to Aberdeen,
                    presented himself before the professors as a candidate; and, though he had
                    neither clothes to give him a decent appearance, nor friends to recommend him,
                    he gained the first prize.</p>
                <p>After attending the university for four years, he obtained the degree of master
                    of arts, an honour of which he was always proud. The thesis says, the
                    disputation on this occasion lasted <hi rend="italic">ab aurora usque ad
                    vesperum,</hi> that is, “from morning till night.” Though Ruddiman was only
                    twenty years of age when he left the university, it appears from a book entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Rhetoricorum Libri tres,</hi> composed before this period, but
                    never published, that he had then read the Roman classics with uncommon
                    attention and advantage.</p>
                <p>He was soon after engaged as a tutor to the son of Mr Robert Young of Auldbar,
                    the great grandson of Sir Peter Young, who under the direction of Buchanan had
                    been preceptor of James VI. His income here must have been very small, or his
                    situation unpleasant; for within a year he accepted the office of schoolmaster
                    in the parish of Laurencekirk. The profession of schoolmaster in a country
                    parish at that period could not open any field for ambition, nor any prospect of
                    great emolument; for by an act of parliament passed in 1633, the salary
                    appropriated to this office could not be increased above 200 merks Scotch, or
                    L.ll. 2s. 2|d. sterling. In discharging the duties of this humble but important
                    station, it is probable that he used Simson’s <hi rend="italic">Rudimenta
                    Grammatica,</hi> which was then generally taught in the northern schools, and by
                    which he himself had been instructed in the principles of Latin grammar.</p>
                <p>When Ruddiman had spent three years and a half in this employment, the celebrated
                    Dr Pitcairne happening to pass through Laurencekirk, was detained in that
                    village by a <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=529"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0529-0517"/>violent storm. Pitcaime wanting amusement,
                    inquired at the hostess if she could procure any agreeable companion to bear him
                    company at dinner. She replied, that the schoolmaster, though young, was said to
                    be learned, and, though modest, she was sure he could talk. Pitcairne was
                    delighted with the conversation and learning of his new companion, invited him
                    to Edinburgh, and promised him his patronage.</p>
                <p>When Ruddiman arrived in Edinburgh, the Advocates Library, which had been founded
                    eighteen years before by Sir George Mackenzie, attracted his curiosity and
                    attention, and he was soon afterwards appointed assistant-keeper under Mr
                    Spottiswoode the principal librarian. His salary for executing this laborious
                    office was L.8. 6s. 8d. He had, besides, a small honorary present from those who
                    were admitted advocates, for correcting their theses; and he was also paid for
                    copying manuscripts for the use of the library. The faculty, however, before he
                    had held the office two years, were so highly pleased with his conduct, that
                    they made him a present of fifty pounds Scotch, or L.4. 3s. 4d. sterling.</p>
                <p>During the sitting of the Court of Session he attended the library from ten till
                    three. But this confinement did not prevent him from engaging in other laborious
                    duties. A part of his time was occupied in teaching young gentlemen the Latin
                    language. Some he attended at their lodgings, some waited upon him, and some
                    resided in his own house. An exact list of the names of those who attended him,
                    expressing the date of their entry, and the sums which he was to receive from
                    each, has been found in his pocketbook, a curious relic, which is still
                    preserved.</p>
                <p>When Ruddiman’s merit as a scholar became better known, his assistance was
                    anxiously solicited by those who were engaged in literary publications.
                    Freebairne, a respectable bookseller of that period, prevailed upon him to
                    correct and prepare for the press Sir Robert Sibbald’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introductio ad historiam rerum a Romanis gestarum in ea Borealis Britannia
                    parte qua ultra murum Picticum est.</hi> For his labour he received L.3
                    sterling. At the request of Mr Spottiswoode, librarian, he contributed for L.5
                    sterling his aid to the publication of Sir Robert Spottiswoode’s Practiques of
                    the Laws of Scotland.</p>
                <p>In 1707 he commenced auctioneer, an employment not very suitable to the dignified
                    character of a man of letters. But to this occupation he was probably impelled
                    by necessity; for upon balancing his accounts at the end of the preceding year,
                    the whole surplus was L.28. 2s. with prospects of L.236. 7s. 6d. Scotch.
                    Ruddiman had a family, and seems to have been a stranger to that foolish pride
                    which has seduced some literary men into the opinion, that it is more honourable
                    to starve than have recourse to an occupation which men of rank and opulence are
                    accustomed to despise. The same year he published an edition of <hi
                    rend="italic">Voluseni de Animi Tranquillitate Diatogus,</hi> to which he
                    prefixed the life of Volusenus. Volusenus or Wilson was a learned Scotchman, and
                    had the honour to be patronized by Cardinal Wolsey. In 1709 he published <hi
                    rend="italic">Johnstoni Cantici Solomonis Paraphrasis Poetica,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Johnstoni Cantica</hi> with notes, which he dedicated in verse to
                    his friend and patron Dr Pitcairne. The edition consisted of two hundred copies.
                    The expense of printing amounted to L.5. 10s. sterling, and he sold them at a
                    shilling each copy.</p>
                <p>The philological talents of Ruddiman were next directed to a more important
                    object, in which they became more conspicuous and useful. Freebairne the
                    bookseller proposed to publish a new edition of the Scottish translation of
                    Virgil's AEneid by Gawin Douglas, bishop of Dunkeld. Of the contributions which
                    some eminent characters of the age presented, the most valuable were supplied by
                    Ruddiman. Freebairne acknowledged in general terms this obligation, but has not
                    done him the justice to inform the reader what these valuable contributions
                    were, and Ruddiman’s modesty restrained him from publicly asserting his claim.
                    From the pocket-book which has been already mentioned, it appears that Ruddiman
                    corrected the work and wrote the glossary; and there is strong reason to believe
                    that he was the author of the forty-two general rules for assisting the reader
                    to understand the language of Douglas. To those who wish to be acquainted with
                    the ancient language of this island, the glossary will be a treasure, as it
                    forms a compendious dictionary of the Anglo-Saxon. For this elaborate work
                    Ruddiman was allowed L.8. 6s. 8d. sterling.</p>
                <p>The reputation of Ruddiman had now extended to a distance. He was invited by the
                    magistrates of Dundee to be rector of the grammar-school of that town; but the
                    faculty of advocates, anxious to retain him, augmented his salary to L.30. 6s.
                    8d. sterling, and he declined the offer.</p>
                <p>In 1711 he assisted Bishop Sage in publishing Drummond of Ilawthornden’s works;
                    and performed the same favour to Dr Abercrombie, who was then preparing for the
                    press his Martial Achievements. In 1713 he was deprived of his friend Dr
                    Pitcairne. On this occasion he testified all the respect which friendship could
                    inspire to the memory of his deceased patron and surviving family. He composed
                    Pitcairne’s epitaph, and conducted the sale of his library, which was disposed
                    of to Peter the Great of Russia.</p>
                <p>In 1714 the Rudiments of the Latin Tongue were published. Eighteen or nineteen
                    Latin grammars, composed by Scotchmen, had appeared before this period; yet such
                    is the intrinsic value of this little treatise, that it soon superseded all
                    other books on the subject, and is now taught in all the grammar-schools in
                    Scotland. It has also been translated into other languages.</p>
                <p>He was next called upon to publish the works of Buchanan. The value of these he
                    enhanced by an elaborate preface, his <hi rend="italic">Tabula Regum Scotiae
                    Chronologica</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Propriorum Nominum Interpretatio.</hi>
                    The interpretation of proper names was highly requisite; for Buchanan has so
                    disguised them in the Roman dress, that the original name is scarcely
                    discernible; and the preface puts the reader on his guard against the
                    chronological errors and factious spirit of the history. Ruddiman also added a
                    learned dissertation, entitled <hi rend="italic">De Metris Buchananais
                    Libellus,</hi> and subjoined annotations critical and political on the History
                    of Scotland. As he espoused the cause of Queen Mary, he raised against himself a
                    host of enemies, and gave occasion to that celebrated controversy which has been
                    carried on with much keenness and animosity, and with little intermission, even
                    to the present times. For this work Ruddiman was promised L.40 sterling.</p>
                <p>He had now been so long accustomed to superintend the press, that he was led to
                    form the plan of erecting a printing-office himself. Accordingly, in the year
                    1715, he commenced printer in partnership with his brother Walter, who had been
                    regularly bred to the business; and some years afterwards he was appointed
                    printer to the university, along with James Davidson, bookseller.</p>
                <p>The first literary society formed in Scotland was instituted in the year 1718. It
                    probably derived its origin from the factious and turbulent spirit of the times.
                    The learned, anxious perhaps to find some respite from the political dissensions
                    of the day, endeavoured to procure it in elegant amusement; for one of the
                    fundamental articles of the new association was, that the “affairs of church and
                    state should not be introduced.” Ruddiman and the masters of the high school had
                    the honour to found this society. They were afterwards joined by Lord
                    Karnes.</p>
                <p>In 1725 was published the first part of his <hi rend="italic">Grammatica Latina
                    Institutiones,</hi> which treated of etymology. The second part, which explained
                    the nature and principles of syntax, appeared in 1731. He also wrote a third
                    part on prosody, which is said to be more copious and correct than <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=530"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0530-0518"/>any other publication on the subject. When urged
                    to give it to the public, he said dryly, “The age has so little taste, that the
                    sale would not pay the expense.” Of this work he published an abridgment, to
                    which he subjoined an extract of his prosody.</p>
                <p>Ruddiman next engaged in the management of a newspaper, an employment for which
                    his genius and industry seemed to render him well qualified. But those who
                    should expect either much information or amusement from this publication, would
                    perhaps be greatly disappointed. The newspaper which he conducted was the
                    Caledonian Mercury, and was established in 1720, by William Rolland, a lawyer.
                    Ruddiman acted only for five years in the capacity of printer; but upon the
                    death of Mr Rolland in 1729, the property was transferred to him, or to his
                    brother Walter and him conjunctly. This paper continued in the family of
                    Ruddiman till the year 1772, when it was sold by the trustees of his
                    grandchildren. The Caledonian Mercury was at first printed three times a week,
                    on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, in a small quarto of four pages, with two
                    columns in each page, and fifty lines in each column; so that the whole paper
                    contained only four hundred lines.</p>
                <p>Mr Ruddiman, after the death of Mr Spottiswoode, librarian, remained for some
                    time in his former station; but he was at length appointed keeper of the
                    library, though without any increase of salary; and some years afterwards Mr
                    Goodal, the defender of Queen Mary, succeeded him in the office of
                    sub-librarian.</p>
                <p>The assiduous application of Ruddiman, supported by such learning, was entitled
                    to wealth, which now indeed flowed upon him in what was at that period deemed
                    great abundance. On the lst of October 1735, it appeared, from an exact
                    statement of his affairs, that he was worth L.1882. 5s. 2d. sterling; and on the
                    20th of May the ensuing year his wealth had increased to L.1985. 6s. 3d.
                    sterling. In 1710 he had valued his effects at L.24. l4s. 9d. sterling.</p>
                <p>In 1737 the schoolmasters and teachers in Edinburgh formed themselves into a
                    society, in order to establish a fund for the support of their widows and
                    children. Of this scheme Ruddiman was an active promoter, and was chosen
                    treasurer. Perhaps it was this association which in 1742 gave to the Scotch
                    clergy the idea of forming their widows’ fund.</p>
                <p>In 1739 he published <hi rend="italic">Selectus Diplomatum et Numismatum Scoticae
                    Thesaurus.</hi> This work was projected and begun by Anderson, and hence called
                    Anderson’s <hi rend="italic">Diplomata,</hi> but was finished by Ruddiman. The
                    preface, w <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> hich is an excellent commentary on
                    Anderson’s performance, was written by Ruddiman, and displays a greater extent
                    of knowledge than any of his other productions.</p>
                <p>As Ruddiman had imbibed from his father those political principles which attached
                    him to the family of Stuart, he probably did not remain an unconcerned spectator
                    of the civil commotions which, in 1745, agitated Scotland. He did not, however,
                    take any active part in the rebellion. His principles, he has been heard to say,
                    induced him to be a quiet subject and a good citizen. He retired to the country
                    during the summer of 1745; and whilst his fellow-citizens were spilling each
                    other’s blood, he was more happily engaged in writing Critical Observations on
                    Burmann’s Commentaries on Lucan’s <hi rend="italic">Phαrsαlia.</hi> The
                    Caledonian Mercury was in the mean time marked with a jealous eye. His son, who
                    had for some time been the principal manager of that newspaper, having copied
                    from an English paper a paragraph which was reckoned seditious, was imprisoned.
                    The solicitation of his father procured his release; but it was too late, for
                    the unhappy young man had contracted a distemper in the tolbooth of Edinburgh
                    which brought him to a premature grave.</p>
                <p>During the last seventeen years of his life, Ruddiman was almost incessantly
                    engaged in controversy. To this he was in some measure compelled by the violent
                    attacks which some critics of the times had successively made upon his works. He
                    was first called upon by Benson, auditor in the exchequer, to determine the
                    comparative merit of Buchanan and Johnson as poets. He gave a decided preference
                    to Buchanan in perspicuity, purity, and variety of style; but, like a candid
                    critic, allowed Johnson to be superior in the harmony of his numbers. His next
                    antagonist was Logan, one of the ministers of Edinburgh, a weak and illiterate
                    man, but an obstinate polemic. The subject of contest was, whether the crown of
                    Scotland was strictly hereditary, and whether the birth of Robert III. was
                    legitimate. Ruddiman maintained the affirmative in both points, and certainly
                    far surpassed his antagonist in the powers of reasoning. He proved the
                    legitimacy of Robert by the public records of the kingdom, with a force of
                    argument which admits of no reply; but in discussing the first question, by
                    which he was led to consider the contest between Bruce and Baliol, he was not so
                    successful; for there are many instances in the history of Scotland in which the
                    brother succeeded to the crown in preference to the son. He showed, however,
                    that the Scottish crown was at no period properly elective; and that, according
                    to the old licentious constitution of the kingdom, the right of Bruce, who was
                    the nearest in blood to the royal stock, was preferable to the claim of Baliol,
                    though descended from the eldest daughter.</p>
                <p>But the labours of Ruddiman did not end when the pen dropt from the feeble hand
                    of Logan. He was soon called upon to repel the attacks of Love, schoolmaster of
                    Dalkeith, who maintained, in opposition to him, that Buchanan had neither
                    repented of his treatment of Queen Mary, nor had been guilty of ingratitude to
                    that princess. That Buchanan ever repented there is reason to doubt. Whether he
                    was guilty of ingratitude, let the unbiassed determine, when they are assured by
                    authentic records that Mary conferred on him a pension for life of five hundred
                    pounds Scotch.</p>
                <p>When Ruddiman had arrived at his eightieth year, and was almost blind, he was
                    assailed by James Man, master of an hospital at Aberdeen, with a degree of
                    rancour and virulence, united with some learning and ability, which must have
                    touched him in a sensible manner, and alarmed his fears for his reputation after
                    his decease. He was called a finished pedant, a furious calumniator, and a
                    corrupter of Buchanan’s works. The venerable old man again put on his armour,
                    entered the lists, and gained a complete victory. Man, with all his acuteness,
                    could only point out twenty errors in two folio volumes. Some of these were
                    typographical, some trifling, and some doubtful. Ruddiman, with much pleasantry,
                    drew up against Man an account of four hundred and sixty-nine errors, consisting
                    of fourteen articles, of which two or three may be produced as a specimen: 1.
                    Falsehoods and prevarications, twenty; 2. absurdities, sixty-nine; and, 3.
                    passages from classical authors which were misunderstood by Man, ten. The
                    triumph which he gained over this virulent adversary he did not long enjoy, for
                    he died at Edinburgh on the 19th of January 1757, in the eighty-third year of
                    his age, and was buried in the Greyfriars churchyard, without any monument to
                    distinguish his grave. He was three times married, but left behind him only one
                    daughter, Alison, who was married in 1747 to Mr James Stewart. He is supposed to
                    have died worth L.3000 sterling.</p>
                <p>He was of the middle size, of a thin and straight make, and had eyes remarkably
                    piercing. Of his talents and learning his works afford the most satisfactory
                    proofs. His memory w as tenacious and exact; and he was so great a master in the
                    Latin language that he has perhaps been equalled by none since the days of
                    Buchanan.</p>
                <p>Ruddiman has left a character unstained by vice and distinguished by many
                    virtues. His piety was exemplary <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=531" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0531-0519"
                    />He spent Sunday in religious employment, and, we are informed, had prayers
                    read to him every morning by his amanuensis when the infirmities of age rendered
                    such an assistance necessary. He was frugal of his time, neither indolent nor
                    fond of amusement, and so remarkably temperate, that it is said he was never
                    intoxicated. Though often forced into controversy, and treated with insolence,
                    he never descended to scurrility, nor cherished resentment against his enemies.
                    His candour was much admired in one instance, in the favourable character, which
                    he published in the Caledonian Mercury, of his antagonist Love after his
                    decease. Upon the whole, it must be allowed that Ruddiman has been of great
                    service to classical literature, and an honour to his native country.</p>
