                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">About</hi> the fifth century, a horde of those nations that
                    roved at large on the banks of the Dnieper and the Volkhof, established
                    themselves in that part of the region bordering on the Dnieper, where is now
                    situated the government of Kief or Kiow. These people were called Slavi, or
                    Slavonians, and had advanced eastward from the shores of the Danube. They appear
                    to have laid the first foundation of the Russian monarchy, and to have built
                    Kief, where they fixed their capital. It is probable that about the same time
                    another tribe of Slavi had settled still farther to the east, in the province of
                    Novgorod, where they built the city still known by that name, as their
                    metropolis. Of the government and transactions of these people we have no
                    regular accounts till the conclusion of the ninth century. It appears, however,
                    from a work of the Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenneta on the administration of
                    the empire, that in his time the city of Novgorod was a place of great
                    importance, and carried on an extensive commerce, both with Constantinople and
                    the countries bordering on the Baltic. The government of the Novgorodians
                    appears to have been republican, but the people were probably rather merchants
                    than warriors. We find them involved in frequent disputes with the neighbouring
                    nations, from whose ravages they suffered considerable losses.</p>
                <p>If we may credit the Russian historians, the Slavi that had settled about Kief
                    and Novgorod must have extended the boundaries of their territory northwards as
                    far as the shores of the Baltic. We find that they were much harassed by a
                    piratical nation who dwelt on the coasts of that sea, and were denominated
                    Varages or Varagians, and who made frequent descents on the Russian coasts, and
                    ravaged the country. It is not improbable that these Varagians formed a part of
                    the Scandinavian nations who, under the names of Danes and Saxons, successively
                    made themselves masters of England. They were occasionally employed by the
                    weaker neighbouring states as mercenary auxiliaries, and in this capacity they
                    were once called to the assistance of the Novgorodians. The auxiliaries, after
                    having overcome the enemies whom they were invited to combat, began to think of
                    availing themselves of the advantages which their bravery had given them over
                    their employers. From allies and servants they soon became the masters of the
                    Slavi; and finding the country about Novgorod superior to that which they had
                    left, they resolved to take up their residence in their new quarters.</p>
                <p>Their leader Ruric built, near the Volkhof, a town whose site is now called Old
                    Ladoga. Here he established the seat of his government. The event appears to
                    have taken place about the year 860; and from this period we may date the
                    commencement of the Russian monarchy. Ruric was assisted by two other chiefs of
                    the Varages, Sinaus and Truvor, who are supposed to have been his brothers, and
                    with whom he divided the territory of which he had possessed himself. Of these,
                    Sinaus took up his residence at Bielo Osero, or the White Lake; while Truvor
                    kept his court at Isborsk, or, according to some, at Twertzog, in the district
                    of Pleskow. The three chiefs having thus divided among them the territories of
                    the Novgorodians, continued to reign in amity with each other for several
                    years.</p>
                <p>The Slavi, however, did not immediately submit to the dominion of their new
                    masters. They flew to arms, and chose for their leader Vadim, who by his feats
                    in war had acquired the honourable appellation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >valiant.</hi> A fierce engagement took place between the Novgorodians and the
                    Varages, which ended in favour of the latter, and the brave</p>
                <p>Vadim, with several other chiefs of the Novgorodians, lost their lives in the
                    attempt to free their country from its ambitious guests. This new success
                    emboldened Ruric to extend his territories, and to change the seat of government
                    from the insignificant town of Ladoga, to the spacious and opulent city of
                    Novgorod. Soon after, by the death of his partners in sovereignty, he became
                    sole monarch of the conquered territory, where he reigned without further
                    molestation for seventeen years, and became the primogenitor of a long line of
                    descendants, who held the throne without interruption for several centuries. He
                    appears to have been zealous for the strict administration of justice in his
                    dominions, and issued his command to all the boyars, or nobles, who held
                    territories under him, in order to see it exercised in an exact and uniform
                    manner. Ruric assumed the title of grand prince. His dominions extended over the
                    present governments of Riga, Revel, Polotsk, Pscov, Vyborg, St Petersburg,
                    Novgorod, Smolensk, Olonetz, Archangel, Vladimir, Yaroslavl, Kostroma, and
                    Vologda.</p>
                <p>As Ruric left only one son, Igor, who was still a minor at his father’s death,
                    Oleg, a kinsman of the deceased monarch, took upon him the administration of
                    affairs. Either from the natural restlessness of the Varages, or from the spirit
                    of rebellion manifested by the Novgorodians, which indicated the necessity of
                    employing his people on some active enterprise, the new ruler did not long
                    remain idle. He appears very early to have projected the extension of his
                    territories, by annexing to them the settlement which the Slavi had formed about
                    Kief, against which he soon undertook a formidable expedition. Collecting a
                    numerous army, composed of Slavi, Varages, and Tschudes (a Finnish tribe
                    dwelling in districts embraced in the modern governments of Pscov and ReveD, he
                    carried with him the young prince Igor, and opened the campaign with the capture
                    of Lubitch, and of Smolensk the capital of the Krivitsches.</p>
                <p>Having advanced near the walls of Kief, he did not think it advisable to hazard
                    an open attack. He therefore had recourse to artifice, and leaving behind him
                    the greater part of his troops, he concealed the remainder in the barks that had
                    brought them down the Dnieper from Smolensk. He himself, disguising his name and
                    quality, passed for a merchant sent by Oleg and his ward Igor on business of
                    importance to Constantinople; and he despatched officers to Oskhold and Dir, the
                    two chieftains of the Kievians, requesting permission to pass through their
                    territory into Greece, and inviting them to visit him as friends and
                    fellow-citizens, pretending that indisposition prevented him from paying his
                    respects to them in person. The princes, free from mistrust, accepted Oleg’s
                    invitation, and scarcely thought it necessary to take with them their ordinary
                    attendants. They were soon undeceived; for when they arrived at the regent’s
                    encampment, they were quickly surrounded by the Varagian soldiers, who sprung
                    from their place of concealment in the barks. Oleg taking Igor in his arms, and
                    casting on the sovereigns of Kief a fierce and threatening look, exclaimed, “You
                    are neither princes nor of the race of princes; behold the son of Ruric.” These
                    words, which formed the signal that had been agreed on, were no sooner uttered,
                    than his soldiers rushed on the two princes, and laid them prostrate at the feet
                    of their master. The inhabitants of Kief, thrown into consternation by this bold
                    and treacherous act, made no resistance, but opened the gates of their city to
                    their invader; and thus the two Slavonian states were united under one head.</p>
                <p>Having thus made himself master of the key to the eastern <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=540" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0540-0528"
                    />empire, Oleg prepared to carry into effect his ambitious designs against
                    Constantinople. Leaving Igor at Kief, he himself embarked on the Dnieper with
                    eighty-thousand warriors, on board of not fewer than two thousand vessels. Their
                    passage down the river met with no obstruction, till they came to that part
                    where its course is embarrassed for nearly fifteen leagues by seven rocks; and
                    here began a series of perils, labours, and fatigues, which none but barbarians
                    could have overcome. They were obliged to unload their barks, and convey them
                    over the rocks; and, in particular, at the fourth rock, they carried their
                    baggage for above six thousand paces, exposed to the perpetual risk of attack
                    from the neighbouring nations with whom they were at war, while thus hampered
                    and encumbered. Having at length reached the mouth of the Dnieper, Oleg drew
                    together his scattered vessels to be repaired, and waited for a favourable wind
                    to carry him across the Black Sea to the mouth of the Dniester. Here the vessels
                    were again refitted, and hence the expedition, coasting along the shores of the
                    Euxine, soon arrived at the Strait of Constantinople.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of the imperial city, on discovering the approach of the
                    barbarians, had drawn a massy chain across the harbour, thus hoping to prevent
                    their landing. In this hope, however, they were deceived. The invaders drew
                    ashore their barks, fitted wheels to their flat bottoms, and converted them into
                    carriages, which by the help of sails they forced along the roads that led to
                    the city, and thus arrived under the walls of Constantinople. In their route
                    they ravaged the whole country, and pillaged and demolished the houses; loaded
                    the inhabitants with irons, and committed other enormities which generally
                    attend the incursions of a barbarous enemy. The weak Leo, who then swayed the
                    sceptre of the Grecian empire, instead of making a manly resistance, is said to
                    have attempted carrying off his enemy by poison; but this not succeeding, he was
                    obliged to purchase from the conqueror an ignominious peace. Oleg on his return
                    made his entrance into Kief laden with the wealth acquired by his victory; and
                    the people, dazzled with such splendid objects, imagined their prince to be
                    endowed with supernatural powers, and looked up to him with a reverence
                    approaching to adoration.</p>
                <p>Soon after his return to his own dominions, the Russian monarch despatched
                    deputies to Constantinople with the articles of a treaty, which he required the
                    Greek emperor to sign. This treaty, which is preserved in the Chronicles of
                    Nestor, is extremely curious; and we learn from it many important particulars
                    respecting the internal policy of the Russians at the beginning of the tenth
                    century. Several articles of it show that the Russian laws laid great stress on
                    oaths; that they pronounced the sentence of death against the murderer, instead
                    of inflicting on him only a pecuniary fine, and thus allowing the rich to commit
                    assassination with impunity; that the punishment of offences did not extend to
                    the entire confiscation of goods, and hence the widow and orphan did not suffer
                    for a crime of which they were innocent; that robbery, which attacks only
                    property, was punished by the privation of property; that the citizens, secure
                    in their possessions, were under no apprehension that the sovereign would seize
                    on their heritage, and might even dispose of their effects in favour of
                    friends.</p>
                <p>Oleg maintained the sovereign power for thirty-three years; nor does it appear
                    that Igor, even after he attained the age of majority, had any share in the
                    administration, till the death of his guardian, in 913, left him in full
                    possession of the throne.</p>
                <p>Igor had reached his fortieth year before he entered upon the government. He soon
                    discovered marks of the same warlike spirit which had actuated his predeccssor.
                    Among the nations that had been subjugated by Oleg, several, on the accession of
                    the new sovereign, attempted to regain their independence; the Drevlians, who
                    dwelt on the banks of the Uscha, in the present district of Vrutsch, being the
                    first to revolt. They were, however, soon quelled, and punished ' by the
                    imposition of an increased tribute.</p>
                <p>Igor had next to contend with more formidable enemies. The Petchenegans, a nation
                    hitherto unknown, quitted their settlements on the Yaik and the Volga, and made
                    incursions into the Russian territory. These people appear to have been at least
                    as powerful and warlike as the Varages; and Igor, finding himself unable to cope
                    with them, concluded a treaty of alliance. About five years afterwards, disputes
                    arose between the new allies, and both had recourse to arms. It appears that the
                    Russians were finally victorious, and the Petchenegans were for some time
                    disabled from giving further molestation.</p>
                <p>The Russian monarch, in imitation of his guardian, soon turned his attention
                    towards the Grecian empire, where depredations might apparently be made with
                    impunity. He equipped an immense armament, consisting, if we may credit the
                    improbable tale of the Russian annals, of ten thousand barks, each carrying
                    forty men, thus forming an array of four hundred thousand warriors. He set sail
                    for Constantinople, without any previous declaration of war, and without any
                    ostensible motive for thus infringing the treaty which had been concluded some
                    years before between Oleg and Leo. In his route he overran and ravaged the
                    provinces of Paphlagonia, Pontus, and Bithynia, plundering the towns, and
                    butchering the inhabitants. For some time the barbarians met with no opposition,
                    as the imperial troops were engaged in distant provinces; but the government of
                    the empire was now in very different hands from those which had held it during
                    the former invasion. The Grecian forces were well appointed, and commanded by
                    two generals of approved ability and courage. These were Theophanes and Phocas,
                    of whom the former commanded the fleet, and the latter the army. The Russians
                    had soon cause to repent their temerity. Theophanes attacked them on board their
                    ships, within sight of the Pharos, and throwing among them the unquenchable
                    Grecian fire, with the effects of which they were wholly unacquainted, produced
                    such confusion, that many plunged into the sea in order to avoid the flames that
                    threatened and pursued them. Their vessels were dispersed, shattered, or burned,
                    and great numbers of their crews perished. The remainder reached the shores of
                    Bithynia; but before they could recover from their consternation, they were met
                    by Phocas, who fell upon them with his troops, and made prodigious slaughter. So
                    great were the losses sustained by Igor in this unfortunate expedition, that he
                    carried back with him scarcely a third of his army. This second naval expedition
                    of the Russians against Constantinople took place in 941.</p>
                <p>Though discouraged by the ill success which had attended his first invasion of
                    the Grecian empire, Igor was too much stimulated by the desire of plunder, not
                    to risk a second attempt. Three years afterwards, he collected new forces, took
                    into pay many of the Petchenegans, and again set out for Greece; but before he
                    had advanced beyond the Tau-rican Chersonesus, the emperor Romanus, informed of
                    his approach, and not choosing to hazard the result of an engagement, sent
                    deputies to the Russian leader, offering to pay him the same tribute which had
                    been given to his predecessor. With this offer Igor complied, and once more
                    retired with his army.</p>
                <p>Igor was now far advanced in years; but the insatiable rapacity of his officers,
                    ever craving for fresh spoils from vanquished nations, impelled him to turn his
                    arms against the Drevlians, for the purpose of obtaining from them an increase
                    of their yearly tribute. In this unjust attack he was at first successful, and
                    returned loaded with the contributions which he had levied from that people; but
                    having dismissed great part of his troops with the spoils of the vanquished, and
                    marching with the remainder too far into the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=541" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0541-0529"
                    />country, he fell into an ambuscade, which the Drevlians, now grown desperate,
                    had formed on his approach, in the neighbourhood of Iskorosch. The Russians were
                    soon overpowered, and Igor being made prisoner, was put to death.</p>
                <p>Before the death of Oleg, Igor had married a princess of a bold and daring
                    spirit, named Olga, by whom he had one son, Sviatoslaf; but as this boy was very
                    young at the death of his father, the queen-mother Olga assumed the reins of
                    government. Her first care was to take signal vengeance upon the unhappy
                    Drevlians, for having bravely defended themselves against the encroachments of
                    foreign enemies. This tribe, satisfied with the death of their oppressor,
                    appeared desirous of renewing their amicable intercourse with the Russians, and
                    their chief, Male, is even said to have made an offer of his hand to Igor’s
                    widow. Olga, with that deep cunning and concealed malice that so often mark the
                    character of the despotic leader of a barbarous people, pretended to listen to
                    their overtures, and received the deputies of Male, but immediately ordered them
                    to be privately put to death. In the mean time she invited a larger deputation
                    from the Drevlian chief, which she treated in the same inhuman manner, taking
                    care that no tidings of either murder should be carried to the Drevlians. She
                    then set out, as if on an amicable visit, to conclude the new alliance, and
                    having proclaimed a solemn entertainment, to which she invited some hundreds of
                    the principal inhabitants of the Drevlian towns, she caused them to be
                    treacherously assassinated. But this was only the first step to the more
                    dreadful vengeance which she had resolved to inflict on this deluded people. She
                    laid waste the whole country of the Drevlians, and in particular the town near
                    which Igor had lost his life. For a long time she could not master the place, as
                    the inhabitants, dreading the horrible fate that awaited them, from the
                    revengeful spirit of Olga, defended themselves with the utmost valour and
                    success. At length, being assured of clemency, upon condition of sending to
                    their besieger all the pigeons of the town, they submitted; but the queen
                    causing lighted matches to be fastened to the tails of the pigeons, set them at
                    liberty. The birds flew to their usual places of residence in the town, which
                    were speedily in a conflagration. The wretched inhabitants endeavouring to
                    escape the flames, fell into the hands of the Russsian soldiers, planted around
                    the town for that purpose, by whom they were put to the sword.</p>
                <p>This was the only warlike transaction, if it deserves that name, which took place
                    during the regency of Olga. Though not uncommon in the annals of a barbarous
                    people, it would have been sufficient to hand down her name with detestation to
                    posterity, had she not, in the opinion of her panegyrists, atoned for the
                    enormity by attempting to introduce into her dominions the Christian
                    religion.</p>
                <p>Hitherto the Slavi, and the Scandinavian nations who had taken possession of
                    their territories, were Pagans; and their religious ceremonies, like those of
                    all the surrounding nations, were marked by an absurd and cruel superstition.
                    Their deities seem to have been borrowed, partly from the Greeks and Romans, and
                    partly from the Scythians; but were characterised by peculiar names, and
                    represented by idols of complex workmanship and grotesque appearance. Thus, the
                    god Perune, or Perkune, who was the chief among the Slavonian deities, was
                    personated by an idol whose head was of silver, its ears and mustachios of massy
                    gold, its legs of iron, and its trunk of hard incorruptible wood. It was
                    decorated with rubies and carbuncles, and held in its hand a stone carved, being
                    the symbol of lightning. The sacred fire burned continually before it; and if
                    the priests suffered this to be extinguished, they were doomed to perish in the
                    flames, as enemies of the god. Sacrifices of their flocks to this supreme deity
                    were regarded as trifling. His altar smoked with the blood of captives, and even
                    the children of his worshippers were sometimes immolated to appease his wrath or
                    propitiate his favour.</p>
                <p>It is uncertain at what time the light of Christianity began to beam on the
                    nations that occupied the banks <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the Dnieper, nor are
                    we acquainted with the circumstances that led to the conversion of the
                    queen-regent. We find, however, that about the middle of the tenth century, she
                    undertook a journey to Constantinople for the express purpose of being initiated
                    into the religion of Jesus. Constantine Porphyrogenneta, who then sat on the
                    imperial throne, received the royal convert with the greatest honour and
                    respect; he himself conducted her to the baptismal font, and, in the character
                    of her sponsor, gave to her the name of Helen. Her example, however, had little
                    influence on her son, or the nation at large. The Russians do not seem to have
                    been very ardent in their religious observances, nor peculiarly attached to the
                    opinions of their forefathers; but the nature of Christianity, and the character
                    of its disciples, were not in their eyes sufficiently striking or alluring to
                    produce any change in their religious system. Olga’s son, Sviatoslaf, either
                    from his contempt for the unwarlike character of the Greek Christians, or
                    through fear of the ridicule to which his conversion might subject him from his
                    young companions, disregarded all his mother’s solicitations. He did not,
                    however, prevent the people from receiving baptism, and a few proselytes were
                    made. Though the character of Olga, even after her conversion to Christianity,
                    was by no means such as to entitle her to the rank which she afterwards attained
                    among the Russian saints, it appears that she had given her son many wise and
                    prudent instructions respecting the government of his future empire. She
                    travelled with him round the country; superintended the erection of bridges and
                    the making of roads, for the benefit of trade and commerce; built several towns
                    and villages, and founded such laudable institutions, as sufficiently evince her
                    talents for governing a nation. She died about the year 969, at a very advanced
                    age.</p>
                <p>It is probable that Olga retired from the administration of affairs soon after
                    her conversion to Christianity; for we find Sviatoslaf in full possession of the
                    government long before his mother’s death. This prince has been considered as
                    one of the Russian heroes; and if a thirst for blood, a contempt of danger, and
                    a disregard of the luxuries and conveniences of life, be admitted as the
                    characteristics of a hero, he deserves the appellation. His habits rendered him
                    the idol of his army. He took up his habitation in the camp, where he led a life
                    exactly similar to that of the meanest soldier.</p>
                <p>His first expedition was against the Kozares, a people who had come from the
                    shores of the Caspian and the sides of the Caucasus, and had established
                    themselves along the eastern coast of the Black Sea. They had rendered tributary
                    both the Kievians, and the Viateches, a Slavonian nation that dwelt on the banks
                    of the Oka and the Volga. Sviatoslaf, desirous of transferring to himself the
                    tribute which the Kozares derived from the latter people, marched against them,
                    and appears to have succeeded in his design. He defeated them in a pitched
                    battle, and took by storm their capital city, Sarkel or Belgorod. It is said by
                    some historians that he even annihilated the nation; and certain it is, that
                    from that time no mention is made of the Kozares.</p>
                <p>The martial fame of Sviatoslaf had extended to Constantinople; and the Emperor
                    Nicephorus Phocas, who was then harassed by the Ungrians, assisted by his
                    treacherous allies the Bulgarians, applied for succours to the Russian
                    chieftain. A subsidiary treaty was entered into between them, and Sviatoslaf
                    hastened southward with a numerous army. He quickly made himself master of most
                    of the Bulgarian towns along the Danube, and was so elated with his success that
                    he determined to remove the centre of his government from Kief to the city of
                    Pereiaslavatz, now Yamboly, situated upon the shores of that river. He was <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=542"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0542-0530"/>soon obliged, however, to postpone the completion
                    of this design, on receiving intelligence that his old enemies the Petchenegans
                    had assembled in great numbers, ravaged the Kievian territory, and laid siege to
                    the capital, within the walls of which were shut up his mother and his sons. He
                    hastened to the relief of his family, but before he reached home, the
                    Petchenegans had been induced to raise the siege by an artifice of the Kievian
                    general. Sviatoslaf on his arrival pursued the enemy, defeated them, and obliged
                    them to sue for peace.</p>
                <p>He now resumed his design of establishing himself on the banks of the Danube, and
                    divided his hereditary dominions among his children. He gave Kief to Yaropolk,
                    the Drevlian territory to Oleg, and on Vladimir, a natural son, born to him by
                    one of the attendants of Olga, he bestowed the government of Novgorod. On his
                    return to Bulgaria, indeed, he found that his affairs had assumed a very
                    different aspect; for the Bulgarians, taking advantage of his absence with his
                    troops, had recovered most of their towns, and seemed well prepared to resist
                    the encroachments of a foreign power. Sviatoslaf, however, soon regained all
                    that he had lost.</p>
                <p>During these transactions the Emperor Nicephorus had been assassinated, and John
                    Zimisces, his murderer, had succeeded to the imperial diadem. The new emperor
                    sent ambassadors to the Russian monarch, requiring him to comply with the
                    stipulations of his treaty with Nicephorus, and evacuate Bulgaria, which he had
                    agreed to occupy as an ally, but not as a master. Sviatoslaf refused to give up
                    his newly-acquired possessions, and prepared to decide the contest by force of
                    arms. The particulars of this campaign, and the numbers of the contending
                    armies, are very differently related by the Russian annalists, and the
                    historians of the Grecian empire; the former stating that Sviatoslaf had not
                    more than ten thousand men, and yet was victorious over the troops of Zimisces;
                    while the Grecian historians affirm that the Russians amounted to three hundred
                    thousand, but were defeated, and compelled to abandon Bulgaria. As far as
                    respects the issue of the war, the Grecian writers are probably correct; for it
                    is certain that Sviatoslaf retreated towards Russia with the shattered remains
                    of his army. He did not, however, live to reach the capital; for having,
                    contrary to the advice of his most experienced officers, attempted to return to
                    Kief by the dangerous navigation of the Dnieper, he was intercepted by the
                    Petchenegans near the cataracts of that river. After remaining upon the
                    defensive during winter, exposed to all the horrors of famine and disease, he,
                    on the return of spring, attempted to force his way through the ranks of the
                    enemy; but his troops were defeated, and himself killed in the battle.</p>
                <p>Yaropolk, the sovereign of Kief, may be considered as the successor of Sviatoslaf
                    upon the Russian throne; but his reign was short and turbulent. A war took place
                    between him and his brother Oleg, on account of a base assassination committed
                    by the latter upon the son of his father’s friend and privy councillor Svenald.
                    Oleg was defeated and slain, and the other brother, Vladimir, dreading the
                    increased power and ambitious disposition of Yaropolk, abandoned his dominions,
                    which were quickly seized on by the Kievian prince. Vladimir had retired among
                    the Va-ragians, from whom he soon procured such succours as enabled him to make
                    effectual head against the usurper. While his natural courage was thus
                    increased, his enmity against Yaropolk received an additional spur from an
                    affront inflicted on him by a lady whom he had sought in marriage, but who,
                    despising the meanness of his birth, as being the son of a slave, had rejected
                    his proposals, and offered her hand to Yaropolk. The vindictive Vladimir, on
                    being informed of this insult, attacked the possessions of the lady’s father,
                    put both him and his two sons to the sword, and obliged the princess to accept
                    his hand, yet reeking with her parent’s blood. He now advanced towards Kief,
                    where Yaropolk was by no means prepared to oppose him. The Kievian prince had
                    indeed been lulled into security by the treacherous report of one of his
                    voyvodes, who was in the interest of Vladimir, and who not only prevented
                    Yaropolk from taking effectual measures for his safety, but found means to raise
                    suspicions in his breast against the inhabitants of his capital, which he thus
                    induced him to abandon. The Kievians, left without a leader, opened their gates
                    to Vladimir; and the wretched Yaropolk, still misled by the treachery of his
                    adviser, determined to throw himself on the mercy of his brother. It is probable
                    that this would have availed him little, as Vladimir seems to have determined on
                    his death; but before he could reach the arms of his revengeful brother,
                    Yaropolk was assassinated by some of his Varagian followers.</p>
                <p>By this murder the conqueror acquired the undivided possession of his father’s
                    territories, and maintained the sovereignty during a long reign, respected at
                    home, and feared abroad. Indeed, had not the commencement of his reign been
                    stained with the blood of his father-in-law and his brother, we might place him
                    among the most distinguished monarchs of the age in which he lived, as he not
                    only extended and enriched his empire, but was the means of establishing in his
                    dominions, upon a firm and lasting basis, the Christian religion, which, though
                    introduced by Olga, appears hitherto to have made but a very trifling
                    progress.</p>
                <p>The commencement of Vladimir’s reign formed but a continuation of those
                    enormities which had conducted him to the throne. He began with removing Blude,
                    the treacherous voyvode by whom his brother had been betrayed into his power,
                    and to whom he had promised the highest honours and dignities. Accordingly, for
                    three days he suffered Blude to live in all the splendour of a prince. At the
                    end of that period he thus addressed him: “I have fulfilled my promise; I have
                    treated thee as my friend; the honours thou hast received exceed thy most
                    sanguine wishes. Today, as the judge of crimes and the executor of justice, I
                    condemn the traitor, and punish the assassin of his prince.” Having uttered
                    these words, he caused Blude to be put to death. He displayed still more the
                    perfidiousness of his character in his behaviour towards the Varagians, who had
                    assisted in placing him on the throne of his ancestors; for on their requesting
                    permission to go and seek their fortune in Greece, he granted their request, but
                    privately advertised the emperor of their approach, and caused them to be
                    arrested and secured.</p>
                <p>Vladimir engaged in numerous wars, and subjected several of the neighbouring
                    states to his dominion. He seized on part of the Polish territories, and
                    compelled the Bulgarians who dwelt in the districts that now form the government
                    of Kazan to do him homage. He subjected the Petchenegans and Khazares, who lay
                    in the immediate neighbourhood of the Kievian state; he reduced to his authority
                    Halitsch and Vladimir, countries which are now called Gallicia and Lubomiria; he
                    conquered Lithuania as far as Memel, and took possession of a great part of the

                <p>His conduct after these successes by no means prognosticated his future zeal for
                    the Christian religion. None of the Russian monarchs appears to have been more
                    devout in the adoration of their heathen deities. It was usual for him to return
                    thanks to the gods for the success which they had granted to his arms, and to
                    show his gratitude by offering on their altars a part of the prisoners he had
                    taken in war. Upon one occasion his piety extended so far, that he resolved on
                    selecting one of his own subjects as the object of his sacrifice, thinking that
                    he should thus more worthily testify his gratitude for the signal favours he had
                    received from heaven. His choice fell upon a young Vara<pb break="no"

                    />gian, who was the son of a Christian, and had been brought up in the new
                    faith. The unhappy father refused the demanded victim. The enraged people,
                    deeming their prince and their religion insulted, assailed the house, and having
                    burst open the doors, butchered both the father and the son, folded in mutual
                    embraces.</p>
                <p>Yet this furious Pagan and bloody warrior afterwards became a most zealous
                    Christian, and a shining example of charity and benevolence to his subjects. The
                    circumstances that led to these important changes are, as well as the martial
                    achievements of this favourite prince, related with great minuteness by the
                    Russian annalists, and give this part of their chronicles the air rather of a
                    historical romance than a narrative of facts. We are told that the fame of
                    Vladimir’s military exploits had rendered him so formidable to the neighbouring
                    nations, that each courted his alliance, and strove to render this more lasting
                    by engaging him in the ties of the same religion with themselves. In particular,
                    the Grecian emperors sent to him a philosopher, whose exhortations, though they
                    did not at first induce Vladimir to embrace the Greek ritual, at least succeeded
                    in giving him a favourable opinion of it; so that the philosopher was
                    entertained with respect, and returned home loaded with presents. We are also
                    told, that, determined to act in the most impartial manner with respect to the
                    several religions which he had been invited to embrace, the prince despatched
                    persons remarkable for their wisdom and sagacity to visit the surrounding
                    nations, inspect the religious tenets and ceremonies that distinguished them,
                    and communicate to him the result of their observations. On the return of these
                    deputies, the report of those who had visited the churches of Constantinople,
                    and witnessed the imposing splendour of religious adoration, and the gorgeous
                    decorations of the Greek priests in the superb basilica of St Sophia, proved so
                    satisfactory to Vladimir, that he determined on embracing the Christian religion
                    according to the Observancesmf the Greek church. But though he resolved on
                    baptism, he was too proud to seek from the Greek emperor a priest by whom the
                    solemn ordinance might be performed. He assembled an army selected from all the
                    nations of which his empire was composed, and marching to Taurida, laid siege to
                    Theodosia, which is the modern Kaffa. On sitting down before the walls of this
                    place, he is said to have offered up the following characteristic prayer: “O
                    God, grant me thy help to take this town, that I may carry from it Christians
                    and priests to instruct me and my people, and convey the true religion into my
                    dominions.” His prayer was at length granted; for, rather by stratagem than by
                    force, he made himself master of the town, and, through it, of the whole of the
                    Crimea. He might now have received baptism; but his desire of being initiated in
                    the Christian faith seems to have been excited more by ambition than by true
                    devotion. His ruling passion promised to be amply gratified by an alliance with
                    the Grecian emperors, as he would thus acquire some legal claim on the
                    territories which they possessed. He therefore demanded in marriage Anna, the
                    sister of Basi-lius and Constantine, who jointly held the imperial dignity;
                    threatening, that if they refused his proffered alliance, he would lay siege to
                    Constantinople. After some deliberation, the emperors complied, on condition
                    that Vladimir and his people should become Christians; and these conditions
                    being accepted, the Russian monarch was baptized, took the name of Basilius,
                    received the Grecian princess, and, as the reward of his victories, carried off
                    several popes and archimandrites, together with sacred vessels and church books,
                    images of saints, and consecrated relics</p>
                <p>1 Whatever might have been the considerations that swayed Vladimir in his
                    conversion to the Christian faith, it is certain that his new religion had the
                    happiest influence on his subsequent life and conduct. He not only abjured
                    idolatry himself, and destroyed the idols which he had caused to be raised in
                    his dominions, but he used every exertion to persuade and compel his subjects to
                    follow his example. Before his conversion he is said to have possessed five
                    wives and eight hundred concubines; but after he became a Christian, he
                    maintained an unshaken fidelity towards the imperial princess. As a Pagan he had
                    been lavish of human blood; but after he had adopted the religion of Jesus, he
                    could scarcely be prevailed on to sentence to death a single highway robber. His
                    former delight had been in storming towns and gaining battles; but he now found
                    his greatest pleasure in building churches, and endowing seminaries of
                    education. He encouraged the raising of new cities and towns; peopled the waste
                    districts of his country with the prisoners whom he had taken in war; and not
                    only conducted himself as a sovereign who consulted the welfare of his
                    dominions, but displayed many benevolent and amiable qualities that highly
                    endeared him to his subjects. By thus showing that Christianity had made him
                    both a milder and a wiser prince, he insured from his people a respect for the
                    new religion, whilst the striking example of the sovereign and his nobles could
                    not fail to influence the minds of the inferior orders. Having one day issued a
                    proclamation, ordering all the inhabitants of Kief to repair next morning to the
                    banks of the river to be baptized, the people cheerfully obeyed the order;
                    observing, that if it were not good to be baptized, the prince and the boyars
                    would never submit to the ceremony.</p>
                <p>The establishment of Christianity in the Russian dominions forms one of the most
                    prominent features in the reign of Vladimir, and gives him a much juster claim
                    to the title of Great, which has been bestowed on him by historians, than all
                    his numerous victories. We have therefore dwelt on it with the greater
                    minuteness. Indeed the latter transe actions of his reign afford but little
                    interest. His last days were embittered by domestic vexations. His wife and one
                    of his favourite sons died long before him; while another of his sons, Yaroslaf,
                    on whom he had bestowed the government of Novgorod, refused to acknowledge him
                    as his liege lord, and applied to the Varagians for assistance against his
                    father. The aged Vladimir, compelled to march against a rebellious son, died of
                    grief upon the road, after a long and glorious reign of thirty-five years.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the unfavourable circumstances we have noticed, the improvement
                    which Russia owed to this prince was great and permanent. With the Christian
                    religion he imported from Greece the arts which then flourished in that empire;
                    and almost entirely new-modelled the language of his country, by engrafting on
                    it the more refined dialect of the Greeks, and adopting, in a great measure, the
                    letters of their alphabet.</p>
                <p>The dominions of Russia, which at first consisted of two principalities, that of
                    Novgorod, bordering on the Baltic, and that of Kief, occupying no very large
                    space on the eastern bank of the Dnieper, were, by the victories of Vladimir,
                    extended westward along the shores of the Baltic into Lithuania and Poland;
                    southward along the shores of the Euxine, so as to include the Crimea and great
                    part of the Bulgarian territories; whilst to the east it extended to the Oka,
                    the Don, and the Volga. He still maintained the seat of government at Kief, of
                    which he was styled grand prince, whilst the other districts were either
                    tributary to that principality, or held of it as their superior.</p>
                <p>Before his death, Vladimir had divided his extensive territories amongst his
                    twelve sons, reserving to himself and his immediate heir the grand principality
                    of Kief. The consequences of this ill-judged distribution were disunion, con-
                    <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> tention, and almost perpetual warfare amongst the
                    brothers. The most respectable, and in the end the most powerful of these, was
                    Yaroslaf, or, as he is commonly called, Jarislas, prince of Novgorod. This
                    prince, finding that Sviatopolk <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> who had raised
                    himself to the sovereignty of Kief after his <pb break="no"

                    />father’s death, attempted by assassination, or force of arms, to take
                    possession of the neighbouring principalities, determined to resist him in his
                    encroachments. Collecting an army of Novgorodians, he, in 1016, drove Sviatopolk
                    from Kief, and forced him to seek an asylum with his father-in-law, Boleslas,
                    duke of Poland. Boleslas, easily persuaded to engage in the cause of his
                    son-in-law, accompanied Sviatopolk into Russia with an army, retook Kief, and
                    obliged the Novgorodian prince to retire with precipitation. Whilst he was
                    endeavouring to collect fresh forces to renew the war with Boleslas and
                    Sviatopolk, the latter, by the treachery and perfidy with which he treated his
                    Polish allies, contributed to his own downfall. He caused great numbers of the
                    Poles to be secretly massacred, a transaction by which Boleslas was so incensed,
                    that he plundered Kief, made himself master of several places on the Russian
                    frontiers, and then left, his perfidious son-in-law to shift for himself.
                    Sviatopolk now sought assistance from the Petchenegans, and with an army of
                    these auxiliaries offered battle to Ya-roslaf, not far from the place where he
                    had, four years before, caused one of his brothers to be murdered. The contest
                    was long and bloody, but terminated in favour of Yaros-laf. Sviatopolk was put
                    to flight, and died soon afterwards.</p>
                <p>By this victory Yaroslaf acquired possession of the greater part of his father’s
                    dominions, and testified his gratitude for the assistance given him by the
                    Novgorodians, by the attention which he paid to the particular improvement of
                    that state. He drew up for it a code of laws, which are still known by the
                    appellation of the municipal law of Novgorod. He also exerted himself for the
                    welfare of other towns, and of the country at large.</p>
                <p>Yaroslaf did not neglect the advancement of the Christian religion. He
                    established a metropolitan in Kief, and thus gave to the Russian clergy a head,
                    who might watch over the morals of the inferior pastors, and provide for the
                    general dissemination of the Christian doctrine. He collected several books on
                    the Greek religion, and caused many of them to be translated into the Russian
                    language.</p>
                <p>This monarch is supposed to have died in 1054, and to have reigned thirty-five
                    years. He followed the example of his father, in dividing his territories
                    amongst his sons, though he endeavoured to prevent the dissensions which he
                    himself had witnessed from such a partition, by exhorting them on his death-bed
                    to the most intimate concord, and endeavouring to convince them that they would
                    be respected by their subjects, and feared by their enemies, only whilst they
                    continued to act with unanimity.</p>
                <p>We know little of the proceedings of Yaroslaf’s successors, except that Isiaslaf,
                    his eldest son, who until 1078 reigned as grand prince of Kief, had frequent
                    disputes with his brothers, in which he was assisted by the Poles, and supported
                    by the influence of the Roman pontiff.</p>
                <p>From the death of Isiaslaf to the beginning of the thirteenth century, the
                    history of Russia comprises little else than a continued series of intestine
                    commotions and petty wars with the neighbouring states. The same system of
                    dismemberment was continued by the succeeding princes, and was attended with the
                    same result. There were during this period not fewer than seventeen independent
                    principalities, though these were at length reduced to seven, viz. those of
                    Kief, Novgorod, Smolensk, Vladimir, Tver, Halitcb, and Moskva or Moscow. Of
                    these, Kief and Novgorod long continued to be the most powerful, though they
                    could not always maintain their superiority over the others; and towards the
                    latter end of the period which we have mentioned, the district of Vladimir
                    erected itself into a grand principality, and became at least as powerful as
                    Kief and Novgorod. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In
                    the supremacy of these three great principalities, we may trace the division of
                    European Russia into Great, Little, and White Russia; a distinction which long
                    maintained its ground, and in later times gave to the sovereign of this empire
                    the title of monarch or emperor of all the Russias. Great Russia comprehended
                    the principality of Novgorod, and extended northward to the White Sea, eastward
                    to the river Dvina, and the entrance of the Petchora into the Ural Mountains;
                    whilst to the south it bordered on the district of Vladimir, as far as the Volga
                    and the mouth of the Medveditza, and to the west on Lithuania and Prussia,
                    including the tributary tribes on the Baltic, as far as Memel. Its capital was
                    Novgorod. Little Russia extended on the north along the river Agcr to White
                    Russia, on the east above the Donetz and the Oka to the Polovtzes and the
                    Petchenegans« whilst to the south it stretched as far as the Tauric Chersonesus,
                    or the Crimea, and to the west along the banks of the river Goryn. This was the
                    principality of Kief, and in that city was the seat of government. The
                    principality of Vladimir received the name of White Russia. It extended
                    northward along the Volga, to the southern boundary of Great Russia; to the east
                    it bordered on the possessions of the Ugres, and the territory of the Mordvines,
                    stretching down the Volga to the mouth of the Oka; and to the south it extended
                    along the Oka to the principality of Riazan, and the Bulgarian territory. The
                    metropolis of this division was at first Shuja, and afterwards in succession
                    Rost of, Susdal, and Vladimir, till at length the seat of government was
                    transferred to Moscow. </p></note></p>
                <p>During the intestine broils that attended the dismemberment of the Russian
                    monarchy, the ambition of its neighbours, with the folly of the contending
                    princes, who solicited foreign aid against their rivals, contributed to diminish
                    the strength and resources of the empire. In particular, the Poles and the
                    Hungarians availed themselves of these circumstances. By ravaging the towns and
                    villages, carrying off the captives into slavery, and making a prey of whatever
                    appeared most useful, they quickly recompensed themselves for their assistance.
                    The Poles seem to have been the most successful in their depredations, and to
                    have fully revenged themselves for their former humiliation.</p>
                <p>A state of anarchy and confusion, such as we have described, held out a strong
                    temptation to powerful states in the vicinity. In the neighbourhood of the Sea
                    of Aral, not far from the confines of Vladimir and Kief, the wandering hordes of
                    Mongols, or Mongol Tartars, had taken up their residence. They were perhaps
                    descended from the ancient Scythians, and long dwelt on the confines of China.
                    Hence they gradually marched westward, and about the year 1228 arrived on the
                    shores of the Sea of Aral, under the conduct of Tuschi, son of the famous
                    Tschinghis Khan, chief of the Mogul empire. From the Aral, Tuschi conducted his
                    horde along the shores of the Caspian Sea, and gradually approached the Dnieper.
                    In his course he attacked and overcame the Tscherkasses, or Circassians, who on
                    his approach had joined with the Polovtzes to resist the terrible enemy. The
                    defeated Polovtzes gave notice to their neighbours the Russians, of the
                    approaching storm, and invited them to form a common cause against the enemy. In
                    the mean time the Tartars had sent ambassadors to the Russians, hoping to
                    prevent their alliance with the Polovtzes, and thus the more easily to subdue
                    the disunited nations. For this time, however, the Russians were true to their
                    own interest. In concert with the Polovtzes they assembled an army, and prepared
                    to resist the incursions of the Tartars. Both parties</p>
                <p>The principality of Novgorod appears, during this interval, to have been the most
                    respect able for its commercial intercourse with the neighbouring nations, and
                    for the independent spirit of its internal government. This, though nominally
                    monarchical, seems to have possessed much of a republican character. The princes
                    were evidently dependent on the people, and some ludicrous instances of this
                    dependence are related by the old historians. One of the grand princes had so
                    much displeased his people, that they refused to pay him their usual obedience.
                    As the prince seems to have been aware of the little influence which he
                    possessed in the state, he employed the metropolitan of the principality to
                    negotiate a reconciliation. This prelate, accordingly, by a letter addressed to
                    the Novgorodians, interceded for the sovereign, and pledged himself as surety
                    for his good behaviour.</p>

                <p>met near the small river Kalka, which flows into the Sea of Azof, and a furious
                    engagement took place, ending in the complete overthrow of the Russians and
                    their allies.</p>
                <p>About thirteen years after this defeat, another horde of Tartars, headed by Baaty
                    Khan, the grandson of Tschinghis Khan, penetrated into Russia, after having
                    attacked and defeated their neighbours the Bulgarians. The invaders soon spread
                    far and wide the terror of their name. Wherever they came, the whole face <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> nature was laid waste; towns and villages were destroyed
                    by fire; all the men capable of bearing arms were put to the sword, and the
                    children, women, and old men, carried into captivity. If the inhabitants of the
                    towns to which they approached offered a compromise, the faithless barbarians
                    affected to receive their submission, but immediately broke the agreement, and
                    treated those who surrendered to their mercy with as much rigour as those who
                    had endeavoured to defend themselves and had been overcome. If the inhabitants
                    of the open towns and villages came out to meet them, and to receive them as
                    conquerors and friends, death, torture, or the most ignominious bondage, was the
                    reward of their spontaneous submission.</p>
                <p>The first state which the Tartars attacked was Riazan, the prince of which
                    applied for assistance to Yury, commonly called by historians George
                    Vsevolodovitch, grand prince of VOadimir. He sent them a few auxiliaries, but
                    these either came too late, or their number was too small. The principality of
                    Riazan fell, and its fall was succeeded by that of PereiaslavI, Rost of, Susdal,
                    and several others. Like a furious torrent rushing down the mountain side, and
                    irresistibly bearing with it all that impedes its progress, these barbarous
                    hordes poured rapidly along, sweeping all before them in one common devastation.
                    They now approached the principality of Vladimir, and no army appeared to resist
                    them upon the frontiers. They advanced unimpeded to the capital, which, left to
                    its fate by the grand prince, had nothing to expect but the same cruel treatment
                    which the neighbouring cities had received. Yury, with unpardonable negligence,
                    was celebrating a marriage feast, when he ought to have been employed in
                    collecting the means of defence against the enemy, of whose approach to his
                    borders he had received timely intimation. The city of Vladimir, which contained
                    the princess and two of her sons, was left to the protection of a chieftain
                    totally unqualified for its defence; and the inhabitants seemed to share in the
                    pusillanimity of their governor. Instead of annoying the enemy by occasional
                    excursions, and preparing the means of defending the walls against a sudden
                    attack, they gave themselves up to terror and despair; and as they conceived
                    death to be inevitable, they prepared for it, by taking the habits of monks and
                    nuns, in order to insure to themselves a blissful departure. A prey to fear and
                    despondency, the city soon fell into the hands of the Tartars. They one morning
                    scaled the walls, and meeting with little opposition, quickly made themselves
                    masters of the place, when they cast aside every feeling of humanity, and, like
                    beasts of prey, glutted their appetite for blood amongst the wretched
                    inhabitants. The grand princess, and other ladies of distinction, dreading the
                    brutality of the relentless conquerors, had taken refuge in the choir of a
                    church, an asylum which all the assurances of the Tartars that they should
                    suffer no injury could not prevail on them to abandon. It was therefore set on
                    fire by the barbarians, who feasted their ears with the shrieks and groans of
                    the women as the flames surrounded them.</p>
                <p>V ury, incensed almost to desperation at the fate of his capital, and the
                    horrible death of his wife and children, was determined to take signal vengeance
                    on the assailants. He assembled all the forces which he could draw together; and
                    though his army was greatly inferior in number to the Iartars, he marched
                    against the enemy, and attacked them with the most determined valour. The
                    struggle was short but bloody. The Tartars were victorious, and the body of Yury
                    was found amongst the slain.</p>
                <p>This appears to have been the only vigorous stand made by the Russian princes.
                    The Tartars pushed forward with rapidity, and successively overpowered the
                    principalities of Novgorod and Kief. In the latter city they found immense
                    booty; but this circumstance did not prevent them from repeating here the same
                    bloody scenes which they had acted in the other capitals. The governor was
                    preserved from the cruelties that had been inflicted upon the inhabitants, by
                    the courage he had displayed in defence of the city; and his noble demeanour,
                    when he fell into the hands of the conqueror, acquiring the esteem and affection
                    of that chief, enabled him to obtain a temporary repose to his country.</p>
                <p>The Tartars had now established themselves in the Russian territories, and their
                    khan or chief, though he did not himself assume the nominal sovereignty, reigned
                    as paramount lord, and placed on the throne any of the native &lt; princes whom
                    he found most obsequious to his will, or who had ingratiated themselves by the
                    magnificence of their presents. Till the middle of the fourteenth century, the
                    throne was successively occupied by Yaroslaf II., Alexander Yaroslavitch called
                    Saint Alexander Neffsky, Yaroslaf Yaroslavitch, Vasilii Yaroslavitch <hi

                    Andrei, Daniil, both brothers of Dimitri, Mikaila Yarosla-vitch, Yury
                    Danilovitch, Alexander Mikailovitch, Ivan Danilovitch, Simeon Ivanovitch, and
                    Ivan Ivanovitch.</p>
                <p>During these several reigns, the miseries of a foreign yoke were aggravated by
                    all the calamities of intestine discord and war; whilst the knights of Livonia,
                    or Brothers of the Short Sword, as they are sometimes called, a kind of military
                    order of religious, on one side, and the Poles on the other, catching at the
                    opportunity, and attacking Russia, took several of its towns, and even some
                    considerable countries. The Tartars and Russians, whose interests were in this
                    case the same, often united to oppose their common enemy; but they were
                    generally worsted. The Livonians took Pleskow, and the Poles made themselves
                    masters of Black Russia, the Ukraine, Podolia, and the city of Kief. Casimir the
                    Great, one of their kings, carried his conquests still farther. He asserted his
                    pretensions to a part of Russia, in right of his relation to Boleslas, duke of
                    Kalitz, who died without issue, and forcibly possessed himself of the duchies of
                    Perzesmylia, Kalitz, and Luckow, with the districts of Sanock, Lubakzow, and
                    Trebowla; of all which countries he made a province of Poland.</p>
                <p>The newly-conquered Russians were ill disposed to endure the government of the
                    Poles, whose law’s and customs were more contrary to their own than those of the
                    Tartars had been. They joined the latter to rid themselves of the yoke, and
                    assembled an army numerous enough to overwhelm all Poland, but destitute of
                    valour and discipline. Casimir, undaunted by this deluge of barbarians,
                    presented himself at the head of a few troops on the borders of the Vistula, and
                    obliged his enemies to retire.</p>
                <p>About the year 1362 Dimitri Ivanovitch received the sovereignty from the Tartar
                    chief, and established the seat of his government at Moscow. This prince
                    possessed considerable ambition, and contrived to inspire the other Russian
                    princes with so much respect for his person and government, that they consented
                    to hold their principalities as fiefs under Dimitri. This increased the
                    consequence of the Russian prince, and excited the jealousy of Mammai the Tartar
                    khan, who determined to take measures for maintaining his superiority. He began
                    by demanding an increase of tribute; but when Dimitri demurred to this new
                    encroachment, the khan not only insisted on his demand, but required the grand
                    prince to appear before him in person. This requisition Dimitri thought proper
                    to refuse,</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=546"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0546-0534"/>
                <p>and prepared to support his refusal by force of arms. The terror with which the
                    Tartars had inspired the inhabitants of Russia had now considerably subsided,
                    whilst the hatred which the Russians bore these haughty masters was kept alive
                    by the barbarism of their manners and the difference of their religion. The
                    Christian ministers, justly dreading that the Tartars, in their furious
                    progress, might extirpate Christianity, contributed all in their power to
                    confirm the spirit of revolt amongst the people; and they promised the crown of
                    martyrdom to such as should fall in battle against the infidels. Thus the
                    contest into which the grand prince determined to enter in support of his
                    authority became in some measure a holy war, undertaken in defence of the
                    national religion. This combination of favourable circumstances operated so
                    strongly in favour of Dimitri, and the iirinces that had confederated with him,
                    that they soon col-ected an army of two hundred thousand men. With this force
                    the grand prince left Moscow, and marched towards the Don, on the southern bank
                    of which the Tartars were encamped. Arrived at this river, he left it to the
                    choice of his troops, either to cross the river and encounter the enemy on the
                    other side, or to await the attack where they were. The general voice declared
                    for passing over to the assault. He accordingly transported his battalions
                    across the river, that he might cut off all hope of escaping by retreat. The
                    fight now commenced, and though the numbers of the enemy far exceeded their own,
                    the Russians defended themselves valiantly against the furious onset of the
                    Tartars; but as these barbarians were continually relieved by fresh
                    reinforcements, they appeared to be gaining ground. Indeed, nothing but the
                    impossibility of retreating across the river, and the firm persuasion that death
                    would immediately transport them to the mansions of eternal bliss, restrained
                    the Russians from a general flight. At the moment when the day seemed entirely
                    lost, a detachment of the grand prince’s army which had been stationed in
                    reserve, and had remained out of the view of the enemy, came up with unabated
                    force, fell on the rear of the Tartars, and threw them into such terror and
                    confusion that they fled with Mammai at their head, leaving the Russians masters
                    of the field.</p>
                <p>This glorious victory, which took place in 1380, was attended with numerous
                    advantages to the Russian cause. In particular, it taught the native princes
                    that the Tartars were not unconquerable; and that nothing was wanting to relieve
                    them from the galling yoke under which they had long groaned, but mutual union,
                    courage, and prudence. The Tartars appear to have been so much humbled by this
                    defeat, that for a time they left the Russians to enjoy in peace their recovered
                    liberty. This forbearance, however, was not of long duration. Before the death
                    of Dimitri, returning with increased numbers, they laid siege to Moscow, which,
                    after an obstinate defence, was at length induced to surrender, and Russia once
                    more submitted to her old masters.</p>
                <p>Dimitri died in the year 1389, and was succeeded by his son Vasilii
                    Dimitrievitch. In the reign of this prince a new incursion of the Tartars took
                    place, under the great Timur or Tamerlane, who, after having subdued all the
                    neighbouring Tartar hordes, extended his conquests to the Russian territories,
                    took Moscow by assault, and carried off immense plunder.</p>
                <p>The grand principality of Vladimir, or, as it may now be called, of Moscow, had,
                    at the end of the fourteenth century, attained its greatest height, whilst that
                    of Kief had proportionally declined. This latter principality was, at the time
                    of which we are now writing, under the dominion of the Poles, having been seized
                    on in 1320 by Gedemin, duke of Lithuania.</p>
                <p>The later part of the fifteenth century forms a splendid epoch in the Russian
                    history. At this time, viz. from 1462 to 1505, reigned Ivan Vasiliivitch, or, as
                    he is commonly called, John Basilovitz. This able prince, by his invincible
                    spirit and refined policy, became both the conqueror and deliverer of his
                    country, and laid the first foundation of its future grandeur. Observing with
                    indignation the narrow limits of his power at his accession to the throne, after
                    the death of his father Vastlii the Blind, he began immediately to resolve
                    within himself upon the means of enlarging his dominions. He demanded and
                    obtained in marriage Maria, sister of Michael duke of Twer, whom he soon
                    afterwards deposed, on pretence of revehging the injuries done to his father,
                    and added this duchy to his own territories of Moscow. Maria, by whom he had a
                    son, who died before him, did not live long; and upon her death he married
                    Sophia, daughter of Thomas Palaeologus, who had been driven from Constantinople,
                    and forced to seek shelter at Rome, where the pope portioned this princess, in
                    hopes of thus procuring great advantage to the Catholic religion; but his
                    expectations were frustrated, Sophia being obliged to conform to the Greek
                    church after her arrival in Russia.</p>
                <p>The Russians certainly owed to this alliance their deliverance from the Tartar
                    yoke. Shocked at the servile homage exacted by these proud victors, when she saw
                    her husband going to meet their ambassadors at some distance from the city, and
                    standing to hear what they had to say, whilst they were at dinner, Sophia told
                    him that she was surprised to find she had married a servant to the Tartars.
                    Nettled at the reproach, Ivan feigned himself ill when the next deputation from
                    the Tartars arrived, and by means of this stratagem avoided a repetition of the
                    humiliating ceremonial. Another circumstance equally displeasing to the princess
                    was, that the Tartars possessed by agreement, within the walls of the palace at
                    Moscow, houses in which their ministers resided; a stipulation which they had
                    made at once to show their power and watch the actions of the grand prince. To
                    rid her husband and herself of these unpleasant neighbours, Sophia sent a formal
                    embassy to the khan, to inform him, that as she had been favoured with a vision
                    from above, commanding her to build a temple in the place where then stood the
                    houses of the Tartar ministers, her mind could not be at ease till she had
                    fulfilled the divine command; she therefore desired his leave to pull them down,
                    and give his people others. The khan consented. The houses within the Kremlin
                    were demolished, and no new ones being provided, the Tartar residents were
                    obliged to leave Moscow; an affront which their prince was not able to revenge,
                    as he was then engaged in a war with the Poles.</p>
                <p>Ivan, taking advantage of this circumstance, and having gradually increased his
                    forces, now openly disclaimed all subjection to the Tartars, attacked their
                    territories, and made himself master of Kazan. Here he was solemnly crowned with
                    a diadem which is said to be the same that is still used in the coronation of
                    the Russian sovereigns. This took place about the year 1470, and led to a
                    complete emancipation of Russia from the Tartar dominion. Ivan afterwards
                    carried his arms against the neighbouring states. Asiatic Bulgaria, and great
                    part of Lapland, soon submitted to him; and the great Novgorod, a city then so
                    famous that the Russians were accustomed to intimate their idea of its
                    importance by the proverbial expression, Who can resist God and the great
                    Novgorod? was reduced by his generals after a seven years’ siege, and yielded
                    immense treasure. After he quitted the city, which had been awed by his
                    presence, the discontents excited at his violent measures broke out into acts of
                    mutiny, upon which he, in 1485, carried off fifty of the principal families, and
                    distributed them through several of the Russian towns. He afterwards removed
                    some thousands of the most considerable inhabitants, and substituted for them
                    more loyal subjects from other places. By these proceedings the flourishing
                    commerce of this city received a considerable shock, and <pb break="no"

                    />it suffered still more by the imprisonment of all the German merchants, and
                    the confiscation of their effects, with the abolition of the old municipal
                    franchises. Indeed from this period Novgorod never recovered its former
                    splendour.</p>
                <p>After his reduction of this city, Ivan invaded the territories of Livonia and
                    Esthonia, in consequence, as we are told, of an affront offered to him by the
                    inhabitants of Revel. Here, however, he met with a stout resistance, and does
                    not seem to have made much progress. Towards the conclusion of his reign, the
                    Razanian Tartars, who, though humbled, had continued to inhabit that district,
                    made a hard struggle to shake off the Russian yoke that had been imposed on
                    them; but Ivan had established his authority too firmly for them to accomplish
                    their purpose during his life. He died in 1505, and was succeeded by his son
                    Vasilii Ivanovitch, commonly called Basilius III.</p>
                <p>The Tartars of Kazan were still suffered to maintain a show of independency, by
                    electing their own khans; but a Russian noble, under the denomination of
                    voyvode, was associated with the khan in the government, and took care that the
                    administration should be conducted in such a manner as to secure the interests
                    of his master. About fourteen years after the death of Ivan, however, the
                    Tartars resolved to overturn so humiliating an administration. They murdered the
                    Russian voyvode, expelled their nominal khan, and united themselves with their
                    brethren of the Crimea. With their assistance they assembled a mighty force,
                    entered the Russian dominions, and carried their arms even to the gates of
                    Moscow. The grand prince Vasilii found himself at that time unable to resist the
                    barbarians; and therefore purchased an exemption from general pillage by great
                    presents, and a promise of renewed allegiance. The Tartars retired, but carried
                    off immense booty, and nearly three hundred thousand prisoners, the greater part
                    of whom they sent to Theodosia in the Crimea, and sold to the Turks. This
                    humiliation of Vasilii did not, however, long continue; and he was soon enabled
                    to make head against the Tartars, and to recover possession of the city Kazan,
                    and of Pscove, a city which had been built by the Princess Olga, and was the
                    great rival of Novgorod in wealth and commercial importance. Under this prince
                    all the principalities of Russia were once more united, and they have remained
                    ever since under the dominion of one sovereign.</p>
                <p>It was under the son and successor of Vasilii, Ivan IV., or, as he is styled by
                    the Russian historians, Ivan Vasilii-vitch II., that Russia completely
                    emancipated herself from her subjection to the Tartars, and acquired a vast
                    accession of territory, which extended her empire into the northeast of Asia,
                    and rendered her for the first time superior in extent to any state that had
                    appeared since the Roman empire. Vasilii died in 1533, having reigned
                    twenty-eight years, and lived fifty-five. His son Ivan was only three years old
                    when he succeeded to the throne; and during his minority the state became a prey
                    to anarchy and confusion. But when he attained his seventeenth year, he was able
                    to assume the reins of government without opposition; and, from the important
                    transactions in which he immediately engaged, he must have been possessed of
                    considerable resources.</p>
                <p>In taking into his own hands the administration of the state, Ivan displayed so
                    much prudence and manly fortitude as soon raised him very high in the estimation
                    of his subjects. At the same time he showed marks of a tyrannical disposition
                    and irritability of temper, which made him rather feared than admired by his
                    friends, whilst they rendered him an object of terror to his neighbours and his
                    enemies. He saw himself surrounded on all sides by contending factions, and to
                    suppress these was the first object of his care. In the choice of means for
                    effecting this, he does not seem to have been very scrupulous, provided they
                    tended to the accomplishment of his end; and in punishing the offences of those
                    who opposed his purpose, his violence of temper not unfrequently led him to
                    confound the innocent with the guilty. He was successful, however, in his great
                    design; and having secured the domestic tranquillity of his dominions, he had
                    leisure to direct his attention to the more remote but not less predominant
                    objects of his ambition. He resolved to attempt liberating his country for ever
                    from the dominion of the Tartars; and he succeeded. In the year 1551 he marched
                    an army in the depth of winter into the district of Kazan, and laid siege to the
                    capital, checking by severe punishments the murmurs of his troops, who loudly
                    and openly expressed their dislike to this expedition.</p>
                <p>Before entering seriously on the siege of Kazan, he built several forts on the
                    frontiers of the Tartar territories, by which he hoped to awe these barbarians,
                    and to prevent them from disturbing the peace of his dominions. He then invested
                    Kazan, and, in the year 1552, made himself master of it by the new, and, to the
                    Tartars, unheard-of method of springing a mine below the walls. The inhabitants
                    that escaped slaughter were offered mercy on condition that they should embrace
                    the Christian faith. By this important conquest, the dominion of the Tartars,
                    who had oppressed the Russians for more than three centuries, was completely and
                    permanently overthrown.</p>
                <p>About two years later Ivan extended his conquests eastward to the shores of the
                    Caspian, and took possession of the territory that lay on the right bank of the
                    Volga, round the city of Astracan, which was also inhabited by the Tartar
                    hordes.</p>
                <p>Ivan, as well as his grandfather, had found it necessary to chastise the
                    inhabitants of Novgorod. But, in the year 1570, this city, being suspected
                    Offormingaplot for delivering itself and the surrounding territory into the
                    hands of the king of Poland, felt still more severely the effects of his
                    vengeance. All who had been in any degree implicated in the conspiracy, to the
                    number of twenty-five thousand, suffered by the hands of the executioner. The
                    city of Pscove was threatened with a similar proscription; but Ivan, on theiι
                    voluntary submission, contented himself with the execution of a few monks, and
                    the confiscation of the property of the most opulent inhabitants. It is not
                    surprising that acts like these should have given to this prince the names of
                    <hi rend="italic">Ierriblt</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tyrant,</hi> by which
                    historians have occasionally distinguished him; though it is not a little
                    extraordinary that he should have retained so much interest in the affections of
                    his subjects, that when, to try their attachment, he, in 1575, abdicated the
                    government, and retained only the title of Prince of Moscow, the majority of the
                    nation loudly expressed their wish for him to resume the administration of
                    affairs. We can account for this only by considering the measures which he had
                    adopted for the improvement and the civilization of his people. These were of
                    such a nature as in a great measure to obliterate the remembrance of his cruelty
                    and oppression. He promulgated a new code of laws, composed partly of such
                    ancient statutes as were still in force, and were capable of improvement, and
                    partly of new regulations, which he either contrived himself, or adopted from
                    the neighbouring states. He found it necessary, however, to render many of these
                    laws extremely severe; though their execution was most frequently exemplified in
                    the persons of his nobles, whose proud obstinacy seemed unconquerable by more
                    lenient measures.</p>
                <p>Ivan cultivated an intercourse with several of the European states, especially
                    with Germany. In 1547, he sent a splendid embassy to the Emperor Charles V.,
                    requesting him to permit a number of German artists, mechanics, and literary
                    men, to establish themselves in Russia. Charles readily complied with his
                    request, and several hundred volunteers were collected and assembled at Lubeck,
                    whence they were to proceed through Livonia to Moscow. The Lubeck<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=548" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0548-0536"
                    />ers, however, afraid lest the improvement of the Russians in arts and
                    manufactures might render them independent of their neighbours, and diminish the
                    commercial intercourse that had long subsisted between their city and the
                    principal towns of Russia, arrested the Germans on their route; and, in concert
                    with the merchants of Revel and Riga, sent a petition to Charles, requesting him
                    to recall the permission he had granted. In consequence of these measures, many
                    of the German artists returned home; but several of them escaped the vigilance
                    of the Lubeckers, and reached Moscow by a circuitous journey. Ivan endeavoured
                    to revenge himself on the Livonians by invading their country, which was
                    strenuously defended by the Teutonic knights; and these champions, finding at
                    last that they were unable to maintain their ground, put the territory under the
                    protection of Poland.</p>
                <p>The Swedes also received a share of the Livonian territories; and this
                    circumstance gave rise to a war between them and the Russians. Ivan invaded
                    Finland; but that ’country was bravely defended by William of Furstenberg,
                    grand-master of the Livonian knights, with the assistance of the troops of
                    Gustavus Vasa; and it does not appear that Ivan gained much in this expedition,
                    though we are told that the Livonian grand-master ended his life in a Russian
                    prison.</p>
                <p>In 1553, an event happened which first led to an intercourse between Russia and
                    England. Some Englishmen, who were at that time on a voyage of discovery, landed
                    on the shores of the White Sea, where soon after was built the port of
                    Archangel. They were hospitably received by the natives; and intimation of the
                    circumstance being conveyed to Ivan, he sent for the strangers, and was so much
                    pleased with their abilities and deportment, that he resolved to give every
                    encouragement to the English commerce, and thus open a new channel of
                    intercourse with a highly polished nation, by which his subjects might obtain
                    fresh incitements to activity and industry. He expressed the highest esteem for
                    Queen Elizabeth, and requested by his ambassador, that if the ingratitude of his
                    subjects should ever compel him to quit Russia (a circumstance by no means
                    improbable), she would grant him an asylum in her dominions. It was in
                    consequence of this accidental communication between the Russians and the
                    English that England first engaged in a trade to Russia, and promoted this new
                    commerce by the establishment of a company of Russian merchants in London.</p>
                <p>About twenty years after Astracan had been annexed to the Russian empire, a new
                    acquisition of territory accrued to it from the conquests of a private
                    adventurer, in the unknown regions of Siberia. The steps that led to the
                    acquisition of this immense tract of the Asiatic continent are thus related by
                    Tooke.</p>
                <p>“The grand prince, Ivan III. had already sent out a body of men, who penetrated
                    across the Ingrian Mountains, and traversed all the districts as far as the
                    river Oby. But, amidst the urgent affairs of government, the discoveries they
                    made insensibly fell into oblivion. Some years afterwards, a merchant named
                    Stroganof, who was proprietor of some salt-works on the confines of Siberia, was
                    curious to gain a farther knowledge of that country, which was likewise
                    inhabited by Tartars, whose khan resided in the capital Sibir. Perceiving, among
                    the persons who came to him on affairs of trade, men who belonged to no nation
                    with which he was acquainted, he put several inquiries to them concerning the
                    place whence they came, and once sent a few of his people with them back to
                    their country. These people brought with them, at their return from the regions
                    they had now explored, and which proved to be this very Siberia, a great
                    quantity of valuable furs, and thus opened to their master a new road to wealth.
                    However, not so covetous as to wish to keep this treasure to himself, he sent
                    information of it to the court, and the attention of government was once more
                    directed to this country. But the conquest of it, and its conjunction with
                    Russia, was reserved foi an adventurer named Timoseyer Yermak. This Yermak, at
                    the head of a gang of Don Kozaks, had made it his practice to rob and plunder
                    the caravans and passengers that occasionally frequented the roads, as well as
                    the inhabitants, wherever he came, and was so fortunate as to escape the search
                    of the Russian troops that had been sent out against him and his band, which
                    consisted of not fewer than six thousand men. On their flight, he and his people
                    accidentally came to the dwelling of Stroganof, where, hearing much talk about
                    Siberia, and being persons who had nothing to lose, and therefore might put all
                    to the hazard, they soon formed a plan to penetrate farther into that country,
                    and there seek at once their safety and their fortune. After numerous struggles
                    and conflicts with the natives, which greatly reduced their numbers, they at
                    length conquered the capital, and shortly after the whole country. Yermak now
                    presented the fruit of his toilsome and perilous victories to his Czar, <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Previous to the reign of
                    Vasilii, the predecessor of the monarch whose transactions we are now relating,
                    the Russian sovereigns held the title of Velikn Kniaz, which has been translated
                    Grand Duke, though it more properly denotes Grand Prince; and by this latter
                    appellation we have accordingly distinguished the preceding monarchs. Vasilii,
                    near the conclusion of his reign, adopted the title of Czar or Emperor; but this
                    title was not fully established till the successes and increasing power of his
                    son Ivan enabled the latter to confirm it both at home and abroad; and since his
                    time it has been universally acknowledged. </p></note> Ivan, in hopes of
                    obtaining thereby a pardon of his former depredations, which was granted him
                    accordingly; and by the building of several towns, and the constructing a number
                    of forts, the possession of this country was soon permanently secured. The less
                    and the greater Kabardey were also added to Russia in the reign of Ivan. This
                    Czar, however, not only enlarged the circumference of his empire, partly by
                    force of arms and partly by accident, but he resolved to reform his people, to
                    render them more polished, more skilful, and more industrious; but this he found
                    to be the most arduous enterprise he could possibly have undertaken. The
                    insuperable impediments which threw themselves in the way of the execution of
                    this grand work, were the principal incitements to those frequent acts of
                    cruelty and despotism which have covered his memory with so deep a stain.”</p>
                <p>Towards the close of Ivan’s reign, a prodigious army of Tartars entered Russia,
                    with a design to subdue the whole country. But Zerebrinoff, the Czar’s general,
                    having attacked them in a defile, put them to flight with considerable
                    slaughter. They then retired towards the mouth of the Volga, where they expected
                    a considerable reinforcement; but being closely pursued by the Russians, and the
                    Tartars in alliance with them, they were again defeated, and forced to fly
                    towards Azof, where their army was almost annihilated.</p>
                <p>From this time the empire of Russia became so formidable that none of the
                    neighbouring nations could hope to make a total conquest of it. The Poles and
                    Swedes indeed continued to be very formidable enemies; and, by the instigation
                    of the former, the Crim Tartars, in 1571, again invaded the country with an army
                    of seventy thousand men, which totally defeated the Russians in a battle fought
                    within eighteen miles of the city of Moscow. The Czar retired with his most
                    valuable effects to a well-fortified cloister; upon which the Tartars entered
                    the city, plundered it, and set fire to several churches. A violent storm which
                    happened at the same time soon spread the flames all over the city, which was
                    entirely reduced to ashes in six hours. The fire likewise communicated itself to
                    a powder magazine at some distance from the city; an accident by which upwards
                    of fifty <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=549"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0549-0537"/>rods of the city wall, with all the buildings upon
                    it, were destroyed; and, according to the historians, upwards of a hundred and
                    twenty thousand citizens were burned or buried in the ruins. The castle,
                    however, which was strongly fortified, could not be taken; and the Tartars,
                    hearing that a formidable array was coming against them under the command of
                    Magnus duke of Holstein, whom Ivan had made king of Livonia, thought proper to
                    retire. The war, nevertheless, continued with the Polesand Swedes; and the Czar
                    being defeated by the latter after some trifling success, was reduced to the
                    necessity of suing for peace; but the negotiations being broken off, the war was
                    renewed with the greatest vigour. The Livonians, the Poles, and the Swedes,
                    having united in a league against the Russians, gained great advantages over
                    them; and in 1579, Stephen Batory, who was then raised to the throne of Poland,
                    levied an army expressly with a design of invading Russia, and of regaining all
                    that Poland had formerly claimed, which, indeed, was little less than the whole
                    empire. Ivan found his undisciplined multitudes unable to cope with the regular
                    forces of his enemies; their conquests were so rapid that he was soon obliged to
                    sue for peace, which, however, was not granted; and it is possible that the
                    number of enemies which now attacked Russia might have overcome the empire
                    entirely, had not the allies grown jealous of each other. The consequence of
                    this was, that in 1582 a peace was concluded with the Poles, in which the Swedes
                    were not comprehended. However, the Swedes, finding themselves unable to effect
                    any thing of moment after the desertion of their allies, were obliged to
                    conclude a truce; shortly after which, the Czar, having been worsted in an
                    engagement with the Tartars, died in the year 1584.</p>
                <p>The eldest son of the late Czar, Feodor (or, as he is commonly called, Theodore)
                    Ivanovitch, was by no means fitted for the government of an empire so extensive,
                    and a people so rude and turbulent, as had devolved to him by the death of his
                    father. Ivan had seen the incapacity of his son, and had endeavoured to obviate
                    its effect3 by appointing three of his principal nobles as administrators of the
                    empire; whilst to a fourth he committed the charge of his younger son Dmitri or
                    Demetrius. This expedient, however, failed of success; and, partly from the
                    mutual jealousy of the administrators, partly from the envy which their
                    exaltation had excited in the other nobles, the affairs of the empire soon fell
                    into confusion. The weak Feodor had married a sister of Boris Gudonof, a man of
                    great ambition, immense riches, and tolerable abilities. He had long directed
                    his wishes towards the imperial dignity, and began to prepare the way for its
                    attainment by removing Dmitri. This young prince suddenly disappeared; and there
                    is every reason to believe that he was assassinated by the order of Boris.
                    Feodor did not long survive his brother, but died in 1598, not without suspicion
                    of having been poisoned by his brother-in-law. We are told that the Czarina,
                    Irene, was so much convinced of this, that, retiring to a convent, she never
                    afterwards held any communication with her brother.</p>
                <p>With Feodor ended the family of Ruric, a dynasty which had enjoyed the supreme
                    power in Russia ever since the establishment of the principality by the Varagian
                    chief, that is, during a period of above seven hundred years. On the death of
                    Feodor, as there was no hereditary successor to the vacant throne, the nobles
                    assembled to elect a new Czar; and the artful Boris having, through the interest
                    of the patriarch, procured a majority in his favour, wasdeclared the object of
                    then choice. He pretended unwillingness to accept the crown, declaring that he
                    had resolved to live and die in a monastery; but when the patriarch, at the head
                    of the principal nobles, and attended by a great concourse of people, bearing
                    before them the cross, and the effigies of several saints, repaired to the
                    convent, where the artful usurper had taken up his residence, he was at length
                    prevailed on to accompany them to the palace of the Czars, and suffer himself to
                    be crowned.</p>
                <p>Boris is one instance amongst many of a sovereign who became beneficial to his
                    subjects, though he had procured the throne by unjustifiable means. If we give
                    implicit credit to the historians of those times, he was a murderer and a
                    usurper, though he had the voice of the people in his favour; but by whatever
                    means he had attained the imperial power, he seems to have employed it in
                    advancing the interest of the nation, and in improving the circumstances of his
                    people. He was extremely active in his endeavours to extend the commerce, and
                    improve the arts and manufactures, of the Russian empire; and for this purpose
                    he invited many foreigners into his dominions. Whilst he exerted himself in
                    securing the tranquillity of the country, and defending its frontiers against
                    the incursions of his neighbours, he made himself respected abroad, and received
                    ambassadors from almost all the powers of Europe.</p>
                <p>Soon after the commencement of his reign, the city of Moscow was desolated by one
                    of the most dreadful famines recorded in history. Thousands of people lay dead
                    in the streets and roads; and in many houses the fattest of the inmates was
                    killed to serve as food for the remainder. Parents are said to have eaten their
                    children, and children their parents; and we are told by one writer of the time
                    that he saw a woman bite several pieces out of her child’s arm as she was
                    carrying it along. Another relates, that four women having desired a peasant to
                    come to one of their houses, on pretence of paying him for some wood, killed and
                    devoured both him and his horse. This dreadful calamity lasted three years,
                    notwithstanding all the exertions of Boris to provide for the necessities of the
                    inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Duringthese distresses of the capital, the power of Boris was threatened with
                    annihilation by an adventurer who <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> suddenly started
                    up, and pretended to be the young prince Dmitri, whom all believed to have been
                    assassinated, or, as Boris had given out, to have died of a malignant fever.
                    This adventurer was a monk named Otrepief. He retired from Russia into Poland,
                    where he had the dexterity to ingratiate himself with some of the principal
                    nobles, and to persuade them that he was really the lawful heir to the crown of
                    Russia. The better to insure to himself the support of the Poles, he learned
                    their language, and professed a great regard for the Catholic religion. By this
                    last artifice he both gained the attachment of the Catholic Poles, and acquired
                    the friendship of the Roman pontiff, whose blessing and patronage in his great
                    undertaking he further secured, by promising that, as soon as he should have
                    established himself on the throne, he would make every exertion to bring the
                    Russians within the pale of the Catholic church. To the external graces of a
                    fine person, the pretended Dmitri added the charms of irresistible eloquence;
                    and by these accomplishments the Polish voyvode of Sandomir was so much
                    captivated that he not only espoused his cause, but promised to give him his
                    daughter in marriage as soon as he should be placed on the throne of his
                    fathers. This respectable man exerted himself so warmly in behalf of his
                    intended son-in-law, that he brought over even the king of Poland to his party.
                    The Kozaks of the Don, who were oppressed by Boris, hoping to gain at least a
                    temporary advantage by the disturbance excited in favour of the adventurer,
                    eagerly embraced the opportunity of declaring in his favour. The news soon
                    penetrated into Russia; and although Boris did all in his power to destroy the
                    illusion, by prohibiting all intercourse between his subjects and the Poles, and
                    by appealing to the evidence of the murdered prince’s mother in proof of his
                    death, the cause of the pretender continued to gain ground. Many circumstances
                    concurred to interest the Russian <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=550" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0550-0538"
                    />people in favour of Otrepief. The courtiers of the usurper, who had long been
                    jealous of his elevation, pretended to believe his assertions; whilst those who
                    were persuaded that the young prince had been murdered by order of tile present
                    Czar, regarded this event as a judgment from heaven. The greater part of the
                    nation appear to have been persuaded that the pretender was the real Dmitri; and
                    as they believed that he had been miraculously preserved, they piously resolved
                    to concur with the hand of Providence in assisting him to recover his just
                    rights. Thus, before he had set foot in Russia, a numerous party was formed in
                    his behalf. He soon made his appearance on the frontiers with a regiment of
                    Polish troops, and a body of Kozaks. Boris sent an army to oppose him; but
                    though the number of these troops greatly exceeded the small force of the
                    invaders, the latter were so animated by the eloquence of their leader, and the
                    intrepidity and personal bravery which he displayed in the field of battle,
                    that, after a bloody conflict, the army of Boris was defeated, and the pretended
                    Dmitri remained master of the field.</p>
                <p>This victory served still further to strengthen the belief that Dmitri was
                    favoured by heaven, and consequently could not be an impostor. To confirm the
                    good opinion which he had evidently acquired, the victor treated his prisoners
                    with great kindness; caused the dead to be decently interred; and gave strict
                    injunctions to his troops to behave with humanity in the towns through which he
                    passed. This gentle behaviour, when contrasted with the horrible excesses
                    committed by the soldiers of Boris, wherever the people appeared to show any
                    inclination towards the cause of the invader, gained Dmitri more adherents than
                    even the persuasion that he was the lawful sovereign of the country. Unluckily
                    for Boris, likewise, the superstition of the Russians was about this time
                    directed against him, by the appearance of a comet, and by the more than usual
                    coruscations of the aurora borealis, phenomena which were immediately regarded
                    as manifest demonstrations that the Almighty was pouring out his phials of wrath
                    on the devoted country. Boris, unable to resist the torrent of public opinion in
                    favour of his rival, is said to have taken poison, and thus hastened that fate
                    which he foresaw awaited him if he should fall into the hands of his
                    enemies.</p>
                <p>The death of Boris took place in the year 1605; and though the principal nobility
                    at Moscow placed his son Feodor on the throne, the party of Dmitri was now so
                    strong, that Feodor was dethroned and sent to prison with his mother and sister,
                    within six weeks after his accession.</p>
                <p>The successful monk had now attained the summit of his ambitious hopes, and made
                    his entry into Moscow with the utmost magnificence. Not deeming himself secure,
                    however, whilst the son of Boris remained alive, he is said to have caused him
                    to be strangled, together with one of his sisters. The new Czar, though he
                    evidently possessed great abilities, seems to have been deficient in point of
                    prudence. Instead of conciliating the favour of his subjects, he openly
                    displayed his predilection for the Poles, conferring on them high posts and
                    dignities, and even conniving at the extravagance and enormities which they
                    committed. This impolitic conduct, together with his partiality for the Catholic
                    religion; his marked indifference towards the public worship of the national
                    church, and his want of reverence for the Greek clergy; his marrying a Polish
                    lady; his affectation of Polish manners; his inordinate voluptuousness, and the
                    contempt with which he treated the principal nobility; so exasperated the
                    Russians, Shat discontents and insurrections arose in every quarter of the
                    empire. The populace of the capital were at length roused to fury, by a rumour
                    that a timber fort which he had caused to be constructed before Moscow, was
                    intended to serve as an engine of destruction, and that at a martial spectacle
                    which the Czar was preparing for the entertainment of his bride, the</p>
                <p>Poles, and other foreigners that composed hie body guard, were from this building
                    to cast firebrands into the city, and then slaughter the inhabitants. The people
                    were still further incensed by the clergy, who declaimed against Dmitri as a
                    heretic, and by Schuiskoy, a nobleman who had been condemned to death by the
                    Czar, but had afterwards been pardoned. This nobleman put himself at the head of
                    the enraged mob, and led them to attack the palace. They entered it by assault,
                    put to the sword all the Poles whom they found within its walls, and afterwards
                    extended their massacre to such as were discovered in other parts of the city.
                    Dmitri himself, in attempting to escape, was over taken by his pursuers, and
                    thrust through with a spear; and his dead body, being brought back into the
                    city, lay for three days before the palace, exposed to every outrage that malice
                    could invent or rage inflict. His father-in-law and his wife escaped with their
                    lives, but were detained as prisoners, and the Czarina was confined at
                    Yaroslaf.</p>
                <p>Schuiskoy, who had pretended to be actuated by no other motives than those of the
                    purest patriotism, now aspired to the vacant throne, and had sufficient interest
                    to carry his election. His reign was short and uninteresting, and indeed from
                    this time till the accession of the house of Romanof in 1613, the affairs of
                    Russia have little to gratify our curiosity. Schuiskoy’s reign was disturbed by
                    the pretensions of two fictitious Dmitris, who successively started up, and
                    declared themselves to be either the late Czar, or the prince whom he had
                    personated; and his neighbours the Swedes and Poles, taking advantage of the
                    internal dissensions in the empire, made many successful incursions into Russia,
                    set fire to Moscow, and massacred above a hundred thousand of the people. The
                    Russians, dissatisfied with the reigning prince, treated with several of the
                    neighbouring potentates for the disposal of the imperial crown. They offered it
                    to Vladislaf, or Uladislas, son of Sigismund <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> king of
                    Poland, on condition that he should adopt the Greek persuasion; but as he
                    rejected this preliminary, they turned their eyes first on a son of Charles IX.
                    of Sweden, and then on a young native Russian, Mikhail Feodorovitch, of the
                    house of Romanof, a family which was distantly related to their ancient Czars,
                    and of which the head was then metropolitan of Rost of, and as such held in
                    great estimation. The influence of the clergy, who exerted themselves for
                    Mikhail, both by personal intrigues and by the dissemination of pretended
                    revelations from heaven, silenced the supporters of the other claimants; and
                    after a long series of confusion and disaster, there ascended the Russian throne
                    a new family, whose descendants have raised the empire to a state of grandeur
                    and importance unequalled in any former period.</p>
                <p>Having traced Russia through the obscurer stages of its history, we are now to
                    witness its sudden elevation amongst the powers of Europe, and to accompany it
                    in its hasty strides towards that importance which it has lately assumed. But
                    before ¼ <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> e enter on the transactions that have
                    enriched the pages of the Russian annals since the accession of the house of
                    Romanof, it may not be uninteresting to take a general view of the state of the
                    empire at the beginning of the seventeenth century.</p>
                <p>At this period the government of Russia may be considered as a pure aristocracy,
                    since the supreme power rested in the hands of the nobles and the superior
                    clergy. In particular, the boyars, or chief officers of the army, who were also
                    the privy counsellors of the prince, possessed a very considerable share of
                    authority. The election of the late princes Boris, Dmitri, and Schuiskoy, had
                    been conducted principally by them, in concert with the inhabitants of Mosoow,
                    where was then held the seat of government. The common people, especially those
                    of the inferior towns, though nominally free, had no share in the government or

                    and transferable with the land on which they dwelt. An attempt to annul this
                    barbarous vassalage had been made, both by Boris and by Schuiskoy; but, from the
                    opposition of the nobles, it was abandoned.</p>
                <p>The laws then in force consisted partly of the municipal laws drawn up for the
                    state of Novgorod by Yaroslaf, and partly of an amended code, called <hi
                    rend="italic"> Sudebnih,</hi> promulgated by Ivan Vasiliivitch II. By this
                    Sudebnik the administration of the laws was made uniform throughout the empire,
                    and particular magistrates were appointed in the several towns and districts,
                    all subject to the czar as their chief. The Sudebnik consisted of ninety-seven
                    articles, all containing civil laws; as the penal statutes are only briefly
                    mentioned in some articles, so as to appear either connected with the civil, or
                    as serving to illustrate them. The criminal laws were contained in a separate
                    code, called <hi rend="italic">Gubnaia Gramota,</hi> which is now lost, but is
                    referred to in the civil code. In neither of these codes is there any mention of
                    ecclesiastical affairs; but these were regulated by a set of canons drawn up in
                    1542, under the inspection of Ivan Vasiliivitch, in a grand council held at
                    Moscow. In the civil statutes of the Sudebnik, theft was punished in the first
                    instance by restitution; or, if the thief were unable to restore the property
                    stolen, he became the slave of the injured party till by his labour he had made
                    sufficient compensation. Of murder nothing is said, except where the person
                    slain was a lord or master, when the murderer was to be punished with death.
                    There is no mention of torture, except in cases of theft.</p>
                <p>Before the accession of the house of Romanof, the commercial intercourse which
                    the cities of Novgorod and Pscov, formerly held with the Hanse Towns, had
                    entirely ceased; but this was in some degree compensated by the newly
                    established trade between Russia and England, the centre of which was Archangel.
                    This trade had been lately increased by the products derived from the
                    acquisition of Siberia, in exchange for which the English principally supplied
                    the Russians with broad cloth. In 1568, an English counting-house was
                    established at Moscow, and about the same time the Russian Company was
                    incorporated. Previously to the fifteenth century, the trade of the Russians had
                    been carried on merely by barter; but during that century the coinage of money
                    commenced at Novgorod and Pscov; and from this time their commerce was placed on
                    an equal footing with that of the other European nations.</p>
                <p>Except in the article of commerce, the Russians were deplorably behind the rest
                    of Europe; and though attempts had been made by Ivan <hi rend="italic">L,</hi>
                    Ivan Vasiliivitch II., and Boris, to cultivate their manners and to improve the
                    state of their arts and manufactures, these attempts had failed of success.

                <p>At the accession of Mikhail, who was crowned in June 1613, the Swedes and Poles
                    were in possession of several parts of the empire; and to dislodge these
                    intruders wasthe first object of the new czar. Aware of the difficulty of)
                    contending at once with both these formidable enemies, hei began by negotiating
                    a treaty of peace with Sweden. This was not effected without considerable
                    sacrifices. Mikhail agreed to give up Ingria and Karelia, and to evacuate
                    Es-thonia and Livonia. Thus freed from his most dangerous enemy, he prepared to
                    oppose the Poles, of whom a numerous body had entered Russia, to support the
                    claims of their king’s son Vladislaf. Mikhail proceeded, however, in a very wary
                    manner, and instead of opposing the invaders in the open field, he entrapped
                    them by ambuscades, or allured them into districts already desolated, where they
                    suffered so much from cold and hunger, that in 1619 they agreed to a cessation
                    of hostilities for fourteen years and a half, on condition that the Russians
                    should cede to Poland the government of Smolensk.</p>
                <p>Thus freed from external enemies on terms which, though not very honourable, were
                    the best that the posture of his affairs admitted, Mikhail applied himself to
                    arranging the internal economy of his empire. He began by placing his father at
                    the head of the church, by conferring on him the dignity of patriarch, which had
                    become vacant. The counsels of this venerable man were of great advantage to the
                    emperor, and contributed to preserve that peace and tranquillity by which his
                    reign was in general distinguished. His next step was to form treaties of
                    alliance with the principal commercial states of Europe. He accordingly sent
                    ambassadors into England, Denmark, Holland, and the German empire; and Russia,
                    which had hitherto been considered rather as an Asiatic than a European power,
                    became so respectable in the eyes of her northern neighbours, that they vied
                    with each other in their eagerness for establishing with her commercial
                    relations.</p>
                <p>Mikhail also commenced those improvements of the laws which we shall presently
                    see more fully executed by his son and successor; but the tide of party ran so
                    high, that he could effect only a very imperfect reformation. He was also
                    obliged to put his frontiers in a state of defence, by providing for the
                    expiration of the truce with Poland, which now drew nigh; and as no permanent
                    peace had been established, both parties began to prepare for a renewal of
                    hostilities. Indeed the armistice was broken by the Russians, who, on the death
                    of Sigismund, king of Poland, appeared before Smolensk, justifying the
                    infringement of the treaty, on the pretence that it was concluded with
                    Sigismund, and not</p>
                <p>The houses were in general of timber, and badly constructed, except that in
                    Moscow and other great town3 there were a few built of brick.</p>
                <p>That contempt for the female sex which is invariably a characteristic of
                    defective civilization, was conspicuous among the Russians. The women were kept
                    in a state of perfect bondage, and it was thought a great instance of liberality
                    if a stranger were but permitted to see them. They were scarcely ever allowed to
                    quit the house, even for the purpose of going to church, though attendance on
                    divine worship was considered of the highest importance.</p>
                <p>The men of the middle ranks always repaired about noon to the market, where they
                    transacted business, conversed about public affairs, and attended the courts of
                    judicature to hear the causes that were going forward. In agreements and
                    bargains the highest asseveration was, “If I keep not my word, may it turn to my
                    infamy;” a custom extremely honourable to the nation, as they held the disgrace
                    of having forfeited their word to be the deepest degradation.</p>
                <p>If the wife was so dependent on her husband, the child was still more dependent
                    on his father; for parents were allowed to sell their children. Masters and
                    servants entered into a mutual contract respecting the terms of their
                    connection; and a written copy of this agreement was deposited in the proper
                    court, where, if either party broke the contract, the other might lodge his
                    complaint.</p>
                <p>Single combat still continued to be the last resource in deciding a cause; and to
                    this the judge resorted in cases which he knew not otherwise how to determine.
                    But duels out of court were strictly prohibited; and when these took place, and
                    either party fell, the survivor was regarded as a murderer, and punished
                    accordingly. Personal vengeance was forbidden, under the strictest penalty. The
                    nobles were universally soldiers, and were obliged to appear when summoned, to
                    assist the prince in his wars. Till the end of the sixteenth century the boor
                    was not bound to any particular master. He tilled the ground of a nobleman for a
                    certain time on stated conditions. Thus he either received part of the harvest
                    or of the cattle, a portion of wood, hay, &amp;c.; or he worked five days for
                    the master, and on the sixth was at liberty to till a piece of ground set apart
                    for his use. At tie expiration of the term agreed on, either party might give up
                    the contract; the boor might remove to another master, and the master dismiss
                    the boor that did not suit him.</p>

                <p>with his successors. Nothing of consequence, however, was then executed; and the
                    Russian commander, after having lain there in perfect indolence, with an army of
                    fifty thousand men, for two years, at length raised the siege. Mikhail attempted
                    to engage the Swedes in an alliance with him against Poland; but failing in this
                    negotiation, he concluded a new treaty, which continued unbroken till his death.
                    This event happened in 1645.</p>
                <p>Mikhail was succeeded by his son Alexci; but as the young prince was only fifteen
                    years of age at the time of his father’s death, a nobleman named Morosof had
                    been appointed his governor and regent of the empire. This man possessed all the
                    ambition of Boris, without his prudence and address; and in attempting to raise
                    himself and his adherents to the highest posts in the state, he incurred the
                    hatred of all ranks of the people. Though, by properly organizing the army, he
                    provided for the defence of the empire against external enemies, he shamefully
                    neglected internal policy, and connived at the most flagrant enormities in the
                    administration of justice. These abuses went so far that the populace once
                    stopped the czar as he was returning from church to his palace, calling aloud
                    for righteous judges. Although Alexci promised to make strict inquiry into the
                    nature and extent of their grievances, and to inflict deserved punishment on the
                    guilty, the people had not the patience to await this tardy process, and
                    proceeded to plunder the houses of those nobles who were most obnoxious to them.
                    They were at length pacified, however, on condition that the author of their
                    oppression should be brought to condign punishment. One of the most nefarious
                    judges was executed; and the principal magistrate of Moscow was killed in a
                    tumult. The life of Morosof was spared at the earnest entreaty of the czar, who
                    engaged for his future good behaviour.</p>
                <p>Similar disturbances had broken out at Novgorod and Pscov; but they were happily
                    terminated, chiefly through the exertions of the metropolitan Nico, a man of low
                    birth, who, by his reputation for extraordinary piety and holiness, had raised
                    himself to the patriarchal dignity, and was high in favour with Alexci. The
                    pacific conduct of the neighbouring states did not long continue, though indeed
                    we may attribute the renewal of hostilities to the ambition of the czar.</p>
                <p>The war with Poland was occasioned by Alexci’s supporting the Kozaks, a military
                    horde, who had left the north-• ern shores of the Dnieper, and retired further
                    to the south. Here they had established a military democracy, and during the
                    dominion of the Tartars in Russia had been subject to the kliaa of those tribes;
                    but after the expulsion or subjugation of the Tartars, the Kozaks had put
                    themselves under the guardianship of Poland, to which kingdom they formerly
                    belonged. As the Polish clergy, however, attempted to impose on them the Greek
                    faith, they threw off their allegiance to the king of Poland, and claimed the
                    patronage of Russia. Alexci, who seems to hava sought a pretext for a rupture
                    with that state, gladly received them as his subjects, hoping, by their
                    assistance, to recover the territories which had been ceded to Poland by his
                    father. He began by negotiation, and sent an embassy to the king of Poland,
                    complaining of some Polish publications, in which reflections had been cast on
                    the honour of his father, and demanding that, by way of compensation, the
                    Russian territories formerly ceded should be restored. The king of Poland of
                    course refused so arrogant a demand, and both parties prepared for war. The
                    Russians, assisted by the Kozaks, were so successful in this contest, that the
                    king of Sweden became jealous of Alexci’s good fortune, and apprehensive of an
                    attack. He therefore determined to take a very active part in the war,
                    especially as the Lithuanians, who were extremely averse to the Russian
                    dominion, had sought his protection. The war with Sweden commenced in 1656, and
                    lasted for two years, without any important advantage being gained by either
                    party. A truce was concluded in 1658 for three years, and at the termination of
                    this period a solid peace was established. In the mean time the war with Poland
                    continued, but was at length terminated by an armistice, which was prolonged
                    from time to time during the remainder of Alexci’s life.</p>
                <p>The reign of this monarch is as remarkable for turbulence as that of his
                    predecessor had been for tranquillity. No sooner was peace established with the
                    neighbouring states than fresh commotions shook the empire from within. The Don
                    Kozaks, who now formed a part of the Russian population, felt themselves
                    aggrieved by the rigour with which one of their officers had been treated, and,
                    placing at their head Radzin, the brother of the deceased, broke out into open
                    rebellion. Allured by the spirit of licentiousness and the hopes of plunder,
                    vast numbers, both of Kozaks and inferior Russians, flocked to the standard of
                    Radzin, and formed an army of nearly two hundred thousand men. This force,
                    however, ill armed and quite undisciplined, was formidable merely from its
                    numbers. Radzin himself seems to have placed no reliance on the courage or
                    fidelity of his followers, and eagerly embraced the first opportunity of
                    procuring a pardon by submission. Having been deceived into a belief that this
                    pardon would be granted on his surrendering himself to the mercy of the czar, he
                    set out for Moscow, accompanied by his brother; but when he had arrived within a
                    short distance of the capital, whither notice had been sent of his approach, he
                    was met by a cart containing a gallows, on which he was immediately hanged. His
                    followers, who had assembled at Astracan, were surrounded by the czar’s troops,
                    taken prisoners, and twelve thousand of them hung on the gibbets in the
                    highways.</p>
                <p>The authority which Alexci had obtained over the Don- &lt; skoi Kozaks excited
                    the jealousy of the Sublime Porte, <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> which justly
                    dreaded the extension of the Russian territo-1 ry on the side of the Crimea, a
                    peninsula at that time belonging to Turkey. After a successful attempt on the
                    frontiers of Poland, a Turkish army entered the Ukraine, and the Russians made
                    preparations to oppose them. Alexci endeavoured to form a confederacy against
                    the infidels among the Christian potentates of Europe; but the age of crusading
                    chivalry was over, and the czar was obliged to make head against the Turks, with
                    no assistance but that of the king of Poland. The Turkish arms were for some
                    years victorious, especially on the side of Poland; but at length a check was
                    given to their successes by the Polish general Sobieski, who afterwards ascended
                    the throne of that kingdom. Hostilities between the Turks and Russians were not,
                    however, terminated during the reign of Alexci, and the czar left to his
                    successor the prosecution of the war.</p>
                <p>The reign of Alexci is most remarkable for the improve-. ments introduced by him
                    into the Russian laws. Before' his time the <hi rend="italic">Emannoy
                    Ukases,</hi> or personal orders of the sovereign, were almost the only laws of
                    the country. These edicts were as various as the opinions, prejudices, and
                    passions of men; and before the days of Alexci they produced endless
                    contentions. To remedy this evil, he made a selection, from all the edicts of
                    his predecessors, of such as had been current for a hundred years, presuming
                    that these either were founded in natural justice, or during so long a currency
                    had formed the minds of the people to consider them as just. This digest, which
                    he declared to be the common law of Russia, and which is prefaced by a sort of
                    institute, is known by the title of the <hi rend="italic">Uloshenic</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic"> Selection.</hi> It was long the standard law-book, all edicts
                    prior thereto being declared to be obsolete. He soon made his new code, however,
                    more bulky than even the Selection; and the additions of his successors are
                    beyond enumeration. This was undoubtedly a great and useful work; but Alexci
                    performed another still greater.</p>

                <p>Though there were many courts of judicature in this ’ widely-extended empire, the
                    emperor was always lord paramount, and could take a cause from any court
                    immediately before himself. But as several of the old nobles had the remains of
                    principalities in their families, and held their own courts, the sovereign or
                    his ministers, at a distance up the country, frequently found it difficult to
                    bring a culprit out of one of these hereditary feudal jurisdictions, and to try
                    him by the laws of the empire. This was a very dangerous limitation of imperial
                    power, and the more so that some families claimed even a right of replevance. A
                    fortunate opportunity soon offered of settling the dispute, and Alexci embraced
                    it with great ability.</p>
                <p>Some families on the old frontiers were taxed with their defence, for which they
                    were obliged to maintain regiments; and as they were but scantily indemnified by
                    the state, it sometimes required the exertion of authority to make them keep up
                    their levies. When, by the conquest of Kazan, the frontiers were far extended,
                    these nobles found the regiments no longer burdensome, because, by the help of
                    false musters, the formerly scanty allowance much more than reimbursed them for
                    the expense of the establishment. The consequence was, that disputes arose among
                    them about the right of guarding certain districts, and lawsuits were necessary
                    to settle their respective claims. These were tedious and intricate. The emperor
                    ordered all the family archives to be brought to Moscow, and all documents on
                    both sides to be collected. A time was fixed for the examination; a fine wooden
                    court-house was built; every paper was lodged under a guard; and the day was
                    appointed when the court should be opened and the claims heard. But on that
                    morning the house, with all its contents, was in two hours consumed by fire. The
                    emperor then said, “Gentlemen, henceforward your rank, your privileges, and your
                    courts, are the nation’s, and the nation will guard itself. Your archives are
                    unfortunately lost, but those of the nation remain. I am the keeper, and it is
                    my duty to administer justice for all and to all. Your rank is not private, but
                    national, attached to the services you are actually performing. Henceforward
                    Colonel Buturlin (a private gentleman) ranks before Captain Viazemsky (an old
                    prince).”</p>
                <p>The Russians owe more to this prince than some of their historians seem willing
                    to acknowledge; and there appears to be no doubt that several of the
                    improvements attributed to Peter the Great were at least projected by his
                    father. Under Alexci a considerable trade was opened with China, from which
                    country silks, and other rich stuffs, were brought into Russia, and exchanged
                    for the Siberian furs. The exportation of Russian products to other countries
                    was also increased; and we are assured that Alexci had even projected the
                    formation of a navy, and would have executed the design, had he not been
                    perpetually occupied in foreign wars and domestic troubles.</p>
                <p>Alexci died in 1676, leaving three sons and six daughters. Two of the sons,
                    Feodor and Ivan, were by a first marriage; the third, Peter, by a second. The
                    two former? particularly Ivan, were of a delicate constitution, and some
                    attempts were made by the relations of Peter to set them aside. These attempts,
                    however, proved unsuccessful, and Feodor became the successor of Alexci.</p>
                <p>The reign of this prince was short, and distinguished rather for the happiness
                    which the nation then experienced, than for the importance of the transactions
                    which took place. He continued the war with the Turks for four years after his
                    father’s death, and at length brought it to an honourable conclusion, by a truce
                    for twenty years, after the Turks had acknowledged the Russian right of
                    sovereignty over the Kozaks. Feodor died in 1682, but before his death nominated
                    his half-brother Peter his successor.</p>
                <p>The succession of Peter, though appointed by their fa vourite czar Feodor, was by
                    no means pleasing to the majority of the Russian nobles, and it was particularly
                    opposed by Galitzin, the prime minister of the late czar. This able man had
                    espoused the interest of Sophia, the sister of, Feodor and Ivan, a young woman
                    of eminent abilities and <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> the most insinuating
                    address. Sophia, upon pretence of asserting the claims of her brother Ivan, who,
                    though of a feeble body and weak intellect, was considered as the lawful heir of
                    the crown, had really formed a design of securing the succession to herself; and
                    with that view, had not only insinuated herself into the confidence and good
                    graces of Galitzin, but had brought over to her interests the Stre-Iitzes, who
                    were the body-guard of the czars, and at this time were about fourteen thousand
                    in number. These licentious soldiers assembled for the purpose, as was
                    pretended, of placing on the throne Prince Ivan, whom they proclaimed czar by
                    acclamation. During three days they roved about the city of Moscow, committing
                    the greatest excesses, and putting to death several of the chief officers of
                    state who were suspected of being hostile to the designs of Sophia. Their
                    employer did not, however, entirely gain her point; for as the new czar
                    entertained a sincere affection for his half-brother Peter, he insisted that
                    this prince should share with him the imperial dignity. This was at length
                    agreed to; and on the 6th of May 1682, Ivan and Peter were solemnly crowned
                    joint emperors of all the Russias, while the Princess Sophia was nominated their
                    copartner in the go-vernment-</p>
                <p>From the imbecility of Ivan and the youth of Peter, who was now only ten years of
                    age, the whole power of the government rested with Sophia and her minister
                    Galitzin, although till the year 1687 the names of Ivan and Peter only were
                    annexed to the imperial decrees. Scarcely had Sophia established her authority
                    when she was threatened with deposition, from an alarming insurrection of the
                    Stre-litzes. This was excited by their commander Prince Ko-vanskoi, who had
                    demanded of Sophia that she should marry one of her sisters to his son, but had
                    met with a mortifying refusal. In consequence of this insurrection, which threw
                    the whole city of Moscow into terror and consternation, Sophia and the two young
                    czars took refuge in a monastery about twelve leagues from the capital; and
                    before the Strelitzes could follow them thither, a considerable body of
                    soldiers, principally foreigners, was assembled in their defence. Kovanskoi was
                    taken prisoner, and instantly beheaded; and though his followers at first
                    threatened dreadful vengeance on his executioners, they soon found themselves
                    obliged to submit. From every regiment was selected the tenth man, who was to
                    suffer as an atonement for the rest; but this cruel punishment was remitted, and
                    only the most guilty among the ringleaders suffered death.</p>
                <p>The quelling of these disturbances gave leisure to the friends of Peter to pursue
                    the plans which they had formed for subverting the authority of Sophia; and
                    about this time a favourable opportunity offered, in consequence of a rupture
                    with Turkey. The Porte was now engaged in a war with Poland and the German
                    empire, and both these latter powers had solicited the assistance of Russia
                    against the common enemy. Sophia and her party were averse to the alliance; but
                    as there were in the council many secret friends of Peter, these had sufficient
                    influence to persuade the majority that a Turkish war would be of advantage to
                    the state. They even prevailed on Galitzin to put himself at the head of the
                    army, and thus removed their principal opponent. It is difficult to conceive how
                    a man, so able in the cabinet as Galitzin, could have suffered his vanity so far
                    to get the better of his good sense, as to accept a military command, for which
                    he certainly had no talents. Assembling an army of nearly three hundred thousand
                    men, he marched towards the confines of Turkey, and there consumed two campaigns
                    in marches and countermarches, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=554" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0554-0542"
                    />lost nearly forty"thousand men, partly in unsuccessful skirmishes with the
                    enemy, but chiefly from disease.</p>
                <p>While Galitzin was thus trifling away his time in the south, Peter, who already
                    began to give proofs of those great talents which afterwards enabled him to act
                    so conspicuous a part in the theatre of the north, was strengthening his party
                    among the Russian nobles. His ordinary residence was at a village not far from
                    Moscow, and here he had assembled round him a considerable number of young men
                    of rank and influence, whom he called his play-mates. Among these were two
                    foreigners, Lefort a Genevese, and Gordon a Scotchman, who afterwards signalized
                    themselves in his service. These young men had formed a sort of military
                    company, of which Lefort was captain; and the young czar, beginning with the
                    situation of drummer, gradually rose through every subordinate office. Under
                    this appearance of a military game, Peter was secretly establishing himself in
                    the affections of his young companions, and effectually lulled the suspicions of
                    Sophia, till it was too late for her to oppose his machinations.</p>
                <p>About the middle of the year 1689, Peter, who had now attained his seventeenth
                    year, determined to make an effort to deprive Sophia of all share in the
                    government, and to secure to himself the undivided sovereignty. On occasion of a
                    solemn religious meeting that was held, Sophia had claimed the principal place,
                    as regent of the empire; but this claim was strenuously opposed by Peter, who,
                    rather than fill a subordinate situation, quitted the place of assembly, and,
                    with his friends and adherents, withdrew to the monastery of the Holy Trinity,
                    which had formerly sheltered him and his copartners from the fury of the
                    Strelitzes. This was the signal for an open rupture. Sophia, finding that she
                    could not openly oppose the party of the czar, attempted to procure his
                    assassination; but as her design was discovered, she thought proper to solicit
                    an accommodation. This was agreed to, on condition that she should give up all
                    claim to the regency, and retire to a nunnery. The commander of the Strelitzes,
                    her agent in the assassination of Peter, was beheaded, and the minister Galitzin
                    sent into banishment to Archangel.</p>
                <p>Peter now saw himself in undisputed possession of the imperial throne; for though
                    Ivan was still nominally czar, he had voluntarily resigned all share in the
                    administration of affairs, and retired to a life of obscurity. The first object
                    to which the czar directed his attention was the establishment of a regular and
                    well-disciplined military force. He had learned by experience how little
                    dependence was to be placed on the Strelitzes; and these regiments he determined
                    to disband. He commissioned Lefort and Gordon to levy new regiments, which, in
                    their whole constitution, dress, and military exercises, should be formed on the
                    model of other European troops. He next resolved to carry into execution the
                    design which had been formed by his father, of constructing a navy. For this
                    purpose he first took a journey to Archangel, where he employed himself in
                    examining the operations of the shipwrights, and occasionally taking a part in
                    their labours; but as he learned that the art of ship-building was practised in
                    greater perfection in Holland, and some other maritime countries of Europe, he
                    sent thither several young Russians to be initiated into the best methods of
                    constructing ships of war.</p>
                <p>The war with Turkey still languished, but Peter was resolved to prosecute it with
                    vigour, hoping to get possession <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> of the town of
                    Azof, and thus open a passage to the Black Sea. He placed Gordon, Lefort, and
                    two of his nobles, at the head of the forces destined for this expedition, and
                    himself attended the army as a private volunteer. The success of the first
                    campaign was but trifling; and Peter learned that his deficiency of artillery
                    and his want of transports prevented him from making an effectual attack on
                    Azof. These difficulties, however, were soon surmounted. He procured a supply of
                    artillery and engineers from the emperor and the Dutch, and found means to
                    provide a number of transports. With these auxiliaries he opened the second
                    campaign, defeated the Turks on the Sea of Azof, and made himself master of the
                    town. Peter was so elated with these successes, that on his return from the seat
                    of war he marched his troops into Moscow in a triumphal procession, in which
                    Lefort as admiral of the transports, and Schein as commander of the land forces,
                    bore the most conspicuous parts, while Peter himself was lost without
                    distinction in the crowd of subaltern officers.</p>
                <p>He now resolved to form a fleet in the Black Sea; but as his own revenues were
                    insufficient for this purpose, he issued a ukase, commanding the patriarch and
                    other dignified clergy, the nobility, and the merchants, to contribute a part of
                    their income towards fitting out a certain number of ships. This proclamation
                    was extremely unpopular, and, together with the numerous innovations which Peter
                    was every day introducing, especially his sending the young nobles to visit
                    foreign countries, and his own avowed intention of making the tour of Europe,
                    contributed to raise against him a formidable party. The vigilance and prudence
                    of the czar, however, extricated him from the dangers with which he was
                    threatened, and enabled him to carry into execution his proposed journey.</p>
                <p>In returning to his own dominions, Peter passed through Rawa, where Augustus king
                    of Poland then was. The czar had determined, in conjunction with Augustus and
                    the king of Denmark, to take advantage of the youth and inexperience of Charles
                    XII. who had just succeeded to the Swedish throne; and in this interview with
                    Augustus, he made the final arrangements for the part which each was to take in
                    the war. Augustus was to receive Livonia as his part of the spoil, while
                    Frederick king of Denmark had his eye on Holstein, and Peter had formed designs
                    on Ingria, formerly a province of the Russian empire.</p>
                <p>In the middle of the year 1700, Charles had left his capital to oppose these
                    united enemies. He soon compelled the king of Denmark to give up his designs on
                    Holstein, and sign a treaty of peace; and being thus at liberty to turn his arms
                    against the other members of the confederacy, he resolved first to lead his army
                    against the king of Poland; but on his way he received intelligence that the
                    czar had laid siege to Narva with an army which some authorities calculate at a
                    hundred thousand men. On this he immediately embarked at Carlscrona, though it
                    was then the depth of winter, and the Baltic was scarcely navigable; and soon
                    landed at Pernaw in Livonia with part of his forces, having ordered the rest to
                    Revel. His army did not exceed twenty thousand men, but it was composed of the
                    best soldiers in Europe, while that of the Russians was little better than an
                    undisciplined multitude. Every possible obstruction, however, had been thrown in
                    the way of the Swedes. Thirty thousand Russians were posted in a defile on the
                    road, and this corps was sustained by another body of twenty thousand drawn up
                    some leagues nearer Narva. Peter himself had set out to hasten the march of a
                    reinforcement of forty thousand men, with whom he intended to attack the Swedes
                    in flank and rear; but the celerity and valour of Charles baffled every attempt
                    to oppose him. He set out with four thousand foot and an equal number of
                    cavalry, leaving the rest of the army to follow at their leisure. With this
                    small body he attacked and defeated the Russian armies successively, and pushed
                    his way to Peter’s camp, for the attack of which he gave immediate orders. This
                    camp was fortified by lines of circumvallation and contravallation, by redoubts,
                    and by a line of a hundred and fifty brass cannons placed in front; and it was
                    defended by an army of eighty thousand men; yet so violent was the attack of the
                    Swedes, that in three hours the intrenchments were carried, and Charles, with
                    <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=555"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0555-0543"/>only four thousand men, that composed the wing
                    which he commanded, pursued the flying enemy, amounting to fifty thousand, to
                    the river Narva. Here the bridge broke down with the weight of the fugitives,
                    and the river was filled with their bodies. Great numbers returned in despair to
                    their camp, where they defended themselves for a short time, but were at last
                    obliged to surrender. In this battle, thirty thousand were killed in the
                    intrenchments and the pursuit, or drowned in the river; twenty thousand
                    surrendered at discretion, and were dismissed unarmed, while the rest were
                    totally dispersed. A hundred and fifty pieces of cannon, twenty-eight mortars, a
                    hundred and fifty-one pairs of colours, twenty standards, and all the Russian
                    baggage, fell into the hands of the Swedes; and the Duke de Croy, the Prince of
                    Georgia, and seven other generals, were made prisoners. Charles behaved with the
                    greatest generosity to the conquered. Being informed that the tradesmen of Narva
                    had refused credit to the officers whom he detained prisoners, he sent a
                    thousand ducats to the Duke de Croy, and to every other officer a proportional
                    sum.</p>
                <p>Peter was advancing with forty thousand men to surround the Swedes, when he
                    received intelligence of the dreadful defeat at Narva. He was greatly chagrined;
                    but comforting himself with the hopes that the Swedes would in time teach the
                    Russians to beat them, he returned to his own dominions, where he applied
                    himself with the utmost diligence to the raising of another army. He evacuated
                    all the provinces which he had invaded, and for a time abandoned all his great
                    projects, thus leaving Charles at liberty to prosecute the war against
                    Poland.</p>
                <p>As Augustus had expected an attack, he endeavoured to draw the czar into a close
                    alliance with him. The two monarchs had an interview at Birzen, where it was
                    agreed that Augustus should lend the czar fifty thousand German soldiers, to be
                    paid by Russia; that the czar should send an equal number of his troops to be
                    trained up to the art of war in Poland; and that he should pay the king three
                    millions of rix-dollars in the space of two years. Of this treaty Charles had
                    notice, and, by means of his minister Count Piper, entirely frustrated the
                    scheme.</p>
                <p>After the battle of Narva, Charles became confident and negligent, while the
                    activity of Peter increased with his losses. He supplied his want of artillery
                    by melting down the bells of the churches, and constructed numerous small
                    vessels on the lake of Ladoga to oppose the entrance of the Swedes into his
                    dominions. He took every advantage of Charles’s negligence, and engaged in
                    frequent skirmishes, in which, though often beaten, he was sometimes victorious.
                    He contrived to make himself master of the river Neva, and captured Nyenschantz
                    <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> a fortress at the mouth of that river. Here he laid
                    the foundation of that city which he had long projected, and which was to become
                    the metropolis of his empire. At length, in 1704∙, he became master of Ingria,
                    and appointed his favourite Prince Menzikoff to be viceroy of that province,
                    with strict orders to make the building of the new city his principal business.
                    Here edifices were already rising in every quarter, and navigation and commerce
                    were increasing in vigour and extent.</p>
                <p>In the mean time Augustus king of Poland, though treat-• ing with Charles for the
                    surrender of his dominions, was obliged to keep up the appearance of war, which
                    he had neither ability nor inclination to conduct. He had been lately joined by
                    Prince Menzikoff with thirty thousand Russians; and this obliged him, contrary
                    to his inclination, to hazard an engagement with Meyerfeldt, who commanded ten
                    thousand men, one half of whom were Swedes. As at tnis time no disparity of
                    numbers whatever was reckoned an equivalent to the valour of the Swedes,
                    Meyerfeldt did not decline the combat, though the army of the enemy was four
                    times as numerous as his own. With his own countrymen he defeated the enemy’s
                    first line, and was on the point of defeating the second, when Stanislas, with
                    the Poles and Lithuanians, gave way. Meyerfeldt then perceived that the battle
                    was lost; but he fought desperately, that he might avoid the disgrace of a
                    defeat. At last, however, he was oppressed by numbers, and forced to surrender;
                    suffering the Swedes for the first time to be conquered by their enemies. The
                    whole army were taken prisoners excepting Major-general Krassau, who having
                    repeatedly rallied a body of horse formed into a brigade, at last broke through
                    the enemy, and escaped to Posnania. Augustus had scarcely sung <hi rend="italic"
                    > Te Deum</hi> for this victory, when his plenipotentiary returned from Saxony
                    with the articles of the treaty, by which he was to renounce all claim to the
                    crown of Poland in favour of his rival Stanislas. The king hesitated and
                    scrupled, but at last signed them; after which he set out for Saxony, glad at
                    any expense to be freed from such an enemy as the king of Sweden, and from such
                    allies as the Russians.</p>
                <p>The czar Peter was no sooner informed of this extraordinary treaty, than he
                    learned also the cruel fate of his plenipotentiary Patkul, a Livonian emigrant,
                    whom Charles claiming as a subject, seized and executed. Peter immediately sent
                    letters to every court in Christendom, complaining of this breach of the law of
                    nations. He entreated the emperor, the queen of Britain, and the states-general,
                    to revenge this insult on humanity. He stigmatized the compliance of Augustus
                    with the opprobrious name of pusillanimity; and exhorted them not to guarantee a
                    treaty so unjust, but to despise the menaces of the Swedish bully. So well,
                    however, was the prowess of the king of Sweden known, that none of the allies
                    thought proper to irritate him, by refusing to guarantee any treaty which he
                    thought proper to accept. At first, Peter thought of revenging PatkuPs death by
                    massacring the Swedish prisoners at Moscow; but from this he was deterred, by
                    remembering that Charles had many more Russian prisoners than he himself had of
                    Swedes. In the year 1707, however, he entered Poland at the head of sixty
                    thousand men, and, assembling a diet, solemnly deposed Stanislas, with the same
                    ceremonies which had been used with regard to Augustus. The appearance of a
                    Swedish army under King Stanislas and General Lewenhaupt put a stop to this
                    invasion, and the czar retired into Lithuania, giving out as the cause of his
                    retreat, that the country could not supply him with the provisions and forage
                    necessary for so great an army.</p>
                <p>During these transactions Charles had taken up his residence in Saxony, where he
                    gave laws to the court of Vienna, and in a manner intimidated all Europe. At
                    last, satiated with the glory of having dethroned one king, set up another, and
                    struck all Europe with terror and admiration, he began to evacuate Saxony in
                    pursuit of his great plan, the dethroning the czar Peter, and conquering the
                    vast empire of Russia. While the army was on full march in the neighbourhood of
                    Dresden, he took the extraordinary resolution of visiting King Augustus with no
                    more than five attendants. Although he had no reason to imagine that Augustus
                    either did or could entertain any friendship for him, he was not uneasy at the
                    consequences of thus putting himself entirely in his power. He reached the
                    palace door of Augustus before it was known that he was in the city; and he
                    entered the elector’s chamber in his boots before the latter had time to recover
                    from his surprise. He breakfasted with him in a friendly manner, and then
                    expressed a desire of viewing the fortifications. While he was walking round
                    them, a Livonian, who had formerly been condemned in Sweden, and served in the
                    troops of Saxony, thought he could never have a more favourable opportunity of
                    obtaining pardon. He therefore begged of King Augustus to intercede for him,
                    being fully assured that his majesty could not refuse so small a favour to a
                    prince in whose power he then was. Augustus accordingly made the request, but
                    Charles refused <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=556"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0556-0544"/>it in such a manner that he did not think proper
                    to ask it a second time. Having passed some hours in this extraordinary visit,
                    he returned to his army, after having embraced and taken leave of the king he
                    had dethroned, <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> The armies of Sweden, in Saxony,
                    Poland, and Finland, <hi rend="superscript">!</hi> now exceeded seventy thousand
                    men; while the available force of Russia amounted to about a hundred thousand.
                    Peter, who had his army dispersed in small parties, instantly assembled it on
                    receiving notice of the king of Sweden’s march, was making all possible
                    preparations for a vigorous resistance, and was on the point of attacking
                    Stanislas, when the approach of Charles struck his whole army with terror. In
                    the month of January 1708, Charles passed the Niemen, and entered the south gate
                    of Grodno just as Peter was quitting the place by the north gate. Charles at
                    this time had advanced some distance before the army, at the head of six hundred
                    horse.</p>
                <p>The czar having received intelligence of his situation, sent back a detachment of
                    two thousand men to attack him; but these were entirely defeated, and thus
                    Charles became possessed of the whole province of Lithuania. The king pursued
                    his flying enemies in the midst of ice and snow, over mountains, rivers, and
                    morasses, and through obstacles which appeared to be insurmountable. These
                    difficulties, however, he had foreseen, and had prepared to meet them. As he
                    knew that the country could not furnish provisions sufficient for the
                    subsistence of his army, he had provided a large quantity of biscuit, and on
                    this his troops chiefly subsisted, till they came to the banks of the Beresina,
                    in view of Borisow.' Here the czar was posted, and Charles intended to give him
                    battle, after which he could the more easily penetrate into Russia. Peter,
                    however, did not think proper to come to an action, but retreated towards the
                    Dnieper, whither he was pursued by Charles, as soon as he had refreshed his
                    army. The Russians had destroyed the roads and desolated the country, yet the
                    Swedish army advanced with great celerity, and in their march defeated twenty
                    thousand Russians, though intrenched to the very teeth. This victory, from the
                    circumstances in which it was gained, was one of the most glorious that ever
                    Charles had achieved. The memory of it was preserved by a medal struck in Sweden
                    with this inscription; <hi rend="italic">Sylvoe, paludes, aggeres, hostes,
                    victi.</hi></p>
                <p>VVhen the Russians had repassed the Dnieper, the czar, finding himself pursued by
                    an enemy with whom he could not cope, resolved to make proposals for an
                    accommodation. Charles made only this arrogant reply, “I will treat with the
                    czar at Moscow ;” a taunt which was received by Peter with the coolness of a
                    hero. “My brother Charles,” said he, “affects to play the Alexander, but he
                    shall not find in me a Darius.” He still, however, continued his retreat, and
                    Charles pursued so closely that daily skirmishes took place between his advanced
                    guard and the rear of the Russians. In these actions the Swedes had generally
                    the advantage, though their petty victories cost them dear, by contributing to
                    weaken their force in a country where it could not be recruited. The two armies
                    came so close to each other at Smolensk, that an engagement took place between a
                    body of Russians composed of ten thousand cavalry and six thousand Kalmuks, and
                    the Sw edish vanguard, composed of only six regiments, but commanded by the king
                    in person. Here the Russians were again defeated; but Charles, having been
                    separated from the main body of his detachment, was exposed to great danger.
                    With one regiment only he fought with such fury as to drive the enemy before
                    him, when they thought themselves sure of making him prisoner.</p>
                <p>By the 3d of October 1708, Charles had approached within a hundred leagues of
                    Moscow; but Peter had rendered the roads completely impassable, and had
                    destroyed the villages on every side, so as to cut off every possibility of
                    subsistence to the enemy, while the season was far advanced, and the severity of
                    winter was approaching. In these circumstances, the king, at length sensible
                    that he had committed a perilous mistake, endeavoured to retrieve it by a step
                    which proved yet more calamitous. He resolved, before attacking the Russian
                    capital, to achieve the conquest of the Ukraine, where Mazeppa, a Polish
                    gentleman, was general and chief of the Kozaks. Mazeppa having been affronted by
                    the czar, readily entered into a treaty with Charles, whom he promised to assist
                    with thirty thousand men, great quantities of provisions and ammunition, and
                    with all his treasures, which were falsely stated to be immense. The Swedish
                    army advanced towards the rivet' Disna, where they had to encounter the greatest
                    difficulties; a forest above forty leagues in extent, filled with rocks,
                    mountains, and morasses. To complete their misfortunes, they were led thirty
                    leagues out of the right way; all the artillery was sunk in bogs and marshes;
                    the provision of the soldiers, which consisted of biscuit, was exhausted; and
                    the whole army were spent and emaciated when they arrived at the Disna. Here
                    they expected to have met Mazeppa with his reinforcement; but instead of that,
                    they perceived the opposite banks of the river covered with a hostile army, and
                    the passage itself rendered almost impracticable. Charles, however, was still
                    undaunted; he let his soldiers by ropes down the steep banks; they crossed the
                    river either by swimming, or on rafts hastily put together, drove the Russians
                    from their post, and continued their march. Mazeppa soon after appeared, having
                    with him about six thousand men, the broken remains of the army he had promised.
                    The Russians had got intelligence of his designs, defeated and dispersed his
                    adherents, laid his town in ashes, and taken all the stores collected for the
                    Swedish army. However, he still hoped to be useful by his intelligence in an
                    unknown country; and the Kozaks, out of revenge, crowded daily to the camp with
                    provisions.</p>
                <p>Greater misfortunes still awaited the Swedes. Wlien Charles entered the Ukraine,
                    he had sent orders to General Lewenhaupt to meet him with fifteen thousand men,
                    six thousand of whom were Swedes, and a large convoy of provisions. Against this
                    detachment Peter now bent his whole force, and marched against him with an army
                    of sixty-five thousand men. Lewenhaupt had received intelligence that the
                    Russian army consisted of only twenty-four thousand, a force to which he thought
                    six thousand Swedes superior, and therefore disdained to intrench himself. A
                    furious contest ensued, in which the Russians were defeated with the loss of
                    fifteen thousand men. Now, however, affairs began to take another turn. The
                    Swedes, elated with victory, prosecuted their march into the interior; but, from
                    the ignorance or treachery of their guides, they were led into a marshy country,
                    where the roads were made impassable by felled trees and deep ditches. Here they
                    were attacked by the czar with his whole array. Le-wenliaupt had sent a
                    detachment to dispute the passage of a body of Russians over a morass; but
                    finding his detachment likely to be overpolvered, he marched to support them
                    with all his infantry. Another desperate battle ensued. The Russians were once
                    more thrown into disorder, and were just on the point of being totally defeated,
                    when Peter gave orders to the Kozaks and Kalmuks to fire upon all that fled;
                    “Even kill me,” said he, “if I should be so cowardly as to turn my back.” The
                    battle was now renewed with great vigour; but notwithstanding the czar’s
                    positive orders, and his own example, the day would have been lost, had not
                    General Bauer arrived with a strong reinforcement of fresh Russian troops. The
                    engagement was once more renewed, and continued without intermission till night.
                    The Swedes then took possession of an advantageous post, but were next morning
                    attacked by the <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=557"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0557-0545"/>Russians. Lewenhaupt had formed a sort of rampart
                    with his waggons, but was obliged to set fire to them to prevent their falling
                    into the hands of the Russians, while he retreated under cover of the smoke. The
                    czar’s troops, however, arrived in time to save five hundred of these waggons,
                    filled with provisions destined for the distressed Swedes. A strong detachment
                    was sent to pursue Lewenhaupt; but so terrible did he now appear, that the
                    Russian general offered him an honourable capitulation. This was rejected with
                    disdain, and a fresh engagement took place, in which the Swedes, now reduced to
                    four thousand, again defeated their enemies, and killed five thousand on the
                    spot. After this Lewenhaupt was allowed to pursue his retreat without
                    molestation, though deprived of all his cannon and provisions. Prince MenzikofT
                    was indeed detached with a body of forces to harass him on his march; but the
                    Swedes were now so formidable, even in their extremity, that Menzikoff dared not
                    to attack them, so that Lewenhaupt with his four thousand men arrived safe in
                    the camp of Charles, after having destroyed nearly thirty thousand of the
                    Russians.</p>
                <p>This may be said to have been the last successful effort of Swedish valour
                    against the troops of Peter. The difficulties which Charles’s army had now to
                    undergo exceeded what human nature could support; yet still they hoped by
                    constancy and courage to subdue them. In the severest winter known for a long
                    time, even in Russia, they made long marches, clothed like savages in the skins
                    of wild beasts. All the draught-horses perished; thousands of soldiers dropt
                    down dead through cold and hunger; and by the month of February 1709 the whole
                    army was reduced to eighteen thousand. Amidst numberless difficulties these
                    penetrated to Pultava, a town on the eastern frontier of the Ukraine, where the
                    czar had laid up magazines, of which Charles resolved to obtain possession.
                    Mazeppa advised the king to invest the place, in consequence of his having
                    correspondence with some of the inhabitants, by whose means he hoped it would be
                    surrendered. He was, however, de-cei ved. The besieged made an obstinate
                    defence; the Swedes were repulsed in every assault, and eight thousand of them
                    were defeated, and almost entirely cut off, in an engagement with a party of
                    Russians. To complete his misfortunes, Charles received a shot in his heel from
                    a carabine, which shattered the bone. For six hours afterwards, he continued
                    calmly on horseback, giving orders, till he fainted with the loss of blood;
                    after which he was carried into his tent.</p>
                <p>For some days the czar, with an army of seventy thousand men, had lain at a small
                    distance, harassing the Swedish camp, and cutting off the convoys of provision;
                    but now intelligence was received that he was advancing as if with a design of
                    attacking the lines. In this situation, Charles, wounded, distressed, and almost
                    surrounded by enemies, is said to have, for the first time, assembled a grand
                    council of war, the result of which was, that it was determined to march out and
                    attack the Russians. Voltaire, however, asserts that the king did not relax one
                    iota of his wonted obstinacy and arbitrary temper; but that, on the 7th of July,
                    he sent for General Renschild, and told him, without any emotion, to prepare for
                    attacking the enemy next morning.</p>
                <p>The 8th of July 1709 is remarkable for the battle which decided the fate of
                    Sweden. Charles, having left eight thousand men in the camp to defend the works
                    and repel the sallies of the besieged, began by break of day to march against
                    his enemies with the rest of the army, consisting of twenty-six thousand men, of
                    whom eighteen thousand were Kozaks. The Russians were drawn up in two lines
                    behind their in-trenchments, the horse in front, and the foot in the rear, with
                    chasms to suffer the horse to fall back in case of necessity. General
                    Slippenbach was despatched to attack the cavalry, which he did with such
                    impetuosity that they were broken in an instant. They, however, rallied behind
                    the infantry, and returned to the charge with so much vigour, that the Swedes
                    were disordered in their turn, and Slippen-bach was made prisoner. Charles was
                    now carried in his ' litter to the scene of confusion. His troops, re-animated
                    by the presence of their leader, returned to the charge, and the battle became
                    doubtful, when a blunder of General Creuk, who had been despatched by Charles to
                    take the enemy in flank, and a successful manoeuvre of Prince Menzikoff, decided
                    the fortune of the day in favour of the Russiane. Creuk’s detachment was
                    defeated, and Menzikoff, who had been sent by Peter with a strong body to post
                    himself between the Swedes and Pultava, so as to cut off the communication of
                    the enemy with their camp, and fall upon their rear, executed his orders with so
                    much success as to intercept a corps de reserve of three thousand men. Charles
                    had ranged his remaining troops in two lines, with the infantry in the centre,
                    and the horse on the two wings. They had already twice rallied, and were now
                    again attacked on all sides with the utmost fury. Charles in his litter, with a
                    drawn sword in one hand, and a pistol in the other, seemed to be everywhere
                    present; but new misfortunes awaited him. A cannon-ball killed both horses in
                    the litter; and scarcely were these replaced by a fresh pair, when a second ball
                    struck the litter in pieces, and overturned the king. The Swedish soldiers,
                    believing him killed, fell back in consternation. The first line was completely
                    broken, and the second fled. Charles, though disabled, did every thing in his
                    power to restore order; but the Russians, emboldened by success, pressed so hard
                    on the flying foe, that it was impossible to rally them. Renschild and several
                    other general officers were taken prisoners, and Charles himself would have
                    shared the same fate, had not Count Poniatowski, father of the future favourite
                    of Catherine IL, with five hundred horse, surrounded the royal person, and with
                    desperate fury cut his way through ten regiments of the Russians. With this
                    small guard the king arrived on the banks of the Dnieper, and was followed by
                    Lewenhaupt with four thousand foot and all the remaining cavalry. The Russians
                    took possession of the Swedish camp, where they found a prodigious sum in
                    specie; while Prince Menzikoff pursued the flying Swedes, and, as they were in
                    want of boats to cross the Dnieper, obliged them to surrender at discretion.
                    Charles escaped with the utmost difficulty, but at length reached Otchakof, on
                    the frontiers of Turkey.</p>
                <p>By this decisive victory, Peter remained in quiet possession of his new
                    acquisitions on the Baltic, and was enabled to carry on, without molestation,
                    the improvements which he had projected at the mouth of the Neva. His haughty
                    rival, so long and so justly dreaded, was now completely humbled, and his ally
                    the king of Poland was again established on his throne. During the eight years
                    that had elapsed from the battle of Narva to that of Pultava, the Russian troops
                    had acquired the discipline and steadiness of veterans, and had at length
                    learned to beat their former conquerors. If Peter had decreed triumphal
                    processions for his trifling successes at Azof, it is not surprising that he
                    should commemorate by similar pageants a victory so glorious and so important as
                    that of Pultava. He made his triumphal entry into Moscow for the third time, and
                    the public rejoicings on this occasion far exceeded all that had before been
                    witnessed in the Russian empire.</p>
                <p>The vanquished Charles had, in the mean time, found a valuable friend in the
                    monarch in whose territories he had taken refuge. Achmet II. who then filled the
                    Ottoman throne, had beheld with admiration the warlike achievements of the
                    Swedish hero; and, alarmed at the late successes of his rival, determined to
                    afford Charles the most effectual aid. In 1711, the Turkish emperor assembled an
                    immense army, and was preparing to invade the Russian territories, when the
                    czar, having intimation of his design, and expecting powerful support from
                    Cantemir, hospodar of Moldavia, a vassal of the Porte, resolved to anticipate
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=558"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0558-0546"/>Turks, and to make an inroad into Moldavia.
                    Forgetting his usual prudence and circumspection, Peter crossed the Dnieper, and
                    advanced by rapid marches as far as Yassy or Jassy, the capital of that
                    province, which is situated on the river Pruth; but his temerity had nearly cost
                    him his liberty, if not his life. The particulars of his dangerous situation,
                    with the manner in which he ⅜ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> as extricated from
                    it by the prudent counsel of his consort Catherine, and the treaty of the Pruth
                    <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> which was the result of that counsel, have been
                    already related under the head of Cathebine I.</p>
                <p>By this treaty, in which the interests of Charles had been almost abandoned,
                    Peter saw himself delivered from a dangerous enemy, and returned to his capital
                    to prosecute those plans for the internal improvement of his empire which justly
                    entitled him to the appellation of Great. Before we enumerate these
                    improvements, however, we must bring the Swedish war to a conclusion. The death
                    of Charles, in 1718, had left the Swedish government deplorably weakened, by the
                    continual drains of men and money occasioned by his mad enterprises, and little
                    able to carry on a war with a monarch so powerful as Peter. At length,
                    therefore, in 1721, this ruinous contest, which had continued ever since the
                    commencement of the century, was brought to a conclusion by the treaty of
                    Nystadt <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> by which the Swedes were obliged to cede to
                    Russia, Livonia, Esthonia, Ingria, a part of Karelia, the territory of Vyborg,
                    the isle of Oesel, and all the other islands in the Baltic, from Courland to
                    Vyborg; for which concessions they received back Finland, that had been
                    conquered by Peter, together with two millions of dollars, and the liberty of
                    exporting duty free, from Riga, Revel, and Arensberg, corn to the annual amount
                    of fifty thousand roubles. In consequence of this great accession to the Russian
                    empire, Peter received from his senate the title of Emperor and Autocrat of all
                    the Rus-sias, and the ancient title of czar fell into disuse.</p>
                <p>The improvements introduced by Peter into the internal policy of the empire must
                    be acknowledged to have been numerous and important. He organized anew the
                    legislative assembly of the state; he greatly ameliorated the administration of
                    justice; he new-modelled the national army; he entirely created the Russian
                    navy; he rendered the ecclesiastical government milder and less intolerant; he
                    zealously patronized the arts and sciences; he erected an observatory at St
                    Petersburg, and by publicly proclaiming the approach of an eclipse, and the
                    precise time at which it was to take place, taught his subjects no longer to
                    consider such a phenomenon as an omen of disaster, or an awful menace of divine
                    judgment. He enlarged the commerce of his empire, and gave every encouragement
                    to trade and manufactures. He formed canals, repaired the roads, instituted
                    regular posts, and laid down regulations for a uniformity of weights and
                    measures. Lastly, he in some measure civilized his subjects, though it is
                    evident that he could not civilize himself.</p>
                <p>Various have been the estimates formed of the character of Peter by those who
                    have detailed the events of his reign. It is certain that to him the Russian
                    empire is indebted for much of that splendour with which it now shines among the
                    powers of Europe. As a monarch, therefore, he is entitled to our admiration; but
                    as a private individual we must consider him as an object of detestation and
                    abhorrence. His tyranny and his cruelty admit of no excuse; and if we were to
                    suppose, that in sacrificing the heir of his crown he emulated the patriotism of
                    the elder Brutus, we must remember that the same hand which signed tile
                    death-warrant of his son, could with pleasure execute the sentence of the law,
                    or rather of his own caprice, and, in the moments of dissipation and revelry,
                    could make the axe of justice an instrument of diabolical vengeance or of cool
                    brutality.</p>
                <p>Peter was succeeded by his consort Catherine, in whose favour he had, some years
                    before his death, altered the order of succession. As the character of this
                    princess, and the transactions of her short reign, have been fully detailed
                    under her life, we shall here only notice in the most cur- sory manner the
                    events that took place. From the com-, mencement of her reign, Catherine
                    conducted herself with the greatest benignity and gentleness, and thus secured
                    the love and veneration of her subjects, which she had acquired during the life
                    of the emperor. She reduced the annual capitation tax; ordered the numerous
                    gibbets which Peter had erected in various parts of the country to be cut down;
                    and caused the bodies of those who had fallen victims to his tyranny to be
                    decently interred. She recalled the greater part of those whom Peter had exiled
                    to Siberia; paid the troops their arrears; and restored to the Kozaks those
                    privileges and immunities of which they had been deprived during the late reign,
                    while she continued in office most of the servants of Peter, both civil and
                    military. In her reign the boundaries of the empire were extended by the
                    submission of a Georgian prince, and the voluntary homage of the Kubinskian
                    Tartars. She died on the 17th of May 1727, having reigned about two years. She
                    had settled the crown on Peter the son of the Czarovitch Alexci, who succeeded
                    by the title of Peter II.</p>
                <p>Peter was only twelve years of age when he ascended tile imperial throne, and his
                    reign was short and uninteresting· He was guided chiefly by Prince MenzikofF,
                    whose daughter Catherine had decreed him to marry. This ambitious man, who, from
                    the mean condition of a pye-boy, had risen to the first offices of the state,
                    and had, during the late reign, principally conducted the administration of the
                    government, was now, however, drawing towards the end of his career. The number
                    of his enemies had greatly increased, and their attempts to work his downfall at
                    last succeeded. A young nobleman of the family of the Dol-goruki, who was one of
                    Peter’s chief companions, was excited by his relations, and the other enemies of
                    MenzikofF, to instil into the mind of the young prince feelings hostile to that
                    minister. In this commission he succeeded so well, that MenzikofFand his whole
                    family, not excepting the young empress, were banished to Siberia, and the
                    Dolgorukis took into their hands the management of affairs. These artful
                    counsellors, instead of cultivating the naturally good abilities of Peter,
                    encouraged him to waste his time and exhaust his strength in hunting and other
                    athletic exercises, ∙for which his tender years were by no means calculated. It
                    is supposed that the debility consequent on such fatigue increased the natural
                    danger of the small-pox, with which he was attacked in January 1730, and from
                    which he never recovered.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the absolute power with which Peter I. and the Empress Catherine
                    had settled by will the title to the throne, the Russian senate and nobility,
                    upon the death of Peter II. ventured to set aside the order of succession which
                    those sovereigns had established. The male issue of Peter was now extinct; and
                    the Duke of Holstein, son to Peter’s eldest daughter, was by the destination of
                    the late empress entitled to the crown; but the Russians, for political reasons,
                    filled the throne with Anne duchess of Courland, second daughter to Ivan, the
                    eldest brother of Peter, though her eldest sister, the Duchess of Mecklenburg,
                    was still alive. Anne’s reign was extremely prosperous; and though she accepted
                    the crown under limitations which some thought derogatory to her dignity, yet
                    she broke them all, asserted the prerogative of her ancestors, and punished the
                    aspiring Dolgoruki family, who had imposed those restrictions, with a view, as
                    it is said, that they themselves might govern. She raised her favourite Biren to
                    the duchy of Courland; and was obliged to give way to many severe executions on
                    his account-Few transactions of any importance took place during the reign of
                    Anne. She followed the example of her great predecessor Peter, by interposing in
                    the affairs of Poland, where she <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=559" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0559-0547"
                    />had sufficient interest to establish on the throne Augustus III. She entered
                    into a treaty with the shah of Persia, by which she agreed to give up all title
                    to the territories that had been seized by Peter I. on the shores of the
                    Caspian, in consideration of certain privileges to be granted to the Russian
                    merchants.</p>
                <p>In 1735, a rupture took place between Russia and Turkey, occasioned partly by the
                    mutual jealousies that had subsisted between these powers ever since the treaty
                    on the Pruth <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> and partly by the depredations of the
                    Tartars of the Crimea, then under the dominion of the Porte. A Russian army
                    entered the Crimea, ravaged part of the country, and killed a considerable
                    number of Tartars; but having ventured too far, without a sufficient supply of
                    provisions, it was obliged to retreat, after sustaining a loss of nearly ten
                    thousand men. This ill success did not discourage the court of St Petersburg;
                    and in the following year another armament was sent into the Ukraine, under the
                    command of Marshal Munnich, while another army under Lascy proceeded against
                    Azof. Both these generals met with considerable success; the Tartars were
                    defeated, and the fort of Azof once more submitted to the Russian arms. A third
                    campaign took place in 1737, and the Russians were now assisted by a body of
                    Austrian troops. Munnich laid siege to Otchakof, which soon surrendered, while
                    Lascy desolated the Crimea.</p>
                <p>No material advantages were, however, gained upon either side; and disputes arose
                    between the Austrian and Russian generals. At length, in 1739, Marshal Munnich,
                    having crossed the Bog at the head of a considerable army, defeated the Turks in
                    a pitched battle near Stavutshan; made himself master of Yassy, the capital of
                    Moldavia; and before the end of the campaign reduced the whole of that province
                    under his subjection. These successes of the Russian arms induced the Porte to
                    propose terms of accommodation; and in the end of 1739 a treaty was concluded,
                    by which Russia again gave up Azof and Moldavia, and, to compensate the loss of
                    above a hundred thousand men, and vast sums of money, gained nothing but
                    permission to build a fortress on the Don.</p>
                <p>Upon the death of Anne, which took place in 1740, Ivan, the son of her niece the
                    Princess of Mecklenburg, was, by her will, entitled to the succession; but as he
                    was no more than two years old, Biren was appointed to be administrator of the
                    empire during his minority. This nomination was disagreeable to the emperor’s
                    father and mother, and unpopular among the Russians. Count Munnich was employed
                    by the princess to arrest Biren, who was tried and condemned to die, but was
                    sent into exile to Siberia.</p>
                <p>The administration of the Princess Anne of Mecklenburg and her husband was upon
                    many accounts disagreeable, not only to the Russians, but to other powers of
                    Europe; and the Princess Elizabeth, daughter of Peter the Great by Catherine,
                    formed such a party, that in one night’s time she was proclaimed empress of the
                    Russias, and the Princess of Mecklenburg, her husband, and son, were made
                    prisoners. The fate of this unhappy family was peculiarly severe. All but Ivan
                    were sent into banishment, to an island at the mouth of the Dvina, in the White
                    Sea, where the Princess Anne died in childbed in the year 1747. Ivan’s father
                    survived till 1775, and at last ended his miserable career in prison. The young
                    emperor Ivan was for some time shut up in a monastery at Oranienburg, when, on
                    attempting to escape, he was removed to the castle of Schlusselburg, where he
                    was cruelly put to death.</p>
                <p>The chief instrument in rousing the ambition of Elizabeth, and procuring her
                    elevation to the throne, was her physician and favourite Lestocq, who, partly by
                    his insinuating address, and partly by the assistance of French gold, brought
                    over to Elizabeth’s interest most of the royal guards. During the short regency
                    of Anne of Mecklenburg, a new war had commenced between Russia and Sweden; and
                    this war was carried on with considerable acrimony and some success by
                    Elizabeth. The Russian forces took possession of Abo, and made themselves
                    masters of nearly all Finland. But at length, in 1743, in consequence of the
                    negotiations that were carrying on regarding the succession to the Swedish
                    crown, a peace was concluded between the two powers, on the condition that
                    Elizabeth should restore the greater part of Finland.</p>
                <p>Soon after her accession, Elizabeth determined to nominate her successor to the
                    imperial throne, and had fixed! her eyes on Charles Peter Ulric, son of the Duke
                    of Hol-* stein-Gottorp, by Anne, daughter of Peter the Great. This’ prince was
                    accordingly invited into Russia, persuaded to, become a member of the Greek
                    church, and proclaimed Grand Duke of Russia, and heir of the empire. The
                    ceremony of his baptism was performed on the 18th of November 1742, when he
                    received the name of Peter Feodorovitch. He was at this time only fourteen years
                    of age; but before he had attained his sixteenth year, his aunt had destined him
                    a consort in the person of Sophia Augusta Frederica, daughter of Christian
                    Augustus prince of Anhalt-Zerbst-Dornburg. This princess, on entering the Greek
                    church, took the name of Catherine which she afterwards bore on the throne.</p>
                <p>Having thus settled the order of succession, Elizabeth began to take an active
                    part in the politics of Europe. The* death of Charles VI. emperor of Germany,
                    had left his! daughter, Maria Theresa queen of Hungary, at the mercy of the
                    enterprising king of Prussia, till a formidable party was organized in her
                    behalf. To this confederacy the empress of Russia acceded, and in 1747 sent a
                    considerable body of troops into Germany, to the assistance of the
                    empress-queen. The events of this long and bloody contest have been fully
                    detailed in the article Prussia, comprehending the greater part of those
                    transactions in the reign of Elizabeth that do not particularly regard the
                    internal policy of the empire. The more private transactions of the court of St
                    Petersburg, as far as they are connected with the intrigues of her niece
                    Catherine and the follies of the Grand Duke Peter, have also been related in our
                    life of Catherine II. Elizabeth died on the 5th of January 1762, the victim of
                    disease brought on by intemperance. With her character as a private woman we
                    have little business here. Her merits as a sovereign are fairly estimated in the
                    following sketch of her character by Tooke.</p>
                <p>“Elizabeth, as empress, governed but little of herself, it being properly her
                    ministers and favourites who dictated' her regulations and decrees. Of this
                    number, besides Bestnehef, was also Razumofsky, to whom, it has been said, the
                    empress was even privately married. At the beginning of her reign, it is true,
                    she went a few times to the sitting of the senate; but the matters transacted
                    there were by much too serious for her mind; and, accordingly, she very soon
                    left off that practice altogether, contenting herself by confirming with her
                    signature the resolutions of that assembly, and the determinations of her
                    minister, or the conference, which supplied the place of the council.</p>
                <p>“Her character in general was mild, as was evident from the tears it cost her
                    whenever she received accounts from Prussia even of victories gained by her own
                    army, on account of the human blood by which they must necessarily have been
                    purchased. Yet even this delicate sensibility did not restrain her from
                    prosecuting the war into which she had entered from a species of revenge, and
                    for the purpose of humbling the king of Prussia, and, even on her death-bed,
                    from exhorting the persons who surrounded her to the most vigorous continuation
                    of it. It also proceeded from this sensibility, that immediately on her
                    accession to the government she made the vow never to put her signature to a
                    sentence of death. A resolution which she faith <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=560" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0560-0548"
                    />fully kept, though it cannot be averred to have been for the benefit of the
                    empire; since, in consequence of it, the number of malefactors who deserved to
                    die was every day increasing, insomuch that even the clergy requested the
                    empress to retract her vow, at the same time urging proofs that they could
                    release her from it. All the arguments they could use, however, were of no avail
                    to move the conscientious monarch; she would not give effect to any sentence of
                    death, although the commanders in the army particularly would have been glad
                    that her conscience had yielded a little on that point. They declared that the
                    soldiers were not to be restrained from their excesses by the severest corporal
                    punishments they could employ; whereas such was their dread of a solemn
                    execution, that a few examples of that nature would have effectually kept them
                    in awe.</p>
                <p>“Commerce and literature, arts, manufactures, handicrafts, and the other means of
                    livelihood, which had been fostered by the former sovereigns, continued their
                    course under Elizabeth with increasing prosperity. The country products were
                    obtained and wrought up in greater quantities, and several branches of profit
                    were more zealously carried on. The sum appointed for the support of the Academy
                    of Sciences founded by Peter I. at St Petersburg, was considerably augmented by
                    Elizabeth; and she moreover established, in 1758, the academy still subsisting
                    for the arts of painting and sculpture, in which a number of young persons are
                    brought up as painters, engravers, statuaries, architects, &amp;c. At Moscow she
                    endowed a university and two gymnasia.</p>
                <p>“The Empress Elizabeth herself having a good voice, music, which Anne had already
                    much encouraged, found under her administration a perpetual accession of
                    disciples and admirers; so that even numbers of persons of distinction at St
                    Petersburg became excellent performers. The art of acting plays was now also
                    more general among the Russians. Formerly none but French or Italian pieces were
                    performed on the stage of St Petersburg, whereas now Sumarokof obtained
                    celebrity as a dramatic poet in his native language, and, in 1756, Elizabeth
                    laid the foundation of a Russian theatre in her residence. Architecture likewise
                    found a great admirer and patroness in her, St Petersburg and its vicinity being
                    indebted to her for great embellishments and numerous structures.</p>
                <p>“The magnificence which had prevailed under Anne at the court of St Petersburg
                    was not diminished during her reign, and the court establishment therefore
                    amounted to extraordinary sums. Elizabeth, indeed, in this respect did not
                    imitate her great father; and accordingly in the Seven Years’ War the want of a
                    well-stored treasury was already very sensibly felt.</p>
                <p>“The population of the empire was considerably increased under her reign; and so
                    early as 1752, according to the statement in an account published by an official
                    person, it was augmented by one fifth.</p>
                <p>“Elizabeth continued the practice of her predecessors in encouraging foreigners
                    to come to settle in her empire. Emigrant Servians cultivated a considerable
                    tract of land, till then almost entirely uninhabited, on the borders of Turkey,
                    where they built the town of Elizabethgorod, and multiplied so fast, that in the
                    year 1764 a particular district was formed of these improvements, under the name
                    of New Servia. Only the Jews Elizabeth was no less resolute not to tolerate than
                    her father had been; insomuch that, so early in her reign as 1743, they were
                    ordered to quit the country on pain of death.</p>
                <p>“The army was augmented under Elizabeth, but certainly not improved. There were
                    now no longer at the head of it such men as the foreigners Munnich, Keith, or
                    Loevendal, who, besides their personal courage and intrepidity, possessed the
                    soundest principles of the art of war; and, what is of no less consequence in a
                    commander, kept up a strict discipline, and took care that the laws of
                    su⅛or-dination were punctually observed. The excessive license which the
                    regiments of guards, particularly the life company of the Preobajerskoy guards,
                    presumed to exercise, under the very eyes of the empress in St Petersburg,
                    afforded no good example to the rest of the army; and Elizabeth, in appointing
                    those soldiers of that life company who had been most guilty of flagrant
                    disorders, and the basest conduct, to be officers in the marching regiments,
                    gives us no very high idea of what was required in an officer, but rather serves
                    easily to explain whence it arose that such frequent complaints were made of
                    insubordination. A great number of excellent regulations that had been
                    introduced into the army, and always enforced by foreigners, especially by
                    Mun-nich, were suffered by the Russian generals to fall into total disuse. The
                    bad effects of this negligence were very soon perceived; and it was undoubtedly
                    a circumstance highly favourable to the Russian troops, that for several years
                    successively in the war which we have had occasion so often to mention, they had
                    to engage with such a master in the military art as the king of Prussia, and by
                    their conflicts with him, as well as by their connection with the Austrians, and
                    in the sequel with the Prussian soldiery, had an opportunity of learning so many
                    things, and of forming themselves into regular combatants.</p>
                <p>“Elizabeth tarnished her reign, however, by the institution of a political court
                    of inquisition, under the name of a secret state chancery, empowered to examine
                    into and punish all such charges as related to the expression of any kind of
                    displeasure against the measures of government. This, as is usual in such cases,
                    opened a door to the vilest practices. The lowest and most profligate of mankind
                    were now employed as spies and informers, and were rewarded for their
                    denunciations and calumnies against the most virtuous characters, if these
                    happened by a look, a shrug of the shoulders, or a few harmless words, to
                    signify their disapprobation of the proceedings of the sovereign.”</p>
                <p>The grand duke ascended the throne by the name of Peter III. This prince’s
                    conduct has been variously represented. He entered on the government possessed
                    of an enthusiastic admiration of the virtues of the king of Prussia, with whom
                    he immediately made peace, and whose principles and practice he seems to have
                    adopted as patterns for his imitation. He <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> might
                    have surmounted the effects even of these peculiarities, unpopular as they then
                    were in Russia; but it is said that he aimed at reforms in his dominions which
                    Peter the Great durst not attempt; and that he even ventured to cut off the
                    beards of his clergy. He was certainly a weak man, who had no opinions of his
                    own, but childishly adopted the sentiments of any person who took the trouble to
                    teach him. His chief amusement was buffoonery; and he would sit for hours
                    looking with pleasure at a merry-andrew singing drunken and vulgar songs. He was
                    a stranger to the country, its inhabitants, and their manners; and suffered
                    himself to be persuaded by those about him, that the Russians were fools and
                    beasts unworthy of his attention, except to make them, by means of the Prussian
                    discipline, good fighting machines. These opinions regulated his whole conduct,
                    and prepared the way for that revolution which faults of a different kind tended
                    to hasten.</p>
                <p>Becoming attached to a lady of the noble family of Vo-rontzoff, he disgusted his
                    wife, who was then a beautiful woman in the prime of life, of great natural
                    talents and great acquired accomplishments; whilst the lady whom he preferred to
                    her was but one degree above an idiot. The Princess Dashkoff, the favourite’s
                    sister, who was married to a man whose genius was not superior to that of the
                    emperor, being <hi rend="italic">dame d’honneur</hi> and lady of the
                    bed-chamber, had of course much of the empress’s company. Similarity of
                    situations knit these two illustrious personages in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=561" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0561-0549"
                    />closest friendship. The princess, being a zealous admirer of the French <hi
                    rend="italic"> économistes,</hi> could make her conversation both amusing and
                    instructive. She retailed all her statistical knowledge; and finding the empress
                    a willing hearer, she spoke of her in every company as a prodigy of knowledge,
                    judgment, and philanthropy. Whilst the emperor, by his buifoonery and attachment
                    to foreign manners, was daily incurring more and more the hatred of his
                    subjects, the popularity of his wife was rapidly increasing; and some persons
                    about the court expressed their regret that so much knowledge of government,
                    such love of humanity, and such ardent wishes for the prosperity of Russia,
                    should only furnish conversations with Catharina Romanovna (the Princess
                    Dashkoff). The empress and her favourite did not let these expressions pass
                    unobserved, but continued their studies in concert; and whilst the former was
                    employed on her famous code of laws for a great empire, the latter always
                    reported progress, till the middling circles of Moscow and St Petersburg began
                    to speak familiarly of the blessings which they might enjoy if these
                    speculations could be realized.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Peter III. was giving fresh cause of discontent. He had recalled from
                    Siberia Count Munnich, who was indeed a sensible, brave, and worthy man; but
                    Munnich, as he was smarting under the effects of Russian despotism, and had
                    grounds of resentment against most of the great families, did not much
                    discourage the emperor’s unpopular conduct, trying only to moderate it and give
                    it a system. Peter, however, was impatient He publicly ridiculed the exercise
                    and evolutions of the Russian troops; and hastily adopting the Prussian
                    discipline, without digesting and fitting it for the constitution of his own
                    forces, he completely ruined himself by disgusting the army.</p>
                <p>In the midst of these imprudences, indeed, Peter was ’sometimes disturbed by the
                    advice of virtuous counsellors. But these remonstrances produced only a
                    temporary gleam of reformation, and he soon relapsed into his accustomed
                    sensuality. What he lost in popularity was gained by the emissaries of
                    Catherine. Four regiments of guards, amounting to eight thousand men, were
                    speedily brought over by the three brothers Orlof, who had contrived to
                    ingratiate themselves with their officers. The people at large were in a state
                    of indifference, out of which they were partially roused by the following means.
                    A little manuscript was handed about, containing principles of legislation for
                    Russia, founded on natural rights, and on the claims of the different classes of
                    people, which, insensibly formed, became so familiar as to appear natural. In
                    that performance was proposed a convention of deputies from all the classes, and
                    from every part of the empire, to converse, but without authority, on the
                    subjects of which it treated, and to inform the senate of the result of their
                    deliberations. It passed for the work of her majesty, and was much admired.</p>
                <p>While Catherine was thus high in the public esteem and affection, the emperor
                    took the alarm at her popularity, and in a few days came to the resolution of
                    confining her for life, and then of marrying his favourite. The servants of that
                    lady betrayed her to her sister, who imparted the intelligence to the empress.
                    Catherine saw her danger, and mstantly formed her resolution. She must either
                    tamely submit to perpetual imprisonment, and perhaps a cruel and ignominious
                    death, or contrive to hurl her husband from his throne. No other alternative was
                    left her, and the consequence was what was undoubtedly expected. The proper
                    steps were taken. Folly fell before abilities and address, and in three days the
                    revolution was accomplished.</p>
                <p>When the emperor saw that all was lost he attempted to enter Cronstadt from
                    Oranienbaum, a town on the Gulf of Finland, thirty versts, or nearly twenty-six
                    miles, from St Petersburg. The sentinels at the harbour presented their muskets
                    at the barge; and though they were not loaded, and the men had no cartridges, he
                    drew back.</p>
                <p>Munnich received him again, and exhorted him to mount his horse and head his
                    guards, swearing to live and die with him. He said, “No, I see it cannot be done
                    without shedding much of the blood of my brave Holsteiners. I am not worthy of
                    the sacrifice.”</p>
                <p>Six days had already elapsed since the revolution, and that great event had been
                    apparently terminated without any violence that might leave odious impressions
                    upon the mind of the public. Peter had been removed from Peterhof to a pleasant
                    retreat called Ropscha, about thirty miles from St Petersburg; and here he
                    supposed he should be detained but a short time previous to his being sent into
                    Germany. He therefore transmitted a message to Catherine, desiring permission to
                    have for his attendant a favourite negro, and that she would send him a dog, of
                    which he was very fond, together with his violin, a bible, and a few romances;
                    telling her that disgusted with the wickedness of mankind, he was resolved
                    henceforth to devote himself to a philosophical life. However reasonable these
                    requests, not one of them was granted, and his plans of wisdom were turned into
                    ridicule.</p>
                <p>In the mean time the soldiers were amazed at what they had done. They .could not
                    conceive by what fascination they had been hurried so far as to dethrone the
                    grandson of Peter the Great, in order to give his crown to a German woman. The
                    majority, without plan or consciousness of what they were doing, had been
                    mechanically led on by the movements of others; and each individual now
                    reflecting on his baseness, after the pleasure of disposing of a crown had
                    vanished, was filled only with remorse. The sailors, who had never been engaged
                    in the insurrection, openly reproached the guards in the tippling-houses with
                    having sold their emperor for beer. One night a band of soldiers attached to the
                    empress took the alarm, from an idle fear, and exclaimed that their mother was
                    in danger, and that she must be awaked, that they might see her. During the next
                    night there was a fresh commotion more serious than the former. So long as the
                    life of the emperor left a pretext for inquietude, it was thought that no
                    tranquillity was to be expected.</p>
                <p>On the sixth day of the emperor’s imprisonment at Rop-scha, Alexci Orlof,
                    accompanied by an officer named Tep-loff, came to him with the news of his
                    speedy deliverance, and asked permission to dine with him. According to the
                    custom of that country, wine glasses and brandy were brought previous to dinner;
                    and while the officer amused the czar with some trifling discourse, his chief
                    filled the glasses, and poured a poisonous mixture into that which he intended
                    for the prince. The czar, without any distrust swallowed the potion, on which he
                    immediately experienced the most severe pains; and on his being offered a second
                    glass, on pretence of its giving him relief, he refused it, with reproaches
                    against him that offered it. He called aloud for milk, but the two monsters
                    offered him poison again, and pressed him to take it A French valet-de-chambre,
                    greatly attached to him, now ran in. Peter threw himself into his arms, saying
                    in a faint tone of voice, “It was not enough, then, to prevent me from reigning
                    in Sweden, and to deprive me of the crown of Russia. I must also be put to
                    death.”</p>
                <p>The valet-de-chambre presumed to intercede for his master; but the two miscreants
                    forced this dangerous witness out of the room, and continued their ill treatment
                    of the czar. In the midst of this tumult the younger of the Princes Baratinsky
                    came in, and joined the two former. Orlof, who had already thrown down the
                    emperor, was pressing upon his breast with both his knees, and firmly griping
                    his throat with his hand. The unhappy monarch now struggling with that strength
                    which arises from despair, the two other assassins threw a napkin round his
                    neck, and put an end to his life by suffocation.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=562"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0562-0550"/>
                <p>It is not known with certainty what share the empress had in this event; but it
                    is affirmed that on the very day on which it happened, while the empress was
                    beginning her dinner with much gaiety, an officer, supposed to be one of the
                    assassins, precipitately entered the apartment with his hair dishevelled, his
                    face covered with sweat and dust, his clothes torn, and his countenance agitated
                    with horror and dismay. On entering, his eyes, sparkling and confused, met those
                    of the empress. She arose in silence, and went into a closet, whither he
                    followed her. A few moments afterwards she sent for Count Panin, the former
                    governor of Peter, who was already appointed her minister, and, informing him
                    that the emperor was dead, consulted him on the manner of announcing his death
                    to the public. Panin advised her to let one night pass over, and to spread the
                    news next day, as if they had received it during the night. This counsel being
                    approved, the empress returned with the same countenance, and continued her
                    dinner with the same gaiety. On the day following, when it was published that
                    Peter had died of an haemorrhoidal colic, she appeared bathed in tears, and
                    proclaimed her grief by an edict.</p>
                <p>The corpse was brought to St Petersburg, there to be exposed. The face was black,
                    and the neck excoriated. Notwithstanding these horrible marks, in order to
                    assuage the commotions, which began to excite apprehension, and to prevent
                    impostors from hereafter disturbing the empire, it was left three days exposed
                    to all the people, with only the ornaments of a Holstein officer. The soldiers,
                    disbanded and disarmed, mingled with the crowd, and as they beheld their
                    sovereign, their countenances indicated a mixture of compassion, contempt, and
                    shame. They were soon afterwards embarked for their country; but, as the sequel
                    of their cruel destiny, almost all of these unfortunate men perished in a storm.
                    Some of them had saved themselves on the rocks adjacent to the coast; but they
                    again fell a prey to the waves, while the commandant of Cronstadt despatched a
                    messenger to St Petersburg to know whether he might be permitted to assist them.
                    Thus fell the unhappy Peter III. in 1762, in the thirty-fourth year of his age,
                    after having enjoyed the imperial dignity only six months.</p>
                <p>On her accession, Catherine behaved with great magna- <hi rend="superscript"
                    >3</hi> nimity and forbearance towards those who had opposed her elevation, or
                    were the declared friends of the deceased em-’ peror. She gave to Prince George,
                    in exchange for his title of Duke of Courland, conferred on him by Peter, the
                    government of Holstein. She reinstated Biren in his dukedom of Courland,
                    received into favour Marshal Munnich, who had readily transferred his fidelity
                    from the dead to the living, and even pardoned her rival the Countess
                    Vo-rontzoff, and permitted her to retain the tokens of her lover’s munificence.
                    She permitted Gudovitch, who was high in the confidence of Peter, and had
                    incurred her particular displeasure, to retire to his native country. Perhaps
                    the most unexpected part of her conduct towards the friends of Peter, was her
                    adhering to the treaty of peace which that monarch had concluded with the king
                    of Prussia six months before. The death of his inveterate enemy Elizabeth had
                    relieved Frederick from a load of solicitude, and had extricated him from his
                    dangerous situation. He now, as he thought, saw himself again involved in a war
                    with the same formidable power; but, to his great joy, he found that Catherine,
                    from motives of policy, declined entering on a war at the commencement of her
                    reign.</p>
                <p>In one particular the empress showed her jealousy and her fears. She increased
                    the vigilance with which the young prince Ivan was confined in the castle of
                    Schlusselburg, from which Peter III. had expressed a resolution to release him.
                    Not long after her accession, this unfortunate prince was assassinated, though
                    whether this event was to be imputed to the empress or her counsellors, cannot
                    be positively determined. But a manifesto published by the court of St
                    Petersburg, and supposed to have been written by the empress herself, admitted
                    that the prince was put to death by the officers of his guard, alleging that
                    this was necessary, in consequence of an attempt to carry him off.</p>
                <p>Were we to offer a detailed account of the principal transactions that took place
                    during the long reign of Catherine, we should far exceed the limits within which
                    this article must be confined, and should at the same time repeat much of what
                    has already been given under other heads. As the events that distinguished the
                    life of Catherine, however, are too important to be wholly omitted, we shall
                    present our readers with the following chronological sketch of them, referring
                    for a more particular account to Tooke’s Life of Catherine II., and to the
                    articles Catherine IL Britain, France, Poland, Prussia, Sweden, and Turkey, in
                    this work.</p>
                <p>The year 1766 presented at St Petersburg the grandest spectacle that perhaps was
                    ever seen in Europe. At an entertainment, which the empress chose to name a
                    carousal, the principal nobility appeared in the most sumptuous dresses,
                    sparkling with diamonds, and mounted on horses richly caparisoned, in a
                    magnificent theatre erected for that purpose. Here all that has been read of the
                    ancient jousts and tournaments was realized and exceeded in the presence of
                    thousands of spectators, who seemed to vie with each other in the brilliancy of
                    their appearance.</p>
                <p>In 1768, the empress composed instructions for a new code of laws for her
                    dominions; and the same year she submitted to the danger of inoculation, in
                    order that her subjects, to whom the practice was unknown, might be benefited by
                    her example.</p>
                <p>In the same year a war broke out with the Ottoman Porte. The various events of
                    this long and important conflict, which continued for seven years, must here be
                    only briefly enumerated, as they will hereafter be more particularly noticed
                    under the article Turkey. In this war our countryman Greig, then an admiral in
                    the Russian service, highly distinguished himself by his conduct in a naval
                    engagement with the Turks, in the harbour of Tschesme, in the Archipelago, in
                    which the Turkish fleet was entirely defeated, and their magazines destroyed.
                    This took place on the 4th of November 1772.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the year 1769, the khan of the Crimea made an attack on the
                    territory of Bachmut, on the river Bog, where he was several times bravely
                    repulsed, with his army of Tartars and Turks, by Major-General Ro-manius and
                    Prince Prosorofskoi. At the same time were fought the battles of Zekanofca and
                    Soroca on the Dnieper, when the large magazines of the enemy were burned. In
                    February the Polish Kozaks in the voyvodeship of Brac-lau put themselves under
                    the Russian sceptre. In the same month the Nisovian Saparogian Kozaks gained a
                    battle in the deserts of Krim. In March the Polish rebels were subdued, and
                    their town taken, by Major-General Ismailof. On the 2d of April the fort of
                    Taganrog, on the Sea of Azof, was taken. On the 15th the Russian army, under the
                    general-in-chief Prince Galitzin, crossed the Dniester. On the 19th a victory
                    was gained by Prince Galitzin near Chotzim. On the 2lst the Turks were defeated
                    not far from Chotzim by Lieutenant-General Count Soltikof. The 29th, an action
                    was fought between the Russian Kalmucks and the Kuban Tartars, to the
                    disadvantage of the latter. June the 8th, the Turks were defeated at the mouth
                    of the Dnieper, near Otchakof. An action took place on the Dniester on the 19th,
                    when the troops of Prince Proso-rofskoi forced the Turks to repass the river in
                    great disorder. Chotzim was taken on the 19th of September. Yassy, in Moldavia,
                    was taken on the 27th of September. Bukarescht, in Wallachia, was taken, and the
                    hospodar made prisoner, in November 1770. A victory was gained <pb break="no"

                    />by the Russians under Generals Podhorilshany and Potemkin, near Fokshany. The
                    town of Shursha was taken by Lieutenant-General Von Stoffeln, February 4. A
                    Russian fleet appeared in the port of Maina, in the Morea <hi rend="subscript"
                    >1</hi> on the 17th February. Mistra, the Lacedaemon of the ancients, and
                    several other towns of the Morea, were taken in February. Arcadira in Greece
                    surrendered, and a multitude of Turks were made prisoncrs, in the same month.
                    The Turks and Tartars were driven from their intrenchrnents near the Pruth, by
                    Count Romantzof, Prince Repnin, and General Bauer, 11th—16th June. Prince
                    Prosorofskoi gained several advantages near Otchakof, June 18. The Russian
                    fleet, under Count Alexci Orlof, gained a complete victory over the Turks near
                    Tschesme, 24th June; the consequence of this victory was the destruction of the

                    the Turkish fleet commanded by the capudan pasha, at the mouth of the Straits of
                    Yenikali. August 3d, peace was concluded with Sweden, without the mediation of
                    any other power. August 28th, 29th, an engagement took place on the Euxine, not
                    far from Chodshabey, between the Russian admiral Ushakofl' and the capudan
                    pasha, when the principal Turkish ship, of eighty guns, was burnt, one of
                    seventy guns and three others taken, the admiral Said Beybeing made prisoner,
                    and another ship sunk; the rest made off. September 30th, a great victory was
                    obtained over the Turks by General Germann, with much slaughter, and the
                    seraskier Batal Bey, and the whole camp, were taken. October 18th, Kilia
                    surrendered to Major Ribas. November 6th, 7th, the fortress Cultsha and the
                    Turkish flotilla were taken. December 1 lth, the important fortress of Ismail,
                    after a storming for seven hours without intermission, surrendered to Count
                    Suwaroff, with the garrison of forty-two thousand men; thirty thousand eight
                    hundred and sixteen were slain on the spot, two thousand died of their wounds,
                    nine thousand were taken prisoners, with two hundred and sixty-five pieces of
                    cannon, an incredible store of ammunition, &amp;c. The Russians lost only
                    eighteen hundred and fifteen killed, and two thousand four hundred and fifty
                    wounded.</p>
                <p>1791. March 25th-31st, the campaign opened by the 'troops under Prince Potemkin,
                    not far from Brailof, when the Turks were defeated in several battles, in which
                    they I lost upwards of four thousand men. June 5th, the troops under General
                    Golenitshef Kutusoff, near Tultsha, drove the Turks beyond the Danube, and at
                    Babada entirely routed a body of fifteen thousand men, of whom fifteen hundred
                    were left dead upon the field. 22d, The fortress Anapuas was taken by storm,
                    when the whole garrison, consisting of twenty-five thousand men, were put to the
                    sword, exceptingone thousand who were taken prisoners. 28th, The troops
                    UnderPrince Repnin attacked the Turkish army, consisting of nearly eighty
                    thousand men, commanded by the grand vizir Yussuf Pasha, eight pashas, two
                    Tartar sultans, and two beys of Anatolia; and after a bloody battle of six
                    hours, entirely routed them: five thousand Turkswere killed in their flight.
                    June 28th, Sudskuk Kale was taken. July 3lst, Admiral Ushakoff beat the Turkish
                    fleet on the coasts of Rumelia. Prince Repnin and Yussuf Pasha signed the
                    preliminaries of peace between the Russian empire and the Ottoman Porte, by
                    which the Dniester was made the boundary of the two empires, with the cession of
                    the countries lying between the Bog and Dniester to Russia. August 15th, 16th,
                    at Pilnitz, near Dresden, a congress was held by the emperor of Germany, the
                    king of Prussia, the elector of Saxony, the Count d’Artois, &amp;c. &amp;c. One
                    of the most important events in this year was the death of Prince Potemkin, at
                    Yassy in Moldavia, on the 15th October.</p>
                <p>1792. Early in this year Bulgakoff <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> the Russian
                    minister •at Warsaw, declared war against Poland; and the Polish <hi
                    rend="superscript">-</hi> patriots raised an army in which Thaddeus Kosciuszko
                    soon bore a conspicuous part.</p>
                <p>In 1788, the diet of Poland had abrogated the constitution which the empress of
                    Russia had, in 1775, compelled that nation to adopt, and had formed an alliance
                    with the king of Prussia, by way of defence against the further encroachments of
                    the Russian despot. Three years after, viz. on the 3d of May 1791, the new
                    constitution, which was intended further to destroy the ambitious hopes of
                    Catherine, was decreed at Warsaw. (See Poland.) These were affronts which the
                    Russian empress could not forgive, and in one of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conciliabula,</hi> in which the ministers of state, and the favourite for the
                    time being, sat to regulate the affairs of the north of Europe, and to determine
                    the fate of the surrounding nations, the annihilation of the Polish monarchy was
                    resolved on.</p>
                <p>The declaration of war above mentioned was denounced by Bulgakoff at an assembly
                    of the diet-That body received the declaration with a majestic calmness, and
                    resolved to take measures for the defence of the nation. The generous enthusiasm
                    of liberty soon spread throughout the state, and even the king pretended to
                    share in the general indignation. An army was hastily collected, and the command
                    of it bestowed on Prince Joseph Poniatowsky, a general whose inexperience and
                    frivolous pursuits were but ill adapted to so important a charge.</p>
                <p>In the mean time several Russian armies were preparing to overwhelm the small and
                    disunited forces of the Poles. A body of eighty thousand Russians extended
                    itself along the Bog, another of ten thousand was collected in the environs of
                    Kief, and a third of thirty thousand penetrated into Lithuania. While these
                    armies were carrying murder and desolation throughout the Polish territories,
                    Catherine was employing all her arts to induce the neighbouring powers to join
                    in the partition of Poland; and in this she was but too successful. A treaty was
                    accordingly concluded between the empress and the king of Prussia, by which each
                    appropriated to itself a share of the remains of Poland. Stanislas Augustus, the
                    powerless head of that state, was prevailed on to make a public declaration that
                    there was a necessity for yielding to the superiority of the Russian arms.</p>
                <p>1793. On the 9th of April the Polish confederation of the partisans of Russia
                    assembled at Grodno; and on this occasion the Russian general placed himself
                    under the canopy of that throne which he was about to declare for ever vacant,
                    and the Russian minister Sievers produced a manifesto, declaring the intention
                    of his mistress to incorporate with her domains all the Polish territory which
                    her arms had conquered.</p>
                <p>The Russian soldiers dispersed throughout the provinces committed depredations
                    and ravages of which history furnishes but few examples. Warsaw became
                    especially the theatre of their excesses. Their general, Igelstrom, who governed
                    in that city, connived at the disorders of the soldiers, and made the wretched
                    inhabitants feel the whole weight of his arrogance and barbarity. The patriots
                    of Poland had been obliged to disperse, their property was confiscated, and
                    their families reduced to servitude. Goaded by so many calamities, they once
                    more took the resolution to free their country from the oppression of the
                    Russians, or perish in the attempt. Some of them assembled, and sent an
                    invitation to Kosciuszko, to come and lead them on against the invaders of their
                    freedom.</p>
                <p>Kosciuszko had retired to Leipsig, with a few other Poles, all eminent for
                    patriotism and military ardour. These hesitated not a moment in giving their
                    approbation to the resolution adopted by their indignant countrymen; but they
                    were sensible that, in order to succeed, they must begin by emancipating the
                    peasants from the state of servitude under which they then groaned. Kosciuszko
                    and Zagonchek repaired with all expedition to the frontiers of Poland, and the
                    latter proceeded to Warsaw, where he held conferences with the chief of the
                    conspirators, and particularly with several officers, who declared their
                    detestation of the Russian yoke. All appeared ripe for a general insurrection;
                    and the Russian commanders, whose suspicions had been excited by the appearance
                    of Kosciuszko on the frontiers, obliged that leader and his confederates to
                    postpone for a time the execution of their plan. In order to deceive the
                    Russians, Kos-ciuszko retired into Italy, and Zagonchek repaired to Dresden,
                    whither Ignatius Potoski and Kolontay had gone before him. On a sudden, however,
                    Zagonchek appeared again at Warsaw, but was impeached by the king to General
                    Igelstrom, and, in a conference with the general, was ordered to quit the Polish
                    territory. He must now have abandoned his enterprise altogether, or immediately
                    proceed to open insurrection. He chose the latter.</p>

                <p>1794. Kosciuszko was recalled from Italy, and arrived at Cracow, where the Poles
                    received him as their deliverer. .Here he was joined by some other officers, and
                    took the <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> command of his little army, consisting of
                    about three thousand infantry and twelve hundred cavalry. On the 24th of March
                    was published the manifesto of the patriots, in which they declared the motives
                    for their insurrection, and called on their countrymen to unite in the glorious
                    attempt to free the republic from a foreign yoke. Kosciuszko was soon joined by
                    three hundred peasants armed with scythes, and some other small reinforcements
                    gradually came in. A body of seven thousand Russians had collected to oppose the
                    movements of this little army, and a battle took place, in which the patriots
                    were successful.</p>
                <p>While the insurrection had thus auspiciously commenced on the frontiers, the
                    confederates of the capital were nearly crushed by the exertions of the Russian
                    general. Hearing at Warsaw of the success of Kosciuszko, Igelstrom caused all
                    those whom he suspected of having any concern in the insurrection to be
                    arrested; but these measures served only to irritate the conspirators. On the 18
                    th of April they openly avowed their confederacy with the patriots of the
                    frontiers, and proceeded in great numbers to attack the Russian garrison. Two
                    thousand Russians were put to the sword, and the general, being besieged in his
                    house, proposed a capitulation; but, profiting by the .delay that had been
                    granted him, he escaped to the Prussian camp, which lay at a little distance
                    from Warsaw.</p>
                <p>Wilna, the capital of Lithuania, followed the example of Warsaw; but the triumph
                    of the insurgents was there less terrible, as Colonel Yasinsky, who headed the
                    patriots, conducted himself with so much skill, that he made all the Russians
                    prisoners without bloodshed. The inhabitants of the cantons of Chelm and Lublin
                    also declared themselves in a state of insurrection, and three Polish regiments
                    who were employed in the service of Russia espoused the cause of their country.
                    Some of the principal partisans of Russia were arrested, and sentenced to be
                    hanged.</p>
                <p>Kosciuszko exerted himself to the utmost to augment his army. He procured
                    recruits among the peasants, and to inspire them with the more emulation, he
                    adopted their dress, ate with them, and distributed rewards among such as
                    appeared most to merit encouragement. All his attempts to inspire the lower
                    orders of the Poles with the ardour of patriotism were, however, unavailing. A
                    mutual distrust prevailed between the nobles and the peasants, and this was
                    fomented by the arts of Stanislas and the other partisans of Russia.</p>
                <p>The empress had sent into Poland two of her best generals, Suwaroff and Fersen.
                    For some time Kosciuszko succeeded in preventing the junction of these
                    commanders, and several engagements took place between the Russians and
                    patriots, in which the former were generally successful. At length, on the 4th
                    of October, the fate of Poland was decided by a sanguinary conflict between
                    Kosciuszko and Fersen, at Macieyovitch, a small town of Little Poland, about
                    sixty miles from Warsaw. The talents, valour, and desperation of Kosciuszko
                    could not prevent the Poles from yielding to superior numbers. Almost the whole
                    of his army was either cut in pieces or compelled to surrender at discretion,
                    and the hero himself, covered with wounds, fell senseless on the field of
                    battle, and was made prisoner.</p>
                <p>The small number that escaped fled to Warsaw, and shut themselves up in the
                    suburb of Praga. Hither they were pursued by Suwaroff, who immediately laid
                    siege to the suburb, and prepared to carry it by storm. On the 2d of November he
                    gave the assault, and having made himself master of the place, put to the sword
                    both the soldiers and the peaceable inhabitants, without distinction of age or
                    sex. It is computed that twenty thousand persons fell victims to the savage
                    ferocity of the Russian general; and, covered with the blood of the slaughtered
                    inhabitants, the barbarian entered Warsaw in triumph.</p>
                <p>Thus terminated the feeble resistance of the Polish patriots. The partition of
                    the remaining provinces was soon effected, and Stanislas Augustus, who had long
                    enjoyed merely the appearance of royalty, and had degraded himself by becoming
                    the instrument of Russian usurpation, retired to Grodno, there to pass the
                    remainder of his days, on a pension granted him by the empress.</p>
                <p>1795. On the 18th of February, a treaty of defensive alliance between the empress
                    of Russia and his Britannic majesty was signed at St Petersburg. The ostensible
                    object of this treaty was to maintain the general tranquillity of Europe, and
                    more especially of the north; and by it Russia agreed to furnish Great Britain
                    with ten thousand infantry and two thousand horse in case of invasion; while
                    Great Britain was, under similar circumstances, to send her imperial majesty a
                    squadron consisting of two ships of seventy-four guns, six of sixty, and four of
                    fifty, with a complement of four thousand five hundred and sixty men. On the
                    18th of March was signed the act by which the duchy of Courland, together with
                    the circle of Pilten, all of which had lately belonged to the Duke of Courland,
                    but had long retained only the shadow of independence, submitted themselves to
                    the Russian dominion.</p>
                <p>In this year there took place between the courts of St Petersburg and Stockholm a
                    dispute which threatened to terminate in a war. Gustavus III. had been
                    assassinated <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> by Ankerstroem at a masquerade, on
                    the 15th of March 1791; and the young king GustavusAdolphus being still a minor,
                    the Duke of Sudermania, his uncle, had been appointed regent of the kingdom. The
                    regent had determined to effect a marriage between his nephew and a princess of
                    the house of Mecklenburg; but Catherine publicly declared that the late king had
                    betrothed his son to one of her grand-daughters. The misunderstanding hence
                    originating was increased by the rude and indecorous behaviour of the Baron von
                    Budberg, the Russian minister at Stockholm; and matters seemed tending to an
                    open rupture, when, in the year 1796, a French emigrant named Christin effected
                    a reconciliation, and General Budberg, the baron’s uncle, was sent as ambassador
                    to Stockholm from the Russian court. In consequence of this reconciliation, the
                    young king, attended by the regent, and a numerous train of Swedish courtiers,
                    set out on a visit to St Petersburg, where they arrived on the 24th of August,
                    and an interview took place between the empress and her royal visiters, for the
                    purpose of finally adjusting the projected matrimonial alliance. Gustavus
                    Adolphus was much pleased with the appearance of the Grand Duchess Alexandra,
                    but informed the empress, that by the fundamental laws of Sweden he could not
                    sign the marriage-contract before the princess had abjured the Greek religion;
                    and as neither the solicitations nor the flatteries of Catherine could prevail
                    on the young monarch to depart from the received custom of his country, the
                    negotiation ended, and the next day Gustavus and his retinue quitted St
                    Petersburg.</p>
                <p>The last transaction of importance in the reign of Catherine was her invasion of
                    the Persian territories, undertaken for the purpose of acquiring certain
                    possessions on the shores of the Caspian. A Russian army entered Daghestan, and
                    made itself master of Derbent, but was afterwards defeated by the Persians under
                    Aga Mahmoud. The death of the empress took place, as we have elsewhere stated,
                    on the 9th of November of this year; and the Grand Duke Paul Pe-trovitch
                    ascended the throne under the title of Paul I.</p>
                <p>Paul Petrovitch had attained his forty-second year before the death of his mother
                    placed him on the imperial throne; but for many years before her death he had
                    lived in a state of comparative obscurity and retirement, and had apparently
                    been considered by the empress as incapable of taking <pb break="no"

                    />any active part in the administration of affairs. It is well known that
                    Catherine never admitted him to any participation of power, and kept him in a
                    state of the most abject and mortifying separation from court, and in almost
                    total ignorance of the affairs of the empire. Although by his birth he was
                    generalissimo of the armies, president of the admiralty, and grand admiral of
                    the Baltic, he was never permitted to head even a regiment, and was interdicted
                    from visiting the fleet at Cronstadt. From these circumstances, it is evident
                    that the empress either had conceived some jealousy of her son, or saw in him
                    some mental imbecility, which appeared to her to disqualify him for the arduous
                    concerns of government. There is little doubt, from the circumstances which
                    distinguished his short reign, that Catherine had been chiefly influenced in her
                    treatment of the grand duke by the latter consideration. There were certainly
                    times at which Paul displayed evident marks of insanity, though he occasionally
                    gave proofs of a generous and tender disposition, and even of intellectual
                    vigour.</p>
                <p>It is generally believed that, a short time before her death, Catherine committed
                    to Plato Zuboff, her last favourite, a declaration of her will, addressed to the
                    senate, desiring that Paul should be passed over in the succession, and that on
                    her death the Grand Duke Alexander should ascend the vacant throne. As soon as
                    Zuboff was made acquainted with the sudden death of the empress, he flew to
                    Pavlovsk, about twenty-three miles from St Petersburg, where Paul occasionally
                    resided; but meeting the grand duke on the road, he, after a short explanation,
                    delivered up the important document. Paul, charmed with his zeal and loyalty,
                    rewarded the favourite, by permitting him to retain the wealth and honours which
                    had been heaped on him by his mistress, while a general and rapid dispersion
                    soon took place among the other adherents of the late sovereign. On the day
                    following the death of his mother, Paul made his public entry into St
                    Petersburg, amidst the acclamations of all ranks of people.</p>
                <p>One of the first measures adopted by the new emperor excited considerable
                    surprise, and divided the opinions of the public with respect to the motives by
                    which it had been suggested; some attributing it to his respect for the memory
                    of his late father, and others to a culpable reflection on that of his mother.
                    He ordered the corpse of Peter III. to be removed from the sepulchre in which it
                    had been deposited in the church of St Alexander Nefsky, solemnly crowned it,
                    and caused it to lie in state for three weeks, while it was watched day and
                    night by the only two remaining conspirators who had assisted at his
                    assassination. After this dreadful mark of his justice on the murderers of his
                    father, surely more terrible to the guilty mind than death itself, he consigned
                    the ashes to the sepulchre of Catherine II. in the cathedral of St Peter and St
                    Paul, obliging the assassins to walk in the procession as chief mourners.</p>
                <p>Few political events of any importance marked the reign of Paul previously to the
                    year 1798, when, in consequence of a treaty between him and the emperor of
                    Germany, a Russian army of forty-five thousand men, under Field-Marshal
                    Suwaroff, joined the imperialists in the Austrian territories in Italy. The
                    progress of Suwaroff, his successes over Moreau, and his final recall by his
                    master, have already been related in the article France.</p>
                <p>In 1799, Paul entered into a treaty of offensive and defensive alliance with his
                    Britannic majesty. This treaty was signed at St Petersburg on the 22d of June,
                    having been preceded by a provisional treaty between the same powers at the end
                    of the year 1798. By the latter, which was fortified by a relative treaty with
                    Austria, it had been stipulated that Paul should assist the king of Prussia, if
                    the latter could be persuaded to join his arms to the allied powers against
                    France, with forty-five thousand men, and that the king of Great Britain should
                    pay to Russia a subsidy of L.75,000 sterling per month; and in case the king of
                    Prussia should refuse to join the coalition, the same number of troops, in
                    consideration of the same subsidy, should be employed, as occasion might
                    require, to assist the common cause. By the new treaty, the emperor of Russia,
                    instead of the forty-five thousand troops, engaged to furnish seventeen thousand
                    five hundred and ninety-three, with the necessary artillery, to be employed in
                    an expedition against Holland; and six ships, five frigates, and two transports,
                    for the purpose of transporting part of the invading army from Britain to the
                    continent. In consideration of these succours, the court of London engaged to
                    advance to Russia a subsidy of L.44,000 sterling per month; to pay the sum of
                    L.58,929. 10s. sterling for the expenses of equipping the fleet; and after the
                    period of three months had elapsed from such equipment, to pay a further subsidy
                    of L. 19,642. 10s. sterling per month, as long as the fleet should remain under
                    the command of his Britannic majesty.</p>
                <p>In consequence of this treaty, a Russian fleet joined that of Britain in Yarmouth
                    Roads, and took part in the unfortunate expedition to the coast of Holland,
                    which was undertaken in the summer of 1799. The military fame of Russia was more
                    augmented by the share which its army under Suwaroff took in the campaign of
                    Italy during the same year, although the victories which won for the veteran his
                    name of Italinski were far more than overbalanced by the misfortunes which
                    ensued in Switzerland under the emperor’s favourite Korsakoff. But in December
                    1800, Paul, after having laid an embargo on the British shipping which lay in
                    his ports, openly abandoned his relations with our country, and proclaimed, in
                    confederacy with Sweden and Denmark, to whom Prussia afterwards added herself,
                    the great Northern Coalition with France against Great Britain.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the year 1801, all Europe was astonished or amused by a
                    paragraph which appeared in the Hamburg Gazette of the 16th of January. It was
                    dated from Petersburg, the 30th December 1800, and is as follows.</p>
                <p>“We learn from Petersburg, that the emperor of Russia, finding that the powers of
                    Europe cannot agree among themselves, and being desirous to put an end to a war
                    which has desolated it-for eleven years past, intends to point out a spot to
                    which he will invite all the other sovereigns, to repair and fight in single
                    combat; bringing with them, as seconds and squires, their most enlightened
                    ministers and their most able generals, such as Messrs Thugot, Pitt, and
                    Bernstorff; and that the emperor himself proposes being attended by Generals
                    Cotint de Pahlen and Khutosof. We know not if this report be worthy of credit;
                    however, the thing appears not destitute of some foundation, and bears strong
                    marks of what he has been often taxed with.”</p>
                <p>This paragraph was immediately copied or translated into all the public papers,
                    and it was strongly affirmed by many that it was the composition of Paul
                    himself. This has since been confirmed by the poet Kotzebue, who was employed by
                    the emperor of Russia to translate the original into German, for the express
                    purpose of its being inserted in the Hamburg Gazette. <note anchored="true"

                    rend="italic"> morceau</hi> of witty insanity, that we shall here give the
                    original French, as written by Paul himself, and published by Kotzebue in his
                    account of his exile into Siberia. “On apprend de Petersbourg. que l’Empereur de
                    Russie, voyant que les puissances de l’Europe ne pouvoient s’accorder
                    entr'elles, et voulant mettre fin a une guerre qui la désoloit depuis onze ans,
                    vouloit proposer un lieu où il inviteroit tous les autres Souverains, de se
                    rendre et y combattre en champ clos, ayant avec eux pour écuyers juges de camp
                    et heros des armes leurs ministres les plus éclairés et les généraux les plus
                    habiles, tels que MM. Thugot, Pitt, Bernstorff; lui-même se proposant de prendre
                    avec lui les généraux C. de Pahlen et Khutosof. On ne sqait si on doit y ajouter
                    foi; toutefois, la chose ne paroit pas destituée de fondement, en portant
                    l’empreinte de ce dont il a souvent été taxé.” </p></note></p>

                <p>This was not the only mark of mental derangement displayed by the unhappy
                    monarch. The army, which formed his favourite employment, was tormented by
                    incessant caprices affecting its discipline; and the press, the native Russians,
                    and the resident foreigners, suffered tyrannical and unaccountable restrictions.
                    His favours and his displeasure were alternately experienced by some of his
                    roost distinguished courtiers and adherents. Stanislas, the deposed king of
                    Poland, partook by turns of his beneficence and his severity; and at length, on
                    the death of that monarch, Paul assisted at his funeral, commanded in person the
                    guards that attended on the ceremony, and uncovering himself with the utmost
                    emotion, saluted the coffin as it passed. To the memory of the aged Suwaroff <hi
                    rend="subscript">1</hi> who is said to have fallen a broken-hearted victim to
                    the distraction of his imperial master, he raised a colossal statue of bronze;
                    and on the days when he reviewed his troops in the square where the figure had
                    been erected, he used to command them to march by in open order, and face the
                    monument. Notwithstanding the important service that had been rendered him by
                    Zuboff, the emperor soon became disgusted with him; spoke of him to his friends
                    with great asperity; at length denounced him as a defaulter to the imperial
                    treasury of half a million of roubles; and, convinced of the justice of the
                    allegation, proceeded to sequestrate the vast estates which belonged to him and
                    his two brothers. Driven to desperation by such conduct, the second brother of
                    the favourite one day walked up boldly to the emperor upon the parade, and with
                    manly eloquence represented the injustice of his measures. Paul received him
                    without anger, heard him without interruption, and restored the property; but
                    soon afterwards he ordered Plato Zuboff to reside on his estate, though he again
                    restored him to favour.</p>
                <p>It is not surprising that these instances of folly and caprice should alarm and
                    disgust many of the nobles. In particular, Count Pahlen <hi rend="subscript"
                    >1</hi> the governor of St Petersburg, with some other men of rank, entered into
                    a confederacy with Zuboff and his brothers for removing the emperor. In their
                    conferences, which were managed with great prudence and discretion, it was
                    resolved that Paul should die, and that the day of the festival called
                    Maslaintza, the Ilth of March O. S. 1801, should be the day for executing the
                    awful deed. At the time of this plot, the emperor and his family resided in the
                    new palace of St Michael, an enormous quadrangular pile standing at the bottom
                    of the summer gardens. Paul being anxious to inhabit this palace soon after he
                    was crowned, the masons, carpenters, and various artificers, toiled with
                    incredible labour, by day and by torch-light, under the sultry sun of the
                    summer, and in all the severity of a polar winter; and in three years this
                    enormous and magnificent fabric was completed. The whole is moated round; and
                    when the stranger surveys its bastions of granite, and numerous draw-bridges, he
                    is naturally led to conclude that it was intended for the last asylum of a
                    prince at war with his subjects. Those who have seen its massive walls, and the
                    capaciousness and variety of its chambers, will easily admit that an act of
                    violence might be committed in one room, and not be heard by those who occupy
                    the adjoining one; and that a massacre might be perpetrated at one end, and not
                    known at the other. Paui took possession of this palace as a place of strength,
                    and beheld it with rapture, because his imperial mother had never even seen it.
                    While his family were here, by every act of tenderness endeavouring to soothe
                    the terrible perturbation of his mind, there were not wanting those who exerted
                    every stratagem to inflame and increase it. These people were constantly
                    insinuating that every hand was armed against him. With this impression, which
                    added fuel to his burning brain, he ordered a secret staircase to be
                    constructed, which, leading from his own chamber, passed under a false stove in
                    the anti-room, and led by a small door to the terrace.</p>
                <p>It was the custom of the emperor to sleep in an apart-: ment next to the
                    empress’s, upon a sofa, in his regimen*’ tals and boots, whilst the grand duke
                    and duchess, and the rest of the imperial family, were lodged at various
                    distances, in apartments below the story which he occupied. On the IOth March,
                    the day preceding the fatal night, whether Paul’s apprehension, or anonymous
                    information, suggested the idea, is not known; but conceiving that a storm was
                    ready to burst upon him, he sent for Count Pahlen: “I am informed,” said the
                    emperor, “that there is a conspiracy en foot against me; do you think it
                    necessary to take any precaution ?’ The count, without betraying the least
                    emotion, replied, “Sire, do not suffer such apprehensions to haunt your mind; if
                    there were any combinations forming agamst your majesty’s person, I am sure I
                    should be acquainted with it.” “Then I am satisfied,” said the emperor; and the
                    governor withdrew. Before Paul retired to rest, he, beyond his usual custom,
                    expressed the most tender solicitude for the empress and his children, kissed
                    them with all the warmth of farewell fondness, and remained with them for a
                    considerable time. He afterwards visited the sentinels at their different posts,
                    and then retired to his chamber. Soon after the emperor had retired, the guard
                    that was always placed at his chamber door was, on some pretext, changed by the
                    officers who had the command for the night, and who were engaged in the
                    conspiracy. One man oniy remained. This was a hussar whom the emperor had
                    honoured with particular marks of attention, and who always slept at night in
                    the antechamber, at his sovereign’s bed-room door. This faithful soldier it was
                    found impossible to remove, except by force, which at that time the conspirators
                    did not think proper to employ. Silence now reigned throughout the palace,
                    disturbed only by the pacing of the sentinels, or by the distant murmurs of the
                    Neva; and only a few straggling lights were to be seen, irregularly gleaming
                    through the windows of the palace. In the dead of the night, Zuboff and his
                    friends, amounting to eight or nine persons, passed the draw-bridge, ascended
                    the staircase that led to the emperor’s apartments, and met with no opposition
                    till they reached the antechamber, where the faithful hussar, awakened by the
                    noise, challenged them, and presented his fusee. Though they must have admired
                    the brave fidelity of the guard, neither time nor circumstances would admit of
                    an act of generosity which might have endangered their whole plan of operations.
                    Zuboff therefore drew his sabre, and cut the poor fellow down. In the mean time,
                    Paul, roused by the unusual bustle, sprang from his couch. At this moment the
                    whole party rushed into his chamber. The unhappy sovereign, anticipating their
                    design, at first endeavoured to intrench himself behind the chairs and tables;
                    but soon recovering some share of his natural courage, he assumed a high tone,
                    told them they were his prisoners, and required them to surrender. Finding that
                    they fixed their eyes steadily and fiercely upon him, and continued to advance,
                    he implored them to spare his life, declared his willingness instantly to
                    relinquish the sceptre, and to accept of any terms which they might dictate. He
                    even offered to make them princes, and to confer on them orders and estates.
                    Regardless alike of his threats and promises, they now began to press on him,
                    when he made a convulsive effort to reach the window, but failed in the attempt;
                    and, indeed, had he succeeded in his endeavour to escape that way, the height
                    from the window to the ground was so great, that the expedient would probably
                    have only put a more speedy period to his existence. As the conspirators drew
                    him back, he grasped a chair, with which he knocked down one of the assailants,
                    and a desperate conflict now took place. So great was the noise, that
                    notwithstanding the massive walls and double folding <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=569" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0569-0557"

                    disturbed, and began to call for help, when a voice whispered in her ear,
                    commanding her to remain quiet, and threatening that if she uttered another word
                    she should instantly be put to death.</p>
                <p>Paul was now making his last struggle, when one of the party struck him on the
                    temple with his fist, and laid him prostrate on the floor. Recovering from the
                    blow, the unhappy monarch again implored his life. At this moment the heart of
                    one of the conspirators relented, and he was observed to hesitate and tremble,
                    when a young Hanoverian who was present exclaimed, we have passed the Rubico; if
                    we spare his life, we shall, before the setting of to-morrow’s sun, become his
                    victims; on saying which he took off his sash, turned it twice round the naked
                    neck of the emperor, and giving one end to ZubofF, he himself drew the other,
                    till the object of their attack expired.</p>
                <p>The Emperor Alexander, Paul’s eldest son, was in his . twenty-fourth year when he
                    ascended the throne, and from • his amiable disposition had acquired the love
                    and respect of all his subjects. The first measure which he adopted, his
                    proclamation, and his first imperial orders, all tended to encourage and confirm
                    the confidence with which the people beheld him ascend the throne of his
                    forefathers. He solemnly promised to tread in the steps of Catherine U.; he
                    allowed every one to dress according to his o¼m fancy; he exonerated the
                    inhabitants of tile capital from the trouble and duty of alighting from their
                    carriages on the approach of the imperial family; he dismissed the court
                    advocate, who was universally and justly detested; he suppressed the secret
                    inquisition, that had become the scourge of the country; he restored to the
                    senate its former authority, set at liberty the state prisoners, and recalled
                    from Siberia several of the exiles. He even extended his mercy to the assassins
                    of the late emperor. Zuboff was ordered not to approach the imperial residence,
                    and the governor of the city was transferred to Riga.</p>
                <p>It is not easy to explain the motives that induced Alexander to forego that
                    vengeance which justice seemed to demand on the heads of his father’s assassins.
                    It has been attributed by one of his panegyrists to a fiarlom and melancholy
                    conviction that the murderers had been prompted to commit the bloody deed solely
                    by a regard for the salvation of the empire. This conviction might have induced
                    the young monarch to diminish the weight of the punishment which piety and
                    justice called on him to inflict, but can scarcely account for his total
                    forbearance.</p>
                <p>Alexander, on his accession to the throne, appeared desirous to cultivate the
                    friendship of the neighbouring states, - and especially that of Great Britain.
                    His late father, among <hi rend="superscript">9</hi> other projects, had
                    procured himself to be elected grandmaster of the knights of Malta, and had laid
                    claim to the sovereignty of that island. This claim, which had nearly produced a
                    rupture between the courts of London and St Petersburg, Alexander consented to
                    abandon, though he expressed a wish to be elected grand-master of the order, by
                    the free suffrages of the knights. A confederacy, as we have seen, had been
                    formed among the northern powers of Europe, with a view to oppose the British
                    claim to the sovereignty of the seas; but by the spirited interference of the
                    British court, especially with the cabinet of St Petersburg, the good
                    understanding between Britain and the northern states was reestablished, and the
                    embargo which had been laid on British vessels in the Russian ports was taken
                    off. Alexander, however, earnestly desired to maintain peaceful relations with
                    France; and expressed this wish, both in public manifestos, and in private
                    communications addressed to the First Consul.</p>
                <p>Early in the same year there was signed at St Petersburg a treaty of amity,
                    commerce, and navigation, between Russia and Sweden, to continue for twelve
                    years, by which Sweden was allowed to import into Russia, alum, salt herrings,
                    and salt, on the payment of one half of the duties then exacted, and into
                    Russian Finland the produce of Swedish Finland duty free; while the importation
                    of Russia into Sweden, of hemp, linen, and tallow, was allowed at one half of
                    the existing duties, and of linseed at two thirds. The most remarkable part of
                    this treaty was the recognition, by the court of St Petersburg, of the northern
                    confederacy, which the amicable adjustment with Britain appeared to have done
                    away. The commerce of Russia had now recovered its former splendour. The exports
                    from the city of Riga alone, for the year ending July 1801, amounted to
                    6,770,638 roubles, and of these exports England alone imported to the value of
                    2,509,853 roubles.</p>
                <p>On the 25th of March 1802 was signed at Amiens the definitive treaty of peace
                    between the belligerent powers of Europe, by one material article of which the
                    islands of Malta, Gozo, and Comino, were to be restored to the knights of St
                    John of Jerusalem, under the protection and guarantee of France, Great Britain,
                    Austria, Spain, Russia, and Prussia; and his Sicilian majesty was invited to
                    furnish two thousand men, natives of his states, to serve in garrisons at the
                    different fortresses of the said islands, for one year after their restitution
                    to the knights, or until they should be replaced by a force deemed sufficient by
                    the guaranteeing powers. Some time after the conclusion of this treaty, disputes
                    arose among the contracting powers relative to the sovereignty of Malta, which
                    the emperor of Russia insisted should be yielded to Naples, otherwise he would
                    not undertake to guarantee the order, and would separate from it the priories of
                    Russia. The result of these disputes is well known, as they afforded a reason
                    for renewing the bloody contest which so long desolated Europe.</p>
                <p>During the short interval of peace, the emperor of Russia made several prudent
                    regulations in the internal administration of his empire. On the 12th of
                    September 1801, a manifesto had been published, proclaiming the union of
                    Georgia, or Russian Grusinia, with the empire; and on the 1st of April 1802,
                    Alexander sent a deputation to establish the new governmental Teflis, the
                    capital of the province. On the 28th of May the emperor wrote a letter to the
                    chamberlain Wittostoff, president of the commission for ameliorating the
                    condition of the poor of St Petersburg, in which he recommended to the
                    commission to follow the example of a similar establishment at Hamburg, in
                    selecting proper objects for their charitable bequests, preferring the humble
                    and industrious pauper to the idle and sturdy beggar. He also offered
                    considerable premiums to persons who should introduce any new or advantageous
                    mode of agriculture, or who should bring to perfection any old invention, open
                    any new branch of commerce, establish any new manufacture, or contrive any
                    machine or process that might be useful in the arts.</p>
                <p>Early in the year 1803, the emperor fitted out, at his own expense, two vessels
                    for a voyage of discovery round the world, under the command of Captain
                    Krusenstern. These ships were provided with every necessary for accomplishing
                    the object of the voyage; and several men of eminence for science and
                    literature, among whom was Churchman the American astronomer, volunteered their
                    services on this occasion.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of 1804 the emperor established a university at Kharkof, in
                    Lithuania, for the cultivation and diffusion of the arts and sciences in that
                    part of the Russian empire; and Mr Fletcher Campbell, a Scotch gentleman, was
                    employed to procure masters for this new institution. Some time after, the
                    emperor ordered that meteorological observations should be regularly made at all
                    the universities and public schools, and the results published. It appears that
                    at the end of this year the sums allotted by the Russian government for
                    defraying the expenses of these institutions amounted to 2,149,213 roubles,
                    besides a gift of nearly 60,000 roubles towards erecting the new university.</p>

                <p>About this time an imperial ukase was published, granting to the Jews a complete
                    emancipation from the shackles under which that devoted people had long groaned,
                    and allowing them the privileges of educating their children in any of the
                    schools and universities of the empire, or establishing schools at their own
                    expense.</p>
                <p>For some time the genius of discord, which had again actuated the minds of the
                    European sovereigns, failed to extend her baleful influence over the Russian
                    empire; but it was scarcely possible that the emperor should long remain an
                    impartial spectator of the renewed disputes between his more powerful
                    neighbours. An important change had, in the latter end of 1802, taken place in
                    the ministry of the empire; and Count Worontzoff, brother of the late ambassador
                    at London, had been appointed great chan-cellor-in-chief of the department of
                    foreign affairs, with Prince Adam Czartoryski for his assistant. How far this
                    change in the councils of the empire influenced the political measures of the
                    court of St Petersburg, it is not easy to determine; but in the latter end of
                    1803, Alexander appeared to view with a jealous eye the presumption and violence
                    exercised by France among the German states, and the encroachments which she
                    appeared desirous of making on the freedom of the Baltic. Alexander had offered
                    his mediation between Great Britain and France, but without effect; and both
                    these parties strove to bring over the Russian emperor to their alliance. France
                    seems to have held out to the ambition of Alexander the bait of a partition of
                    the Turkish territories, the dismemberment of which had long been a favourite
                    object with his predecessors. At length, however, the court of London prevailed,
                    and the Russian ambassador, by his master’s orders, took leave of the First
                    Consul of the French republic, though without demonstrating any intentions of
                    immediate hostility. A new levy of a hundred thousand men was immediately
                    ordered, to recruit the Russian army; and, to prevent any jealousy on the side
                    of Turkey, assurances were given to the Sublime Porte of the amicable intentions
                    of Russia towards that power.</p>
                <p>On the Ilth of April 1805 a treaty of concert was concluded between Great Britain
                    and Russia, in which the two governments agreed to adopt the most efficacious
                    means for forming a general league of the states of Europe, to be directed
                    against the power of France. From the terms of the treaty, its objects appear to
                    have been, first, the evacuation of the country of Hanover and the north of
                    Germany; secondly, the establishment of the independence of the republics of
                    Holland and Switzerland; thirdly, the reestablishment of the king of Sardinia in
                    Piedmont; fourthly, the future security of the kingdom of Naples, and the
                    complete evacuation of Italy, the island of Elba included, by the French forces;
                    fifthly, the establishment of an order of things in Europe, which might
                    effectually guarantee the security and independence of the different states, and
                    present a solid barrier against future usurpation.</p>
                <p>For the prosecution of the great objects of this treaty, it was proposed by the
                    first article that an army of five hundred thousand men should be levied; but in
                    a subsequent separate article, the contracting parties, after observing that it
                    was more desirable than easy to assemble so large a force, agreed that the
                    treaty should be carried into execution as soon as it should be possible to
                    oppose to France an active force of four hundred thousand men. It was understood
                    and stipulated that these troops should be provided by the powers of the
                    continent who should become parties to the league, and subsidies should be
                    granted by Great Britain in the proportion of L.l,250,000 sterling for every
                    hundred thousand men, besides a considerable additional sum for the necessary
                    expense occasioned in bringing them into the field.</p>
                <p>About this time the occupation of Genoa by the French, on the pretence that that
                    republic was too feeble to support itself against the attacks of Great Britain,
                    was com-municated to the different courts of Europe, and excited in ' every
                    quarter the highest indignation. The Emperor Alexander, in particular, was
                    incensed at this new outrage. Such an open violation of those principles which
                    were justly regarded as essential to the general safety, committed not only
                    during the peace of the continent, but when passports had been delivered to his
                    ambassador, in order that a negotiation might be commenced for the purpose of
                    providing for the permanent security and repose of Europe, he considered as an
                    indecent insult to his person and crown. He issued immediate orders for the
                    recall of M. Novosilt-zoff; and the messenger despatbhed upon this occasion was
                    commanded to repair with the utmost diligence to Berlin. M. Novosiltzoff had not
                    yet left that city; he immediately therefore returned his passports to the
                    Prussian minister of state, Baron de Hardenberg, and at the same time delivered,
                    by order of his court, a spirited memorial explanatory of the object of his
                    mission, and of the circumstances which had led to its termination.</p>
                <p>The recall of the Russian envoy appeared to be the signal of hostilities on the
                    part of Russia and Austria against France. These hostilities may be said to have
                    commenced and terminated in the autumn of this year. The military operations
                    that distinguished this short but bloody conflict, the rapid successes of the
                    French, the capitulation of Ulm on the 17th of October, the occupation of Vienna
                    by the French on the 12th of the same month, and the sanguinary battle of
                    Austerlitz on the 27th of November, have been already noticed under the head of
                    France. The consequences of these disastrous events were, first a cessation of
                    hostilities, and at length a treaty of firm alliance between France and
                    Russia.</p>
                <p>But before Alexander finally stooped to the imperial eagles of Napoleon, he was
                    determined to make one more effort to preserve his independence. The Russian
                    envoy at Paris, DOubril, had hastily concluded a preliminary treaty of peace
                    between his master and the emperor of the French, which he signed at Paris on
                    the 8th of July 1806, and instantly set out for St Petersburg to procure the
                    ratification of his master. When the terms of this convention were laid before
                    the privy council by Alexander, they appeared so derogatory to the interests of
                    Russia, that the emperor refused them his sanction, and declared that the
                    counsellor of state, DOubril, when he signed the convention, had not only
                    departed from the instructions he had received, but had acted directly contrary
                    to the sense and intention of the commission with which he had been intrusted.
                    His imperial majesty, however, signified his willingness to renew the
                    negotiations for peace, but only on such terms as were consistent with the
                    dignity of his crown and the interests of his empire.</p>
                <p>In the mean time the king of Prussia began, when it n <hi rend="superscript"
                    >τ</hi> as too late, to see the folly and imprudence of the neutrality which he
                    had so long maintained, and he at length prepared to oppose his now feeble
                    efforts to the growing power of France. He brought together in the summer of
                    this year an army of at least two hundred thousand men, near Weimar and Jena,
                    while the French myriads assembled in Franconia and on the frontiers of Saxony.
                    Previously to the commencement of hostilities, his Prussian majesty issued a
                    spirited manifesto, in which he explained his motives for abandoning his plan of
                    neutrality, and appealed to Europe for the justice of his cause. He entered into
                    an alliance with the Emperor Alexander, and with the king of Sweden; and it was
                    expected that these united forces would at length hurl the tyrant of Europe from
                    his throne, or at least compel him to listen to equitable terms of pacification.
                    These expectations were, however, miserably disappointed. The same extraordinary
                    success was still to attend the arms of France,</p>

                <p>and the north of Europe was again condemned to submit in silence to her yoke.</p>
                <p>On the 13th of October 1806, the Prussians received a dreadful check at the
                    battle of Jena; and on the 27th of the same month Napoleon entered Berlin. While
                    the French were thus successful, the troops of the Emperor Alexander occupied
                    Prussian Poland, and took up their residence at Warsaw; but they were soon
                    attacked by the French under Murat, who on the 28th entered Warsaw with his
                    cavalry, on which the Russians retreated across the Vistula, burning the bridge
                    over which they had passed. On the 26th of December, a dreadful engagement took
                    place between the Russians commanded by General Ben-ningsen, and the French
                    under Generals Murat, Davoust, and Lannes. The scene of action was at
                    Ostralenka, about sixty miles from Warsaw, and the fighting continued for three
                    days. The loss was immense on both sides, though the advantage appears to have
                    been on the side of the French. According to French accounts, the Russian army
                    lost twelve thousand men in killed and wounded, together with eighty pieces of
                    cannon, and all its ammunition waggons; while the Russian account states the
                    loss of the French at five thousand men.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of February 1807, the Russians obtained a partial advantage in
                    the battle of Eylau. According to the account of this battle, given by General
                    de Bud-berg in a despatch to the Marquis of Douglas, the British ambassador at
                    St Petersburg, the Russian general Ben-ningsen, after having fallen back for the
                    purpose of choosing a position which he judged well adapted for manoeuvring the
                    troops under his command, drew up his army at Preus-sisch Eylau. During four
                    days successively his rear-guard had to withstand several vigorous assaults; and
                    on the 7th of February, at three o’clock in the afternoon, the battle became
                    general throughout the whole line of the main army. The contest was destructive,
                    and night came on before it could be decided. Early on the following morning the
                    French renewed the attack, and the action was contested with obstinacy on both
                    sides; but towards the evening of that day the assailants were repulsed, and the
                    Russian general remained master of the field. In this action Napoleon commanded
                    in person, having under him Augereau, Davoust, Soult, Ney, and Bessieres at the
                    bead of the imperial guards. The loss of the Russians in that engagement was by
                    themselves stated at above six thousand men, while they estimated that of the
                    French, probably untruly, at nearly double that number.</p>
                <p>This was the last important stand made by the Russian army. In May, Dantzig,
                    defended by eighteen thousand Russians and Prussians, surrendered to the French.
                    Several actions succeeded at Spanden, at Lamitten, at Guttotadt, and at
                    Heilsberg, in all of which the French had the advantage, till at length, on the
                    14th of June, the Russians appeared in considerable force upon the bridge of
                    Friedland, whither the French army under Napoleon was advancing. At three in the
                    morning the report of cannon was first heard, and at this time Marshals Lannes
                    and Mortier were engaged with the Russians. After various manoeuvres, the
                    Russian troops received a check, and filed off towards Konigsberg. In the
                    afternoon the French army drew up in order of battle, having Marshal Ney on the
                    right, Lannes in the centre, and Mortier 'on the left, while Victor commanded a
                    corps de reserve, consisting of the guards. At half-past five the attack began
                    on the side of Marshal Ney; and notwithstanding the different movements of the
                    Russians to effect a diversion, the French soon carried all before them. Theloss
                    of the Russians, according to the usual exaggerations of the French bulletins,
                    was estimated at from ten thousand to fifteen thousand men, and twenty-five of
                    their generals were said to have been killed, wounded, or taken. In consequence
                    of this victory the French became masters of all the country round Konigsberg,
                    and Marshal Soult entered that city in triumph. Thus concluded the campaign in
                    Germany, in which the Russians sustained a loss of at least thirty thousand of
                    their choicest troops.</p>
                <p>While these military operations were going forward on the continent of Europe,
                    the emissaries of France were' busily employed at Constantinople in exciting the
                    divan to' declare against their ancient enemies. They at length succeeded; for
                    on the 30th of December 1806 war with Russia was proclaimed, and twenty-eight
                    regiments of janissaries assembled under the command of the grand vizir. But the
                    disturbances which broke out in the latter end of May 1807 prevented any
                    operations of importance from taking place; and the pacification which was soon
                    concluded between Russia and France, though it did not entirely put a stop to
                    the war between the former power and Turkey, in some measure diminished their
                    hostile preparations.</p>
                <p>The defeats which the allied armies had sustained in Prussia and Poland rendered
                    peace, on almost any terms, a desirable object; and Alexander found himself
                    constrained to meet, at least with the appearance of friendship, the conqueror
                    of his armies. Propositions for an armistice had been made by the Prussian
                    general to Murat near Tilsit, and after the battle of Friedland the Russian
                    prince Laba-noff had a conference, on similar views, with the prince of
                    Neufchatel, soon after which an armistice was concluded between the French and
                    Russians. On the 25th of June an amicable meeting took place on the river
                    Niemen, between the emperors of Frajice and Russia, and adjoining apartments
                    were fitted up for the reception of both courts in the town of Tilsit. This
                    politic friendship was soon after cemented by the treaty of Tilsit, concluded
                    between the emperor of the French on the one part, and the emperor of Russia and
                    the king of Prussia (whom it despoiled of a fourth of his dominions) on the
                    other, on the 7th and 12th of July in this year. Thenceforth, until Napoleon’s
                    star began to wane, Alexander was his firm partisan; and his faithlessness
                    towards his former allies gave them no temptation to repose further confidence
                    in him.</p>
                <p>The conclusion of the treaty of Tilsit was notified to the court of London on the
                    1st of August; and at the same time a proposal was made from his imperial
                    majesty for mediating a peace between France and Britain. This mediation,
                    however, was declined on the part of Great Britain, until his Britannic majesty
                    should be made acquainted with the stipulations of the treaty of Tilsit, and
                    should find them such as might afford him a just hope of the attainment of a
                    secure and honourable peace. This declining of the mediation of Russia was no
                    doubt expected by the court of St Petersburg; but it served as a pretext for
                    binding more closely the alliance between that power and France, by breaking off
                    her connection with Great Britain. Accordingly, in October, Lord Granville
                    Leveson Gower, who had succeeded the Marquis of Douglas as British envoy,
                    received a note from the government, intimating that, as a British ambassador,
                    he could no longer be received at the court of St Petersburg, which he therefore
                    soon after quitted. An embargo was laid on all British vessels in the ports of
                    Russia, and it was peremptorily required by Napoleon and Alexander that Sweden
                    should abandon her alliance with Great Britain.</p>
                <p>An additional ground of complaint against the British court was furnished by the
                    attack on Copenhagen, and the seizure of the Danish fleet, in the beginning of
                    September; and though Lord Gower had attempted to justify these measures on the
                    plea of anticipating the French in the same transaction, the emperor of Russia
                    expressed, in the warmest terms, his indignation at what he called an unjust
                    attack on a neutral power. A considerable Russian fleet joined the French; but
                    the combined squadrons were compelled to seek for shelter in the Tagus, where
                    they remain<pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=572"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0572-0560"/>ed blocked up by the British, till they were
                    surrendered by the convention of Cintra; and another fleet of fifteen sail of
                    the line that proceeded up the Mediterranean, and advanced as far as Trieste,
                    shared a similar fate.</p>
                <p>On the 26th of October the emperor of Russia published a declaration, notifying
                    to the powers of Europe that he had broken off all communication between his
                    empire and Great Britain, until the conclusion of a peace between this power and
                    France. In a counter-declaration, published at London on the IOth of December,
                    his Britannic majesty repels the accusations of Russia, while he regrets the
                    interruption of the friendly intercourse between that power and Britain. His
                    majesty justifies his own conduct, and declares, that when tile opportunity for
                    peace between Great Britain and Russia shall arrive, he will embrace it with
                    eagerness; satisfied if Russia shall manifest a disposition to return to her
                    ancient feeling of friendship towards Great Britain, to a just consideration of
                    her own true interests, and to a sense of her own dignity as an independent
                    nation.</p>
                <p>In October 1808, a meeting took place at Erfurt between the emperors of France
                    and Russia, and a letter was drawn up under their signature, addressed to his
                    Britannic majesty. The object of this letter was, to induce the king of Great
                    Britain to enter into negotiations for a general peace, and with that view it
                    was despatched by Count Ro-manzoff, the Russian minister at Erfurt, to Mr
                    Canning, the British secretary of state for foreign affairs. It was answered by
                    an official note, requiring the emperors, as an indispensable condition of any
                    treaty with Britain, to receive Sweden as a party, to protect the interests of
                    Portugal and of the ex-king of Naples, and to extend the benefits of the
                    projected arrangements to Ferdinand VII. of Spain. These requisitions were
                    evidently quite inconsistent with Napoleon’s views; the emperors refused to
                    accede to them; and all hope of accommodation was in the mean time at an
                    end.</p>
                <p>The demand of concurrence in the views of France and Russia made on Sweden was
                    formally repeated in a declaration of the Emperor Alexander, published at St
                    Petersburg on the IOth of February in this year. In this declaration his
                    imperial majesty intimated to the king of Sweden that he was making preparations
                    to invade his territories; but that he was ready to change the measures he was
                    about to take, to measures of precaution only, if Sweden would, without delay,
                    join Russia and Denmark in shutting the Baltic against Great Britain, until the
                    conclusion of a maritime peace. He professed that nothing could be more painful
                    to him, than to see a rupture take place between Sweden and Russia; but that his
                    Swedish majesty had it still in his power to avoid this event, by resolving
                    without delay to adopt that course which could alone preserve strict union and
                    perfect harmony between the two states.</p>
                <p>The king of Sweden, however, determined to abide by the measures which he had for
                    some time pursued, and to adhere to the terms of the convention which had just
                    been concluded between him and the king of Great Britain. In consequence of this
                    determination, a Russian army entered Finland in the beginning of March, under
                    the command of General Buxhovden, and advanced against Helsingfors, which was
                    occupied by a single battalion of a Swedish regiment. This small force retired
                    into the fortress of Swea-borg, where they maintained themselves with great
                    bravery till the 17th of April, when they were obliged to capitulate. The loss
                    of this fortress, though inconsiderable in itself, so highly enraged the king of
                    Sweden, that he dismissed the naval and military commanders who had been
                    concerned in the capitulation.</p>
                <p>On the 27th of April, some slight advantage was gained over the Russians near
                    Rivolax, by the Swedish army under General Count Klinspor; but this was only a
                    partial gleam of success. The Russians soon overran almost all Finland, took
                    possession of Wasa, Old and New Carleby, and reduced ' under subjection the
                    whole province of which Wasa is the capital. The army of Field-Marshal Klinspor,
                    which originally consisted of sixteen thousand regulars, and many boors, was, by
                    the end of the campaign, reduced to little more than nine thousand men.</p>
                <p>The king of Sweden sent some reinforcements to his army in Finland; but the
                    forces which should have supported Klinspor were foolishly employed in a
                    fruitless attempt to conquer Norway; and in 1809 the Swedes were compelled to
                    cede Finland to Russia.</p>
                <p>Russia continued to appear in the unworthy character of Napoleon’s ally; and when
                    Austria made an effort in 1809 to recover her losses, a Russian army advanced to
                    co-operate with the French. The diversion which this produced was one cause of
                    the final success of Napoleon, whose situation after the battle of Aspern was
                    extremely critical. When Austria was at last compelled to accept of peace on
                    humiliating terms, Russia received as the reward of her services the district of
                    Tarnopol in Galicia, with a population of four hundred thousand souls. This
                    district was restored to Austria in 1815.</p>
                <p>In 1811, hostilities commenced between Russia and the Porte. It is of little
                    consequence to inquire into the causes of this rupture; a powerful and ambitious
                    government in the neighbourhood of a weak one never wants pretexts for war. The
                    result might have been serious, if not fatal to the Porte, had not the prospect
                    of a more arduous struggle induced Russia to suspend her efforts in that
                    quarter, and conclude a peace on condition of receiving a part of Moldavia and
                    Bessarabia.</p>
                <p>The great contest was now approaching which was to try the resources of Russia,
                    and ultimately to raise her to unexampled greatness. The seizure by France of
                    the territories of the Prince of Oldenburg, who was the emperor of Russia’s
                    brother-in-law, on the one hand, and the admission of British produce into the
                    Russian harbours on the other, furnished the ostensible grounds of the quarrel.
                    After some fruitless negotiations, Napoleon dismissed the Russian ambassador,
                    and left Paris to join the army on the 9th of May 1812. The events of this
                    disastrous expedition into Russia have been minutely related in the article
                    France; and the reader does not require to be reminded of those lamentable
                    sufferings of the French army, which were its principal result. The spirited
                    resistance of Russia now roused Prussia and Austria; and early in 1813 a league
                    was formed between these powers, to which Bavaria and other small states
                    acceded. The battle of Leipsic, fought on the 18th of October, led to the final
                    overthrow of the French domination. In all the transactions which followed,
                    Russia bore a leading part. At the congress of Vienna in 1814, the duchy of
                    Warsaw, consisting of part of the original conquests of Austria and Prussia in
                    Poland, was assigned to Russia, which thus ultimately obtained about four fifths
                    of the territory and three fourths of the population of that ancient
                    kingdom.</p>
                <p>In passing to the new system of foreign policy which has prevailed in Russia, as
                    well as in the rest of Europe, since the year 1815, we must pause for a moment
                    to remark the accessions of territory which the empire had made during the half
                    century which preceded that epoch. The reign of Catherine II. had, as we have
                    seen, been by far the most fertile in foreign acquisitions. Her conquests
                    included the Crimea, which was an incorporated portion of Russia since 1783;
                    Georgia, gained in 1785, though, as we have observed, not formally annexed till
                    1801; Bessarabia, with a part of Moldavia, and other Turkish possessions,
                    finally secured to ,Russia by the treaty of Bukarescht in 1812; Courland,
                    acquired in 1795; and the extensive spoils of Poland in 1793 and 1794. Paul’s
                    reign made no permanent addition of import<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=573" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0573-0561"
                    />ance, except some districts within the Persian frontier. Alexander’s gave to
                    Russia in the first years of the present century several of the tribes of the
                    Caucasus; Finland in 1809; Daghestan and other large territories ceded by Persia
                    in 1813; and in 1814, Napoleon’s grand duchy of Warsaw, which was erected into a
                    kingdom of Poland. The total population of these new Russian provinces cannot at
                    the very least be estimated under fifteen millions, and probably exceeds that
                    number.</p>
                <p>During the ten years of Alexander’s reign which succeeded the peace, and ended
                    with his death in 1825, he acquired no new territory as a substantive addition
                    to his dominions, but occupied himself assiduously in that indirect augmentation
                    of Russian influence on the states around the frontier, which had before his
                    time formed, and has since continued to form, the first step in all the schemes
                    of conquest projected by his ambitious nation. The objects of Alexander’s
                    foreign policy after 1815 were chiefly three; the suppression of constitutional,
                    or, as they were called by preference, revolutionary movements, in the central
                    and southern states of Europe; the weakening of Turkey, and the gradual
                    reduction of that power into a state of dependence .on the cabinet of St
                    Petersburg, so as to pave the way for the Russians towards the sovereignty of
                    the Levant; and the extension of the Russian influence in Persia and those
                    adjacent states, which must form the stepping-stones by which the Muscovites
                    will strive to pass, if they shall ever make the attempt, to the throne of
                    British India. For the attainment of the first of these great ends, there was
                    formed, under the guidance and by the suggestion of Alexander, that league of
                    princes which has been named the Holy Alliance; a confederacy whose bitter
                    fruits have been tasted in full measure by Italy and Spain, but whose conception
                    is in one view an encouraging tribute to the growing enlightenment of the world,
                    since it is the earliest instance in which despots, conspiring against truth and
                    freedom, have condescended to speak the language of Christianity and peace. In
                    reference to Turkey, the policy of Alexander aimed at gradually detaching the
                    Porte from its friendly relations with Great Britain and other European powers,
                    and insidiously advancing towards a position in which the sultan should find
                    himself powerless against his neighbours and his own subjects, until Russia
                    should stretch forth her protecting hand; but a check was administered to this
                    train of diplomacy, and a peculiar relation introduced between the courts of
                    Constantinople and St Petersburg, by the insurrection of Greece in 1821. To the
                    founder and head of the Holy Alliance the Greeks must have appeared to be mere
                    rebels, whom it was his duty as a neighbouring sovereign to assist in punishing;
                    while to the watchful power which desired by every available means to weaken and
                    circumscribe the power of Turkey, such an opportunity as the Greek revolution
                    was unusually tempting, and indeed the sultan’s ministers openly alleged that
                    the disturbances had been fomented by Russian agents. The result of the rising
                    in Greece has been related in our article on that country; and the other
                    misunderstandings between Russia and Turkey, the principal of which related to
                    the appointment of the hospodars in Wallachia and Moldavia, were not sufficient
                    to disturb the diplomatic system which was resumed after the Greek question had
                    been settled by the interposition of the other great European powers. The
                    designs of the emperor on the side of India chiefly exhibited themselves in
                    intrigues among the northern neighbours of our possessions in that country; and
                    the system scarcely came to light till after Alexander’s death.</p>
                <p>In the internal government of the empire, Alexander in-</p>
                <p>- traduced many salutary changes, especially in the early part</p>
                <p>- of his reign; but here, not less than in his foreign policy, the last ten years
                    of his life exhibited a marked contrast to its earlier portion. The transition
                    in his mind from a love of liberal institutions to a distrust of every thing
                    that seemed to threaten the stability of thrones, began almost with his alliance
                    with Napoleon, but reached full maturity after that extraordinary man’s fall. In
                    the first year of his reign he abolished the literary censorship, and afterwards
                    restored it with less absurd but not less severe rules than those of his father.
                    He at one time patronized both the education of the young and the general
                    dissemination of religious knowledge; but after the peace the missionary
                    societies were suppressed, and very harsh measures adopted against the
                    universities. In several particulars a better spirit prevailed. That tolerant
                    disposition towards the various sects of Christianity, of which we have remarked
                    more than one instance in passing, had already become systematic, and was never
                    departed from. The emancipation of the peasants from their state of serfdom was
                    long a favourite object with the emperor, who was able to attain it in
                    Cour-land, Livonia, and one or two other provinces, and used openly to lament
                    that private interests and prejudices had baffled his good intentions elsewhere.
                    Another plan of his, which was connected with the scheme just mentioned, was
                    that of the military colonies, of which Dr Lyall has published an interesting
                    account. The advantages which this system promised to confer were these: the
                    diminution of the expenses of the army in times of peace, and the easy training
                    of a large agricultural population to the trade of war. For these purposes
                    villages were built on the crown-estates along the western frontier of the
                    empire, and in these, soon after the peace, formidable detachments of soldiers
                    were settled with their families, and mixed among the boors who, belonging to
                    the crown, had previously been the sole or the principal inhabitants of the
                    districts. The whole male population of these new settlements was to occupy
                    itself alternately in rural labour and military exercises; and while the troops
                    who had already seen service were always in a position to take the field again,
                    the boors were gradually to qualify themselves for acting as a corps de reserve,
                    and for filling up vacancies. The plan excited considerable opposition; and
                    although the obstacles were finally to appearance vanquished, and the colonies
                    speedily mustered four hundred thousand fighting men, yet new difficulties have
                    arisen since Alexander’s death, and the present emperor has abandoned the idea
                    of extending the principle, or making it permanent.</p>
                <p>During the last few years of Alexander’s life he appears to have been completely
                    miserable. To family misfortunes, religious despondency, and disappointment in
                    political schemes, was added the continual terror of conspiracies in the heart
                    of the empire, which were said to have ramifications everywhere, and to aim at
                    nothing less than a total revolution, and the assassination of the whole royal
                    family. Those constant travels through the several Russian provinces in which
                    Alexander was engaged for two or three years before his death, have been mainly
                    attributed by some writers to his dread of poison or the dagger. In the course
                    of one of these journeys he died at Taganrog, on the Sea of Azof, on the 1st day
                    of December 1825.</p>
                <p>Alexander’s brother, the Grand Duke Constantine, whose conduct as governor of
                    Poland has been described in our article on the history of that country, was
                    immediately proclaimed emperor at St Petersburg; and whatever may have been the
                    feelings of the Russians themselves, foreigners who were acquainted with the new
                    sovereign by his general reputation, looked on his accession with pity for his
                    subjects and alarm for the peace of Europe. But the danger had been foreseen and
                    averted by Alexander and the rest of the family. Constantine had been induced to
                    resign his claims to the crown by a formal deed executed in 1822. The senate, on
                    opening the will of Alexander, found it to contain a nomination of his second
                    brother, the Grand Duke Nicholas, as his successor in the empire. The act of
                    resig <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=574"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0574-0562"/>nation was at the same time discovered, and in a
                    few days there arrived from Warsaw a communication from Constantine, in which he
                    acknowledged the existence and validity of the deed, and anew waived his right
                    of succession.</p>
                <p>Accordingly Nicholas I. ascended the throne, announcing the event by a
                    proclamation of the 23d of December 1825. The disturbance of the natural order
                    of succession was seized by the discontented as a favourable pretext for
                    insurrection; and the reign of the new emperor was opened by a military mutiny
                    in St Petersburg, which, after having been suppressed with bloodshed, was
                    followed by several executions, and many imprisonments and banishments to
                    Siberia. Nicholas, and his spouse, the princess royal of Prussia, were crowned
                    at Moscow in 1826, and at Warsaw in 1829. The latter of these two ceremonies did
                    not long precede the revolution of Poland, which has been the most remarkable
                    event of the emperor’s reign. It is unnecessary to repeat the circumstances of
                    that unfortunate struggle. The whole character and policy of Nicholas have been
                    similar to those of his brother since 1815, with, however, an additional degree
                    of force and boldness, which may be attributable partly to the natural progress
                    of the political tactics which were common to both, and partly to the more
                    energetic will and greater attachment to military principles and forms which
                    distinguish the younger brother.</p>
                <p>If we look to the three questions which were described above as forming the main
                    business of Alexander in his foreign policy, we find the position of Russia
                    regarding them to have remained, with slight alterations, the same since the
                    commencement of the new reign as it was before. The anti-constitutional views of
                    the Holy Alliance have been necessarily modified, but not abandoned; although
                    Nicholas speedily recognised the title of Louis Philippe to the French throne,
                    and took an active share in the conferences of the five powers at London for
                    arranging the affairs of Belgium and Holland. On the side of Turkey, Russia has,
                    during the last fifteen years, been rapidly gaining strength. The treaty of
                    Akjerman between the two powers in 1826, extending the principles laid down in
                    the peace of Buka-rescht, was ill executed on both sides; and the mutual
                    misunderstanding, being still further complicated by the emergence of the Greek
                    question, issued first in the battle of Navarino, and afterwards in a regular
                    war of two years between Russia and the Porte. The first campaign, in 1828, was
                    favourable to Russia, but not completely decisive; that of 1829 was celebrated
                    for the successful passage of the Balkan by the Russian general Diebitsch <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and was closed in September by the peace of Adrianople,
                    in which Turkey consented to several articles both humiliating and injurious.
                    Russia received but a slight direct accession of territory, but obtained a
                    confirmation of the right of her vessels to navigate the Black Sea, a definitive
                    settlement of frontier towards Turkey, and a recognition of such restrictions on
                    the Turkish government of Moldavia and Wallachia as materially weakened the
                    sultan’s power. The fortresses of these provinces were moreover to be garrisoned
                    by Russian troops, till the Porte should have paid to Russia the expenses of the
                    war; and accordingly the provinces were not evacuated till 1834. Diplomatic
                    skill, and other means less justifiable, strengthened the hold of Russia on the
                    Porte, whose weakness was completely exposed in 1832, when Russian troops
                    appeared as its protectors against its own rebellious subject the viceroy of
                    Egypt. Turkey, in short, has in the mean time thrown herself unreservedly under
                    the influence of Russia, and it appears not improbable that the course of events
                    may very soon allow that influence a yet more favourable field. The most
                    conspicuous incident of recent Russian history on the side of India has been the
                    war with Persia, commenced in 1826, carried on successfully by the generals
                    Yermoloft'and Paskewitsch <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> and terminated in 1828 by
                    the cession of some important provinces to Russia. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Persia.) Since that time, both in Persia and in the neutral countries on the
                    frontiers of British India, there is little reason to doubt that the Russian
                    diplomacy has been acquiring an increasing influence. The only actual accession
                    of territory to Russia in this quarter that deserves notice was given in 1829 by
                    the revolt of the Kirghis Tartars, formerly subject to China, who now placed
                    themselves under the sovereignty of Russia, and brought the Russian frontier
                    nearer by another step to our Asiatic possessions.</hi></p>
                <p>Internally Russia has had to contend with incursions of' the Caucasian hordes
                    from beyond the frontier, with revolts &lt; of the Lesghians and other tribes
                    nominally subject to the <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> empire, and lately with
                    an extensive and spirited insurrection of the Circassians, which it has not yet
                    been possible to quell.</p>
                <p>The domestic government of Nicholas has little to dis-: tinguish it from tbat of
                    his brother. Education has been ∣ to some extent more favoured than it had
                    recently been by <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Alexander; the Catholic and
                    Lutheran churches continue to receive the support of the government, which has
                    also aided missions to the Calmucks and other nomadic hordes; trade and
                    manufactures have been furthered by regulations devised with much intelligence;
                    and the laws have since 1826 received a tolerably complete revision and
                    concentration.</p>
                <p>STATISTICS.</p>
                <p>The Russian empire is of enormous extent, of vast resources, and of great
                    capacity of improvement. It forms a connected territory, extending from the
                    frontiers of Germany and Prussia, and the shores of the Gulf of Bothnia,
                    eastward to the sea which separates Asia from America, thus embracing nearly one
                    half of Europe and all the north of Asia. Beyond Behring’s Straits it extends
                    over a portion of the north-west territory of America, embracing at the same
                    time a number of islands situated in the ocean which washes the northern shores
                    of Europe and Asia, and flows between Asia and America. Its most westerly point
                    is in longitude 18° 20 <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> 15", and its most easterly
                    in 209° 14' east from Greenwich, thus extending through about 190 degrees of
                    longitude. Its northern and southern boundaries have deep indentations; the
                    extreme points of the former are in 78° 4 <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> , and of
                    the latter in 38° 40 <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> of north latitude. This
                    empire embraces about the one-ninth (some estimate it as high as the
                    one-seventh) part of the habitable globe, the one-fourteenth part of the
                    northern hemisphere, and above the one twenty-eighth part of the superficies of
                    our planet. The whole of China is not equal to two thirds of Russia; and the
                    Roman empire, at the period of its greatest extension, did not comprehend more
                    than one fourth of the territory which now bows to the sceptre of the czar. Some
                    have included the mountains of Caucasus, others the whole of the Caspian Sea,
                    whilst some again have omitted the one and not the other. A very elaborate
                    calculation of the superficies of Russia has, within these few years, been
                    published by M. Sernoff, who has invented an improved method of computing areas,
                    by which he can allow for the inequalities of boundaries. “Russia in Europe,
                    including Russian Poland and the islands of the Baltic and German Ocean,
                    contains 2,078,646-∣⅛¼ <hi rend="subscript">i</hi> English square miles, of
                    which 151,049¼' <hi rend="subscript">l</hi> ¼ <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> lie
                    within the frigid zone, and l,927,598-, ½⅛ within the temperate zone. Siberia

                    except Nova Zembla, and of the Pacific Ocean, as well as the peninsula of
                    Alyaska in America) contains 4,866,64⅛∕A English square miles, of which
                    l,130,495-j¾° <hi rend="subscript">i</hi> y are situated within tile frigid

                    within the temperate zone. It is impossible to calculate the exact area of Nova
                    Zembla, as the southern coast of that island has not <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=575" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0575-0563"
                    />been laid down; but if it be supposed to extend in the form of a circle
                    between the promontories of Nikolskoi and Winter, the area would amount to
                    83,271 τ¾¾, English square miles. Thus the whole superficial extent of the
                    Russian empire is about 7,028,561-⅛C English square miles, of which l,364,815¼y,
                    ; lie within the frozen, and 5,663,745¼¼⅛ within the temperate zone.” According
                    to an estimate previously made by Kraft, Russia has a superficies of 7,023,252
                    English square miles, including 571,858 miles of steppes possessed by the
                    Kirghises, which however are omitted by M. Sernoff. We are inclined to adopt the
                    computation of the latter writer as the nearest approximation to the truth; for
                    perfect accuracy is not to be expected where so many liabilities to error exist.
                    In the statistical account of this great empire, we shall describe the European
                    and the Asiatic possessions of Russia separately; its American territory, and
                    the islands in the Polar and Eastern Oceans, coming under the latter head.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Russia in Europe.</hi></p>
                <p>Russia in Europe is bounded on the south by the Caucasus and the Black Sea; on
                    the north by the Arctic Ocean, especially by its great gulf the White Sea; on
                    the east by the river Kara Baigarama, the Ural chain of mountains, the river
                    Ural to its embouchure in the Caspian, and thence by the shores of this sea to
                    the eastern extremity of the Caucasus; and on the west by the principality of
                    Moldavia, Austria, Prussia, the Baltic Sea, and the dominions of Sweden.
                    Excluding Nova Zembla and the archipelago of Spitzbergen, but including the part
                    of Poland which has been absorbed by this vast empire, European Russia lies
                    between 18° 20 <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> 15 <hi rend="superscript">l</hi> *
                    and 64° 20' 15” of east longitude, and between 40° and 70° of north latitude.
                    Its extreme length, from the northern declivities of the Caucasian range, near
                    the sources of the river Samour, to the banks of the Muo-nio, near Ekontekis in
                    East Bothnia, is 1840 miles of sixty to a degree; and its breadth, from the west
                    side of the Ural chain, near the sources of the Sylva, in the government of
                    Perm, to the western limits of Vollhynia, on a line with Loutsk, is 1300 miles.
                    In comparison with its size, Russia has less sea-coast than any other great
                    European power. Its line of coast on the Frozen Ocean is about 920 miles in
                    length, on the Baltic Sea about 1230, and on the Black Sea and the Sea of Azof
                    about 1280; forming altogether a district of sea-coast about 3430 miles in
                    length. Thus a greatly preponderating part of the country is cut off from all
                    maritime intercourse and influence, except by means of navigable rivers and
                    canals, which at best are but an indifferent substitute for the ocean. Owing to
                    this circumstance, and the interruptions occasioned by the ice in the Arctic
                    Sea, and in a considerable portion of the Baltic for the greater part of the
                    year, Russia has made less progress in commerce and civilization than other
                    nations of Europe more favourably situated.</p>
                <p>European Russia, together with Poland, belongs entirely to that immense level
                    plain which begins in the north of Germany, and extends over the whole east of
                    Europe. From the Carpathian to the Ural range, a distance of five hundred
                    leagues, all is one immense undulating plain, without a mountain to break the
                    monotonous level of the horizon, or oppose a barrier to the winds. A great
                    portion of it, in the south especially, consists of those immense levels called
                    <hi rend="italic">steppes,</hi> that, like the pampas of South America, present
                    to the eye only a dead flat for many hundreds of miles. Here and there indeed
                    the surface is diversified by some large ancient tumuli, supposed to be the
                    burial-places of the ancient Scythians, and in a few places there are small
                    tablelands; but the latter swell so gently above the surrounding level as
                    scarcely to be perceptible. Of these, the most worthy of notice are the Valdai
                    Hills and the forest of Vol-konskoï, situated in the governments of St
                    Petersburg,</p>
                <p>Moscow, Tver, and Tula, the loftiest summit of which, lying between the villages
                    of Poloschva and Mosti, and the towns of Ostasckov and Valdai, is only 1064
                    French feet in height. No part of the forest of Volkonskoi is very rugged; on
                    the contrary, it is a gently sloping plain. But the rivers and the
                    deeply-indented lakes are encompassed by steep banks of slate, gypsum, and
                    limestone mixed with shells. Masses and blocks of granite are scattered on the
                    surface. This ridge, or rather plateau, is rich in iron, sulphur pyrites,
                    vitriol, alum-earth, a species of coal, petrifactions, salt springs, and lime
                    and gypsum quarries. Here are situated, within the distance of a hundred miles,
                    the sources of the rivers Volga, Dvina, Dnieper, Don, Oka, Volchow, Lowat, Pola,
                    Kolp, and others less distinguished. To the north-east, the land gradually
                    slopes to the almost flat shores of the Baltic Sea, and is for the most part
                    covered with immense forests, marshes, and turf-moors. Between this ocean inlet
                    and the White Sea, on the north-northwest, lies a tract of country which is
                    richer in water than any other in Europe. Here a multitude of lakes, large and
                    small, are united together like a network of water, and between them extend
                    those rocky ridges which, on the northwest, rise into the inferior Finnish chain
                    of hills. These, however, sink again towards the lake Enara and the river Tana,
                    without joining the Scandinavian system of mountains. Proceeding south-west from
                    the interior hills of Voldai, the land also gradually sinks, and becomes
                    encumbered by immense marshes, situated between Minsk and Volhynia. Through
                    these the river Priepetz, the great feeder of the Dnieper, takes its way,
                    constituting their drain or outlet. The northern declivities of the Carpathian
                    Mountains only in a few places cross the borders of the Austrian territory, and
                    enter Russia, but not as hills of any height. Near the sources of the Oder, they
                    proceed towards the Vistula, and along this stream, as a plateau eight hundred
                    feet in height, which, eastwards between Pilica and the above river, rises into
                    groups of mountains, which extend, in five parallel chains, having a breadth of
                    about fifty miles, for a distance of ninety miles. In two places they reach
                    about two thousand feet in height, which are the loftiest points in Poland. Upon
                    the other side, in the east, the declivities of the Carpathian range extend as a
                    broad plateau across the whole of Southern Russia. It thus separates the low
                    land of the interior from the maritime country of the Black Sea. Unlike the
                    table-land of Volkonskoi, which bears on its broad surface lakes and fens, this
                    southern plateau consists of large steppes, penetrated by the rivers Dniester,
                    Dnieper, and Don, which here form cataracts. , Between the last-named stream and
                    the Volga it rises as a continuation of the Lower Volgarange <hi
                    rend="subscript">1</hi> which, under the name of the Irgeni Hills, extends
                    southwards to the Caucasus. On the peninsula of Crimea, a wholly insulated chain
                    of mountains rises to a considerable height, and runs from east to west nearly a
                    hundred and twenty miles, close to the coast of the Black Sea. In one part it
                    attains an elevation of 4740 feet, and in another 4600 feet. Along the eastern
                    boundary of European Russia, the Ural mountain chain extends from the shores of
                    the Frozen Ocean southwards towards the Caspian Sea, for a distance of nearly
                    1500 miles, unconnected with any other mountain system of Europe. The northern
                    portion of the Ural chain, from the Straits of Waygats to the sources of the
                    Petchora, consists of rough, naked, limestone rocks, which in one place,
                    Padwinski, are 6500 feet in height. This part of the country is comparatively
                    little known. The middle portion of the chain, as far as the sources of the
                    Oufa, called the Verchoturic Urals, forms a broad tableland of moderate
                    elevation, overspread with morasses. Further to the south the Urals rise again
                    in height, and become thickly wooded, whilst in the government of Orenburg they
                    expand in broad ramifications on both sides of the river Ural. The chain, with
                    all its branches,sinks tα-</p>

                <p>wards the Caspian, without coming into contact on the east with the mountain
                    systems of Asia. It is called at different points the Orenburg, Baschkir, and
                    Kirghis Urals, and sends out an offshoot on the south-west, between the rivers
                    Ural and Samara, the Obschtschei-Syrt, which stretches to the banks of the
                    Volga. The Sok Mountains form a part of this spur of tire Urals. There are seven
                    defiles or passes through this great range, the most practicable of which are
                    the roads from Perm and Orenburg into Asia. Between the southern declivities of
                    the Urals and the Caspian Sea and Aral, there is an opening of about two hundred
                    and eighty miles in breadth, through which, more than once, the hordes of Asia
                    in former times have poured like a flood over Europe.</p>
                <p>Steppes, or plains, are an important feature of the geography of Russia, as well
                    as of that of Tartary, with which the term is more frequently associated. The
                    most important of these are the following: 1. The Steppe of Petchora, which
                    stretches along both sides of the rivers Dvina and Petchora, from the Icy Ocean
                    and White Sea, to the northern part of the government of Vologda. It is called
                    Tundra, and consists of turf-moor covered with moss. In the north it is
                    destitute of wood; in the south it is thickly wooded, and has many small
                    fresh-water lakes. 2. The little Jaroslav Steppe, situated between Koslov and
                    Tambov, a plain rich in flowers, and fifty versts <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As we shall have frequent occasion to mention
                    Russian weights and measures, we here present a table, to which the reader can
                    refer, in order to understand what the calculations are equivalent to in
                    English. </p></note> in diameter. In connection with it may be mentioned the
                    great steppe between Tambov and Kopersk, which is plentifully supplied with
                    water, very fruitful, and rich in vegetables and pasture. 3. The Steppe of the
                    Don, belonging to the Don Cossacks. This immense plain, wholly destitute of
                    hills, is about 57,600 geographical square miles in extent; in some parts it is
                    fruitful, but in general the soil is barren and uncultivated. 4. The Kuban
                    Steppe, extending from Kuban to the Manitch. The soil is very unproductive, and
                    rests on a bed of sandy limestone. 5. The Steppe of Azof, which extends on both
                    sides of the Lower Manitch, to the Sea of Azof and the Lower Don; but it is as
                    worthless as the former. 6. The Steppe of Taurida, a gentle declivity of the
                    northerly and easterly mountains of Taurida, inclining towards Kertsch and the
                    Bosphorus, the Putrid Sea (a branch of the Sea of Azof), and the Straits of
                    Perekop. The soil near the mountains is poor and unproductive; but farther down
                    it becomes clayey and fruitful, and towards the sea is impregnated with salt.
                    Similar to the Steppe of Taurida are those of Vosnesenks and Otcha-kof. 7. The
                    Steppe of Nogais on the Black Sea and the Sea of Azof, from the Lower Don to the
                    Lower Dnieper. It is a dry unwooded tract, of some value to the wandering
                    tribes, but nearly useless to the settled countryman. 8. The</p>
                <p>Steppe of Astracan, stretching between the Don, the Volga, and the Caucasus; and,
                    9. the Steppe of Kalmytz. According to Pallas, both of these immense plains must
                    at one time have been covered with the waters of the Caspian Sea. But, in fact,
                    the whole country appears at some period of remote antiquity to have lain
                    beneath the tide of the ocean. Two large oases must be noticed as occurring in
                    the midst of these steppes; they form the country of the Little Russians, and
                    that of the Don Cossacks.</p>
                <p>M. Huot, in his new edition of Malte-Brun’s great geographical work, thus
                    mentions the rivers of Russia. “The soil of Russia is so slightly undulated,
                    that to consider the spaces traversed by its rivers as true basins, would be an
                    abuse of terms; notwithstanding that it contains the most important
                    water-courses in Europe. It would not perhaps be more exact to apply the same
                    name to the Black, Caspian, and Baltic Seas, or to the Icy Ocean, in one or
                    other of which all its waters disembogue. I prefer designating by the
                    denomination of declivities the inclination of the. soil to these several seas,
                    and hence shall term them the Tauric, Caspian, Icy, and Baltic declivities. The
                    Tau-ric, to which I give the name because all the water-courses which descend on
                    this side have their embouchures around the peninsula of Taurida, is watered by
                    the Dniester, the Dnieper, the Bog, and the Don; the Caspian, the waters of
                    which fall into the sea of that name, is furrowed by the Terek, the Volga, and
                    the Ural; the Icy declivity, formed by the tracts which incline towards the
                    White Sea and Icy or Frozen Ocean, is watered by the Petchora, the Mezen, and
                    the Northern Dvina; lastly, the Baltic comprehends all the streams which fall
                    into the Baltic, the most important being the Torneo or Tornea, the Neva, the
                    Southern Dvina or the Dvina, and the Niemen.” Some eminent German geographers
                    have also adopted this plan of classifying the rivers according to the seas into
                    which they discharge themselves; and as it has several advantages over the usual
                    method of describing the streams of a country in the order of their size and
                    importance, we shall follow it.</p>
                <p>In the declivity which slopes to the Black Sea and the Sea of Azof, there is, 1.
                    the Danube, whose northern arm forms part of the southern boundary between
                    Russia and Turkey. Below Galatz it receives its last tributary the Pruth, which
                    descends from the mountains of Gallicia or Austrian Poland, and separates
                    Bessarabia in Russia from Moldavia in Turkey. 2. The Dniester, which rises also
                    in Gallicia, and flows with many serpentine windings towards Russia. Below
                    Chotzim it is broken by rapids, so that near Bender boat-navigation is
                    interrupted, and without receiving any tributaries of importance it falls into
                    the Black Sea at the broad but shallow estuary or Lake of Ovidovo. 3. The
                    Dnieper, which has its source in the government of Smolen-sko, on the southern
                    slope of the Volkouski Wood, and empties itself into the Black Sea below Kerson.
                    This noble stream receives many tributaries, amongst which, on .the right, flow
                    in the Berezina, the Priepetz, and the Bug, and on the left the Soj, the Desna,
                    the Sem, Sula, Psiol, Vorskla, and others. This river is the ancient
                    Borystlienes. It is connected by canals with the Dvina and the Niemen. 4. The
                    Don, which originates in the small lake of Ivanovsko, in the government of
                    Riasan. After intersecting the Cossack territory to which it gives name, it
                    discharges itself below Tcherkask into the Sea of Azof, by several mouths. In
                    summer it is shallow; in spring it overflows its low banks to a great extent,
                    and forms unhealthy morasses. By means of navigable canals it is connected with
                    the rivers Shat, Upa, Oka, and Volga. Its principal affluents on the right are
                    the Sosna and Donetz, and on the left the Vorone; (on which stream Peter the
                    Great built his ships for the Black Sea), the Khoper, Medveditsa, anti the
                    Manitch. 5. The Kuban, which descends from the northern side of Elburz in the
                    Caucasus, flows first north and then west, upon the boundary between Asia and
                    Europe. It separates into two main branches, the northern of which falls into
                    the Sea of Azof, and the southern into the Black Sea.</p>

                <p>On the Caspian declivity we have, 1. the Volga, the largest river in Europe. It
                    originates in the government of Tver, near the village of Volgo Verkovie, in the
                    forest of Volkouski, in north latitude 57° V 37". It traverses Lakes Steij,
                    Peno, and Volga, and on receiving the waters of Lake Seligher, it becomes
                    navigable, and falls into the Caspian Sea by eight principal arms, which have in
                    all sixty-five mouths, forming about seventy islands. It has a number of
                    tributaries, the principal of which, on the left, is the Kama, or Little Volga,
                    which has a course of about a thousand miles in length. Before the Volga
                    receives the Kama, the rivers Tverza, Mologa, Ounja, Vetlouga, and others, join
                    it on the left; and on the right the Oka, which descends from the water-shed
                    where the Don and the Dnieper originate. The Soura, which flows from the
                    mountains of Volga, is another large tributary, which joins it on the right. The
                    Volga is nearly two thousand miles in length. Its breadth at Astracan, where it
                    embraces many islands, is nearly five leagues at the greatest height of the
                    water. The depth of its waters varies from seven to eighteen feet. In the winter
                    it is covered with ice throughout its whole extent, but there are always many
                    apertures in the south, from which currents of air escape, and hence they are
                    termed the lungs of the Volga. During summer the Volga is crowded with thousands
                    of boats, constructed in the well-wooded countries of Northern Russia, and
                    bearing down from the interior all kinds of commodities. Their return being
                    difficult, they are generally broken up and sold at Astracan. This noble river
                    is the principal commercial road of the interior of the Russian empire. It
                    encircles the central table-land, receiving, as we have seen, the Oka, the
                    principal river in this fertile region. It communicates in the upper part of its
                    course by the canal ofVichnei-Volotchock, with the Lakes Ladoga and Onega; and,
                    lastly, the Kama conveys to it all the waters of Eastern Russia. “The town of
                    Astracan,” says Malte-Brun, “may be supposed an Alexandria on a Scythian Nile,
                    but the river enters an inland sea; it does not communicate with the ocean, and
                    the countries which it waters are inhabited by barbarous nations; still,
                    however, the advantages which human industry may derive from the majestic
                    courses of the Volga and the Danube are not as yet realized.” The term
                    “barbarous” is' now scarcely merited. 2. The Ural, or Oural, so called in
                    conformity to a decree of Catherine II. It descends from the eastern declivities
                    of the mountains bearing the same name, and flowing in a smooth channel
                    sufficiently deep for small vessels, traces for a considerable distance the
                    eastern and southern frontiers of the government of Orenburg, and the eastern
                    limits of Europe. On the right it receives the Sakmara, on the left the llek,
                    and after a course of above a thousand miles falls into the Caspian near
                    Gouriev. 3. The Terek. This stream rises at the base of the Kazbek; receives on
                    the right the rivers Songa and Aksai, on the left the Ourong, Tcherek, Bekhar,
                    and Malka; and enters the Caspian by three principal mouths, between the Gulfs
                    of Kouma and Agrakhan.</p>
                <p>On the declivity of the Frozen Ocean we have, 1. the Petchora, which rises in the
                    Ural mountain range, and traverses the most solitary deserts of Russia, the
                    governments of Archangel and Vologda. Its steep calcareous banks are broken by
                    caverns and ravines; and hence its name Pet-choran, which in the Russian
                    language signifies caverns. After receiving, amongst other tributaries, the
                    Oussa on the right and the Tyra on the left, it falls into the Arctic Ocean in
                    north latitude 67° 10', its mouths forming an immense estuary. The length of its
                    course is about 670 miles. 2. The Mezen, which originates in some bogs in the
                    government of Vologda, and after a course of five or six hundred miles
                    discharges itself into a bay of the same name on the shores of the White Sea,
                    almost under the polar circle. 3.' The Dvina, which name the rivers Soukhona and
                    Joug receive after their junction near Weliki-Oust-Joug. The Soukhona flows from
                    Lake Koubinskoe, in the government of Vologda; it is united with Lake Bielo by
                    means of a canal, and also with the rivers Volga and Neva in the same manner.
                    The Joug rises in the same government, but is a much smaller stream. The Dvina
                    does not assume the dimensions of a large river till after the junction of the
                    Vychegda, which falls into it on the right. The latter is united with the Volga
                    by means of Catherine’s Canal. Near Khol-mogory it divides into several arms,
                    and after a course of above 700 miles falls into a gulf of the same name. Its
                    mouth is greatly obstructed by a bar of mud. 4. The Onega, which is the outlet
                    of several lakes, but not that of Onega, although it be situated in the
                    neighbourhood. There are other rivers which fall into the White Sea and Arctic
                    Ocean, but none of them are of any great moment.</p>
                <p>The declivity of the Baltic Sea contains a variety of rivers.</p>
                <p>1. The Torneo, or Tornea. It originates in Swedish Lap-land, and, after the
                    confluence of its great tributary the Muonio, down to its embouchure in the
                    Baltic Sea, it forms the boundary between Russia and Sweden. The Muonio,
                    likewise, traces for some distance the limit of the empire on this side. The
                    Tornea has a course of about 280 miles.</p>
                <p>2. The Neva, in several respects a remarkable river. “The Neva,” says Colonel
                    Jackson, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Journal of the
                    Royal Geographical Society, vol. v. part i. p. 1. To this able paper the reader
                    is referred for some interesting particulars regarding the Neva. </p></note>
                    “though it be called a river, is more properly a bosphorus or strait. Its
                    length, from Schlusselburg, at the south-west angle of the Ladoga Lake, to its
                    mouth, is sixty-nine versts; its direction that of a straight line from east to
                    west; its medium breadth about 1500 feet; and its depth, in many places
                    considerable, is generally in the channel about fifty feet. The water of the
                    Neva is remarkably pure, and though the first use of it by strangers generally
                    produces slight diarrhoea, yet it is very wholesome and extremely palatable.
                    This fine river is the grand and only outlet for the superabundant waters of
                    four great basins, each of which has an extensive natural reservoir of its own.
                    These reservoirs are the Lakes Onega, Ilmen, Salma, and Ladoga; the latter
                    receiving the drains of the other three. Ten different streams flow into the
                    Onega, whose length from north to south is 190 versts, and its breadth from east
                    to west seventy versts. It discharges into the Ladoga by the Sveer, a river 202
                    versts long, and of very unequal breadth. The Rmen is fifty-five versts long
                    from north-east to south-west, and about thirty wide from north-west to
                    south-east. It receives eleven streams, and has its outlet into the Ladoga by
                    the Volkoff, 206 versts long, with a medium breadth of 1400 feet. The Saima,
                    which is rather a collection of lakes, of gulfs, and bays, of all shapes and
                    sizes, communicating with each other, than a regularly-formed and single sheet
                    of water, is estimated by Peter Friccius at 130 versts long in the direction of
                    west-south-west to east-north-east, and 120 from north to south; but on the
                    Swedish side it is about 280 versts more. It pays its tribute to the Ladoga by
                    means of the Voksha or Voxa, a river about 180 versts long, and not navigable in
                    consequence of its several cascades, of which the most considerable, that of
                    Imatra, has a fall of upwards of thirty-two feet. Besides the Sveer, Volkoff,
                    and the Voxa, the Ladoga receives the waters of thirteen other streams. This,
                    the largest lake of Europe, is about 175 versts long and 105 broad, and of an
                    oval form. The surfaces of the four lakes are thus estimated. The Onega, 430
                    leagues, of 25 to a degree; the Ilmen, 36; the Sai'ma, 210; and the Ladoga, 830
                    degrees.” At St Petersburg the Neva di<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=578" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0578-0566"
                    />vides into several deltoid branches, the largest of which is 1260 feet across,
                    and bears along a mass of about 74,000 cubic feet of water in a second, while
                    the Nile in the same time furnishes but 21,800 cubic feet. It moves at the rate
                    of about two miles and one furlong in an hour; but notwithstanding the immense
                    mass of water which is borne along, and the speed with which it moves, taking
                    one year with another, for five months of the year the navigation is interrupted
                    by its being frozen over, the ice sometimes exceeding three feet in thickness.
                    3. The Diina, or Southern Dvina. This river originates in a fen on the western
                    declivities of the forest of Volkonskoi, in the government of Tver, not far from
                    the sources of the Volga. It soon becomes deep enough to be navigable, but its
                    course is broken by falls and sand-banks; it falls into the Bay of Riga, without
                    having received any affluents of importance on its way. 4. The Niemen, which
                    rises in the forests of Kopislov, in the government of Minsk. It flows first in
                    a northerly direction, and then bending to the west, enters Prussia under the
                    name of Memel. On the right it receives the Vilia, a navigable stream; and on
                    tile left one or two others, but they are small and unimportant. 5. The Vistula.
                    This river rises in the principality of Teschen, in Eastern Silesia, at the foot
                    of the western Carpathian range of mountains. It flows in an easterly direction
                    to Cracow, where it becomes navigable, and as far as Sandomir forms the boundary
                    line between Gallicia and Poland. Amongst its confluents, the most important
                    are, the Bug, which originates on the northern side of a chain or lofty ridge of
                    hills separating the chalky lands of Volhynia from the rich plains of Podolia;
                    the Priepetz, a feeder of the Dnieper, which unites the Bug and the Niemen in
                    spring and autumn; and at Sie-rock it receives theNarew,ariverwhich flows from
                    the plains of Lithuania, and is believed by the common people to be fatal to
                    water-snakes. Its other tributaries are tile Pilica, which originates in the
                    heights above Warsaw; the San, which rises not far from the sources of the
                    Dniester; and the Bzura. 6. The Wartha. This river rises in a plateau near
                    Kromolow, in Cracow, flows in a broad channel like the Vistula, and inundates
                    the neighbouring fields. After receiving the Ner, it becomes navigable, and
                    though not so deep as the Vistula, has the appearance of a large river. After
                    receiving the Prosna, which for a great distance forms the boundary between
                    Poland and Prussia, the Wartha enters the Prussian territory, and adds its
                    waters to the Oder.</p>
                <p>The Baltic, the Black Sea, and the Caspian, will be found described in this work,
                    each under its own proper head. In the foregoing account of the rivers of
                    Russia, we have noticed four of the most considerable sheets of water in this
                    country. Deep in the interior are a few pretty large collections of water; but
                    lakes are not a characteristic of Russia, except in the north-west part, where
                    Finland is situated. Here immense numbers of winding lakes of varied form and
                    dimensions intersect the country in all directions, giving rise to numerous
                    rivers; but none of them irrigates a great extent of country. All these,
                    surrounded by flat and bleak shores and frozen plains, present little that is
                    striking in point of scenery, and afford few facilities for internal
                    intercourse. The coasts of Russia are deeply penetrated by large arms of the
                    sea, forming gulfs, bays, and the like. Besides the Black and Baltic Seas, we
                    have the Sea of Kara, which is the most easterly, and bathes at once Europe and
                    Asia. It is four hundred and fifty miles in length; but navigation is almost
                    constantly interrupted by ice at its northern entrance. On the extreme west is
                    the Bieloe More, or White Sea, which itself embosoms a number of bays and gulfs
                    of considerable size. The largest of these are the Gulfs of Mezen, Dvina, and
                    Onega, so called from the rivers which flow into them; and Kandalask, which
                    communicates with Lake Kovdozero. The White Sea is about the same length as that
                    of Kara, with a breadth of from sixty to seventy miles. Between these two great
                    inlets of the Arctic Ocean occur other gulfs, the most consi-derable being
                    Tcheskaia, which is separated from the White Sea by the peninsula of Kaniskaia
                    Zemlia, and that formed to the east of this by the estuary of the river
                    Petchora.</p>
                <p>The extensive inlets of the sea above mentioned of course form numerous
                    promontories and other projections of land. In looking over a good map, the most
                    striking which meets the eye is Cape Kamin or Canin, the north-western extremity
                    of the peninsula of Kaniskaia Zemlia. This neck of land, which Separatesthe
                    GulfofTcheskaiafrom the White Sea, stretches directly north into the Arctic
                    Ocean, a distance of about 150 miles. Its breadth is between forty and fifty
                    miles. Cape Onega projects into the White Sea near the bottom of that gulf, and
                    forms the Bay of Archangel on the north-east, and the Bay of Onega on the
                    south-west.</p>
                <p>In European Russia, the predominating kinds of rocks, or, to use the language of
                    geology, formations, are tertiary and alluvial; those of an older date, says
                    Professor Jameson, namely, the secondary, transition, and primitive series,
                    occupying but comparatively small space. The two latter occur in the Ural chain,
                    in Finland, and Russian Lapland, in some parts of Karelia, Olonetz <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> Crimea, Caucasus, the Valdai plateau, and Sandomir
                    Mountains, Revel, the country around Lake Ilmen and Vologda, and the tract
                    extending from Brody across the Bug and the Dnieper. The secondary lands
                    frequently appear rising like little islands in the great Russo-Polish plains.
                    Amongst the formations of this class of rocks are found coal, lime, gypsum,
                    chalk, and salt, which will be afterwards noticed. The tertiary rocks, which
                    occupy vast tracts of the low country, are clay, loam, limestone, brown coal,
                    with gypsum, and in many tracts, as in Austrian Poland, rich deposits of
                    rock-salt. There is a tertiary limestone almost peculiar to this part of Europe,
                    and extensively distributed throughout Poland, Podolia, and Southern Russia. “It
                    occurs, however,” says Jameson, “in the basin of Vienna, and Hungary, and in
                    France. It is the last dépôt of that sea which covered all the country to the
                    north of the Carpathians, from the Baltic Sea to the foot of that chain, and to
                    the Black Sea, in the middle of which rose the mountains of Sandomir, and the
                    plateau south-west, in the form of islands. It is covered by a marly clay, and a
                    sand formed by the last great alluvial catastrophe, which gave to Europe its
                    present form, and buried in its dépôts remains of unknown species of the
                    elephant, mastodon, rhinoceros, &amp;c.” In Central Poland there is a clay, with
                    lignite or brown coal, resting upon chalk, which is supposed by some geologists
                    to be the oldest members of the tertiary formations. The alluvial formation
                    consists of an old and new deposit, the former being composed of a great stratum
                    of marly clay or loam, interspersed with numerous blocks of granite and other
                    primitive rocks. It covers vast tracts of country in Poland, varying in
                    thickness from thirty to a hundred feet. The soil which it forms in the south of
                    Poland is excellent; but as it advances northward it becomes less and less
                    productive, and more and more intermixed with sands, gravels, and primitive
                    blocks. It is this deposit which contains such an immense quantity of fossil
                    remains of animals, including great whales. An alluvial sand, different from the
                    sand of rivers, is widely distributed in Poland, and connected with the great
                    sandy plain of Northern Germany. Vast numbers of large and small primary blocks
                    occur in this plain, and which, from their identity with the rocks of Sweden and
                    Finland, it is believed, on good grounds, have been transported from these
                    countries by a débâcle flowing from the north-east to the south-west. The same
                    débâcle has also formed the marly clay or alluvial loam; it has interred the
                    elephants and other animals of unknown antiquity; it has broken up the chalk
                    plains of the north, and separated Denmark from Sweden, and, in general, given

                <p>The great mineral repositories of this empire occur in the Ural and Altaic
                    chains; those in European Russia are few in number, and of little importance. A
                    tract called the central mining district of Russia extends from the Oka to near
                    the town of Kalouga, including portions of the governments OfNiznei-Novgorod <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> Vladimir, Tambov, Riazan, and Kalouga. But it is for
                    the most part a poor sandy district, containing iron ore; and as the metal is
                    manufactured in the localities where it is found, several extensive iron-works
                    are situated at intervals along the line mentioned. The ore is described as
                    occurring in regular beds, sixty feet below the surface. It is of several
                    varieties, the lightest coloured producing the most iron. Few minerals occur in
                    that large and sandy plain which we have noticed as forming the northern and
                    central portion of Poland. The land, as in all the northern countries on our
                    globe, is incrusted with a ferruginous deposit, and every marsh and every meadow
                    contains iron in a greater or less proportion. The iron is of indifferent
                    quality; and the existing veins of lead, gold, and silver, which, it appears,
                    were once productive, he beyond the Russian territory. At Petrozavodsk, near
                    Lake Onega, in Finland, there are iron-works, which, it is believed, are the
                    largest in the north of Russia. Bog-iron ore abounds in the neighbourhood; and
                    for a long time this was the only kind smelted; but thirteen different mines are
                    now wrought. Vast quantities are obtained by simply dragging the lakes. Another
                    great iron-work of the same description is situated four versts from St
                    Petersburg, on the road to Riga. Finland also yields copper and tin, but only
                    one mine of the former is wrought. Coal is found in very inconsiderable
                    quantities in European Russia. There is a small mine worked at Tula, another at
                    Bakhmout in the government of Ikaterinoslav, but neither seem to be of much
                    utility. In Southern Poland and Cracow there are numerous beds of black
                    bituminous coal, resembling that of Great Britain, some of which are thirty feet
                    in thickness. These occur in the secondary formation. In the tertiary districts
                    deposits of brown coal are met with, which also yields amber, the exudation of a
                    dicoyledonous tree. Russia possesses a great treasure in the numerous salt-lakes
                    and marshes of the Siberian steppes, and the country to the north of the Caspian
                    Sea. There are also mines of salt dispersed throughout the empire, and from
                    these sources immense quantities are annually obtained, the amount increasing
                    indefinitely with the population. There is a tract of country called the
                    Northern Salt District, which stretches in a line parallel with the Petersburg
                    limestone, for a thousand versts. It makes its first appearance in the island of
                    Oesel, and is worked in several parts of the south of Livonia. Quarries of
                    gypsum are also situated in this great tract. A central salt district is
                    described as existing in the course of the Volga. Along the course of the river
                    Kama there is also a rich and extensive marl, salt, and gypsum tract, probably
                    connected on the south with that of the Volga, and on the north with that <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> Vologda. The principal salt-works are in the neighbourhood
                    of Solikamsk; and the gypsum grottoes of Koungour, in the government of Perm,
                    are of great size and magnificence. There are in Poland large mines of
                    rock-salt, which annually yield immense supplies of the article. They form part
                    of that enormous layer of fossil-salt which extends along the Carpathian
                    Mountains, and is large enough to supply the consumption of all the nations of
                    the earth for an indefinite period of time. Copper-sand is found throughout a
                    vast tract of country extending over the governments of Perm, Viatka, and Oufa.
                    It completely skirts the south and west sides of the Ural Mountains. The sand is
                    of a dull red or green colour, and is usually worked for copper. It contains
                    fossil-wood impregnated with the metal. But it is in the Asiatic territory of
                    Russia that the most abundant mines of copper are found, as well as those of
                    gold, silver, platina, and other metals.</p>
                <p>In a country of such vast dimensions, the soil must of course vary considerably
                    in different situations. There is a vast tract of territory 65,000 geographical
                    square leagues in extent, which possesses a peculiar and rather remarkable soil.
                    Indeed, Ritter, in his <hi rend="italic">Erdhunde,</hi> informs us that there is
                    only one other place on the surface of the earth where any thing similar in soil
                    has been discovered, and that is the north of Hindustan. It consists entirely of
                    decomposed vegetable matter, and is deposited in a thick layer. It is situated
                    in the south of Russia, stretching in a broad belt from Volhynia in a
                    north-easterly direction, to the foot of the Ural chain, near Perm. It is
                    prolonged on one side from this to the shores of the Black Sea; and on the other
                    it stretches from Perm to Orenburg, and thence to the Caspian Sea. All this vast
                    tract, exceeding in extent France, Spain, and Prussiaunited, is covered
                    throughout with a stratum of vegetable mould, which varies in thickness from
                    three to five feet. It is so extremely productive as to stand in no need of
                    manure. Its fertility is shown in the large returns of grain, especially rye,
                    which it yields, and in the excellent breeds of cattle which are reared upon it.
                    From the thinness of the population, this vegetable mould is far from being
                    wholly laid out in corn -fields; vast tracts still remaining unoccupied. The
                    soils of the steppes which cover so large a portion of the surface of Russia we
                    have already adverted to when describing these plains. What remains to be said
                    regarding the soil of this country must be stated in reference to specific
                    localities, a general description being impracticable.</p>
                <p>The country between the Dniester and the Dnieper has a soil impregnated with
                    nitre, a substance deleterious to vegetation; yet, as soon as it is removed or
                    diminished, wheat, millet, and the arbute melon, may be cultivated with great
                    success. The mildest and most fruitful region in all the Russian empire is that
                    continuation of valleys arranged in natural amphitheatres at the southern base
                    of Taurida, along the coasts of the Black Sea. Proceeding eastward, we meet the
                    government of Astracan, only part of the soil of which is fertile. This portion
                    includes the low districts on the banks of the Volga, the Ural, and the Terek,
                    and is by no means large; but here vegetables attain an enormous size. The soil
                    is impregnated with saline and bituminous substances. Higher up, the land on the
                    Volga becomes sandy and unproductive. The soil of Little Russia and the Polish
                    Ukraine is partly sandy and not very fruitful, partly very rich and fertile. A
                    great part of Western Russia is sandy, and intersected by vast marshes and bogs.
                    Large tracts are covered with immense forests, the retreat of the bear, wolf,
                    and wild boar; whilst not an inconsiderable portion of this westerly territory
                    ranks amongst the most fertile in the empire.</p>
                <p>It thus appears, with regard to the soil of Russia, taking a summary view of it
                    along with the climate, that from the forty-fourth to the fiftieth parallel of
                    north latitude, comprising Bessarabia, Podolia, Kherson, Ikaterinoslav, and
                    Taurida, it is for the most part low and level, little wooded, partly very
                    fruitful, partly arid and unfruitful, and here and there impregnated with salt.
                    The winters are short, with little snow; but in some parts the cold is severe.
                    The spring is early and mild; the summer is of long duration, with oppressive
                    heat and little rain; autumn follows late in the year. In the heat of summer a
                    dangerous disease called <hi rend="italic">jassia</hi> is generated; it is fatal
                    to the lower animals as well as to man. Violent whirlwinds are frequent. The
                    south of Russia is subject to a north-easterly wind called <hi rend="italic">
                    mitel,</hi> often accompanied by snow, which is drifted with great violence, and
                    much dreaded by the inhabitants. The middle or temperate district, extending
                    from 50° to 57°,</p>

                <p>has a rough and long-continued winter, especially in the ' eastern territory.
                    This district is the largest and wealthiest portion of the empire, and forms
                    broad, open, undulating plains, over which, as far as the declivities of the
                    Ural chain upon the east, only slight elevations break the monotonous level. The
                    northern district, from 57° to 67°, in European Russia, has a much milder
                    climate than the same parallels in Asia. With the exception of the wooded
                    mountains of Finland on the west, it is, as far as the Urals, a continuation of
                    the former flat land, upon which forests, meadows, marshes, and moor-ground,
                    alternate with one another. The poor, meagre soil, only insures the husbandman a
                    return as far as the sixtieth parallel. The winter here is long and severe,
                    there being six or seven months in which travelling is prosecuted on sledges.
                    Mercury freezes in the winter, and the autumn is foggy. Here only slow-growing
                    wood succeeds, and beyond 67° is confined to dry, stunted shrubs. From 64° the
                    rearing of cattle is always difficult, and agriculture is limited to roots.
                    Under the parallel of 66° the sun does not set on the 21st of June, nor rise
                    above the horizon on the 21st of December. According to observations by the
                    Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences, extending over twenty years, from 1777 to
                    1797, the duration of winter in St Petersburg extends from the end of September
                    to the beginning of May. Snow and ice set in about the 9th of October, and
                    continue to the beginning of May. Upon an average, 230 days of the 365 are
                    reckoned as belonging to winter. For 160 of these, that is, from the 27th of
                    November till the 19th of April, the waters are bound fast with ice. In winter
                    the east wind prevails for 113 days, and the west sixty-eight days. In summer
                    the westerly wind prevails for 110 days, and the easterly for eighty-four days.
                    The quantity of rain which falls is firom ten to eleven French inches; the
                    number of rainy days is reckoned at about eighty. In 1774 there were reckoned
                    forty-eight appearances of the northern lights; but since 1782 their number has
                    decreased in a remarkable degree, especially within the last fifteen years. In
                    the arctic or hyperborean region, extending from 67° to 74°, the rigours of the
                    climate tell upon man and other animals, as well as upon vegetation; for neither
                    attain the full size nor the complete development of their members. In Archangel
                    the sun rises on the 11th of December at twenty-three minutes past ten, and sets
                    about our mid-day, thirty-seven minutes past one; whilst on the 10th of June it
                    rises thirty-seven minutes past one in the morning, and does not disappear below
                    the horizon until twenty-three minutes past ten in the evening. But beyond 67°
                    the climate is one long summer day and long winter night. The summer, however,
                    is much overcast with vapours, which obscure, and sometimes wholly conceal, the
                    sun. The dark and dreary reign of winter is greatly alleviated by clear
                    moonlight and the brilliant apparition of the aurora borealis. Trees cease
                    entirely about 67°, only hardy shrubs being able to endure the intense cold of
                    the climate. In St Petersburg in 1732 the cold was 33° below zero, and in Tornea
                    37° On the 12th of January 1809, quicksilver froze into a solid mass in Moscow,
                    and was extended with a hammer like lead. As this metal becomes solid about 33°,
                    we may reckon the degree of cold in this case as about 35° below zero.
                    Earthquakes were almost unknown in this country till the 17th of November 1821,
                    when Kief and other places were visited by one, which shook the buildings with
                    violence, but did no material damage.</p>
                <p>From the vast extent of this empire, and the great range of its temperature, it
                    is not surprising that the productions of every clime are found, or may be
                    successfully cultivated, in some parts of its wide-spread surface. On the east,
                    the great chain of the Urals separates by a bold line the northern European from
                    the northern Asiatic botany; and over this vast expanse winter reigns with
                    excessive severity, while the almost tropical temperature of the brief summer
                    brings the productions of the vegetable kingdom to sudden maturity; and this
                    rapid growth is followed by as rapid a decay in autumn.</p>
                <p>The forests of Russia are in several respects an important feature of the
                    country; firstly, as a physical characteristic, from their overspreading such
                    enormous tracts of country; secondly, in a commercial point of view, from the
                    timber, tar, pitch, potash, and turpentine, which they afford, forming important
                    items of trade; and, thirdly, from their supplying fuel in a country nearly
                    destitute of coal. An able writer thus describes them: “Estimating the surface
                    of European Russia,” says M. Schnitzler, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><hi rend="italic">La Russie, la Pologne, et la Finlande,</hi>
                    Paris and St Petersburg, 1835. This is a valuable work on the statistics of
                    Russia. </note> “at 402,100,552 dessaitines, 156,000,000 of this number are
                    occupied by forests; 178,000,000 by uncultivated land, water, houses, and roads;
                    61,500,000 dessaitines by arable, and a little more than 6,000,000 by
                    meadow-land. On this general view of the surface, we may compute that a
                    dessaitine of wood occurs for every two and five-ninth dessaitines without it.
                    The forests, indeed, constitute a source of riches which may long continue
                    inexhaustible, and which might be indefinitely increased by strict regulations
                    for their economy and management. Seventy-six millions of dessaitines are still
                    completely covered with pines, firs, and other cone-bearing trees, without
                    counting the oaks, maples, beeches, poplars, and elms, which are by no means
                    rare in the latitudes within the 52d degree, and the birch, which grow’s in
                    still more northern districts....The governments of Novgorod and Tver, in
                    particular, are studded with forests; that of Volkonskoi, which extends to the
                    Valdai Hills, is one of the largest known. In the government of Perm, out of
                    18,000,000 of dessaitines, 17,000,000 are forest. These immense tracts, covered
                    with wood, are a great blessing in so inclement a climate, as they form a
                    shelter against the wfinds from the icy seas. The provinces to the south have
                    not the same necessity for them, and are so destitute of wood as to occasion the
                    burning of grass and dung for fuel.” The trees furnish the inhabitants with
                    fir-timber of the finest and most durable quality, for building, household
                    furniture, and utensils; and for these purposes it is largely used in the
                    interior. The same tree supplies the peasantry with torches, which they use
                    instead of candles. The brushwood, which covers a vast extent of forest country,
                    consists almost entirely of the hazel, dwarf birch, alder, willow, and juniper.
                    In other places the surface of the earth is covered with wild bilberry, and the
                    cranberry, which is extensively exported.</p>
                <p>Russia is as yet chiefly an agricultural country. It is so extensive, and in many
                    parts yields such abundant crops of grain, that enough is produced not only for
                    home con- <hi rend="superscript"/> sumption, but for exportation in considerable
                    quantities. On an average of five years, the annual production of grain amounts
                    to 180,965,000 chetwerts, or about 134,818,920 English quarters, of which
                    quantity 50,335,864 chetwerts were reserved for seed, leaving 119,498,213
                    chetwerts for home consumption or exportation. The price of grain varies
                    exceedingly in different governments. Rye-meal in 1818 was, in Revel and Mittau,
                    twenty-six and twenty-seven roubles per chetwert, while in Viatka and
                    Simpero-pol it was only about the one half. St Petersburg, Moscow, Archangel,
                    Vologda, and Perm are the only governments that consume more than they raise;
                    all the others produce more than they require. The grains most commonly
                    cultivated are rye and oats. The best wheat is produced in Southern Russia,
                    where also, along with millet, a little rice <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=581" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0581-0569"
                    />is raised. Hemp and flax are very largely cultivated, and yield not only
                    material for the manufactures of the country, but a large surplus for
                    exportation.</p>
                <p>Whilst corn and cattle constitute the riches of the central districts, the
                    southern abound in productions of a more precious or delicate nature. The
                    peninsula of Crimea is adapted, by climate and soil, for all the productions of
                    Italy and Greece, and here, indeed, many of them are indigenous. Government has
                    taken a most lively interest in developing the resources of each district of the
                    empire; and in consequence of this the cultivation of the vine, an indigenous
                    plant, and the mulberry tree and sugar-cane, has been carried to a considerable
                    extent. In 1835 there were planted in Crimea 1,454,000 feet of vines, the annual
                    produce of which, in a few years, will be at least 75,000 vedros, or 250,000
                    gallons. The vine cultivation is extending with great success in the south, in
                    the governments of Astra-can, Kherson, Podolia, the country of the Don Cossacks,
                    and especially in the Taurida. In 1837, 1,150,000 vedros of wine were produced,
                    and 1,300,000 to be distilled; while in 1836 the whole quantity was not more
                    than 800,000 vedros. The mulberry tree has been as carefully attended to as the
                    vine, and the result has been, upon the whole, favourable. Vast plantations of
                    mulberries have been formed near all the principal towns of the southern
                    districts. Every encouragement is held out to planters by the government. In
                    Crimea and the countries of the Caucasus, the rearing of the silk-worm is
                    likewise rapidly advancing. Experiments have also been made to cultivate
                    sugar-cane and indigo; but it is doubtful if they will succeed. The corktree was
                    transplanted from Portugal to the Crimea in 1817, but we see no notice of it in
                    recent works.</p>
                <p>In Southern Russia, a region whose climate differs little from that of Asia
                    Minor, we find a similar abundance and variety of fruits and vegetables. The
                    flora of Russia is very abundant in the south. As Pallas informs us, the country
                    presents the most enchanting aspect. On the mountain side, in the valley, in the
                    forest, everywhere, the earth is clothed with a profusion of the loveliest
                    flowers, and aromatic herbs, whose delicate odours embalm all the surrounding
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Russia further produces hops (not sufficient for home consumption), and tobacco,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Nicoiana paniculata,</hi> of which the young leaves are
                    gradually removed, dried in the <hi rend="subscript">t</hi> shade, and buried
                    beneath hay-ricks, where they become of a brownish-yellow colour. Of garden
                    vegetables there are the usual varieties found in Europe. Spanish pepper is
                    raised on the Samara and Lower Volga; poppy in Char-kov, where it yields a
                    return of a hundred and sixty fold; rhubarb, which grows wild in Taurida;
                    rhapontick, which grows wild in the Urals; and <hi rend="italic">polygonum
                    minus,</hi> which in the Ukraine engenders worms that yield a beautiful crimson
                    dye used as paint by the Cossack women. Genuine turpentine might be collected to
                    a great extent. Many plants useful for dyeing are produced in a wild state; and
                    for tanning there are several valuable plants. In short, the Crimea presents
                    great facilities for rendering this a lucrative branch of manufacture. It only
                    remains to be stated with regard to the vegetation of Russia, that in the south
                    there is abundance of excellent food for cattle, consisting not only of a great
                    variety of grasses, but also of the best vegetables recommended for artificial
                    meadows.</p>
                <p>The quadrupeds of Russia are numerous. Some appear to be peculiar to the country,
                    but our business is chiefly with the domesticated animals. Cattle of every
                    description are bred in vast numbers in the steppes, and they have increased
                    with the improvement of agriculture. Black cattle and oxen are raised as far
                    north as the sixty-fourth parallel, especially in Podolia and the Ukraine. Some
                    of the calves of the latter territory weigh from 480 to 600 lbs. Sheep are
                    reared to a great extent, there being supposed to be between sixty and seventy
                    millions of these useful animals in different parts of the country. In Taurida a
                    poor Tartar may have in his possession 1000, and a rich Tartar 50,000. The
                    Merino breed of sheep has been naturalized in Little Russia, in the governments
                    comprised under the name of New Russia on the south and east, and in those of
                    the shores of the Baltic Sea. These different regions, so remote from one
                    another, are too dissimilar to enjoy precisely the same advantages;
                    nevertheless, the perseverance and judicious management of the cultivators have
                    been crowned with success. Even in those districts least favoured by nature
                    rapid improvement has been made. In 1826 the exports of wool from Odessa were
                    only 18,000 poods, valued at ten roubles each; in 1835 they were 116,000 poods,
                    the price being advanced to thirty roubles per pood. At Taganrog the exports
                    have increased in the same proportion; and in Little Russia this branch of
                    commerce is acquiring fresh activity. The wool trade is now also cultivated in
                    Siberia, where a wool-company was established in 1832. In fine, Russia, lately
                    so poor in this species of produce that even in 1824 her exports did not exceed
                    annually 35,000 poods, valued at only 600,000 roubles, in 1834 sold 281,450
                    poods, the value of which amounted to 1,557,066 roubles. This is of course
                    independently of the demands for the cloth manufactories in the interior, which
                    have increased to a very great extent. The report of the minister of the
                    interior for 1837 states the extensive advancement made in agricultural
                    industry, and the improvement of the breeds of cattle and sheep, especially the
                    great increase in the number of Merino sheep in New Russia, as well as in
                    Esthonia, Livonia, and Courland. Amongst the animals are horses of very
                    different races, to improve the breed of which, races have been instituted;
                    goats, from the silken hair of some of which animals the celebrated Cashmere
                    shawls are woven; camels in the warm and saline steppes of Taurida and Kherson;
                    asses, which are especially domesticated in Taurida; swine; rein-deer, so
                    valuable in the north; the buffalo, and others. Amongst useful insects there are
                    bees, which yield an abundance of honey and wax for exportation. There are many
                    wild animεils, the skins or furs of which constitute important items of trade in
                    the northern parts of Russia; and abundance of others, whose flesh is useful as
                    food. Birds are very numerous, including field and water game of various kinds.
                    Fish abound in the seas, lakes, and rivers; and the fisheries constitute an
                    important branch of productive industry, as will be afterwards shown.</p>
                <p>European Russia consists of a variety of countries, viz. that part improperly
                    termed Muscovy, which is Russia strictly so <hi rend="superscript">i</hi>
                    called, and forms the nucleus of the empire; the country of the Cossacks of the
                    Don and of the Black Sea; the kingdoms of Kazan and Astracan, wrested from the
                    Tartars; Biarmia; the greater part of Lapland; Ingria, Karelia, Finland,
                    Astrobothnia, Esthonia, Livonia, the archipelagos of Abo and Aland, and the
                    islands of Dago, Oesel, &amp;c., countries formerly appendages of the Swedish
                    crown; the largest portion of the once independent kingdom of Poland, comprising
                    the governments of Vitebsk, Moghilev, Minsk, Volhynia, Grodno, Vilna, Podolia,
                    the province of Bialystok, and the new kingdom of Poland; the former khanate of
                    the Crimea, with Little Tartary, Bessarabia, and part of Moldavia, territories
                    conquered from the Ottoman empire; and the region beyond the Caucasus, wrested
                    from the natives, Turks, and Persians. “The Russian government,” says Balbi,
                    “does not recognise the distinction made by geographers betwixt Russia in
                    Europe, Russia in Asia, and Russia in America. The first two are blended in
                    several governments. For instance, Perm and Orenburg, being traversed by the
                    Urals, have one part of their territory in Europe and another in Asia. However,
                    having determined the boundaries of Europe by the crest of the Urals and <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=582"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0582-0570"/>that of Caucasus, I have admitted into my table
                    the whole of the two governments of Perm and Orenburg, although great part of
                    their territory, lying east of the Urals, belongs in reality to Asia; and I have
                    rejected the general government of Caucasus, although its northern portion is
                    situated within the limits assigned by me to Europe. This was the only course I
                    could pursue in order not to divide what the</p>
                <p>Russian government has willed to be united, and to preserve the great natural
                    divisions which are the base of all geography.” The following table is taken
                    from M. Huot⅛ edition of Malte-Brmfs great work. Whilst its divisions correspond
                    with those of the able geographer just named, it contains important materials
                    which are not to be found in his work.</p>

                <p>It appears from the researches of De Jonnes in the <hi rend="italic">Revue
                    Encyclopédique</hi> for August 1833, that the mortality of Russia and Poland has
                    remained stationary for a great number of years. The ratio of deaths to the
                    population is one in forty-four, the annual mortality in each million of the
                    inhabitants being 22,700. This differs somewhat from the statements of Herrmann,
                    from whose elaborate researches concerning the progress of population in Russia
                    the following conclusions have been drawn, viz. 1. The proportion of births to
                    the number of inhabitants is one to twenty-five for the whole empire. 2. The
                    proportion of deaths to the total population is one in forty. <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The annual mortality has
                    diminished in some localities since Herrmann drew up his tables, which in some
                    measure accounts for the discrepancy here observable. </p></note> 3. The general
                    proportion of births to deaths in the whole empire is sixteen to ten. 4. The
                    proportion of male to female births is forty-four to forty. The following table
                    is of a more recent date than the researches of Herrmann. It is formed from the
                    reports published by the synod (which, however, includes only the members of the
                    orthodox Greek church), and shows the rate of the progressive increase of the
                    population, as far as relates to that most numerous body of the people.</p>

                <p>The increase of population in Russia appears to be equal to that of any European
                    country. It is indeed not a little remarkable, that in places where neither
                    nature nor fortune have been lavish of their bounties, the inhabitants live one
                    half longer than those who enjoy the sunny skies and lovely landscapes of Italy,
                    and exactly twice as long as those who people the capital of Austria; yet very
                    recent and elaborate investigations have proved this to be the fact. The
                    instances of longevity in Russia are astonishing. In 1821 the deaths were
                    reckoned at 945,088; and of these, 221 were above 105 years of age, 120 above
                    110 ditto, seventy-eight above 115 ditto, forty-nine above 120 ditto, sixteen
                    above 125 ditto, five above 130 ditto; one obtained to the great age of between
                    145 and 150 ditto; and another had tenaciously adhered to life till he had
                    reached the almost antediluvian term of existence, 155 years.</p>
                <p>The government of Russia is that of an absolute hereditary monarchy, where the
                    will of the sovereign is the supreme law of the empire. No restraint can be
                    imposed on it; but the emperors themselves have endeavoured in some degree to
                    qualify this unlimited power, which is likewise somwehat moderated by the rights
                    and privileges enjoyed through long-established usage by many bodies of people
                    in different provinces, and which claims it would be dangerous to the monarch to
                    infringe. The emperors of the house of Holstein have more than once declared
                    that they would wish to follow fixed laws in whatever appertains to the rights
                    of individuals and corporations. Arbitrary enactments are partly abolished;
                    indeed they are only enforced against the great, or courtiers less solicitous
                    about liberty than personal aggrandisement. The highest department of government
                    is the council of the empire, which was established in 1810, to render the laws
                    and the administration less liable to change. In 1811 it was completely
                    organized, and consisted of thirty-five members and four presidents. It is
                    divided into four departments, viz. law or legislation, the supreme court of
                    judicature in spiritual and civil affairs; war; civil and church affairs; and
                    internal political economy, or administration of the public revenue. The emperor
                    himself is president, and, in his absence, one of the members whom he formally
                    appoints president every year takes his place. Each department has its
                    president, and the whole together have a common secretary, who is principal
                    director of chancery, and the organ through which the council of the empire
                    makes known its decisions to the monarch. He is also the person who bears the
                    commands of the sovereign to the directing council of the empire, or makes them
                    known to individual departments; he expedites all the orders of the above
                    council to the respective authorities who are to execute them; and he receives
                    all petitions, and the like, directed to the emperor in person. Each department
                    has its state secretary. The ministers are members of the council of the empire,
                    but they are disqualified from being presidents of the departments. The
                    introduction of the members to the departments takes place half yearly. The
                    original outline, or sketch of every law, ordinance, or regulation, is laid
                    before the council of the empire, who examine it; but the sovereign power alone
                    can give it efficiency. There are three commissions in connection with the
                    council of the empire; these are, commissions of law, petitions, and the
                    chancery of the empire. Alexander gave new activity to the law commission, by
                    which about 70,000 ukases relative to civil rights were rescued from oblivion,
                    and arranged in proper order. The archives of the chancery of the empire contain
                    a collection of accurate accounts of state affairs of former years; complete
                    accounts of the present situation of the government, the protocols of the
                    council of the empire, and the imperial decisions. Each commission has a
                    director, and is divided into several sections, over which a head presides. Such
                    is the constitution of the Russian council of the empire.</p>
                <p>The directing senate is one over which the emperor also presides. It is the
                    supreme tribunal in all affairs of a home or internal description, as
                    distinguished from those of a foreign nature. As guardian of the law, the
                    sovereign watches over the administration of justice, superintends the
                    management of the income and expenditure of the state, as well as looks after
                    the means of national instruction, the preservation of public security, and the
                    abolition of every illegal proceeding. The minister of justice is at the same
                    time general procurator; but the remaining members are undefined, partly
                    consisting of the ministers, who have likewise seats in the council of the
                    empire. The directing senate is divided into eight departments, five of which
                    have their constant seat at St Petersburg, and three at Moscow. These two bodies
                    being composed of individuals either directly or indirectly <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=585" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0585-0573"
                    />appointed by the emperor, and, besides, not having power to act independently,
                    cannot be looked upon as much better than mere agents for promulgating his
                    decrees.</p>
                <p>The holy directing synod has for its object the management of ecclesiastical
                    affairs. It watches over the interests of the established church, but its
                    decrees are issued in the name of the emperor.</p>
                <p>The ministries of state, whose members officiate in their several departments
                    independently of each other, but sit in the council of the empire and the
                    senate, and to the latter annually render an account of their stewardship, are
                    distributed into three sections. The first section consists of the minister of
                    foreign affairs, whose ministry comprises a vice-chancellor, vice-president of
                    the imperial cabinet, director of the Asiatic department for the study of the
                    oriental languages, and a superintendent of the archives of the empire; the
                    minister of war, who takes cognizance of the departments of artillery,
                    engineering, inspection, auditory, commissariat, provision, and medicine; the
                    minister of marine; the minister of the interior, under whom are the departments
                    of the administration of the public revenue, police, and medicine, the minister
                    of spiritual matters, of public instruction; and, lastly, the minister of
                    finance, who has supreme direction over the revenues, and yearly lays before the
                    emperor a balance-sheet of the income and expenditure. He is also the highest
                    authority in matters relative to the departments of trade, manufactures, the
                    customs, mines, and the demesnes of the empire. The second section forms the
                    treasury of the empire, into which all the revenues flow, and from which all
                    payments are made according to the direct orders of the emperor. And to the
                    third section belong the business of state accounts, the general direction of
                    land and water communication, and the ministry of justice. There are likewise
                    ministers of control, the post-office, and of the imperial household. There is,
                    besides, a special minister of state, or secretary, for Poland, and a secretary
                    of state for Finland.</p>
                <p>To all the various ministers the necessary information is weekly sent from the
                    different governments; the whole intelligence being annually laid before the
                    monarch in a definite form. The governors and other authorities in the provinces
                    hold their command through the ministers. Each government has a head director or
                    civil governor, who usually has conjoined with him a military governor. Of
                    course, there is under these the usual train of functionaries, who assist in
                    administering justiec, and protecting the peace of the country and the rights of
                    the subject. How justice is administered it is difficult to say with certainty,
                    for corruption prevails to a great extent. Alexander did much to put an end to
                    it, and his successor has imitated his example with the most laudable zeal, but
                    equivocal success. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr
                    Bremner, whilst he does justice to Nicholas for his strenuous efforts to reform
                    the bribing system, says, “In spite of all his efforts, however, bribery in
                    public offices still prevails to a degree unheard of in other countries. Even in
                    Austria, where they understand such things very well, they are mere tyros in the
                    science, compared with the Russians. It grinds the poor and impoverishes the
                    rich; it is practised in every branch of the administration, from the lowest
                    clerk to the highest minister; it paralyses industry, enterprise, and merit, in
                    every corner of the empire.” </p></note> Conjointly with the judges are
                    apjxjinted assessors, who must be of the same rank as the person tried, which is
                    a plan somewhat similar to that of our jury. In the cities, two burgomasters and
                    four councillors, and in the country, one justice and two plebeian proprietors,
                    form tribunals of the first instance. From these, appeals may be made to higher
                    courts established in the several provinces; and from them again to the supreme
                    tribunals at St Petersburg and Moscow. A kind of court of conscience exists in
                    most places, which hears verbal complaints, acts as arbiter in differences about
                    smaller matters, and exercises power in behalf of minors and imbeciles. Great
                    deviations from the general system exist in some of the less civilized
                    provinces, that of the Cossacks, for instance, which has a sort of military
                    administration. Siberia is also under a different system, as we shall see when
                    we come to describe that country.</p>
                <p>The civil and criminal codes of Russia are very imperfect, notwithstanding the
                    efforts which several successive sovereigns have made to introduce order and
                    certainty. The institutions and pandects of the Russian law were published in
                    1819-1823, by order of the emperor, in twenty-two volumes. The Russian
                    government has also made public a collection of all the ukases, rules,
                    ordinances, &amp;c. in vigour in Russia, which amounted in 1830 to forty-five
                    volumes, systematically arranged, with copious indexes, and forming a single
                    body of laws, divided into several codes. This measure, according to the
                    imperial manifesto of the 31st of January 1833, guarantees the execution of the
                    law’s for the present, at the same time that it establishes a solid basis for
                    their progressive improvement. This body of laws became the standard code of the
                    empire in the beginning of the year 1835. Amongst the particular laws, the ukase
                    of 1822, abolishing the practice of branding after the administration of the
                    knout, deserves particular mention. With regard to the punishment of crime,
                    capital punishment was nominally abolished by the licentious Empress Elizabeth;
                    but in reality it was often inflicted. That horrible instrument the knout may be
                    so administered as to produce death, which often happened. However, it is no
                    longer allowed to extend so far as to take away life. Banishment to Siberia is
                    the other extreme punishment to which the Russian is liable for such crimes as
                    murder and robbery. The police of Russia is a political body, and all travellers
                    complain of its regulations, as being formal and minute beyond any thing known
                    in other European countries. A very recent traveller thus speaks of it. “The
                    Russian police, whose business it is to perform the various essential duties of
                    the civil government, are not, I think, more numerous than in other kingdoms on
                    the Continent, where the system of form and routine is kept up; while the
                    officials with whom you are brought in contact, as far as my experience goes,
                    although grossly venal, and taking bribes without the smallest attempt at
                    concealment, are always disposed to treat a stranger with the utmost courtesy.
                    But, in addition to these acknowledged servants of the state, there is a body of
                    secret police, who are everywhere, and most certainly spy out all the ways of
                    the stranger.” <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The revenues of the Russian government arise chiefly from a capitation tax of two
                    roubles on each peasant, and five on each burgher; a tax on merchants’ capital,
                    of about 11 per cent.; the leases of the crown-lands, and <hi rend="italic">

                    />in furs of the nomade races. But in estimating the receipts and expenditure of
                    government, allowance must be made for numerous and large sums never carried to
                    the account of either income or expenditure, because they are either
                    appropriated to local purposes, or are discharged in kind by various portions of
                    the population. This is the case with the rent of the fisheries on the Ural,
                    which either serves as pay for specific services, or is assigned in perpetuity
                    to certain classes of the community, so that it makes no appearance amongst the
                    public receipts. In some districts the capitation tax is commuted, either wholly
                    or in Tirt, for labour or military service. According to Schubert’s reckoning,
                    the income of the Russian empire for 1836 amounted to 354,268,000 paper roubles,
                    or about L.14,200,000 sterling. To the above may be added six millions of
                    roubles as the produce of the gold and platina mines, The national debt, which
                    in many other countries swallows up so much of the revenue, here absorbs but a
                    comparatively small part of it. On the 1st of January 1834, the debt of the
                    Russian government amounted to 933,871,673 roubles, a sum which two years and a
                    half of revenue would pay up. It has been materially reduced since the above
                    date, and, it is believed, will in a few years be altogether extinguished. Every
                    year a large sum is appropriated to this purpose. In the course of 1835, there
                    were consigned to the commission for the extinction of the national debt no less
                    than 66,529,080 roubles 96 kopecks. For a long period the currency of the
                    country was in a very equivocal state, from government having issued paper
                    roubles or assignats at a gradually increasing depreciation. The assignats, or
                    bank-notes, of Russia were established by an imperial ukase in 1768, and issued
                    in the following year. Of course they were at first equivalent in value to
                    silver roubles, or very nearly so, and were issued to the amount of 40,000, in
                    notes of the value of a hundred, seventy-five, fifty, and twenty-five roubles a
                    piece. In 1786 these assignats were exchanged for new ones, and their quantity
                    increased to the sum of 60,000,000 roubles. Their number went on augmenting till
                    the death of Catherine II., when the sum in circulation amounted to 157,000,000
                    roubles. A natural consequence of the increased issue was their proportional
                    fall; so that, at the above-mentioned epoch, the value of a hundred roubles in
                    assignats was equal to seventy in silver. During the reign of the Emperor Paul
                    I. the quantity of assignats was increased by 55,000,000 more; and during the
                    reign of Alexander the issues were carried to such an extent, that in 1817 their
                    whole quantity amounted to 836,000,000, and their value fell in proportion to
                    their over-issue. The Russian treasury then adopted measures for diminishing the
                    number of its assignats; and from that year till 1822, assignats to the amount
                    of 236,077,650 roubles were withdrawn from circulation and destroyed. In 1819
                    the old assignats were exchanged for new ones, issued in a much improved shape,
                    and in notes of two hundred, one hundred, fifty, twenty-five, ten, and five.
                    According to the report of the minister of finance on the 20th of August 1835,
                    the whole amount of assignats in circulation was 595,776,310 roubles, and their
                    relative value to the metallic money was as a hundred to twenty-seven. There is
                    little gold to be seen; and the only silver coin is the rouble, <note

                    calculations of any kind, nor have the Russians any higher denomination
                    corresponding to our pound sterling. Kopecks and roubles constitute the only
                    practical elements of the currency throughout the whole empire, with the

                    hundred of which equal a paper rouble. Indeed the only true metallic currency
                    may be said to be copper. A coinage of platina was made at the mint, but it is
                    more rarely seen than even gold.</p>
                <p>The amount of the Russian army in time of peace is nominally 612,332 men, of
                    which the imperial guard contains 41,200. The most correct enumeration of the
                    various corps of this enormous force appears to be that of Marshal Marmont. He
                    says that “the imperial guard are six divisions, three of infantry and three of
                    cavalry, making sixteen battalions in all. The grenadier corps has three
                    divisions of infantry, made up of twelve regiments, and a division of light
                    cavalry, made up of four regiments; also two batteries of horse artillery and
                    fifteen of foot. The regiments of guards consist of three battalions of infantry
                    and seven squadrons of cavalry. The six corps of the line are composed each of a
                    division of light cavalry (made up of four regiments), and three divisions of
                    infantry, each of four regiments; in all twelve regiments; besides two
                    battalions of foot and two of horse artillery. The total six corps of the line
                    are seventy-two regiments of infantry and twenty-four of cavalry, twelve
                    batteries of horse and ninety of foot artillery. The corps of cavalry reserve
                    has two divisions, each of four regiments, making a total of twenty-four
                    regiments, and twelve batteries of artillery. The reserve of the line are three
                    divisions, composed of twenty-four battalions. There is, in addition, the corps
                    of the Caucasus, Siberia, and Finland; the troops of the interior, fifty
                    battalions of horse militia, and one hundred and forty-six regiments of
                    Cossacks.” The expense of this vast force is very small; the articles for their
                    equipment, provisioning, and arming, being of the cheapest and coarsest kind,
                    and the pay of both officers and men being low. <note anchored="true"

                    the British and Foreign Review, October 1838, “is the most horrible thing that
                    can be imagined. The levy of recruits is ordered almost every year, and each
                    community is compelled to furnish one, two, three, or more recruits from every

                    easily imagined to how many abuses such a mode of levying is liable. We shall
                    not enter into the disgusting details by which the levy of recruits is
                    accompanied in Russia; we shall only add, that the condition of a Russian
                    soldier is considered so wretched and so hopeless, that there are many instances
                    of individuals, who have not only mutilated, but even destroyed themselves, in
                    order to escape military service.” </p></note> See the article Army.</p>
                <p>The naval force of Russia, for a long time inferior both in point of numbers and
                    character, is now placed upon a highly respectable footing. The present emperor,
                    when he ascended the throne, resolving to render Russia a first-rate naval as
                    well as military power, made great, exertions to realize his wishes. The Baltic
                    fleet, in 1838, consisted of the following vessels; one three-decker of a
                    hundred and twenty guns, three three-deckers of a hundred and ten guns, seven
                    ships of eighty-four guns, and nineteen ships of seventy-four guns; thus making
                    in all thirty heavy line-of-battle ships. To these must be added one razee of
                    fifty-six guns, three frigates of fifty-two guns, and eighteen frigates of
                    forty-four guns, besides corvettes and small craft. The whole is manned by a
                    force of 33,000 men. The fleet in the Black Sea consists of sixteen heavy ships
                    of the line, besides a number of frigates, smaller vessels, gun-boats, &amp;c.
                    On the Caspian Sea there are also several ships of very considerable size, and
                    more are in rapid progress at the building-yards recently established at
                    favourable points. Russia possesses at least sixty steam-boats of one kind or
                    another. This is a formidable armament, and it is admitted by unprejudiced
                    individuals, that the navy of Russia was never in such high condition as it is
                    at the present time. But it is quite preposterous to look upon it in the light
                    of a rival to that of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=587" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0587-0575"
                    />Great Britain. The expense of the navy, like that of the army, is
                    comparatively small. “Indeed,” says Mr Bremner,</p>
                <p>“it is one of the points which should never be forgotten in considering this
                    question” [viz. the maintenance of such a large fleet], “that Russia can not
                    only build ships cheaper than any other European power, but can also man them
                    for less. The pay both of officers and men is so small, that the annual outlay
                    on twenty Russian line-of-battle ships would not defray the expense of ten of
                    ours.” The Russian sailor is brave, well-trained, somewhat after a military
                    fashion, and submissive; but he wants the activity and enthusiasm of the English
                    seaman. To remedy a great defect under which the Russian navy has long laboured,
                    a want of good native officers, colleges of naval cadets have been formed, where
                    young Russians are carefully trained for the higher branches of the service.</p>
                <p>- Ten or fifteen years ago the agricultural operations of the</p>
                <p>Russians were conducted in a very clumsy manner. Rotation of crops was little
                    understood or practised, and husbandry in general was carried on in a very
                    ignorant and unprofitable manner. In the Ukraine, so famous for its fertility,
                    the mode of farming is very simple. They take as many crops out of the ground as
                    it will yield, and then let it lie fallow for a year or two. But this branch of
                    productive industry has made considerable progress within these few years;
                    partly through the exertions of government, and partly through those of the
                    landed proprietors, who find it for their advantage to approximate to those
                    improved methods of cultivating the soil which are practised in most other parts
                    of Europe. Amongst other means employed by government for encouraging
                    agriculture, it has ordered what are called model-gardens to be formed in a
                    number of governments. Native manufactures have likewise been greatly extended
                    and improved.</p>

                    are taken from a work of M. Prelezynski, on the State of the Manufacturing

                    Russia, which formerly imported nothing but manufactured goods, now imports
                    immense quantities of raw material for the use of her manufactures, as will be
                    seen from our table of the imports; and the amount is yearly on the increase. In
                    1815 the total number of manufacturing establishments throughout the empire was
                    estimated at 3250, at which 150,000 workmen were employed. In 1836 the number of
                    manufacturing establishments in activity was 6045, which gave employment to
                    279,673 workmen. The financial agents of Russia residing at Paris, Vienna, and
                    Berlin, as well as the consuls at the chief commercial towns of Europe, have
                    instructions to contribute to the progress and improvement of national industry,
                    by communicating to Russian manufacturers every information respecting new
                    inventions made in foreign countries, forwarding to them patterns of new
                    manufactures, models of machines, and the like, and by engaging expert workmen
                    for them. Government holds out the greatest encouragement to persons engaging in
                    new commercial enterprises. By a ukase dated 1827, such parties are relieved
                    from certain taxes imposed upon them as members of one of the three city guilds,
                    and in 1835 the land-tax and municipal imposts were also remitted in their
                    favour. A further evidence of the advance which Russia has made in commercial
                    enterprise is furnished by the fact, that the number of persons engaged in such
                    pursuits is rapidly increasing, and that every year many acquire the means of
                    passing from the inferior to the upper guilds. The following statement will make
                    this clear.</p>

                <p>In 1836 thirty-five applications were made for patents for new inventions
                    connected with manufactures, of which eleven were granted.</p>
                <p>The distillation of brandy is the most extensive and lucrative branch of the
                    productive industry of Russia. This article is produced to the amount of
                    270,000,000 roubles annually, for which government receives an excise duty of
                    90,000,000 roubles. The brandy monopoly of government is productive of great
                    mischief, as by the universal system of bribery the cost to the consumer is
                    greatly increased. The farmer-general bribes the governor of the province, whose
                    duty it is to see that the article is not adulterated; the farmer-general, and
                    his secretary who grants licenses, are bribed by the retailer, so that by the
                    time the spirit has reached the tables of the peasantry, amongst whom the use of
                    it is universal, one gallon has multiplied itself to three or even four. A kind
                    of beer called <hi rend="italic">braga</hi> is likewise made to a great extent,
                    and largely consumed.</p>
                <p>The mines, particularly those on the Ural Mountains, were worked at a very
                    ancient period; but it is only in modern times that the Russians have applied
                    themselves to that branch of industry. Gold, platina, silver, and copper, are
                    most abundant in the Asiatic governments, or along the last declivities of what
                    is called the great central ridge. The quantities of gold and platina produced
                    will be seen from a table at the end of the exports and imports.</p>
                <p>The silver mines yield annually about 43,200 lbs., besides 1,440,000 lbs. of
                    lead. The aggregate produce of copper from the government and private mines is
                    7,596,000 lbs. English. By a document published in the Russian Mining Journal
                    for 1830, we find that there were in the Ural districts alone fifty-eight
                    smelting works (seven belonging to the crown and fifty-one to individuals),
                    which in 1827 produced 9,731,147 poods of cast iron. The forges, which <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=588"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0588-0576"/>amounted to 105 (only eight of them being crown
                    property), sent into the markets in the same year 5,578,474 poods of wrought
                    iron. We learn, from the same source, that the steel manufactured in all the
                    empire in 1829 amounted only to 80,000 poods.</p>
                <p>Another branch of industry to which the attention of tile Russian government has
                    been for some time directed, has originated in the discovery of precious stones
                    in the Ural Mountains. Stones of great value have from time to time been
                    detected in that range, and scientific individuals have been employed to make
                    researches for the purpose of obtaining extensive and accurate knowledge of
                    these hidden treasures. Diamonds have likewise been found in the auriferous
                    sands of the Ural. But to what amount annually any of these precious stones may
                    be collected is still uncertain.</p>
                <p>The mines of Finland, particularly those of iron, are also an important branch of
                    productive industry. Some of the hills of that country contain veins of an ore
                    fit for the manufacture of wrought iron, while layers of a fusible ore are found
                    buried at a small depth, in marshes and along the borders of lakes. For a long
                    time the mines of the first description were neglected; but there are thirteen
                    now at work. The richest ore, produced from the mines of the Gamnholm and Oiama,
                    contains from fifty-three to fifty-four per cent, of metal; the poorest yields
                    about thirty per cent, of cast iron. The smelting of these ores is performed in
                    eight different furnaces, which consume more ore than Finland can at present
                    furnish; and the deficit is supplied by Sweden. Almost the whole of the cast
                    iron produced by them is distributed among the forges established in different
                    parts of the country. There are sixteen of these forges, which manufacture
                    annually about 121,350 poods of wrought iron. Those immense beds of iron ore
                    which extend throughout the country, along the shores of lakes, and at the
                    bottom of marshes, have been wrought from time immemorial. The number of forges
                    and smelting-houses for working up this product is considerable; and as
                    experience has proved that the marsh ore is preferable to any other, several
                    other establishments of forges have recently been erected, and more are in the
                    course of being added to the number. Next to iron, copper is the most important
                    mineral which Finland produces. Until very lately, however, only one mine was
                    wrought, that of Ovi-Yervi, discovered in 1758. But a patent was a short time
                    ago obtained for the working of copper and tin mines found near Nitkaranda. Iron
                    of the best quality is likewise found in the district of Toula, the seat of the
                    iron manufactures. Russia possesses another treasure in the numerous salt-lakes
                    and marshes in the Siberian steppes, and in the country to the north of the
                    Caspian Sea. The quantity of this article obtained throughout the empire amounts
                    to 22,000,000 poods annually. Alum is also produced to the yearly extent of
                    16,000 poods.</p>
                <p>“A prodigious quantity of fish,” says M. Schnitzler, “is supplied by the rivers
                    and lakes, constituting almost the sole food of the population of extensive
                    districts, and during the long Lents replacing the use of meat. The fisheries of
                    the Volga and the Oka are particularly productive. Without speaking of the carp,
                    the pike, the trout, the herring, especially that species of herring termed rei-
                    <hi rend="italic">Pouchhf</hi> and of the pilchard, I shall cite the sturgeon,
                    beluga, and salmon fisheries, and the pickled lampreys and mackerel of the
                    Crimea. The sterlet of the Volga is a variety of the sturgeon. Caviare, the
                    consumption of which is so great in Russia, is made from the eggs of this fish,
                    and from those of the beluga. A single sterlet will give from ten to thirty
                    pounds weight; and from a single beluga there may at times, it is said, be taken
                    as much as 120 pounds. The best caviare comes from the Cossacks of the Ural. The
                    sturgeon fishery is usually of considerable value; 1,850,500 fish of this
                    species, caught in the year 1793 in the Volga, near Astracan, yielded 124,970
                    poods of caviare, 3575 poods of isinglass. The coasts, which are visited by the
                    cachalot, the whale, and other cetaceous fish, and on which are collected a
                    quantity of pearl-oysters and mussels, likewise furnish cod and herrings. The
                    largest fishery of the latter is in the Sea of Kamtschatka. The net annual value
                    of the Russian fisheries amounts to more than 10,000,000 roubles.” The chase in
                    the Russo-North American colonies, and elsewhere, has long been a profitable
                    branch of national enterprise. Greatquantities of furs and skins, of the otter,
                    beaver, and fox, are annually brought to market by the traders.</p>
                <p>The internal traffic carried on in Russia is very considerable, and yearly upon
                    the increase. The exchange of agricultural produce, as well as of manufactures,
                    is immense. Nineteen fairs have been established for the benefit of trade in
                    several principal towns of the empire, and thirteen in lesser ones. A great
                    number of bazaars have likewise been erected for the accommodation of traders.
                    The great centre of the inland commerce of Russia is Niz-nei-Novgorod, the
                    annual fair at which place is entitled, both from the amount and variety of its
                    articles, to be considered as the first in Europe, perhaps in the world. The
                    trade consists chiefly of three branches; namely, that of goods brought from
                    Asia, Russian manufactures, and merchandise from Europe and America. The Asiatic
                    trade consists principally of tea from China, of which article immense
                    quantities are annually brought to this great emporium. Russian manufactures
                    form the most important branch of the trade of Niznei-Novgorod, and consist
                    chiefly of cotton, silk, and woollen goods brought from the central provinces of
                    the empire. The merchants of Kiakhta carry back large quantities of cotton and
                    skins; those of Bukharia and of Khiva purchase nankeens, calicoes, cambrics,
                    cloth, and sugar; the Armenians and the Persians buy cotton and woollen stufis.
                    Russian and Polish cloths are sent to this market in considerable quantities,
                    part of which are sold to the Transcaucasian provinces, and some are even
                    exported to China.</p>
                <p>The produce of the Russian mines and Ifounderies forms also a considerable item
                    of trade, consisting; of iron, copper, and steel articles from Toula, and which
                    are bought for the use of the inhabitants of the interior. Sugsn is sent from St
                    Petersburg and Archangel. Much country produce is sold for the purpose of
                    exportation; such as wax, wool, cotton, camel-hair, hemp, feathers, and Russian
                    leather. The superb furs of Siberia and the coast of the White Sea form also
                    most important objects of commerce. There is likewise a smaller trade in
                    earthenware, glass, and soap. The third branch of the commerce of
                    Niznei-Novgorod is the produce of Western Europe and its colonies; but the
                    amount of goods imported from these countries is scarcely one tenth of' the
                    merchandise sold at the fair. It consists of indigo, cochineal, and madder, used
                    for the purpose of dyeing manufactures. Foreign wines form also an important
                    article of trade. Coffee and rum are imported from the West Indies; coral is
                    also imported and sold, chiefly to Kiakhta merchants for the Chinese markets.
                    Foreign manufactures, consisting of silks, cotton, and woollen stuffs, are
                    likewise sold in very considerable quantities. The value of the goods which
                    change hands at this fair, according to Klaproth, amounts to ninety-four
                    millions of roubles annually. Dr Lyall and Captain Cochrane raise it to double
                    this sum; but the statement of Lord Londonderry is more to be relied upon. He
                    says that the value of goods actually sold amounted in 1831 to 98,329,525, in
                    1833 to 117,210,676, and in 1835 to 117,743,300 roubles. A great deal more
                    merchandise than is sold is always brought to market. It is supposed that this
                    fair is visited by about ISO, OOOstrangers. The confluence of traders from such
                    remote countries as those mentioned is one of the most striking and picturesque
                    spectacles that can be witnessed. The fair lasts during the months of Augustand
                    September. By the official account of the minister of the interior, the value of
                    merchandise sold <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=589" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0589-0577"
                    />at the different fairs in 1836 was 284,949,191 roubles, and in 1837 it was
                    277,108,436 roubles, or L.l 0,500,000.</p>
                <p>The internal commerce of Russia is greatly facilitated by the vast system of
                    inland navigation, which forms so striking a feature of that country. All the
                    great rivers, lakes, and seas have been connected with one another by means of
                    canals, so that a water-communication exists between the most remote parts of
                    the empire. The Black Sea and the Baltic communicate by means of three canals;
                    the Baltic and the Caspian Seas are united by means of the Volga and artificial
                    cuts; and the same great river is connected with the White Sea and other lakes.
                    Important undertakings are in progress to perfect the junction of such rivers as
                    the Markta and the Volga, the Oka and the Don, the Priepetz, the Niemen, the
                    Bug, and others. In 1817 the Emperor Alexander created an office of
                    “director-general of the ways of communication,” including canals, roads, and
                    bridges. From that period the works of this description have been vigorously
                    prosecuted. The roads of Russia are in general bad, but a number of new high
                    roads are in progress. That from St Petersburg to Moscow, which has long been in
                    existence, is a remarkable work. It is an elevated causeway of timber, running
                    in one long, level, unvarying, straight line, over marsh and bog, through forest
                    and thicket. Many other important public works have been undertaken, of which
                    number is the construction of quays along the Oka, and from the Volga to
                    Niznei-Novgorod, and the works upon the river Seyn. Steam-boats have been
                    established upon some of the principal rivers, for towing barges as well as for
                    conveying passengers and goods. (See Navigation, Inland.)</p>
                <p>The colonies of Russia, that is, those southern parts of the empire in particular
                    which have been settled by foreigners, constitute a distinct feature of the
                    country. At' the period when Catherine II. ascended the throne, that vast tract
                    of country which now forms the government of Saratof was almost without
                    cultivation; and in order to bring it under proper culture, the empress issued a
                    decree, inviting colonists from European countries, where agriculture was in the
                    most advanced state. Great numbers of German and Swiss, French and Swedish
                    families, accordingly, flocked to the banks of the Volga, and to these
                    foreigners Russia is indebted for what advancement she has made in the
                    manufacture of wine and the cultivation of the silk-worm. The German colonists
                    who have settled in New Russia, Bessarabia, and the governments of Saratof,
                    Georgia, &amp;c., but principally in Southern Russia, are located in four
                    hundred and twenty villages. Their population in 1837 amounted to 270,085; the
                    number of sheep was 1,364,840; seed sown, 289,290 chetwerts; produce, 1,736,316
                    chetwerts; fruit trees, 1,666,599 chetwerts; vine roots, 18,447,902 chetwerts;
                    lands assigned to them, 5,836,771 English acres. After the peace of Adrianople,
                    about 60,000 Bulgarians and Rumelians came to settle in Russia. Since the days
                    of Peter the Great, the Russian government has held out great encouragement to
                    foreigners of all professions to settle in the empire, and to such persons
                    Russia is in no small degree indebted for her present greatness and prosperity.
                    There is scarcely an institution, an art, a manufacture, or a department of war
                    or peace, that has attained to excellence in the country, which is not indebted
                    to some foreigner for its efficiency.</p>
                <p>The foreign commerce of Russia is very considerable, as the following tables will

                    />The foregoing tables have been obtained from parliamentary papers. In the last
                    one, no mention is made of the silver and copper mines of the Urals, which,
                    however, are less important than those of gold and platina. The quantities which
                    they produce have already been stated. In 1832, the latest year for which we
                    have complete returns, the number of vessels which arrived in the different
                    ports of Russia was as follows :—</p>
                <p>Ports on the Baltic Sea...................3601</p>
                <p>Ditto on the White Sea................... 472</p>

                <p>Ditto on the Caspian Sea................. 201</p>
                <p>Total.........5720</p>
                <p>It may be mentioned, that there is little difference between the commercial
                    returns of 1834 and those of 1835. Still, taking a series of years, Russia will
                    be found to be steadily and widely extending her commercial relations. The
                    receipts of the custom-house in 1835 amounted to 46,763,444 roubles, and in 1836
                    to 48,968,790 roubles, or L.2,142,384, which is an increase of 2,205,346 roubles
                    in one year. By far the most important of the commercial relations of Russia are
                    those which she has with Great Britain. The interests of the two greatest
                    empires in the world are thus pretty closely united; and there appears to us to
                    be little cause for dreading aggressive hostility on the part of a power which
                    draws half its custom-house revenue from British imports, and sends to Britain
                    one half of all the raw produce which it can raise for exportation. After all,
                    the commerce of Russia is not one third of that of France, and not one seventh
                    of that of Great Britain.</p>
                <p>The nobles in Russia, though distinguished by the several titles of prince,
                    count, or baron, are all upon an equal footing, and enjoy equal privileges.
                    Their persons and lands are freed from taxation; they are exempted from the
                    recruiting ballot; and they are not subject to bodily penalties. These
                    exemptions are, however, more apparent than real; for though their lands and
                    persons are not taxable, yet a capitation tax, at the will of the government,
                    may be imposed on their slaves, who form the most valuable part of their
                    possessions. Though not in person compelled to serve in the army, yet they are
                    bound to furnish from their slaves a number of recruits, in proportion to the
                    demands of the service. In some of the more recently-acquired provinces, such as
                    Livonia, Esthonia, and in Poland, the nobles have, or rather exercise, other
                    privileges, extending even to the power of life and death, over their vassals;
                    but these powers arise from custom and general acquiescence much more than from
                    the existing law. The classes of the nobility are very numerous, being fourteen
                    in all; but, singularly enough, some of them have no members. Thus, of the
                    eleventh and thirteenth none are alive. Although titles are hereditary, there is
                    no rank except what the emperor confers. Most of the public employments are
                    filled by the nobles; but no one whatever is eligible to such appointments
                    unless he belongs to one of the fourteen classes of rank into which the civil
                    and military services, and the clergy, are correspondingly arranged. A fixed
                    term of service, and a prescribed form of examination, are undergone previously
                    to acquiring rank. The right of conferring nobility rests with the emperor, and,
                    as with us, it is hereditary.</p>
                <p>The clergy are exempt from taxation, and from corporal punishment; which
                    privileges are extended to each eldest son, who must, however, though his father
                    is excused, take the risk of being called upon for military service.</p>
                <p>The citizens form the second grand division of the Russian nation. Every
                    inhabitant of a town, who is neither noble, nor the property of another, is a
                    citizen. The notables constitute the highest class amongst them, and possess
                    privileges similar to those of the nobles. Next to these come the merchants of
                    the three guilds. The first or highest guild corresponds with the eighth class
                    of rank, and en- ' joys most of the immunities of the notables. In fact, whoever
                    has belonged ten years to the first guild, or twenty to the second, without
                    incurring any visitation of the law, becomes a notable. For an account of the
                    merchants of these guilds, see the article Petersburg.</p>
                <p>The next class is that of the peasants, or free inhabitants of the country. In
                    this rank are included, first, the ancient race of proprietors, who cultivate
                    their own lands, but do not enjoy the right of possessing slaves; second, the
                    Tartars, the Baschkirs, and several other races, less numerous, to the south of
                    Siberia, who are all proprietors of the lands they cultivate; and, third, the
                    peasants of Finland. Since the acquisition of New Finland, the privileges
                    enjoyed by the peasants of that country under the Swedish government have been
                    continued and confirmed to them, and the same rights granted to those of Old
                    Finland, where all are now either proprietors or renters. There is a
                    considerable number of rent peasants, who, by paying an annual sum to their
                    proprietors, purchase the right of carrying on trade or business on their own
                    account. Some of these have been known to amass considerable property; but they
                    still remain slaves. In the fourth are included the colonists, consisting of
                    foreign families of agriculturists, who are proprietors of the lands they
                    cultivate, and whose number is about 65,000. The fifth embraces the military
                    colonists. These are soldiers, who, after having served a prescribed period,
                    have had land given to them, and a capital sufficient to cultivate it, in the
                    southern provinces. And, lastly, the free cultivators, who enjoy immunity from
                    taxes, on condition of keeping post-horses for the public service, which they
                    furnish at a charge regulated by government.</p>
                <p>The class next below these is that of the serfs. They are chiefly peasants on the
                    crown-lands, or of the province of Livonia. The first of these, the
                    crown-peasants, amount to about 12,000,000, some of whom labour in the fields,
                    and the others in the mines and manufactories. The lot of this class seems to be
                    placed on the confines between liberty and slavery. They may rise to the rank of
                    citizens, they may acquire property, they may enjoy the protection of the laws,
                    and, under some restrictions, may quit their residences to obtain employment for
                    a limited time; but they are liable to be hired to the service of the mines, or
                    to be sold. The peasants of Livonia, amounting to about 560,000, were slaves
                    until the year 1804, when they first obtained the rights of serfs. They are now
                    subject to some peculiar claims; but those claims are fixed, and they cannot be
                    removed from the soil without their own consent.</p>
                <p>The last and most numerous class is that of the slaves. These amounted in 1782 to
                    6,678,000 males, and at present are estimated to include 23,000,000 persons.
                    They are in law considered as <hi rend="italic">things,</hi> not as persons;
                    they are attached to the soil, and incapable of possessing any property in land;
                    they may be bought, sold, or exchanged, with little more restrictions than are
                    enacted in dealing for cattle; and they have no other protection against their
                    masters than what is created by a regard to their pecuniary interest. They
                    belong to the nobles, or to such civil or military officers as have acquired the
                    right of possessing them. They are divided into agricultural, mining,
                    manufacturing, or domestic slaves, and have their condition only improved when
                    drawn for military service.</p>
                <p>“A Russian proprietor,” says a recent traveller, “reckons the value of his
                    property, not by the annual income of his estate, but by the number of souls,
                    that is, of male peasants upon it. An estate is said to be worth so many souls
                    instead of so many roubles per annum. The footing on which the agricultural serf
                    practically stands towards his master, is in most respects that of a small
                    tenant; the principal difference being, that he cannot change his employment or
                    <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=592"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0592-0580"/>move from home without his master’s leave, which
                    is some-</p>
                <p>times obtained for a certain annual sum, called <hi rend="italic">obroh,</hi> in
                    lieu of service. As a general rule, he has a house and a portion of land, for
                    which he pays rent in labour instead of money. He works three days in the week
                    for his master, and has the remainder of his time at his own disposal. A day’s
                    labour of a man includes that of his wife and his horse when requisite. These
                    peasants, who are for the most part in a state of the grossest ignorance, are
                    perfect predestinarians, or fatalists; and this doctrine serves as an excuse on
                    all occasions for their habitual improvidence and want of forethought. Yet,
                    though ignorant, superstitious, and a slave, the serf seems in general happy and
                    contented, and bears about him no signs of oppression; his desires are few and
                    easily satisfied; though his fare is coarse and poor, he seldom suffers from
                    cold or hunger, and he is naturally gay, good-humoured, and light-hearted.” The
                    situation of domestic servants is much worse than that of the peasant, whose
                    great dread is the conscription, and a serious evil it is when it visits him.
                    The peasant cannot legally be sold or transferred from one master to another,
                    excepting with the whole of his family; but this law is often broken or evaded.
                    “There are few landed proprietors who do not carry on a manufactory of some kind
                    or other. The riches of the Russian gentleman lie in the labour of his serfs,
                    which it is his study to turn to good account; and he is the more urged to this,
                    since the law which compels the peasant to work for him, requires him to
                    maintain the peasant; if the latter is found begging, the former is liable to a
                    fine. He is therefore a master who must always keep a certain number of workmen,
                    whether they are useful to him or not; and as every kind of agricultural and
                    out-doors employment is at a stand during the winter, he naturally turns to the
                    establishment of a manufactory as a means of employing his peasants, and as a
                    source of profit to himself. In some cases the manufactory is at work only
                    during the winter, and the people are employed in the summer in agriculture. The
                    alternate employment of the same man in the field and in the factory, which
                    would be attempted in most countries with little success, is here rendered
                    practicable and easy by the versatile genius of the Russian peasant, one of
                    whose leading national characteristics is a general capability of turning his
                    hand to any kind of work which he may be required to undertake.” Not only are
                    the Russian nobles manufacturers, but they carry on the business in every
                    branch; and from the privileges which they enjoy, they have great advantages
                    over the other classes who are not allowed to possess serfs. In almost every
                    house some art is carried on, useful or ornamental; and women are employed in
                    spinning, weaving, knitting, carpet-making, and the like. Mr Bremner informs us
                    that seven shillings and sixpence a week is the general pay of a labourer in the
                    field, and that the best hands in the manufactories can only earn nine shillings
                    and sixpence a week. Hence no people in Europe are so plainly or coarsely fed as
                    the Russians. Their daily fare consists of pickled cucumbers, cabbages, and
                    mushrooms, with a piece of black bread. Fish and butcher-meat are great rarities
                    amongst the poor; they live upon the wretched articles which we have
                    specified.</p>
                <p>The established religion of Russia is that of the Greek Church, to which the
                    great bulk of the population belongs, although all others are tolerated, no
                    civil or political disabilities attaching to those who profess other creeds. In
                    regard to the doctrines of this church, it may be briefly stated, that they
                    differ in several essential particulars from those of the Roman Catholics,
                    although there is a general accordance. The first of these particulars is, that
                    it holds the necessity of complete submersion of the whole body at baptism; the
                    second, that whilst it admits the doctrine of tran-substantiation in regard to
                    the eucharist, it affirms that the bread must be leavened and the wine mixed
                    with water, and they allow both elements to be distributed to every communicant,
                    even to children before they have any correct idea of sin; and a third important
                    distinction relates to the marriage of the clergy, all secular or parish priests
                    being bound to marry. The Greek Church further differs from the Roman Catholic
                    by rejecting purgatory, predestination, works of supererogation, indulgences,
                    and dispensations. Catechising and preaching are scarcely practised; and mass
                    forms the chief part of the public worship. No instrumental music is allowed,
                    but vocal music is much cultivated. Fast days are numerous, and they are kept
                    with great strictness. In addition to the Wednesday and Friday of every week,
                    there are four principal fasts in the year, and several festivals which are
                    celebrated with eastern pomp and splendour. This church rejects all round or
                    solid images of the Saviour, or of saints, as idolatrous; but pictures, mosaics,
                    bas-reliefs, in short, whatever is represented on a flat surface, they do not
                    consider as violations of the law which says, “Thou shalt not make unto thee any
                    graven image.” The state of religion amongst the lower orders is in general
                    deplorable. The most important parts of public worship are, first, to pronounce
                    distinctly and fluently the two words <hi rend="italic">Gospodi pomilui,</hi>
                    which mean, “God be merciful ;” secondly, to make the sign of the cross on the
                    breast a countless number of times; and, thirdly, to bow the head to the ground
                    repeatedly. The common people have a firm belief in good and bad angels. Evil
                    spirits are the tempters and betrayers of men, and they believe that the sign of
                    the cross, which they are very fond of making, will not only drive them away,
                    but avert every kind of misfortune. There are comparatively few sectarians in
                    Russia. The following is as near an approximation as can be arrived at, of the
                    religious diversities of the Russian empire.</p>

                <p>The whole spirituality of the Greek Church is divided into priests belonging to
                    some religious order, and secular priests. For the management of church affairs
                    there are at present thirty-six eparchies of three different classes, only four
                    being of the highest class, those of St Petersburg, Moscow, Novgorod, and Kief.
                    There are nine metropolitans, thirteen archbishops, and twenty-nine bishops. All
                    aspiring to these dignities must be members of some monastery, and unmarried. By
                    a statement published a short time since, the number of monasteries throughout
                    the empire would appear to be 350, with 5330 monks. There are ninety-eight
                    nunneries, containing 4162 nuns; all of them belong to the strict order of St
                    Basil. There are 483 cathedrals, and 28,200 parish churches (of which 853 are
                    situated in Bessarabia), with 218,418 ecclesiastics of the orthodox Greek
                    ritual, and 7311 ecclesiastics of the united Greek ritual. The Russian clergy
                    may be divided into three classes; those who are in full orders, including
                    “pro-topapi,” or inferior priests, and “papi,” or common priests; those who are
                    only in what may be called half orders, such as deacons and readers, who are not
                    allowed to administer the sacrament; and those who have received no ordination
                    <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=593"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0593-0581"/>at all, such as choristers and sacristans, who,
                    strictly speaking, do not belong to the clerical order, but merely discharge the
                    duties of attendants.</p>
                <p>It has been justly remarked, that the members of the religious fraternities are
                    here of more importance, compared with the other clergy, than in the west of
                    Europe, since from them alone are the highest functionaries of the church
                    selected. They are divided into ecclesiastical functionaries of the highest
                    class, such as metropolitans, archbishops, and bishops; heads of religious
                    bodies, such as archimandrites (abbots), and igumen (priors); and monks. Whoever
                    aims at the honour of being a bishop, &amp;c. must of necessity become a monk.
                    On account of their higher learning and more correct life, the monks are held in
                    much greater estimation than the secular clergy. They live a life of abstinence
                    and strict self-denial. Many of them are men of profound learning and undoubted
                    piety; but it is to be feared that the greater bulk of the lower orders of
                    ecclesiastics are among the most degraded that ever assumed the priestly habit
                    in Europe. Many of them are as ignorant as the boors with whom they associate,
                    drinking, playing, and going to market with them like unsophisticated serfs. The
                    general state of morals in the Greek Church, compared with those of Protestants
                    in Russia, may be inferred from the tables of births in St Petersburg, published
                    by the holy synod. From these it appears, that out of 8663 births, the number
                    which took place in the year 1834, in families of the Greek Church not fewer
                    than 1589 were illegitimate; whilst in the Protestant congregations, of 1031
                    infants who were baptized, only seventy-six were illegitimate. <note

                <p>The Catholic Church comprehends eighteen different orders, who possess 113
                    cloisters, in which there are 2200 monks. They support sixteen circuit and
                    thirty-one parochial schools, at which 3012 scholars receive instruction. There
                    are 666 nuns, belonging to ten different orders, and inhabiting fifty-two
                    nunneries. They support thirty-three female schools, fifteen hospitals for the
                    sick, and twelve poor-houses for the aged and infirm. These educational and
                    benevolent institutions are attached to the cloisters. The Catholic secular
                    priesthood, comprising about two thousand individuals, superintend a number of
                    such establishments. There are in all thirteen seminaries of a higher order, 201
                    parochial schools, with 7688 pupils, and 566 poor-houses, with 4449 inmates.
                    This enumeration is exclusive of Poland, in which, in 1830, there were 1917
                    clergymen, 309 chapels of ease, 2369 secular priests, 156 monasteries with 1783
                    monks, and twenty-nine nunneries with 354 nuns. At the head of the clergy were
                    one archbishop, eight bishops, with a chapter of 276 dignitaries, canons, and
                    the like. The collective number of Catholic ecclesiastics in Russia and Poland
                    is estimated at 10,772.</p>
                <p>The Protestants, consisting of Lutherans and some other sects, are divided into
                    two synods and eight consistories, to which belong 865 places of devotion. Each
                    of the consistories has a bishop as its president. The Razkolniks or Apostates,
                    that is, dissenters from the Greek Church, do not compose a distinct
                    ecclesiastical body, but exist in separate congregations, independently of one
                    another, and each having some distinctive shade of difference from all the rest.
                    They have a consecrated clergy, but of course no common synod or consistory.
                    Another sect, called the Duchoborzy, differing still more widely from the Greek
                    Church than the former, have taken refuge in the steppes beyond the Don, where
                    they still profess their creed, but without the aid of either churches or a
                    priesthood.</p>
                <p>The Mahommedans have 4785 mosques in Russia, of which 2466 are head mosques. They
                    have colleges, mullahs, and muftis, who regulate the religious affairs of the
                    sect.</p>
                <p>The worshippers of the Grand Lama have their principal religious establishment at
                    Darsan, in the province of Udinsk. They have a numerous priesthood, who are said
                    to be very successful in making converts amongst the wandering tribes.</p>
                <p>The principal institution for the dissemination of the Holy Scriptures amongst
                    the various tribes of the empire, in their native languages, is established at
                    St Petersburg, and is in connection with the British and Foreign Bible Society
                    of London. It consists of fifty-eight sections and 289 auxiliary societies,
                    situated in Moscow, Jaroslav, Dor-pat, Mittau, Revel, Riga, Orenburg, Tobolsk,
                    Irkutsk, and other places. From the period of its institution in 1813 until June
                    1823, it had issued 184,851 complete Bibles, 315,928 New Testaments, and 204,052
                    Old Testaments, in forty-one different languages and dialects. Its further
                    usefulness was greatly promoted by an arrangement made in 1826, by which the
                    sale of Bibles was for the future permitted. There is always a large supply of
                    Bibles at Moscow, where those condemned to exile in Siberia may have a copy, if
                    they desire one, as they pass through this city on their way to their place of
                    banishment. It is well known that all the exiles, in whatever part of the
                    country they may have received sentence, must take Moscow in their route to
                    Siberia.</p>
                <p>As early as the eleventh century, public schools were founded at several places
                    in Russia; but Peter the Great, to whom Russia is indebted for her civilization
                    and present standing, was the first to plan a regular system of public
                    education. Elementary schools were established throughout the country; a naval
                    and engineering school at St Petersburg; mathematical and navigation schools at
                    Moscow and other places; ecclesiastical schools in the bishoprics; and Latin and
                    Greek schools were also founded in different towns of the empire. Shortly after
                    the demise of Peter, the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences was opened; but the
                    military schools were those which throve best under the Empresses Anne and
                    Elizabeth. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><hi

                    </note> This last sovereign, however, founded in 1755 an university at Moscow,
                    and two years afterwards an academy of the fine arts at St Petersburg. Inferior
                    public schools were not regularly organized until the year 1786, under the reign
                    of the Empress Catherine II. Boarding schools were established by her authority
                    in all the different governments of the empire. But a more important measure was
                    the institution of a central authority, intrusted with the care of disseminating
                    education. This organization underwent a complete reform under the Emperor
                    Alexander, who substituted, for the special commission of the former reign, a
                    minister of public instruction with more extensive powers. This sovereign
                    re-organized the university of Wilna, and founded those of Dorpat, St
                    Petersburg, Kazan, and Kharkov. He also established a gymnasium in the capital
                    of every government, and district schools in every district. But on the
                    accession of Nicholas the system underwent a total change. A few immaterial
                    forms were preserved, but the spirit had departed. His object was to render the
                    system of instruction religious, monarchical, and national; but as the two first
                    terms are evidently auxiliaries of the last, we must fuse the whole into two

                    />veral circuits were dependent, in relation to superintendence and
                    administration, upon the universities situated in each of these circuits. By the
                    ukase of the 25th of June 1835, they are placed under the ministry of public
                    instruction, represented in the different circuits by sub-delegates called
                    curators, by which education is placed under the direct and immediate control of
                    government. The different branches of the administration also take special
                    cognizance of the schools analogous to them. Thus, the military schools are
                    presided over by the war-office, the ecclesiastical schools by the holy synod,
                    and so on of the others. The whole system is divided into four distinct parts:
                    I. The ministry of public instruction; II. Military schools: III. Ecclesiastical
                    schools: and, IV. Special and other schools.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Ministry of Public Instruction.</hi> This department
                    comprehends, 1. Education in public schools; 2. Education in private
                    institutions; 3. Domestic education; 4. Establishments destined for forming
                    professors and masters; 5. The Academy of Sciences, the Russian Academy, the
                    other learned societies, the censorship, public libraries, museums, and
                    collections of every description. The public schools are thus discriminated
                    into, 1. Parish schools, intended for the lower orders, and allowed to teach
                    only the catechism, reading, writing, and the first four rules of arithmetic; 2.
                    District schools, having three classes intended for the children of shopkeepers,
                    and restricted in their course of instruction to the catechism, caligraphy,
                    drawing, the first rudiments of grammar, arithmetic, geometry, geography, and
                    history; 3. Gymnasiums distributed by government, divided into seven classes,
                    authorized to embrace more elevated studies, but only accessible to the children
                    of the nobility; 4. Universities of three faculties,</p>
                <p>The number of schools under the minister of public instruction has likewise
                    increased; and, viewing the general table of the march of education in Russia,
                    there appears to be a progressive increase of the number of pupils. But,
                    examined in detail, some parts of the empire exhibit a striking falling off.
                    This is especially the case in some of the provinces formerly Polish, where
                    schools were suppressed as a measure of policy.</p>
                <p>The minister of public instruction has another important duty besides those
                    mentioned. He exercises a jealous scrutiny of education in private and in
                    boarding schools, as well as domestic education; no one being permitted to
                    follow the profession of a teacher unless he has at least undergone an
                    examination at one of the universities. Private institutions of instruction are
                    usually conducted by foreigners, who, lest they should propagate forbidden
                    truths, are placed under the inspection of the local authorities, and cannot
                    make use of any books but those appointed by government. Other means are taken
                    to shackle these private schools, and deter foreigners from settling in Russia
                    as teachers of the people. But private or domestic tuition even by natives is
                    discouraged. No father has the power of selecting the instructors of his
                    children at his own pleasure; he must take them from amongst the individuals
                    licensed by government, or furnished with an authority those of philosophy, of
                    jurisprudence, and of medicine (the university of Dorpat has a fourth, the
                    faculty of theology), and of which the courses last five years. The following is
                    a table of the state of the schools in 1835 throughout the ten circuits of the
                    Russian empire, exclusive of Poland, which has a separate administration. It may
                    be mentioned, that another university has recently been established at Vladimir,
                    in Volhynia; so that, including the university of Warsaw, there will be nine
                    institutions of this description throughout the Russian empire.</p>

                    permitted to be educated in a foreign country under eighteen years of age; and
                    even after that age it is the emperor alone who can grant the necessary
                    permission. In 1829 there was founded at St Petersburg what is called an Upper
                    Teacher’s Institution, a sort of normal school, its object being the preparation
                    of tutors for the gymnasia and lyceums of the empire. It stands next in order

                    schools, especially reserved for soldiers’ children, and which are under the
                    control of the minister of war. The first are pretty widely distributed
                    throughout the empire; the second class, designated navy, battalion of pilots,
                    and instruction for workmen, are established only at St Petersburg, Cronstadt,

                    are divided into two heads. The first comprehends the schools of the Greek
                    Church, under the control of the holy synod, and directed by a special
                    commission; the second, the ecclesiastical schools belonging to other forms of
                    worship, which schools are under the superintendence of the minister of the
                    interior. All these schools are divided into three circuits or departments, viz.
                    those of St Petersburg, Moscow, and Kief. Each district has a superior school,
                    called the ecclesiastical academy; with a certain number of intermediary schools
                    or seminaries, for the most part established in the chief provincial towns, and
                    of inferior schools, divided into district and parochial ones. These
                    establishments are exclusively reserved for the children of the clergy, an

                    schools, distributed into inferior, middle, and superior seminaries, where the
                    art of mining is taught. They are situated at St Petersburg, and in the

                    pupils, which, added to those attending the mine-schools, makes the number of
                    pupils in the schools of this class amount to 6221. <hi rend="superscript"/> The
                    annual budget is 1,032,191 roubles. 2. Schools under the minister of the
                    interior. These are schools of medicine, surgery, and pharmacy, all independent
                    of the university faculties; rural schools for the cultivation of the vine, and
                    for agriculture in general; schools for the sons of persons employed in
                    subaltern situations in public offices, who are supported by the state on
                    condition of serving it eight years; and schools for orphans and poor children.
                    The establishments under the minister of the interior contain 13,340 pupils, of
                    whom 10,500 are in the hospitals. 3. Under the minister of the emperor’s
                    household are the Moscow Academy of the Fine Arts, Moscow School of
                    Architecture, the Theatrical School of St Petersburg, and the Court School of
                    Singers. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Travellers
                    have remarked, that the Russians possess a singular aptitude for music; and
                    Reicha, a very eminent musician, particularly notices the admirable accuracy
                    with which the vocal music is performed in the churches, without the aid of any
                    instrumental accompaniment. But in Russia the music of the church, the theatre,
                    the concert∙room, and the chamber, has been chiefly indebted for its progress to
                    Italian and German musicians, though the native music and musical instruments of
                    Russia are sufficiently interesting to deserve much more consideration than has
                    hitherto been bestowed upon them. The occurrence of popular airs in Finland in
                    the unusual measure of is vouched by continental writers. In the interior of
                    Russia, there appear to be many native airs of an uncommon character in respect
                    of melody and tonality. The celebrated Russian horn-music, though very
                    remarkable in its kind, must be considered as of foreign introduction, and as
                    the result of great musical aptitude, and of most careful and laborious
                    training. About the middle of the eighteenth century, J. A. Maresch, a Bohemian,
                    and a very skilful horn-player, who was settled at St Petersburg, invented there
                    the famous Russian horn-music. For a brief account of it, see the Appendix to
                    Graham’s Essay on Musical Composition; and for minute details regarding the
                    notation and the mode of performance of this kind of music, consult J. C.
                    Heinrich’s work, <hi rend="italic"> Enlttehung, Fortgang nndjetzige

                    appanages has under him some schools of agriculture, and primary schools for the
                    peasants, but containing only 1070 pupils. 5. Under the general direction of
                    roads and communications is a school of civil engineers and conductors,
                    containing 665 pupils. 6. Under the minister of justice are a school of
                    jurisprudence, and another of land-surveying, to train youth for the exclusive
                    service of government. These two establishments contain 350 pupils. 7. Under the
                    foreign office is an oriental institution for qualifying individuals to act as
                    diplomatic interpreters in the Asiatic tongues. 8. Institutions under the
                    reigning empress, comprehending the foundling hospitals of Moscow and St
                    Petersburg, the boarding-schools for young ladies at St Petersburg, Moscow, and
                    Odessa, which contain 52,912 pupils. The empress has further under her control
                    several patriotic establishments, mostly appropriated to the education of
                    children of indigent or invalid officers. In all they contain 1122 pupils. There
                    are also a number of benevolent institutions, such as houses of industry,
                    establishments for the deaf and dumb, the blind, and others. 9. The Archduchess
                    Helena superintends a number of educational institutions, established in
                    different provincial towns, and managed by the local authorities. 10. There
                    remain to be added to the above a number of schools which are supported without
                    any assistance from government. All the foregoing derive considerable pecuniary
                    aid from that source. There are four German schools at St Petersburg, and 750 in
                    the German colonies, having in all 35,746. In the same provinces are 561 Tartar
                    schools, with 14,000 pupils; and there are two Jewish schools, with 500 pupils.
                    At Omsk, Cossack and Asiatic schools have been instituted. The latter are
                    intended to supply interpreters to all the frontier line of Siberia.</p>

                <p>This upon a population of 48,000,000, exclusively of the Asiatic population,

                    education at 597,424 individuals, which would give to Russia one pupil enjoying
                    education for every fifty of the inhabitants. According to M. Ouvaroff’s last
                    report, this proportion had in 1837 become one in forty-five. The data upon
                    which both the minister and Krusenstern make their calculations are very
                    problematical. We greatly doubt if the proportion is so high as it is here
                    given. Mr Bremner states <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    that “popular education is advancing but slowly; for in many of the governments
                    of the interior, out of every four or five hundred of the population, there is
                    not more than <hi rend="italic">one</hi> young person attending school. The
                    educational schemes of the government have hitherto been unsuccessful in the
                    provinces, because the people, being ignorant of the value of instruction,
                    seldom think of sending their children to school. In the large cities, however,
                    public seminaries are most successfully conducted and numerously attended.” With
                    regard to the provinces, considering the character both of the country and of
                    the peasantry, we think that there may be some truth in Mr Bremner’s statement;
                    but it cannot be of very extensive application, the discrepancy being so great
                    between it and those of the individuals mentioned.</p>
                <p>Independently of the institutions occupied directly in the education of youth,
                    Russia has further her academies of science, her learned societies, her public
                    libraries, and her museums. The number of scientific establishments in St
                    Petersburg is very great; and the merits of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, in
                    relation to its mathematical, astronomical, mineralogical, and geographical
                    labours, are incontestable. The universities of Moscow and Dorpat are also
                    highly celebrated. The institution last named would appear to be the most
                    prosperous of all the universities in Russia, many of its professors, such as
                    Struve the astronomer, Parrot the traveller, and others, being men of great
                    eminence in the scientific world. Of the Russian libraries, that of St
                    Petersburg is the richest and most considerable, containing 413,000 volumes.
                    After it rank the Hermitage Library, consisting of 100,000 volumes; the library,
                    of the Academy of Sciences, 90,000 volumes; and those belonging to the
                    universities of Dorpat, Moscow, Kief, Kazan, Kharkov, and St Petersburg, each
                    being highly respectable, as w ill be seen from a table already given. In 1837,
                    the total amount of books in the public libraries of Russia amounted to 858,635
                    volumes. It ought to be mentioned, however, that about two thirds of the
                    scientific and literary treasure of Russia have been plundered from unhappy
                    Poland. The number of literary and scientific institutions throughout the
                    empire, including several purely philanthropic associations, may be estimated at
                    fifty, of which twenty belong to St Petersburg alone.</p>
                <p>In Russia proper, the owners of estates are under obligations to provide their
                    peasantry with the means of support, and in times of distress to relieve them.
                    On the estates belonging to the crown, a methodical system of parochial relief
                    is established, each parish being compelled to supply its destitute poor, in
                    poor-houses, with fuel, food, and clothing. In Courland, Esthonia, and Livonia,
                    a similar compulsory system is established, the landowners and farmers
                    contributing in proportion to their occupations or rental, and the overseers
                    being elected by the rate-payers. Public begging is forbidden, and vagrants set
                    to work by the overseers. Even in Siberia the authorities are under legal
                    obligation to prevent any individual of the people committed to their charge
                    from suffering want, or remaining without assistance when in distress. In the
                    Russo-Polish provinces a similar system prevails as in Russia proper.</p>
                <p>The productions of the Russian press are no index to the national cultivation.
                    Amongst the great body of the people there is little or no taste for literature.
                    It is only amongst the higher classes that any thing like a reading public is to
                    be found; so that it may well be believed native authors, or translators of
                    foreign literature, have little encouragement held out to them, at least of a
                    public nature. It redounds, however, to the credit of the late sovereigns of
                    Russia, and the more wealthy of the nobles, that they have done much to foster
                    Russian literature, by the munificent favours which they have bestowed on native
                    writers. But that ready market, a large and intelligent reading community, is
                    alone calculated to draw forth to any great extent the talents and the genius of
                    native writers, and to promote the interests of literature. Thus, although many
                    eminent men have appeared in Russia as authors, such as Lomonoscoff, Mura-vieff,
                    Karamzin, Pouschkin (a celebrated poet, who perished in a duel in the flower of
                    his age, February 1837), and some others, its literature is yet in an infant or
                    imitative state. The greater number of the books that are published are
                    translations from the German and French, and their circulation is limited.
                    Karamzin’s History of Russia, the most popular work ever published in that
                    country, and said to be the one most widely circulated, sold only to the extent
                    of 1500 copies in two editions. In the Russian empire are published eighty
                    papers and minor periodicals, and about twelve scientific and literary journals.
                    Of course, nothing like the liberty of the press is known in Russia. Indeed
                    there cannot be said to exist a press at all in the common acceptation of the
                    term, as the newspapers are published by the government, and no periodical
                    literature of a political character exists in the Russian language. In 1837, the
                    printing establishments in the empire were 171, of which ninety-four were
                    maintained by government, and seventy-seven by private persons. There were
                    seventy-four lithographic establishments, nine of which were supported by
                    government. A strict censorship of the press has been instituted, and its
                    jealous vigilance is particularly directed to English newspapers, all but the
                    <hi rend="italic">Morning Post</hi> being absolutely prohibited from entering
                    the capital. The censorships of the press are conducted according to the
                    precepts of a new regulation, which is due to the solicitude of the Emperor
                    Nicholas, and was issued in 1828. In university towns it is intrusted to
                    committees, and everywhere else committed to censors appointed <hi rend="italic"
                    > ad hoc.</hi> The censorship of works relating to religion rests with the
                    ecclesiastical authorities. Every book hostile to the creed of the Greek church,
                    to monarchical or autocratical authority, to decency, to morality, to the honour
                    of individuals, is prohibited. The first duty of the censors in examining a
                    book, is “to consider what is the object that the author has proposed to
                    himself.” These rules apply alike to national and to foreign Works. Literary
                    property is a vested interest during the life of the author, and for twenty-five
                    years after his death. Literary piracy is punished by a fine equivalent to
                    double the cost of an edition of twelve hundred copies. In 1835, seven hundred
                    and eight works were printed in Russia, and three thousand foreign volumes were
                    imported. Mr Bremner informs us, that in spite of all restrictions, “Russian
                    literature is advancing with great rapidity.”</p>
                <p>Under this head two languages are to be distinguished: 1. The Russian language,
                    originally the dialect of the Sclavi, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=597" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0597-0585"
                    />who founded the empire. It underwent various changes along with the empire
                    itself, the Scandinavian, Mongolian, Tartar, and German, also the Polish and
                    French languages, being all by degrees incorporated with it to a greater or less
                    extent. This improvement is continually advancing by means of the national
                    literature. 2. The Sclavonian language, or that of the Sclavonian Bible. It was
                    fixed by the translation of the Holy Scriptures, and so settled that it has
                    since experienced but few alterations. From the combination of these two a mixed
                    language arose, which was used in sermons, rhetorical prose, and the higher
                    species of poetry. The following extract presents a concise view of the way in
                    which the Russian language began to assume its present form. “From the
                    thirteenth to the fourteenth century,” says the celebrated Karamsin, “our
                    language generally became more pure and more correct. Our scrupulous authors
                    gave up the use of the Russian language, as yet too rude, in order to attach
                    themselves more strongly to that which had been employed in composing the books
                    of our church, namely, the ancient Servian, in which our Bible is written. They
                    followed its rules, not only in the declensions and conjugations, but even in
                    the pronunciation and orthography 5 nevertheless, as may be seen in Nestor, the
                    force of habit made them often recur to their natural idioms, a circumstance
                    which has introduced into our literature a mixture consecrated by antiquity, and
                    so deeply rooted amongst us, that often in the same book, and in the same page,
                    we write <hi rend="italic">zlato</hi> and <hi rend="italic">zoloto</hi> (gold),
                    <hi rend="italic">glad</hi> and <hi rend="italic">golod</hi> (hunger), <hi
                    rend="italic">mladost</hi> and <hi rend="italic">molodost</hi> (youth). The time
                    had not yet arrived for giving to the Russian language that energy, that
                    flexibility, that grace and delicacy, which in the days of peace and prosperity
                    are coupled with the rapid progress of the intellectual faculties, with richness
                    of ideas, and variety of knowledge, as well as with the formation of taste and
                    the sense of the beautiful. We see, however, that our ancestors endeavoured to
                    express their thoughts with more distinctness; that they sought to soften the
                    still too rude sound of words, and to give less stiffness to their style. In
                    short, putting aside all national pride, we may say that though, compared with
                    other Europeans, the Russians might appear very ignorant, they were nevertheless
                    far from having lost all the fruits of civilization; they proved how much force
                    it has to resist the rudest assaults of barbarism.” <note anchored="true"

                <p>The accounts of the Russian character in the works of those who have resided or
                    travelled in the country, are extremely conflicting. He who impartially weighs
                    the evidence of Coxe, Tooke, Clarke, Porter, Wilson, Cochrane, Holman,
                    Londonderry, Bremner, and others, will arrive at the conclusion, which might
                    have been suspected before the investigation began, that whilst there are not a
                    few dark stains on the national character, many of them are attributable to the
                    peculiar political system under which the people live, to their general
                    ignorance hitherto, and to the low character and unclerical behaviour of the
                    secular clergy; and that under a proper system of government, instruction, and
                    religious discipline, the Russians would not be far behind some of their
                    continental neighbours who hold a much higher place in the scale of civilization
                    and morals. The opinion which generally prevails in this country regarding the
                    Russians as a people does them injustice. If, as Dr Lyall asserts, they are
                    “insinuating and cunning, deceitful and perfidious, sensual and immoral,” it
                    must not be forgotten, that any natural tendency to these vices not only remains
                    unchecked by proper secular and religious instruction, but is fostered, as in a
                    hot-bed, by a state of slavery, or semi-vassalage, which is little better.
                    Amongst all the nations of Europe, in Russia alone is one half of the population
                    a marketable commodity, or something not very far removed from it. But we
                    question much if the natural bias to the crimes and vices mentioned by Dr Lyall
                    and others be very strong. From circumstances, however, they have received a
                    powerful development; and from the statements of more recent travellers, it
                    would seem that they are gradually becoming less conspicuous. They are fond of
                    novelties, amusements, and gambling, particularly of cardplaying. They are
                    extremely partial to singing, and their talents for imitation and the
                    acquisition of languages are universally allowed to be remarkable. With regard
                    to the former, Dr Clarke observes, “their surprising powers of imitation exceed
                    all that has been hitherto known.”</p>
                <p>The foregoing observations apply to the bulk of the community. With regard to the
                    Russian nobles, it may be briefly stated, that the style of living of the
                    wealthy greatly resembles that of the higher ranks in other parts of Europe.
                    With the exception of a few traits of a national cast, there is little
                    distinction between the majority of the Russian nobility and those who move in
                    the polite circles in Paris or in London. French and German are spoken with as
                    much facility as the Russian language. French is the court language, and in
                    spite of the invasion of 1812, and the loss of Moscow, the manners and
                    literature of France are held in universal esteem. The wealthy nobles expend
                    enormous sums on their entertainments, and many a goodly estate is mortgaged to
                    gratify this passion for display.</p>
                <p>The national dress of Russia consists of a long coat reach- ] ing to the calves
                    of the legs, with numerous tucks at the bottom of the waist; a waistcoat of
                    coloured linen, having the neck bare; and thin boots and shoes of the bark of
                    the linden tree. In winter a sheep-skin pelisse is substituted for the coat. The
                    dress of the higher ranks is now formed studiously on the European model, though
                    no other part of Europe can rival the gorgeous robes worn by the nobles and
                    bishops on public occasions, or the profusion of diamonds which emblazon their
                    persons. The national amusements are chiefly those afforded by the ice. A
                    favourite diversion is the ice-hill, or mountain, as the Russians call it, on
                    whose sides are formed steep inclined planes, down which the adventurer throws
                    himself, seated on a machine, which he guides with surprising skill. Swinging is
                    another Russian diversion; to which may be added the common ones of dancing, and
                    of a national music, which, with the songs and ballads to which it is sung, is
                    very plaintive and pleasing.</p>
                <p>There are ten orders of knighthood or of merit in this; empire, three of which
                    were established by Peter the Great, the parent of Russian civilization. They
                    are both of a civil and military description; and many of them are divided into
                    several classes, some having five, others three and four. But the indiscriminate
                    manner in which these marks of distinction arc bestowed greatly lessens their
                    value. Even private soldiers have frequently half a dozen bits of ribbon strung
                    in a line across the breast, and common policemen are sometimes bedecked in the
                    same manner. A general officer in the Russian service is usually covered with
                    orders of one kind or another. It is a fact worthy of remark, that the calendar
                    has not yet been reformed in Russia. The reason assigned by the Russians for
                    thus remaining twelve days in arrear of all other nations, is partly the fear
                    which the emperor has of any serious innovations giving offence to his nobles,
                    and partly the unwillingness of the clergy to accede to any change which would
                    so materially disarrange the present order of their numerous feasts or saints’
                    days. Without the sanction of the priesthood, such <pb break="no"

                <p>Russia in Asia comprehends the whole northern portion of it, extending from
                    latitude 38° 40' to 78° north, and from longitude 37° 14 to 190° 22' east from
                    Greenwich. It is bounded on the west by European Russia and the Black Sea; on
                    the south by Asiatic Turkey, Persia, the Caspian and Aral Seas, the territories
                    of the Turkomans and Kirghises, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    village of Finalka, situated at the foot of the Altai, is in length 1707 versts,
                    and is marked by four towns, eleven fortresses, fifteen fortified advanced

                    Pacific Ocean and Behring’s Straits; and the Frozen Ocean extends along the
                    whole of its northern limits. Its greatest extent from west to east is about
                    4142 miles, and its greatest breadth from north to south is about 1933 miles.
                    This vast dominion is calculated to be spread over twenty-seven ninetieths of
                    the land of the globe.</p>
                <p>The Ural Mountains, already described, run along the western limits of Asiatic
                    Russia. On the south-west extends the Caucasus, and on the west the Altai range.
                    The eastern division of the Russian territory, from the river Yenisei or
                    Ienessi, has on its southern and eastern parts vast mountain ranges; and on its
                    interior there are several chains that run to the Arctic Ocean in gigantic
                    masses. This portion of Siberia is covered with woods, large lakes, or extensive
                    and elevated plains, and terminates towards the shores of the Frozen Ocean, in
                    vast fields of eternal ice. The western division, with the exception of the
                    mountain ranges mentioned, taken as a whole, may be described as a vast level
                    plain, partially watered, but by its climate and soil ill adapted for the
                    increase or the comfort of human beings.</p>
                <p>The rivers of Asiatic Russia that empty themselves into the Arctic Sea are
                    amongst the most considerable of the ancient world. The most remarkable of these
                    are, 1st, the Obe, whose course is 2170 miles in length, during which it
                    receives the great rivers the Tom, the Kek, the Irtysli, the Tyda, and all their
                    tributary streams. 2d, The Yenisei, which has a course of 3115 miles, with fewer
                    sinuosities than are usually observed in other great rivers. It receives the
                    waters of fourteen large streams, and all their tributary collections. 3d, The
                    Piasana, whose course is 300 miles. 4th, The Taimurskoe, a short stream issuing
                    from a lake of the same name. 5th, The Khatanga, which empties itself into the
                    Bay of Khatangaskoi, on the Frozen Ocean. 6th, The Anabara, an arctic stream.
                    7th, The Olenk, whose waters only become considerable after entering the arctic
                    circle. 8th, The Lena, one of the largest of the Asiatic Russian rivers. It
                    rises in the Baikal Mountains, to the north of China, in latitude 52° 30', and
                    empties itself into the ocean in latitude 70° 40', and longitude 164° 26', after
                    receiving the waters of fourteen large rivers and their numerous tributary
                    streams. 9th, The Omoloi; 10th, the Jana; 11th, the Indigirka; 12th, the
                    Alazeja; 13th, the Kolyma; 14th, the Tchauna; and, 15th, the Amgonia. The
                    streams whose courses have been traced to fall into the sea of Kamtschatka,
                    between Asia and America, are the Anadyr, the Katirka, the Kamtschatka, the
                    Penshena, the Tilcha, the Ischiga, the Tauna, the Okhota, the Uda, the Argun,
                    and the Shilka. The rivers which descend from the Asiatic side into the Black
                    Sea and Caspian have already been noticed.</p>
                <p>The lakes in Russian Asia are very numerous, and some of them very extensive. One
                    of the largest is the Baikal, in Siberia, between latitude 52° and 55°, and
                    longitude 104° 26' and 109° 56', extending over 11,180 square miles. Its water
                    is clear and bright, and the depth varies from eighteen to five hundred feet. It
                    is covered with ice from the middle of December till April. The river Angara,
                    which runs to the Yenisei, issues from it. It contains a great number of rocky
                    islands, the largest of which is called Olchon. The lakes next in extent are the
                    Tchani and the Piasenskoe, both in the government of Tomsk. Every province has
                    one or more lakes, several of which are of salt water, and on whose banks a
                    natural crystallization prepares culinary salt for the use of the
                    inhabitants.</p>
                <p>There are several plains or steppes of great extent in Asiatic Russia, the most
                    remarkable being the Kirghis Steppe, between the Irtysh and Orenburg boundary
                    line. It is a very dry and barren district, with some lakes whose water is
                    saline. The few rivers have copious streams in the spring from the melted snows,
                    but in summer become dried up. There is also the Steppe of Bolschei; of Jettish,
                    to the eastward of the Ural; of Ischim, on both sides of the river of that name,
                    between Tobol and the Irtysh; and the Baraba or Barbinska, between the Irtysh
                    and the Ob or Obe. It is about two hundred miles in breadth, and its surface is
                    by no means dry and arid, as is commonly thought, but, on the contrary, rather
                    suffers from an abundance of water, being chiefly covered with large and small
                    lakes and extensive swamps, and also traversed by several small rivers, which
                    partly fall into the Om, an eastern tributary of the Irtysh, and partly into the
                    Irtysh and Obe. Some portions of it present a perfect level, like the ocean in a
                    calm; others are slightly undulating, and covered with grass, some birch, and
                    poplar. Some lakes are salt, and occasionally the surface of the ground is
                    covered with saline efflorescence. In this steppe a peculiar disease is
                    prevalent, called the Siberian plague. To these may be added the Arctic Plain,
                    between the 67th degree of latitude and the Frozen Ocean, whose whole surface is
                    little more than morasses, mixed with rocks, and bound up by frost between ten
                    and eleven months in the year. These extensive plains are sometimes passed by
                    the wandering tribes, who find subsistence on the less sterile spots which are
                    to be met with on the banks of the rivers that bound them. The southern
                    districts, however, possess a great deal of land equally adapted for tillage and
                    for pasture. The forests abound with game; and the rivers are well stocked with
                    fish.</p>
                <p>The climate differs little from that of European Russia. The principal
                    productions are wheat, rye, barley, oats, and buck-wheat, which grows wild in
                    the middle of Siberia. The return is small, but the crops have increased with
                    the introduction of more improved methods of cultivating the soil. The southern
                    territory along the upper part of the Irtysh, as well as along the Tobol, the
                    Izet, and others of its tributaries, which are covered with luxuriant pastures,
                    might be made to yield very rich crops, if the inhabitants would change their
                    taste for a pastoral life, and till the ground. For some time past indeed the
                    Kirghises have shown indications of commencing agriculture, especially the
                    poorer classes, who cultivate, upon the borders of the lakes and rivers, fields
                    of corn, rye, barley, and millet. But notwithstanding the general neglect of
                    agriculture, the produce is in some parts extremely plentiful. Immense crops are
                    raised without the aid of manure, so that living is very cheap. In many parts
                    the goats and sheep, and in some the oxen, furnish food for the inhabitants;
                    whilst in others they derive subsistence from the fish with which the seas,
                    lakes, and rivers abound. The rearing of sheep for wool is a branch of industry
                    lately introduced into Siberia, and is likely to thrive.</p>

                <p>The territory which stretches along the Asiatic frontier deserves particular
                    mention, as the most favoured district of Siberia. This vast space is chiefly
                    inhabited by Cossacks, colonised warriors, divided into several regiments; and
                    although other colonists, as peasants, shopkeejpers, &amp;c. have established
                    themselves there, the population does not at present exceed 45,000. The Cossacks
                    are privileged to trade with the Kirghises, without paying the taxes of either
                    of the three guilds; in their military capacity they mount guard in turn at the
                    different posts; their leisure time is employed in the rearing of cattle,
                    gardening, hunting, and fishing. The territory they occupy is for the most part
                    very fertile, especially between the forty-ninth and fifty-first degrees of
                    latitude, where the soil spontaneously produces fruit-trees, melons, tobacco,
                    &amp;c.; whilst in the most eastern part, the solitary but picturesque and
                    fruitful valleys of Altai, rich in every description of odoriferous flowers and
                    aromatic herbs, enable the inhabitants to rear innumerable swarms of bees, and
                    to furnish the greatest part of Siberian honey. Several manufactories,
                    especially that of leather, have been established in the towns; but trade is yet
                    in its infancy, and scarcely developed. Its progress and improvement will
                    doubtless hereafter enhance the value of the natural productions of these
                    regions, amongst which must be reckoned the lakes of salt water so numerous in
                    the steppes. Important as they are in relation to trade and commerce, these
                    lakes likewise present to the naturalist a series of interesting phenomena.
                    Their waters hold so great a quantity of salt in solution, that the action of
                    the summer heat is of itself sufficient to convert it into crystals, which,
                    carried towards the banks by the action of the waves, form there shoals of salt
                    of an immense extent. Magazines have been formed upon the borders of Lake
                    Ko-riak, the only one situated on the right bank of the Irtysh, and the salt
                    therein preserved generally amounts to several millions of poods. Large
                    quantities of this article are annually carried across the Irtysh to Tobolsk.
                    But however rich this lake may be, it is less so than three others, the
                    Karashack, the Kalkaman, and the Djémantons, situated in the steppes on the
                    right bank of the Irtysh. Each of these basins is from twenty to twenty-five
                    versts in circumference; and the action of the solar rays produces in them,
                    during the summer season, crystals of salt so numerous, that by mutual contact
                    they at length form thick and solid arches, which, like winter ice, cover the
                    surface of the lakes. These masses are frequently nine inches thick; the action
                    of the air whitens the upper layers; the lower ones preserve a bluish tint,
                    which in some places assumes a beautiful violet hue; and the solidity of these
                    crystal fields is such that horses, chariots, and even camels, pass over them
                    with the greatest safety. Ten other lakes are also found between the Irtysh and
                    Redoubt of Siberia.</p>
                <p>The mines of Russian Asia are by far more productive than those of any other
                    portion of the empire, as from them is extracted the whole of the gold, silver,
                    platina, and lead, nine tenths of the copper, and eleven twelfths of the iron
                    which is brought into use. Zinc, arsenic, and bismuth, together with precious
                    stones, are also found. These mines are situated in the Uralian and Altaian
                    ranges of mountains. It is in those parts of these chains which face Siberia,
                    that is, the eastern slope of the Ural, and the northern declivities of the
                    Altai, with its secondary branches, that are found the veins of precious metal.
                    The best account of these mines is that contained in a recent book of travels by
                    Gustav Rose. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><hi

                    particles of gold occurs along the eastern declivity of the Uralian range, in
                    numerous places north of 56° north latitude, and extends beyond 60° north
                    latitude. It occurs in the western decli-</p>
                <p>vity likewise, but only in a few places, and contains less gold. On the Siberian
                    side of the range, the sand from which the gold is extracted contains about one
                    and a half or two solotnik of gold in a pood, or from 1/2280 to 1/1920 that
                    which contains less is at present not worked.” But Mr Rose says that even sand
                    containing only 1/7680 of gold can still be washed with profit. “The expenses in
                    washing sand containing between and of gold amount commonly to two fifths of its
                    net produce. Sometimes sand is found of which 1/600 and even 1/300 is gold. A
                    small quantity of silver is always mixed with the gold; it amounts to between
                    two and eleven parts in one hundred. Near the Altai Mountains, likewise, gold
                    sand has been discovered in some places, and they have begun working it The
                    first establishment for working this sand in the Ural was made in 1814, at
                    Beresowsk, near Ikaterineburg, and since that time they have been increasing in
                    number and extent Last year (1836) the produce of all the Russian mines gave
                    27,885 marcs of gold, of which more than two thirds were derived from the
                    washing of the sand.” The platina mines are situated on the western declivity of
                    the Ural, about the parallel of 57° 40' north. They are six in number, and he at
                    a short distance from one another. “In the most northern, called
                    Sukhowissimokoi, the discovery of the sand containing platina was made in 1825,
                    and at the other places it was found soon afterwards. The proportion of platina
                    is much larger than that of gold, as it amounts on an average to of the whole
                    mass. Sometimes pieces are found weighing some ounces, and even half a pound and
                    upwards. A small quantity of gold is united with platina. In 1834 platina was
                    discovered in layers of serpentine. The produce of platina in 1836 amounted to
                    8270 marcs.” <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Journal of

                <p>The field opened for researches is so vast, that years of methodical and
                    persevering examination have not yet been sufficient to explore all the valleys
                    and summits of these immense chains, a vast extent not having yet been visited
                    by the officers of the Mining Board. The examination of these parts, as yet
                    almost unknown, is pursued with the greatest regularity. The two chains, the
                    Ural and the Altai, are divided into several mining districts. In each of them
                    the officers to whom is confided the direction of the works, send out every
                    summer detachments of discovery, whose duty it is to examine in detail the
                    mountains assigned to them, the point at which the expedition stopped the
                    preceding year being generally that of departure for the new one. We have
                    already stated the quantities of metal which these mines produce annually. With
                    regard to the diamonds, Mr Rose states that only small stones are found, their
                    number up' to July 1833 amounting only to thirty-three.</p>
                <p>The manufactures are few and unimportant, with the ex-ception of spirits and
                    leather, which are made to a consi-derable extent at Tobolsk,and the towns in
                    the neighbour-hood. There are here 114 tanneries, besides a number of
                    establishments for soap-boiling and the melting of tallow. Cotton and woollen
                    are begun to be manufactured into coarse stuffs in one or two parts. The
                    breweries, but especially the distilleries, are more numerous than any other
                    manufacturing objects. Making corn-spirits is a royal monopoly, but in some of
                    the Asiatic cities it is let to farm by the government. The chief commerce is
                    internal, between the several provinces whose productions are most different
                    from each other. Trade is carried on to a great extent at Tobolsk, the capital
                    of the country. With the exception of the clergy and persons employed in the
                    service of government, almost all are engaged in it, exchanging the produce <pb

                    and utensils, for the skins, cattle, caviare, fish salted and fresh, and game
                    brought to them from the interior by the Ostiaks or Tartars. Every year the
                    merchants of Tobolsk, Tumene, and the other towns, send boats laden with flour
                    up the Irtysh and the Obe to Berezoff, and the other small towns situated
                    farther to the north; and these boats return freighted with fish. The clerks and
                    agents belonging to these merchants, and who are established in the small towns
                    upon the banks of the Obe, purchase of the Ostiaks valuable furs, which,
                    together with soap, tallow, and leather, they afterwards export, partly to the
                    fair of Niznei-Novgorod, and partly to the Kirg-hises of the steppes, who pay
                    them in horses, cattle, and cotton stuffs, purchased by themselves of the
                    Bukharians; the remaining produce of the government of Tobolsk is exported by
                    the way of Kiakhta into China, whence are brought in exchange silks and tea.
                    Kiakhta is the solitary point of commercial intercourse between the two great
                    empires of Russia and China. Almost all the principal houses in Russia have an
                    agent at Kiakhta; while the Chinese traffickers consist chiefly of temporary
                    visiters without their families. The Russians here receive the staples of China,
                    for which they give the productions of their own country in return. The nature
                    and extent of the commerce of</p>
                <p>Kiakhta will be seen from the following statement.</p>

                <p>In 1825 the total exports amounted to 5,501,815 roubles, or L.239,697, so that in
                    ten years there has been an increase in the commercial intercourse between
                    Russia and China to the extent of nearly two millions roubles. The Russians
                    chiefly transport by water the merchandise which they send in summer, or oftener
                    in spring, from Kiakhta to Europe. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Another great commercial line is that which branches from Irkutsk down the Lena,
                    into the heart of the frozen regions and the shores of the Arctic Ocean.
                    Yakoutsk, situated about eight hundred miles down the Lena, is the emporium
                    where the furs and other products of these desolate regions are collected. They
                    are brought from the remotest extremities of the land which borders Behring’s
                    Straits, from Kamtschatka, and from the American territory, as well as from the
                    northern wastes. A considerable proportion consists of the tribute which is paid
                    to government; and the wandering traffickers exchange tobacco, spirits, cutlery,
                    beads, and toys, for the remainder.</p>
                <p>Asiatic Russia, like the European portion of the empire, is divided into

                    under the same species of civil government which we have described as
                    characterising the rest of the empire. The names of the governments of Siberia,
                    with the number of the inhabitants, are as follow.</p>

                <p>There can be little doubt that in this census, which has been recently taken, the
                    wandering tribes have been merely estimated, and that it is only an
                    approximation to the truth. The population consists of two very distinct
                    portions, the foreign rulers and the native tribes. The Russian inhabitants
                    consist chiefly of the unfortunate persons who have been banished to these
                    remote regions for various crimes, more especially those of a political nature.
                    A basis was formed by the Swedish officers who fell into the hands of Peter the
                    Great on “sad Pultawa’s day,” and a regular succession of recruits has
                    subsequently been furnished by the empire itself. Amongst those who have been
                    thus expatriated by a jealous and absolute government, were of course many
                    individuals belonging to the higher ranks of society, men of polished manners
                    and accomplished minds, so that at Tobolsk, where they were chiefly stationed,
                    there is a far higher degree of refinement and intelligence to be found than
                    might have been expected in a settlement of convicts. This great capital of
                    Western Siberia has to a considerable extent acquired the polish of a European
                    city. In 1835 it contained 15,379 inhabitants, two ecclesiastical schools, about
                    twenty churches, and a monastery. The lowest class of exiles are condemned to
                    the mines, where, being closely watched, and with hard work and harder fare,
                    they drag out a miserable existence. A class whose offences are of a milder
                    character are distributed amongst the distilleries. A third class receive grants
                    of land, for which a trifle is paid to government. The individuals composing
                    this class are formed into villages, under the superintendence of a strict
                    police. The native races have been enumerated in our general statement of the
                    various tribes who inhabit the Russian empire. Siberia is under the same system
                    of national education as European Russia, and has its schools, gymnasia, and
                    other institutions of the kind. Public instruction is making some progress at
                    Tobolsk, notwithstanding the many obvious difficulties which obstruct it. There
                    are in this government eleven ecclesiastical schools, with thirty-four masters,
                    and 686 pupils.</p>

                <p>The Transcaucasian territory of Russia is a vast tract of country situated
                    between the Black and Caspian Seas, and bounded by Turkey and Persia on the
                    south. It has been entirely incorporated with the empire since the commencement
                    of this century. Relations had been established with Georgia a long time
                    previously, but it was not till 1801 that it was declared a Russian province.
                    The district of Elizabethpol was seized in 1803; Imeretia in 1805; Persia ceded
                    the Khanats of Sheki, Shirvan, Karabagh, Talish, Bacoo, Cooba, and Derbend, in
                    1813; the treaty of Turk-manschay, concluded with Persia in 1828, gave to Russia
                    the Armenian provinces of Erivan, Nanhischevan, and Or-dubat, and fixed as its
                    frontier the course of the Araxes; and, lastly, by the treaty of Adrianople

                    altogethercomprehend a superficies of 154,000 square versts, which is about
                    twice the size of England without Wales. The whole is considered an integral
                    part of the empire, and as such is administered by Russian authorities. But
                    besides these provinces, Russia claims a protectorate over Mingrelia, Abassa or
                    Abhasia, the Lesghian tribes, and several principalities of Daghestan. Some of
                    these countries are entirely under Russian influence; but in Abhasia,even
                    according to Russian writers, it is merely nominal. The following statistical
                    table is from a work composed and published in St Petersburg in 1836 by supreme

                <p>Small as this territory is compared with the vast extent of Russia, it is of no
                    trifling importance to her in a commercial, financial, and political point of
                    view. Its geographical position appears to us the happiest possible for such a
                    power, prosecuting gigantic schemes of commercial intercourse or territorial
                    aggrandisement. Climate, soil, natural capabilities, situation, and political
                    relations, all prove that, whatever it has cost Russia to acquire and maintain
                    her Transcaucasian dominions, their value, which as yet is only developed to a
                    small extent, justifies her policy. A commission was appointed in 1828 to draw
                    up a statistical account of these provinces, the labours of which body
                    terminated in 1835. The following is a brief abstract of the results of their
                    investigations, derived from the official sources.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Silh.</hi> The cultivation of mulberry trees is in a very
                    backward state, although the tax levied upon them was abolished in 1830. The
                    whole annual export does not exceed 15,530 poods.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Cotton.</hi> The natural capabilities of the country offer a
                    possibility of increasing the production of this valuable commodity to an
                    immense extent; but its cultivation has greatly decreased since the district
                    where it is chiefly raised passed from the hands of Persia to those of Russia.
                    The whole export amounts annually only to 36,000 poods, of very inferior
                    quality.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Wine.</hi> The vine is indigenous to these regions, and
                    presents a great variety of kinds. The vineyards are numerous and rich, the
                    country being well adapted for the cultivation of the plant. There are produced
                    annually about 3,888,000 vedros of wine, and 140,000 vedros of brandy. The
                    district of Telav alone furnishes to this quota 2,000,000 vedros of wine, and
                    140 vedros of brandy. Imeretia is not included in this estimate. This quantity
                    of wine and brandy is entirely absorbed by the internal consumption, which is
                    immense. The production of wine of various kinds and most excellent quality
                    might be prosecuted to an extent which might render Russia independent of
                    foreign importations of the article.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Rice.</hi> The cultivation of this plant has not improved
                    since the establishment of the Russians in the country. There is an annual
                    produce, however, of about 130,000 chetwerts.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Saffron.</hi> The province of Bacoo alone produces yearly
                    1000 poods of saffron, which shows to what an extent this valuable branch of
                    agricultural industry might be carried.</p>
                <p>The article has hitherto been very ill prepared, but efforts are making to
                    improve the management of it.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Madder.</hi> This article is produced in great quantities at
                    Derbend, and other places along the shores of the Caspian Sea.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Cochineal.</hi> The Armenian or southern parts of the
                    Transcaucasian provinces produce a kind of cochineal, which is said to yield a
                    dye equal to that of Mexico The Russian government is doing every thing in her
                    power to extend this new and profitable branch of productive industry.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Live Stock.</hi> Extensive herds might be reared in these
                    provinces, which afford great facilities for their maintenance. Great numbers of
                    sheep and cattle are indeed raised, but the wool of the one is bad, and the
                    breed of the other is inferior. But there can be little doubt that Merino sheep
                    will be successfully introduced into this quarter. There is a fine race of
                    horses, and an abundance of camels, asses, mules, and swine.</p>
                <p>The natural capabilities of these provinces are very great, affording facilities
                    for the production of the most valuable commodities, which are exclusively
                    furnished by southern climates. These have only been developed to a partial
                    extent; but the Russian government is displaying such laudable zeal to encourage
                    such branches of industry as are peculiarly adapted for the various districts of
                    her vast possessions, that by and by she will be independent of what are called
                    colonial goods, silk, cotton, and the like. The provinces, however, are greatly
                    depressed by a system of most vexatious and unequally levied imposts. These have
                    not been laid on by Russia; they owe their origin to the rapacity of the various
                    petty tyrants who formerly ruled the different parts of this region. Free
                    commerce was permitted to the provinces in 1821, and they soon began to reap
                    great advantages from this liberal system. But it was abolished in 1832,
                    probably because the additional revenue which accrued from it was not a
                    sufficient compensation for such an interference with the general system of
                    Russian policy.</p>
                <p>This is not the place to enter into the great and important question relative to
                    the influence which Russia is likely to exercise over the East, by thus firmly
                    establishing her dominion beyond the Caucasus. Although the maintenance of the
                    provinces costs her yearly L.16,000, the revenue being about L.216,000 and the
                    expenditure about L.232,000, yet, by placing the resources of the country under
                    proper management, the former might be increased to a vast extent. But this is
                    of comparatively little moment compared with two other objects of her
                    far-sighted policy, which will be promoted by rendering the Caucasian isthmus a
                    commercial country, securely incorporated with the rest of the empire. These are
                    the creation of a manufacturing industry, which will make her independent of
                    other countries, Particularly of England, and the establishment of her power in
                    Asia, whence great advantages are not unreasonably expected. Now these provinces
                    will at once supply the raw material necessary for manufactures, and at the same
                    time open a market for them in the east. It is true, that the Caucasian
                    Mountains almost totally sever this limb from the great body of the empire, the
                    passes of Mozdac being difficult, and the country at the same time infested with
                    predatory hordes. But there are other and much more eligible means of
                    communication, viz. the Caspian Sea on the east, and the Black Sea on the west.
                    Over the former Russia reigns paramount, no other vessels of war but her own
                    being allowed to navigate its waters. Into this vast reservoir the Volga, which
                    is the great artery of Russia, pours its waters, collected during a navigable
                    course of two thousand miles, through some of the most fertile regions of the
                    empire, and, including its tributaries, those most distinguished for
                    manufacturing industry, which is the main object. There is also a communication
                    between this noble stream and the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=602" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0602-0590"
                    />Baltic Sea. Thus, then, there is an easy transport of goods insured from the
                    remotest governments of the empire to the Caspian Sea, and thence to the
                    Transcaucasian territory. There is also on the other side a communication by the
                    Black Sea, but it does not present so many advantages as that by the Caspian.
                    Our space, however, will not allow us to pursue the subject further.</p>

                    first consists of four large and many smaller islands. They are covered with
                    snow during the greater part of the year; their surface is generally rocky, and
                    on some of them there are marks of volcanoes. They are chiefly remarkable for
                    the bones and teeth of the mammoth, rhinoceros, buffalo, and other animals,
                    which are found upon and beneath the surface of the ground. It was the search
                    for this ivory which originally induced the Russians to visit these islands; and
                    their first expedition for exploring them was equipped in 1820. These islands do
                    not appear to be inhabited, though traces of human beings have been occasionally
                    discovered by the Russians engaged in the fisheries. The Bear’s Island group
                    consists of six small islands, with several kinds of plants and shrubs on them,
                    but no trees, although their shores are found to be covered with large
                    drift-wood. The southernmost point of these islands is in latitude 69° 5', and
                    they extend to latitude 76° 20'. Their longitude is between 154° and 183° 50'
                    east from Greenwich.</p>
                <p>In the Eastern Ocean the islands are thus classed:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">1 st,</hi> The islands of Gevosbewy and Nelken, in Behring’s
                    Straits, in latitude 65° 4', with about 400 people.</p>
                <p>2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, St Lawrence, latitude 63° 40 ʹ , and longitude 190°
                    26', and three smaller islands on the south-east of it.</p>
                <p>3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, St Mathew’s, in latitude 60°, in the Sea of
                    Kamts-chatka, consisting of three islands, one of which was named by some early
                    British navigators Pinnacle Island.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">4th</hi> , The Prebelow Islands, in latitude 57°. Two of them
                    have been named St Paul and St George. The former is about twenty-eight miles
                    long and twenty broad, and both are well stocked with animals whose furs are
                    valuable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">5th,</hi> The Aleutian Islands. This is a chain of islands
                    extending from the peninsula of Kamtschatka to the American peninsula of
                    Alaschka, between 51° and 55° 10' north latitude, and 167° and 197° east
                    longitude. (See Aleutian Islands.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">6th,</hi> The Kurile Islands. This chain extends from north
                    latitude43° 48' to 50° 56', and from longitude 145° 5'to 156° 30' east. They are
                    evidently of volcanic origin. In some of them good water is found, but others
                    arc utterly destitute of it. The few inhabitants are of Japanese origin. Many of
                    these islands have hitherto obtained no European names; but nineteen of the most
                    considerable have been named by the Russians.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">American Russia.</hi></p>
                <p>Russian America comprehends the north-west angle of the North American continent,
                    as far as the 141st degree of longitude west from London, with a narrow stripe
                    of coast reaching as far south as 55½° of north latitude. It occupies a surface
                    of about 500,000 square miles, of which the useful soil forms but a very small
                    proportion. Thick fogs continually brood over these shores. Some parts of the
                    country, bristling with mountains of difficult access, present at every step
                    impenetrable forests and extensive morasses; others, wholly without vegetation,
                    offer to the eye nothing but sterile rocks. In short, the nature of the climate,
                    and that of the soil itself, equally oppose prodigious obstacles to agriculture.
                    The Russians have therefore been obliged to imitate the aborigines, in
                    renouncing all attempts to form permanent establishments in the interior, and in
                    fixing their abode upon the borders of the sea; it being there only that the
                    chase, fishing, and trade, could furnish them with the means of subsistence.</p>
                <p>The Russians who inhabit this remote part of the empire consist either of
                    officers in the imperial navy or civil <hi rend="italic">employés,</hi> who
                    again quit these shores after a service of five years; or else of mechanics and
                    workmen sent by the American Company. These latter, whose engagement is for
                    seven years, also return home upon that term having expired; and even during the
                    time of their sojourn in the colonies their names still remain upon the
                    registers of their district, and the class to which they originally belonged.
                    Exempted only from the conscription, they still continue to pay taxes; in short,
                    the place of their birth is still regarded as their legal abode. The aborigines
                    of the continent, with the exception of three tribes, are exempted from taxes;
                    but they show a great reluctance to come under the restraints of civilization.
                    On several of the numerous islands, as well as along the shores of the mainland,
                    the Russian Company have hunting and fishing stations. The otter chase is the
                    chief occupation in summer, together with the pursuit of aquatic birds and
                    sea-calves. In winter, snares are laid for the white foxes; and dogs regularly
                    trained for the purpose track the zizel to its subterranean abodes.</p>
                <p>Novo Arkhangelsk or New Archangel, situated in latitude 57° 3' and longitude 135°
                    20', is the head establishment. It has a fortress with a small garrison and
                    forty pieces of cannon. Hospitals and schools are established at the company’s
                    expense, which also takes upon itself the maintenance of the orphans and
                    children of those among the tribes whose family is numerous. In these schools
                    the children are taught reading, writing, arithmetic, and the precepts of
                    religion. The priests attached to the churches of these colonies occasionally
                    traverse the remotest regions, for the purpose of making converts; but, as may
                    well be believed, their success is not in proportion to their zeal. On the 1st
                    of January 1836 there were in American Russia 711 Russians, 1110 Creoles, 9101
                    Aleutians, and 99 Kuriles, being 11,021 inhabitants in the various
                    settlements.</p>
