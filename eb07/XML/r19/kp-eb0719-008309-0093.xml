                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">RED SEA</label>. This great inlet of the Indian Ocean, which
                    divides Arabia from the opposite coast of Africa, extends in a north-west
                    direction about 1400 miles from the Straits of Babelmandel, where it is not
                    above thirty miles across to Suez, and only sixty miles distant from the
                    Mediterranean, so that the maritime communication by this route between India
                    and Europe is only divided by this narrow isthmus, which also forms the
                    connecting link between the continents of Asia and Africa. This sea lies between
                    the twelfth and thirtieth degrees of north latitude, and is nowhere broader than
                    200 miles, and scarcely ever of that width. The navigation of *he Red Sea is
                    difficult and dangerous, owing to the reefs and coral rocks both above and under
                    the water; and also, for nine months of the year, in consequence of the violent
                    winds which blow regularly from the north, and impede the passage from the
                    Straits to Suez. There are few harbours to which vessels in distress can repair
                    for shelter. On the eastern coast there is not a single harbour from Suez to
                    Yambo, the port of Medina, nor thence to Jidda. Compodah is the next harbour,
                    about 150 miles south of Jidda. But, in entering Yemen, there are the harbours
                    of Mocha, Loheia, and Hodeida. The navigation to Suez, at the head of the gulf,
                    is extremely difficult through the upper part of the Red Sea, the channel
                    through which vessels have to pass being narrow, with rocks sunk beneath the
                    surface. The only other ports on the western shore are Cosseir, the port and
                    road of which are formed by reefs, which defend it from the north-east winds,
                    and by a headland, which secures it against those blowing from the
                    south-south-east, and which has only a depth of water of two fathoms and a half.
                    Here the goods destined for Egypt are landed, conveyed by land to Kench on the
                    Nile, thence down the river to Alexandria. Suakim, about 500 miles south-east of
                    Cosseir, is extremely difficult of entrance, not <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=94" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0094-0084"
                    />only on account of its narrowness at the mouth, which requires an extremely
                    favourable wind, but from the rocks and shoals which lie off it in every
                    direction. By this port hosts of pilgrims and slaves come from the interior of
                    Africa for the purpose of crossing to Jidda and Mecca. Massuah is about 250
                    miles south-east of Suakim, and is the port of Abyssinia, by which its whole
                    commerce is carried on. The Red Sea penetrating on the one side so deep into the
                    land between the continents of Asia and Africa, and the great inlet of the
                    Mediterranean on the other between Europe and Africa, appear to be admirably
                    adapted for facilitating the commerce and maritime intercourse of the world; and
                    though the intervention of the Isthmus of Suez detracts from their utility, yet,
                    in ancient times, the great trade of Europe and India was carried on through
                    this channel. By the Red Sea also the fleets of Solomon maintained an
                    intercourse with the celebrated countries of Ophir and Tarshish; the situation
                    of which is variously conjectured to be either on the coast of Africa beyond the
                    straits, or on the western shores of Hindustan. The trade of the ancient world
                    with India was carried on entirely by this route; and Alexandria became the
                    great emporium of eastern produce, from which it was distributed by means of the
                    Mediterranean all over Europe. This trade flourished greatly under the reign of
                    the Ptolemies, who succeeded in establishing a regular communication both with
                    Africa and with Hindustan. It was long a source of great commercial ¼ <hi
                    rend="superscript">τ</hi> calth, and was vigorously prosecuted during the whole
                    period that the Roman empire subsisted. But it was long suspended by the
                    overthrow of the Roman power, and during the irruptions of the barbarian hordes,
                    who carried their devastations over the greater part of the civilized world.
                    With literature and refinement commerce revived; and the Venetians established
                    factories at Alexandria, by which they carried on the trade to India through the
                    channel of the Red Sea. Since this period the discovery of the passage to India
                    by the Cape of Good Hope has entirely superseded the route by the Red Sea, and
                    changed the course of the trade to India. But in modern times the introduction
                    of steam-navigation will probably revive the long-abandoned route to India by
                    the Red Sea. The baffling winds which, for nine months in the year, impeded the
                    passage up this sea, will now be overcome by the superior power of steam, nor
                    will the calms which sometimes prevail oppose any further obstacle to its
                    navigation; whilst the route, being so much shorter than by the long circuit
                    round the Cape of Good Hope, may be accomplished in a much shorter time, and is
                    on every account to be preferred.</p>
                <p>The passage of the Israelites through the Red Sea has furnished matter for much
                    curious research and ingenious speculation. Bruce, in his Travels, states, that
                    at the place where he supposes the passage to have been made the sea is not
                    quite four leagues in breadth, so that it might easily have been crossed in one
                    night without any miracle. There are about fourteen fathoms water in the
                    channel, and nine at the sides, with good anchorage everywhere; the farthest
                    side is a low sandy coast, and a very easy landing place. “The draught of the
                    bottom of the gulf,” says he, “given by Dr Pococke, is very' erroneous in every
                    part of it. It was proposed to Mr Niebuhr, when in Egypt, to inquire, upon the
                    spot, whether there were not some ridges of rocks where the water was shallow,
                    so that an army at particular times might pass over; secondly, whether file
                    Etesian winds, which blow strongly all summer from the north-west, could not
                    blow so violently against the sea as to keep it back on a heap, so that the
                    Israelites might have passed without a miracle. And a copy of these queries was
                    left for me to join my inquiries likewise. But I must confess, however learned
                    the gentlemen were who proposed these doubts, I did not think they merited any
                    attention to solve them. If the Etesian winds, blowing from the north-west in
                    summer, could keep the sea as a wall on the right or to the south, of fifty feet
                    high, still the difficulty would remain of building the wall on the left hand,
                    or to the north. Besides, water standing in that position for a day must have
                    lost the nature of a fluid. Whence came that cohesion of particles that hindered
                    that wall to escape at the sides? This is as great a miracle as that of Moses.
                    If the Etesian winds had done this once, they must have repeated it many a time
                    before and since from the same causes. Yet Diodorus Siculus says, the
                    Troglodytes, the indigenous inhabitants of that very spot, have a tradition from
                    father to son, from their very earliest and remotest ages, that once this
                    division of the sea did happen there; and that, after leaving the bottom some
                    time dry, the sea again came back and covered it with great fury. The words of
                    this author are of the most remarkable kind. W <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> e
                    cannot think this heathen is writing in favour of revelation. He knew not Moses,
                    nor says a word about Pharaoh and his host; but records the miracle of the
                    division of the sea in words nearly as strong as those of Moses, from the mouths
                    of unbiassed Iindesigning pagans.”</p>
